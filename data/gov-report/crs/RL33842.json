For a corporation, indictment alone can be catastrophic, if not fatal, in some instances. The Thompson Memorandum, since replaced with guidelines in the U. S. Attorneys Manual, described the policy factors to be considered in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Two of the factors explicitly mentioned were whether a corporation had waived its privileges and whether it had cut off the payment of attorneys' fees for its officers and employees.", "Justice Department policies and practices under the Thompson Memorandum led to constitutional challenges based on the Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause, the Amendment's due process clause, and the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel clause. Due process and right to counsel concerns were enough for a federal district court in New York to throw out the indictments of thirteen former partners and employees of an accounting firm, charged with creating and marketing fraudulent tax shelters, United States v. Stein. The Second Circuit affirmed on right to counsel grounds and consequently found it necessary to address the merits of the due process argument.", "The House addressed the conflict in attorney-client protective legislation which it passed in the 110th Congress.

That perception has changed, however. Corporate criminal liability is now a matter of legislative choice. And the view of the courts is much the same as it was over a century ago, when the Supreme Court observed:", "We see no valid objection in law, and every reason in public policy, why the corporation which profits by the transaction, and can only act through its agents and officers, shall be held punishable by fine because of the knowledge and intent of its agents to whom it has intrusted authority to act in the subject-matter of making and fixing rates of transportation, and whose knowledge and purposes may well be attributed to the corporation for which the agents act. While the law should have regard to the rights of all, and to those of corporations no less than to those of individuals, it cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the great majority of business transactions in modern times are conducted through those bodies, and particularly that interstate commerce is almost entirely in their hands, and to give them immunity from all punishment because of the old and exploded doctrine that corporation cannot commit a crime would virtually take away the only means of effectually controlling the subject-matter and correcting the abuses aimed at.

United States , 212 U.S. 481, 495-96 (1909).", "Both as a general matter and within individual criminal statutes, federal law leaves little doubt when a criminal proscription applies to corporate entities. The Dictionary Act provides that \"[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise ... the words 'person' or 'whoever' include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals.\" With this in mind, criminal statutes ordinarily condemn\u2014\"whoever,\" or any \"person\" who\u2014engages in the misconduct they proscribe. In some instances, the statute goes a step further and supplies an even more expansive crime-specific definition.", "When a federal criminal statute applies to corporations, the courts have generally said that a corporation is liable for the violations committed for its benefit by its officers, employees, or agents acting, within the apparent scope of their authority, even if the corporation has either generally or specifically prohibited the misconduct in question. Of course, the officers, employees, or agents whose misconduct is imputed to the corporation are usually subject to criminal liability as well. It is a matter of prosecutorial discretion whether to prosecute an apparently culpable corporation, or its apparently culpable agents, employees, and officers, or both the corporation and the individuals through whom it has acted. Because their interests are intertwined, corporations often bear the legal costs of defending their agents, employees, and officers in litigation arising out of conduct within the apparent scope of their employment.

In the case of a corporation, it now seems beyond dispute that the privilege applies to the confidential communications from its officers, agents, and employees to its attorney for the purpose of supplying the corporation with legal advice or assistance. At one time, however, some courts believed the privilege should be limited to the communications of the \"control group of the corporation,\" those ultimately responsible for corporate policy. The Supreme Court in Upjohn found this reading too limited.", "The case began when officials at Upjohn became concerned that some of its officers or employees might have been involved in the business-related bribery of foreign officials. Upjohn's general counsel was instructed to conduct an investigation. Following the internal investigation, Upjohn reported suspicious payments to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The company also identified which of its officers and employees had been interviewed or had submitted responses to questionnaires as part of the internal investigation. Then the IRS issued a summons demanding that Upjohn turn over all its files on the internal investigation including responses to its general counsel's questionnaires and memoranda and to notes of the investigation's interviews conducted under his supervision. Upjohn refused to comply, claiming attorney-client and attorney work product privileges, and the IRS sought judicial enforcement of its summons.", "The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Upjohn's attorney-client claim on the grounds that the communications sought were not those of Upjohn's control group, thus not those of the client, and therefore not privileged. The Supreme Court found this control group test insufficiently protective. The test failed to recognize the importance of the attorney's fact gathering communications with the corporation's employees conducted in order to provide the corporate client with legal advice or assistance. In doing so, it frustrated the very purpose of the privilege by discouraging full and frank disclosures by those associated with the company who were in a position to expose it to civil and criminal liability, thereby denying counsel the basis for sound legal advice and assistance. Moreover, it chilled communications between counsel and company employees designed to ensure company compliance with the law.", "In a situation like the one in Upjohn , the attorney represents the corporation, the privilege that envelops the communications with the attorney belongs to the corporation, and may be waived by the corporation. Although disclosure ordinarily waives the privilege, the circuits are divided over whether the privilege may survive disclosure for limited selective purposes (selective waiver) such as the disclosures in Upjohn to government investigators or regulators.", "The prospect of selective waiver was apparently first raised in Diversified Industries v. Meredith , where the Eighth Circuit held voluntary disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not constitute a waiver of the privilege for subsequent purposes. To one extent or another, the District of Columbia, First, Second, Third, Fourth and Tenth Circuits have declined to accept the Eighth Circuit suggestion that the attorney-client privilege may be claimed following a selective disclosure to a governmental agency.", "The existence of either a common interest or joint defense attorney-client privilege further complicates matters, for either may arise in the course of an investigation of allegations of corporate misconduct. The common interest privilege is created when an attorney simultaneously represents more than one client based on their common interest in the same matter. Under such circumstances, \"communications between each of the clients and the attorney are privileged against third parties, and it is unnecessary that there be actual litigation in progress for this privilege to apply.\" Moreover, two or more clients represented by individual attorneys may agree to work jointly in a common defense of a particular suit or case. In such circumstances, \"many courts have held that the attorney-client privilege gives rise to a concomitant 'joint defense privilege' which serves to protect the confidentiality of communications, passing from one party to the attorney for another party where a joint defense effort or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel.\" The courts have generally held\u2014although not universally so\u2014that communications or attorney work product protected by a joint or common defense privileges can only be waived with the consent of all parties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Attorney Work Product", "paragraphs": ["At least since the Supreme Court announced its decision in Hickman v.

It is therefore necessary that the doctrine protect material prepared by agents of the attorney as well as those prepared by the attorney himself.\"", "The protection can be waived, but here too the circuits are divided on the question of whether it can survive a selective waiver in the form of disclosure to a government investigator or regulator. The Fourth Circuit and Federal Circuit have been unwilling to say that the protection afforded attorney opinion work product (work containing the attorney's analysis of the law, facts, and strategy reflecting the attorney's mental impressions) is lost simply because it has been disclosed to governmental entities. On the other hand, the Third Circuit has said without equivocation that the same standard used in the case of attorney-client waivers should apply; that is, disclosure to a governmental entity constitutes complete waiver.

Such waivers permit the government to obtain statements of possible witnesses, subjects, and targets, without having to negotiate individual cooperation or immunity agreements. In addition, they are often critical in enabling the government to evaluate the completeness of a corporation's voluntary disclosure and cooperation. Prosecutors, may, therefore, request a waiver in appropriate circumstances. [This waiver should ordinarily be limited to the factual internal investigation and any contemporaneous advice given to the corporation concerning the conduct at issue. Except in unusual circumstances, prosecutors should not seek a waiver with respect to communications and work product related to advice concerning the government's criminal investigation.] The Department does not, however, consider waiver of a corporation's privileges an absolute requirement, and prosecutor should consider the willingness of a corporation to waive the privileges when necessary to provide timely and complete information as only one factor in evaluating the corporation's cooperation. Holder Memorandum, VI. B.

Thus, while cases will differ depending on the circumstances, a corporation's promise of support to culpable employees and agents either through the advancing of attorneys' fees,[*] through retaining the employees without sanction for their misconduct, or through providing information to the employees about the government's investigation pursuant to a joint defense agreement, may be considered by the prosecutor in weighing the extent and value of a corporation's cooperation. By the same token, the prosecutor should be wary of attempts to shield corporate officers and employees from liability by a willingness of the corporation to plead guilty. [Some states require corporations to pay the legal fees of officers under investigation prior to a formal determination of their guilt. Obviously, a corporation's compliance with governing law should not be considered a failure to cooperate.] Holder Memorandum, VI. B.

That portion of the Memoranda devoted to the waiver of attorney-client and work product protections, and cooperation and voluntary disclosure in general\u2014Part VI\u2014was the same in both except for a new paragraph added in the Thompson Memorandum. The addition said nothing about waivers per se, but made clear the risks that a corporation ran if it failed to be forthcoming early on or continued to support those officers or employees that prosecutors thought culpable:", "Another factor to be weighed by the prosecutor is whether the corporation, while purporting to cooperate, has engaged in conduct that impedes the investigation (whether or not rising to the level of criminal obstruction). Examples of such conduct include overly broad assertions of corporate representation of employees or former employees; inappropriate directions to employees or their counsel, such as directions not to cooperate openly and fully with the investigation including, for example, the direction to decline to be interviewed; making presentations or submissions that contain misleading assertions or omissions; incomplete or delayed production of records; and failure to promptly disclose illegal conduct known to the corporation.

To some, the whole scale adoption of language from the earlier Memorandum suggested a Justice Department perception that the problem with the Holder Memorandum was not its content, but rather its application. The Thompson Memorandum's description of the changes might be read to confirm this impression:", "The main focus of the revisions is increased emphasis on and scrutiny of the authenticity of a corporation's cooperation. Too often business organizations, while purporting to cooperate with a Department investigation, in fact take steps to impede the quick and effective exposure of the complete scope of wrongdoing under investigation. The revisions make clear that such conduct should weigh in favor of a corporate prosecution.

The firm indicated that it had been its practice to cover the litigation costs of its employees, but that it would not pay the fees of employees who refused to cooperate with the government's investigation or who invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege. Prosecutors referred to the Thompson Memorandum and the Sentencing Guidelines and indicated they would take into account any instances where the firm was legally obligated to pay attorneys' fees.

The firm then entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with prosecutors for the eventual dismissal of charges under which it agreed to waive indictment; pay a $456 million fine; accept restrictions on its practice; waive all privileges including but not limited to attorney-client and attorney work product; and provide the government with extensive cooperation in its investigation and prosecution of the firm's former officers and employees.", "The by-then indicted former officers and employees moved to have their indictments dismissed on constitutional grounds.

The McNulty Memorandum suggested that prosecutors' waiver requests were to be considered the exception rather than the rule:", "Prosecutors may only request waiver of attorney-client or work product protections when there is a legitimate need for the privileged information to fulfill their law enforcement obligations. A legitimate need for the information is not established by concluding it is merely desirable or convenient to obtain privileged information.

Senator Specter introduced the Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2007 ( S. 186 ) early in the 110 th Congress, which reappeared in revised form later in the Congress ( S. 3217 ). S. 186 as introduced was identical to S. 30 (109 th Cong.) that the Senator introduced at the end of the earlier Congress. It was also identical to H.R. 3013 offered in the House by Representative Scott and virtually identical to the version of that bill passed by the House. In their final versions, they were much like their successors in the 111 th Congress. ", "The testimony of some of the hearing witnesses and the views of some commentators applauded the changes in the McNulty Memorandum and questioned the justification for the legislative proposals on several grounds, e.g.:", "the McNulty Memorandum changes the tone of the policy, abandoning the aggressive implications of the Thompson Memorandum in favor of statements that confirm the Department's recognition and respect for the importance of the attorney-client privilege; the Memorandum establishes a strict procedure for waiver requests and generally bars prosecutors from holding against a company its payment the legal expenses of an employee; the Memorandum strikes the proper balance between the public's interest in vigorous investigation and prosecute white collar crime and fairness to corporations and their officers and employees; experience since the issuance of the McNulty Memorandum refute the suggestion of widespread prosecutorial abuse; \"legislative action is simply not needed;\" although the bills have no explicit enforcement mechanism and the courts are generally reluctant to impose sanctions in the absence of statutory authority, the bills' proposals are likely to bring forth a \"cottage industry of prosecutorial abuse claims\" that may deter the prosecution of worthy cases; even if the Memorandum fosters an environment in which employees must waive their Fifth Amendment privilege or be fired, it results in no more than a situation in which the guilty suffer; the legislative proposals will make prosecution of white collar crime more difficult because they reduce the incentive for corporate cooperation and thereby encourage \"stonewalling.\"", "Others found the McNulty Memorandum troubling and applauded the legislative proposals for several reasons of their own, e.g.:", "the McNulty Memorandum will continue to result in routine compelled waiver of the attorney-client privilege and the work product protection; the policy improvements contained in the McNulty Memorandum are not binding and lack an enforcement mechanism; the Memorandum continues to allow prosecutors to encourage companies to fire employees who fail to waive their Fifth Amendment rights; the Memorandum affords inadequate, partial attorney-client and attorney work product protection by assigning less stringent approval levels for waivers involving \"factual\" information which reveal client statements and attorney strategy; the Memorandum addresses only Justice Department investigation and prosecution practices, whereas the legislative proposals reach the practices of other agencies as well; the legislative proposals would not unduly impinge upon the prerogatives of federal prosecutors; to a limited extent, they bar interference with the attorney-client privilege, a mainstay of the Anglo-American system of justice since Elizabethan times and one whose presence has not heretofore been considered an unwarranted impediment to prosecution; the proposals would \"uphold the finest traditions of the DoJ by allowing it to strike harsh blows but fair ones in combating corporate crime.\"", "Senator Specter addressed some of these observations in S. 3217 . S. 3217 expressly excluded from its protections certain terrorists organizations, illicit drug cartels, and crime-for-profit entities. Where the earlier bar applied to federal criminal and civil matters and investigations alone, S. 3217 covered administrative adjudications and proceedings as well. Where the earlier bills condemned governmental demands that an organization abandon its privileges, S. 3217 also removed any claim of those privileges from the permissible array of prosecutorial considerations. Where the earlier bills permitted authorities to request information that they might reasonably consider beyond the scope of the privileges, S. 3217 also permitted them to seek information otherwise within the reach of a federal grand jury subpoena, privilege considerations notwithstanding, or to seek information whose privilege status was unknown to them.", "S. 3217 would have carried forward, with some modification, the subsections added to the House bill just before its passage there. The exception it afforded to instances, in which a statute \"that may authorize\" authorities to compel disclosure of privileged material, was revised to cover statutes \"that authorize\" compulsory access.", "Following House passage of H.R. 3013 , then Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip issued a superseding memorandum accompanied by a revised chapter of the U.S. Attorneys Manual.

Following the pattern of earlier Memoranda, much of what appears in the U.S. Attorneys Manual is a verbatim recitation of the McNulty Memorandum. Some things, however, are new. The Filip Memorandum revisions \"concern what measures a business entity must take to qualify for the long-recognized 'cooperation' mitigating factor, as well as how payment of attorneys' fees by a business organization for its officers or employees, or participation in a joint defense or similar agreement, will be considered in the prosecutive analysis.\"", "Thus, the Memorandum declares that \"a corporation remains free to convey non-factual or 'core' attorney-client communications or work product\u2014if and only if the corporation voluntarily chooses to do so\u2014prosecutor should not ask for waivers and are directed not to do so.\" Nevertheless, \"cooperation is a potential mitigating factor, by which a corporation . . . can gain credit in a case that otherwise is appropriate for indictment and prosecution.\" The entity's receipt of credit for its cooperation turns on its timely disclosure of information relating to the government's investigation, regardless of whether the entity acquired or maintains information under circumstances that entitle it to claim attorney-client or attorney work product protection. Nor does a corporation's payment of its employees' attorneys' fees or its entry into a joint defense agreement preclude credit for cooperation.", "On the other hand, \"[i]f the payment of attorney fees were used in a manner that would otherwise constitute criminal obstruction of justice\u2014for example, if fees were advanced on the condition that an employee adhere to a version of the facts that the corporation and the employee knew to be false\u2014these Principles would not (and could not) render inapplicable such criminal prohibitions.\"", "This represents a substantial modification of the previous standard in the McNulty Memorandum which explicitly permitted prosecutors to weigh negatively any number of specifically identified impediments\u2014some well short of a criminal obstruction of justice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Activity in the 111th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Early in the 111 th Congress, Senator Specter introduced the Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2009 ( S. 445 ), for himself and Senators Landrieu, Carper, Kerry, McCaskill, and Cochran. It is essentially the same as the later Specter proposal in the 110 th Congress ( S. 3217 ). Towards the end of the first session, Representative Scott (Va.) introduced a similarly styled Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2009 ( H.R. 4326 ), for himself and Representatives Conyers, Smith (Tex.), Nadler, Delahunt, Coble, and Lungren. It is a replica of the bill which the House passed in the 110 th Congress ( H.R. 3013 ). ", "The two 111 th Congress proposals are much the same, although with occasional differences. They espouse a common purpose: \"to place on each agency clear and practical limits designed to serve the attorney-client privilege and work product protections available to an organization and preserve the constitutional rights and other legal protections available to employees of such an organization.\" ", "They would define \"attorney-client privilege\" as currently understood under the federal law, that is as \"the attorney-client privilege as governed by the principles of the common law, as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience, and the principles of article V of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\" They would adopt an equally contemporaneous definition of \"attorney work product,\" i.e., \"materials prepared by, or at the direction of an attorney in anticipation of litigation, particularly any such materials that contain a mental impression, conclusion, opinion, or legal theory of that attorney.\" ", "The Specter bill ( S. 445 ) alone would insert a definition of \"organization.\" The definition would foretell the scope of the bill, since the bill's commands speak to how federal prosecutors and investigators may deal with organizations. The bill's definition has two distinct components\u2014what is an organization and what is not for purposes of the bill. It describes organizations as persons other than human beings and expressly includes state, local, and municipal governmental entities. The absence of similar definition in the Scott bill ( H.R. 4326 ) leaves open the question whether federal, state, local, and municipal entities fall within the scope of its provisions. The omission of federal and tribal governmental entities from the Specter bill's definition suggests that they would not be considered organizations for purposes of the bill.", "The Specter bill ( S. 445 ) would exclude from the definition of organization, drug cartels (continuing criminal enterprises (21 U.S.C. 848(c))); designated foreign terrorist organizations (18 U.S.C. 2339B(g)(6)); and entities charged under the RICO provisions. The RICO exemption may raise questions. Common business organizations do not ordinarily include drug cartels or designated foreign terrorists organizations, but they are infrequently associated with RICO prosecutions. Federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization (RICO) provisions proscribe, among other things, the patterned commission of two or more other federal or state offenses in order to conduct the affairs of an enterprise whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce, 18 U.S.C. 1962(c). Depending upon the circumstances, an organization might either be an offender or the victimized intestate enterprise, 18 U.S.C. 1961(3), (4). Since the bill uses the phrase \"entity charged,\" it might be thought to apply only to offending organizations and only after they are indicted. Such a reading, however, may be more narrow than its sponsors intend.", "In somewhat different terms, the two bills would bar the Justice Department and other federal investigative, regulatory, or prosecutorial agencies from demanding that an organization:", "waive its attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protection; decline to pay the legal expenses of an employee; avoid joint defense, information sharing or common interest agreements with its employees; refrain from disclosing information concerning an investigation or enforcement action to employees; or terminate or discipline an employee for the employee's exercise of a legal right or prerogative with respect to a governmental inquiry. They would also preclude using such organizational activity as the basis in whole or in part for a civil or criminal charge against the organization. Only the Specter bill ( S. 445 ) would also prohibit the government from rewarding an organization for waiving its attorney-client privilege or work product protection. The provision may be a response to criticism some commentators have leveled against the Filip Memorandum:", "The problem is rooted in the fact that indictments are fatal to major corporations. This means that from the beginning of the process, a corporation is compelled to follow the prosecutor's instructions on how to avoid indictment. Under the Filip revisions, like it was under the Thompson Memorandum, the way to avoid indictment is by cooperating with the government. Now, the government will not view negatively a corporation's refusal to give privileged information. It will, however, still give credit for that privileged information. Under the Filip revisions the compelling is done differently, almost passively\u2014allowing the implied threat of indictment to do the work.", "Both bills would allow the government to request information it believes is beyond the scope of the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product protection. And they would not prevent an organization, on its own initiative, from sharing the results of an internal investigation with authorities, although the Specter bill ( S. 445 ) would preclude the government from considering such a waiver positively.", "Each of the bills declares that its proposals are not intended to apply to situations when the government is statutorily authorized to demand a waiver. It is not entirely clear what subsection 3014(e) intended to preserve when it referred to \"any other federal statute that may authorize[s], in the course of an examination or inspection, an agent or attorney of the United States to require or compel the production of attorney-client privilege material.\" Many federal statutes authorize the examination or inspection of corporate records and other materials. Few, if any, federal statutes state in so many words that federal inspectors may examine otherwise privileged attorney-client or work product material. In fact, if privilege is mentioned at all, the statute is likely to preserve the privileged material against inspection.", "Use of the phrase in the Scott bill ( H.R. 4326 ) that \"any other federal statute that may authorize\" may indicate that the authors of the subsection were referring to statutes which grant general authority that on a given occasion \"may\" extend to compelled access to privileged material. The absence of the word \"may\" in the Specter bill ( S. 445 )may be intended to limit the exception to instances of explicit statutory authority to demand. ", "The term \"in the course of an examination or inspection\" suggests that the exception likely would not extended to situations where the material was sought through an administrative or grand jury subpoena or through a civil investigative demand. Finally, reference to \"privileged\" material narrows the category further and belies any intent to include material which on its face seems \"privileged\" but which because of the \"crime or fraud\" or some other exception cannot be classified as such. It is difficult to see what remains.", "Finally, both bills would permit federal prosecutors, in determining whether to bring criminal charges against a corporation, to consider the fact the corporation had provided counsel for an employee, entered into a joint defense agreement with an employee, or shared information relating to investigation with an employee\u2014but only when those activities are themselves federal crimes. ", "Commentators who support the proposals argue that they are necessary (1) to overcome the \"culture of waiver\" produced by the Thompson Memorandum; (2) to establish consistent policy not only for the Department of Justice but for all federal investigative agencies; and (3) to provide stability and certainty that regularly shifting Justice Department policy statements cannot provide. Others contend that the proposals \"would only frustrate the DOJ corporate charging policy, likely without altering the occurrence of waiver, but at the same time, rendering prosecutions needlessly complex.\"", "As of February 2010, neither House had held hearings on the proposals during the 111 th Congress."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
