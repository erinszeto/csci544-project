United States . Under the ACCA, courts must sentence defendants convicted of federal unlawful possession of a firearm to prison for at least 15 years if the defendant has three or more prior violent felony convictions. Taylor had a prior state burglary conviction in addition to other offenses. The ACCA defines violent felony to include \"burglary,\" which the Court found to mean \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" To decide whether Taylor's state burglary conviction constituted an ACCA burglary conviction, the Court examined the state burglary statute to determine whether a jury would have to find each element of an ACCA burglary offense. The Court held that Taylor's state burglary conviction did not qualify as an ACCA predicate because his state conviction might not have required proof of each element of the ACCA offense ( e.g ., the state statute covered burglarizing a vehicle, while the ACCA limited burglaries to \"building[s] or structure[s]\").", "Following Taylor , the Court declared the ACCA residual clause (\" otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury \") unconstitutionally vague in Johnson v.

The Court acknowledged that a case-specific standard would alleviate at least some constitutional concerns. ", "Justice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, explained that Section 924(c)'s text, context, and history preclude a case-specific approach. First, the residual clause refers to an \"offense\" that risks the use of physical force \"by its nature.\" As Justice Gorsuch stated, \"[I]n plain English, when we speak of the nature of an offense, we're talking about 'what an offense normally \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 entails, not what happened to occur on one occasion.'\" Second, in the federal criminal code, statutes may refer to one of the twin definitions of a \"crime of violence\" in Sections 16 and 924(c).

In Stitt , the Court said that breaking into a plane, boat, or truck that is designed or adapted for overnight accommodation is ACCA burglary.", "A federal jury convicted Stitt, who had six previous Tennessee aggravated burglary convictions, on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The Tennessee aggravated burglary statute outlaws \"burglary of a habitation and defines 'habitation' as 'any structure \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 which is designed or adapted for the overnight accommodation of persons.'

In the opinion for the Court, Justice Breyer pointed out that the ACCA generic burglary definition represented an assumption of Congress's understanding of state law at the time of ACCA's enactment. In 1986, a majority of the states included vehicles, designed or adapted for overnight occupancy, within burglary's location element.

Quarles had previously committed third-degree home invasion and on two occasions committed assault with a deadly weapon. Third-degree home invasion occurs when an individual \"breaks and enters a dwelling or enters a dwelling without permission, and, at any time while he or she is entering, present in, or existing the dwelling, commits a misdemeanor.\" Quarles argued that his home invasion conviction could not count as an ACCA predicate offense because the Michigan statute permitted conviction for conduct that the ACCA did not cover under its generic definition of burglary, which is \"unlawful or privileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" Neither the federal district court nor the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit accepted Quarles' contention.", "Supreme Court : The Supreme Court affirmed.

The Taylor Court therefore interpreted the generic term \"burglary\" in \u00c2\u00a7 924(e) in light of: the ordinary understanding of burglary as of 1986 [when the ACCA was enacted]; the States' laws at that time Congress' recognition of the dangers of burglary; and Congress' stated objective of imposing increased punishment on armed career criminals who had committed prior burglaries. Looking at those sources, the Taylor Court interpreted generic burglary under \u00c2\u00a7 924(e) to encompass remaining-in burglary.

The Court left for the lower court to determine whether the error was harmless and, if not, the appropriate remedy.", "Background : Haymond involved the federal supervised release statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 3583, which subjects federal inmates on their release from prison to certain conditions usually for a maximum of five years. For certain sex offenses, however, the supervised release term is at least five years and may be for the sex offender's entire life. Under the statute, a court may revoke an individual's supervised release and return him to prison if, by a preponderance of the evidence, the court finds that the individual has violated a condition of his release. Ordinarily, when a court revokes supervised release, it re-imprisons the individual for no longer than his remaining time of supervised release and, in any event, for no longer than five years. Under Subsection 3583(k), a court must sentence a sex offender registrant to re-imprisonment for at least five years when the court revokes his supervised release based on a sex offense.

The district court sentenced him to 38 months in prison and supervised release for 10 years thereafter. The court conditioned Haymond's supervised release on him committing no further crimes, submitting to periodic polygraph examinations, and consenting to searches by his probation officer. Haymond passed several polygraph tests, suggesting he had neither viewed nor possessed child pornography since his release. Yet, when Haymond's probation officer seized Haymond's cell phone, he found images of child pornography cached there. At his revocation hearing, Haymond presented expert testimony that the material could have been put on his cell phone without his knowledge. Nevertheless, the court concluded that it was more likely than not that Haymond had knowingly possessed child pornography in violation of a condition of his release. The court \"with reservations\" ordered him returned to prison for the mandatory minimum five years. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed holding the mandatory minimum feature of the sentencing revocation procedure violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.

In this case, that meant Mr. Haymond faced a minimum of five years in prison instead of a little as none.", "Justice Breyer concurred in the judgment but not the rationale. For Justice Breyer, Subsection 3583(k) has three characteristics that together suggest the punishment is for a new crime rather than a continuation of punishment for the crime for which the jury convicted him:", "First , \u00c2\u00a73583(k) applies only when a defendant commits a discrete set of federal criminal offenses specified in the statute. Second , \u00c2\u00a73583(k) takes away the judge's discretion to decide whether violation of a condition of supervised release should result in imprisonment and for how long. Third , \u00c2\u00a73583(k) limits the judge's discretion in a particular manner: by imposing a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 'not less than 5 years' upon a judge's finding that a defendant 'has commit[ted] any' listed 'criminal offense.'

On June 1, 2016, state authorities arrested Mont on drug trafficking charges and held him in pretrial detention. On March 21, 2017, 15 days after Mont's term of supervised release was scheduled to expire, a state trial court sentenced him to six years in prison on state charges with credit for the 10 months he had served in state pretrial detention. On March 30, 2017, the U.S. District Court scheduled a supervisory release revocation hearing. Although Mont argued his term of supervised release had expired, the court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to an addition 42 months in federal prison to be served upon completing his state sentence. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Sixth Circuit) affirmed on the basis of Sixth Circuit precedent interpreting the law governing supervised release. The statute stated, \"[a] term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days.\" An earlier Sixth Circuit decision had concluded that, \"[1] when a defendant is held for thirty days or longer in pretrial detention, and [2] he is later convicted for the offense for which he was held, and [3] his pretrial detention is credited as time served toward his sentence, then the pretrial detention is 'in connection with' a conviction and tolls the period of supervised release under \u00c2\u00a7 3624.\" ", "Supreme Court : In Mont, interpreting Section 3624 divided both the federal courts of appeals and the Supreme Court , a majority of which sided with the Sixth Circuit.

Justice Thomas also noted that Section 3624 does not qualify imprisonment with \" after conviction.\" While the statute identifies a precise point at which supervised release begins, it is less clear where it ends. Referring to the section's statutory setting and purpose, Justice Thomas recognized supervised release to be a \"conditional liberty\" during time of good behavior, but punishment nonetheless.

When the university to which he was admitted dismissed him for poor performance, it advised him that he would lose his immigration status unless he enrolled elsewhere, which he did not do. He went to a shooting range where he purchased ammunition and practiced using the range's firearms. The ammunition he bought came from out-of-state and the firearms he used were from Austria. Federal law declares it unlawful for an individual, unlawfully present in the United States, to possess a firearm or ammunition that has been transported or shipped in interstate or foreign commerce. A second statute makes it a federal crime to knowingly engage in such unlawful possession.", "At his trial, the U.S. district court advised the jury that the government did not have to prove that Rehaif knew that he was in the U.S. unlawfully. The jury convicted Rehaif, and the court sentenced him to prison for 18 months. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (Eleventh Circuit) affirmed Rehaif's conviction on several grounds. The Eleventh Circuit noted that conviction requires proof of three elements: \"(1) the defendant falls within one of the categories [of disqualified possessors] \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ('the status element'); (2) the defendant possessed a firearm or ammunition ('the possession element'); and (3) the possession was 'in or affecting [interstate or foreign] commerce [(the jurisdictional element)].'\" With regard to the status element, binding Eleventh Circuit case law dispensed with a mens rea requirement (sometimes referred to as a scienter, state of mind, or knowledge requirement).", "Supreme Court : The Supreme Court held that \"the Government therefore must prove both that the defendant knew he possessed a firearm and also that he knew he belonged to the relevant category of persons barred from possessing a firearm,\" and reversed Rehaif's conviction. Speaking for a majority of the Court, Justice Breyer pointed out that mens rea questions are first and foremost a matter of congressional intent. He noted that the \"longstanding presumption, traceable to the common law, that Congress intends to require a defendant to possess a culpable mental state regarding 'each of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct.'\" Nevertheless, he explained that the presumption does not necessarily apply to all of a crime's elements. For example, it rarely attaches to jurisdictional elements, such as interstate shipment or use of the mail, that \"do not describe the 'evil Congress seeks to prevent,' but instead simply ensure that the Federal Government has the constitutional authority to regulate the defendant's conduct.\"", "Justice Breyer acknowledged that the Court has \"typically declined to apply the presumption in favor of scienter in cases involving statutory provisions that form part of a 'regulatory' or 'public welfare' program and carry only minor penalties.\" Public welfare offenses generally involve a regulatory regime designed to protect the public from some exceptionally harmful product or device, such as mislabeled drugs, sulfuric acid, or hand grenades. These offenses ordinarily expose to criminal liability only those, such as manufacturers or shippers, who have placed themselves in a responsible relationship to such a public danger. Qualified regulatory statutes usually proscribe conduct that was innocent at common law and punish offenders relatively lightly. Here, Justice Breyer emphasized, the public welfare exception did not apply because the \"firearms provisions before us are not part of a regulatory or public welfare program, and they carry a potential penalty of 10 years in prison that we have previously described as 'harsh.'\"", "Consequences : On remand, the Court left the Eleventh Circuit to determine whether the erroneous jury instruction constituted harmless error. The Court left unresolved what is required to show that a defendant knew of his status. Federal law bars firearm possession by classes of individuals other than illegal aliens, i.e ., (1) convicted felons; (2) fugitives; (3) drug addicts; (4) the mentally disabled; (5) those dishonorably discharged from the armed services; (6) those who have denounced their U.S. citizenship; (7) those under certain restraining orders; and (8) those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. The Court \"express[ed] no view, however, about what precisely the Government must prove to establish a defendant's knowledge of status\" in the case of these other instances of disqualifying status.", "Justice Alito's dissent, which Justice Thomas joined, may have influenced the Court to limit the opinion's scope. Among other criticisms, Justice Alito focused on unlawful possession by others in addition to unlawfully present foreign nationals, stating:", "It [the unlawful possession statute] probably does more to combat gun violence than any other federal law. It prohibits the possession of firearms by, among others, convicted felons, mentally ill persons found by a court to present a danger to the community, stalkers, harassers, perpetrators of domestic violence, and illegal aliens. Today's decision will make it significantly harder to convict persons falling into some of these categories, and the decision will create a mountain of problems with respect to the thousands of prisoners currently serving terms for [unlawful possession] convictions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SORNA", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Gundy v.

Justice Alito, speaking for the four, listed a series of factors documenting the states' compelling interest in access to a reliable test to determine the extent of a suspect's intoxication:", "Highway safety is a legitimate public interest; In a good year, alcohol-related deaths occur at the rate of no more than one per hour; States rely heavily on blood alcohol limits as an effective means of promoting highway safety; Enforcing blood alcohol limits depends on reliable testing methods; Alcohol in the blood dissipates rapidly so speed is of the essence; When a reliable breathalyzer test cannot be administered, a blood test is the only comparable alternative; and Drivers who cannot remain conscious represent an even greater threat.", "In the eyes of the four, \"the only question left, under our exigency doctrine, is whether this compelling need justifies a warrantless search because there is, furthermore, 'no time to secure a warrant.'\" And they concluded, \"[w]hen police have probable cause to believe a person has committed a drunk-driving offense and the driver's unconsciousness or stupor requires him to be taken to the hospital or similar facility before police have a reasonable opportunity to administer a standard evidentiary breath test, they may almost always order a warrantless blood test to measure the driver's BAC [blood alcohol content] without offending the Fourth Amendment.\" Justice Alito acknowledged that the case should be remanded to the Wisconsin courts to permit Mitchell to offer any evidence that the \"police could not have reasonably judged that a warrant application would interfere with other pressing need or duties.\"", "Justice Thomas concurred in the result because he would have recognized a per se rule under which the dissipation of alcohol in blood would always justify a warrantless, probable cause test.", "With Justices Ginsburg and Kagan, Justice Sotomayor noted that, because Wisconsin admitted there was time to get a warrant, she would have held that \"the Fourth Amendment \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 requires police officers seeking to draw blood from a person suspected of drunk driving to get a warrant if possible.\" Because the lower courts had not addressed the exigent circumstance exception, Justice Gorsuch dissented on the grounds that the decision should have been postponed until the issue had been more fully developed below.

In an earlier encounter with Officer Nieves, Bartlett had refused to speak to Officer Nieves. Bartlett and the officers disputed whether Bartlett: (1) was drunk; (2) was loud and belligerent on two occasions; (3) got into Officer Wright's face to provoke a confrontation, or spoke closely to the officer in order to be heard over the loud music; and (4) refused to back away from Officer Wright, or was slow to back away because of a bad back.

Bartlett alleged that, at the time of his arrest, Officer Nieves said: \"[B]et you wish you would have talked to me now.\" The U.S. District Court dismissed the complaint because it found that the officers had probable cause to arrest Bartlett.

The case triggered four individual opinions. Justice Thomas concurred in part and in the judgment, disagreeing with the majority's disparate-application exception. Justice Gorsuch and Justice Ginsburg concurred in part and dissented in part. Justice Gorsuch's position was that \"the absence of probable cause is not an absolute requirement of such a claim, and its presence is not an absolute defense.\" Justice Ginsburg questioned whether the case was the appropriate vehicle for the rule the majority announced.

A grand jury indicted McDonough. He was arrested and held for bail. His first trial ended in a mistrial. The jury acquitted him in a second trial. Just short of three years after his acquittal, McDonough sued the special prosecutor in federal court under Section 1983, claiming denial of due process in the form of malicious prosecution and fabrication of evidence. The U.S. District Court dismissed the malicious prosecution claim against the special prosecutor on the grounds of absolute prosecutorial immunity. The court also ruled that the three-year statute of limitations on McDonough's fabrication claim began to run when McDonough became aware of the fabrication not when he was acquitted. Thus, the statute of limitations had expired by the time McDonough filed his Section 1983 complaint. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Second Circuit) affirmed.", "Supreme Court : The Second Circuit noted a circuit split over whether the statute of limitations on due process fabrication claims begins to run with the claimant's exoneration or with his knowledge of the fabrication and its improper use. The Supreme Court agree to hear the case in order to resolve the issue.", "Writing for the Court, Justice Sotomayor explained that state law governs the length of the statute of limitations in Section 1983 cases. Federal law, however, determines when the statute of limitations begins to run based on \"common-law principles governing analogous torts.\" The inquiry starts with identifying the constitutional or other federal right said to have been abridged under color of law. Justice Sotomayor accepted the Second Circuit's presumption that the Due Process Clause was the basis for McDonough's fabrication claim. ", "While the Second Circuit had decided that common-law malicious prosecution, with its \"end-of-game\" exoneration requirement, did not match McDonough's fabrication claim, the Court ruled that common-law malicious prosecution was the most closely analogous tort to McDonough's fabrication claim. Justice Sotomayor pointed out that one involves a malice-driven, groundless prosecution, the other a thrust for conviction slaked by the use of fabricated evidence. \"At bottom,\" she declared, \"both claims challenge the integrity of criminal prosecutions undertaken 'pursuant to legal process.'\" Moreover, she noted, the Second Circuit's approach would mean starting the statute of limitations clock when use of the fabricated evidence became obvious\u00e2\u0080\u0094at trial or the return of the indictment.

She explained that a notice of appeal is ministerial being \"a simple, nonsubstantive act that is within the defendant's prerogative.\" She noted: (1) any \"waiver of appeal\" is limited to the language of the particular agreement; (2) some appellate issues cannot be waived; and (3) matters that are within the scope of the waiver are only binding if the prosecution elects to stand on its rights. Thus, she concluded, \"simply filing a notice of appeal does not necessarily breach a plea agreement, given the possibility that the defendant will end up raising claims beyond the waiver's scope.
