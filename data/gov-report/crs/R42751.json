While H.R. 4089 directs changes to federal land management and land planning, S. 3525 allows existing management to continue, requiring only that land managers assemble priority lists to improve access for those activities.", "Several issues related to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting are addressed in S. 3525. Hunting and conservation have been linked since the advent of federal wildlife legislation, such as the Lacey Act of 1900 (making it a federal crime to ship game killed in violation of one state's laws to another state) or the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (regulating the killing, hunting, buying, or selling of migratory birds). Even so, controversy exists about exactly what hunting, fishing, or shooting sports should be allowed on federal land, and when. A primary issue is whether opening more lands to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting should be balanced against good game management, public safety, resource management, and the statutory purposes of the lands. S. 3525 focuses on providing additional physical access to federal lands where these activities are already allowed. This would be accomplished through acquisition of lands or rights of way.", "S. 3525 would also expand or authorize certain sport fishing programs.

It would amend the duck stamp program, to allow the Secretary of the Interior to increase the price of the stamp at specified intervals.

Section 102 would also direct FWS to issue permits for importing the sport-hunted trophies. This section is almost identical to H.R. 4089 , Title III.

However, despite issuing this warning, FWS continued to authorize the import of polar bear trophies under existing law until the ESA listing became final. The permitting process was truncated by court order making the listing effective immediately rather than after 30 days.", "Section 102 would allow entry of any harvest before May 15, 2008, regardless of whether a permit was sought prior to the law change, provided that the bear was taken from a population from which import was legal at the time.", "FWS does not oppose legislation allowing importation for hunters who both applied for an import permit and completed their legal hunt prior to ESA listing. FWS originally declined to support another version of this provision ( H.R. 991 , as introduced) because the introduced version would have allowed hunters to import polar bear trophies regardless of whether the hunter had applied for the permit prior to the ESA listing. ", "Others oppose allowing these permits, believing it would encourage hunting of species whose listing is imminent.
