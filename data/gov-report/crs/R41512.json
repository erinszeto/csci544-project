The highway trust fund and the revenue sources that feed it have been a reliable mechanism for financing highway and transit programs for five decades, but this is no longer the case. Fuel taxes, which provide most of the money for surface transportation, are unlikely to provide a solid long-term foundation for the programs, although a rate increase could help in the near-term. The choice for policymakers, therefore, is to find new sources of income for the current-size program or an expanded program, or alternately, to settle for a smaller program that might look very different from the one currently in place. The growing consensus on the need to reduce the federal budget deficit will likely influence this debate.", "One perennial subject of debate concerning the highway program is whether grants to individual states are in line with the taxes those states' motorists pay into the highway trust fund\u2014the so-called donor-donee issue.

The trust fund has two separate accounts\u2014highways and mass transit. The primary revenue sources for these accounts are the 18.4 cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cent-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel. Although there are other sources of revenue for the trust fund (truck registrations, truck tires, etc.), the fuel taxes provide about 90% of the income to the funds. The transit account receives 2.86 cents per gallon of fuel, and there is also a 0.1 cent per gallon fuel tax reserved for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund, which is not included in the surface transportation programs. The federal motor fuels tax has been increased several times since its inception in 1956. At the time of the last increase, in 1993, some of the receipts were deposited in the Treasury general fund, but since FY1998 these revenues have been directed to the highway trust fund.", "Other changes in recent years have modestly increased trust fund revenues. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-357 ) provided the trust fund with additional future income by changing elements of federal gasohol taxation. At the time, there were estimates that these changes could provide the trust fund with an additional $4 billion per year. SAFETEA also included a number of tax and other changes in its finance title. The revenue increases in this title were viewed as quite modest and were derived mostly from cutting back on tax fraud and by transferring some Treasury general fund revenues associated with transportation-related activities to the trust fund. It was believed at the time of passage that the changes enacted in SAFETEA, combined with the changes in gasohol legislation enacted in 2004 and enhanced by expected economic growth, would be sufficient to finance the act through FY2009.", "The financial estimates associated with SAFETEA have proved to be overly optimistic. The highway account has already required three transfers from the general fund totaling $29.7 billion, without which FHWA might not have been able to pay states for work they completed. In late FY2008, $8 billion was transferred to carry the highway account into the 2009 fiscal year ( P.L. 110-318 , September 15, 2008). In FY2009 the transfer was $7 billion ( P.L. 111-46 , August 7, 2009). The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-148 , March 18, 2010) transferred $14.7 billion more to the highway account.", "Historically, the trust fund-based revenue collection system was a reliably growing source of funding for surface transportation, as the trust funds collected more than was expended to implement the program defined by Congress. This situation has changed under SAFETEA as spending on highways and transit has exceeded both highway and transit account revenues on a regular basis.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in its August 30, 2011 HTF baseline projection, showed that the highway account is expected to have an unexpended balance of $4.2 billion at the end of FY2012 and a negative $8.4 billion by the end of FY2013. CBO estimates that the highway account will be unable to meet obligations in a timely manner near the end of FY2012 or during FY2013, depending on the cash flows into and out of the fund.", "The CBO projections show the excess of outlays over tax revenues plus interest as $9 billion for FY2012 and $11.6 billion for FY2013. A gap in the neighborhood of $10 billion remains through FY2021. CBO projects that the mass transit account, which received a $4.8 billion general fund transfer in FY2010, will also remain above zero well into through FY2014. The mass transit account's end of year negative balance jumps to a negative $5.6 billion for FY2015 and grows rapidly thereafter.", "The recent declines in motor fuel tax receipts are unprecedented. Even during the oil shocks of the 1970s, driving, as measured by vehicle miles traveled, returned fairly quickly to the 2% average annual growth rate experienced since the 1960s. The same thing has not happened since 2007, even though fuel prices fell to below $2 by December 2008 from their highs of around $4 per gallon in mid-2008, as the sluggish economy depressed freight, leisure travel, and commutes to work. Gas prices have since increased and have remained above $3.00 per gallon since December 2010. As a rule of thumb, adding a penny to the federal fuels tax provides the trust fund with between $1.6 and $1.8 billion per year in new revenues. Without an increase in the existing fuel taxes, the mostly fuel-based trust fund taxation system will not be able to support increased surface transportation spending over the next few years. The immediate choice for policymakers, therefore, is to find new sources of revenue for the trust fund, or alternately, to settle for a smaller surface transportation program that might look very different than the one currently in place.", "However, if Congress chooses to address the short-term funding issue, it will need to address the viability of the trust fund mechanism over the longer term. In recent years, Congress has acted to mandate higher fuel-economy standards for gasoline-powered cars and to encourage development of hybrid and battery-powered vehicles. As these more fuel-efficient vehicles come to make up a larger share of the U.S. vehicle fleet, consumption of motor fuels may decline even if driving increases. If it wishes to maintain or increase the size of the surface transportation programs, Congress may need to explore alternatives to the motor fuels tax as possible sources of funding.", "The difficult outlook for motor fuel tax revenues clouds the outlook for surface transportation reauthorization. In the past, steady revenue growth enabled Congress to meet the competing demands for funding in each reauthorization. TEA21 benefitted from a run-up in fuel usage during the boom years of the late 1990s that was at least partially the result of the popularity of sport utility vehicles during the period. SAFETEA did not have quite the same financial backing, but the authors of the act were nonetheless able to find sufficient new revenues to expand the programs. The next reauthorization bill, as the above discussion indicates, lacks a ready source of cash to support expansion\u2014a situation that could define the upcoming legislative debate much more than issues such as program structure and infrastructure needs.

A donor state is one whose highway users pay more in revenues to the trust fund highway account than it receives in federal highway assistance. Conversely, a donee state receives more in assistance than it contributes to the trust fund. The debate is generally driven by representatives of donor states, who frame their arguments in terms of \"equity\" in the distribution of federal highway funds. The donor/donee state distinction, however, is far less straightforward than it appears. Federal fuel taxes are not actually collected at the state level, so determining whether a state is a donor or a donee requires a complicated mechanism that attributes fuel usage and associated revenues to individual states. ", "In the last three surface transportation authorization bills, the donor/donee issue was resolved only by the availability of more money and the creation of a process to distribute it. In SAFETEA, this process, called the Equity Bonus Program, is the largest single highway program.

The Equity Bonus Program, however, is so complicated that effectiveness of the guarantee is unclear.

There was no equity bonus calculation for FY2010 or FY2011.", "The transfer of $29.7 billion in general fund revenues to the highway account complicates the donor-donee framework as a basis for analyzing transportation funding.

A handful of fundamental issues, however, will influence the way in which the eventual legislation is constructed.", "National goals and purposes. Today's surface transportation programs have their origins in the creation of the interstate highway program (1956) and the collapse of public transit systems (early 1960s). In the intervening decades, it has become difficult to discern how federal surface transportation spending relates to national needs, as the vast majority of the funding is granted to states and localities based not on maximizing the national return on transportation investment, but as an entitlement to be spent largely as state and, to a lesser extent, local authorities think best. Changing the existing decision-making process, however, could involve a transfer of authority from state and local authorities to the federal government. Productivity and performance management. With the operation of surface transportation programs left largely to states and localities, federal officials often have a poor understanding of the efficiency and effectiveness with which federal funds are being used. States and localities have, in many cases, very robust processes in place to measure and analyze their programs. However, these mechanisms are largely internal, and their diversity makes it difficult to compare performance across the country. Federal performance standards might make such comparisons easier, potentially allowing the federal government to direct funding to the state and local governments with the most efficient and effective programs. Once imposed, however, such measures might be \"gamed\" by state and local officials in ways that negate their value. Even if Congress should decide to enforce performance measures by funding penalties, it is possible that the effect of such penalties would be counteracted by funding guarantees in the bill. Accelerating project d elivery. 17 Major highway and transit facilities, which often take somewhere on the order of 10 to 15 years to plan and build, are frequently said to take much too long deliver. Studies show that project delay can occur during any of the five main phases in delivering major highway and transit projects: planning; preliminary design and environmental review; final design; right-of-way acquisition and utility relocation; and construction. Many proposals, particularly for highways, focus mainly on speeding the environmental review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other federal environmental laws and regulations. One proposal that might be considered is making permanent the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Pilot Program and expanding it to allow delegation of NEPA authority for highway projects to any state. Another is to reduce the number of steps in the public transit New Starts program and the elimination of the alternatives analysis that is often seen as a duplication of the requirements in NEPA. Structural issues. SAFETEA created two commissions to study the structure and the financing imperatives of the surface transportation programs. One of these, the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, called for a major reorganization of the federal surface transportation programs into 10 new program areas, often across existing programmatic modal boundaries. A report issued by the George W. Bush Administration entitled \"Refocus, Reform, Renew: A New Transportation Approach for America,\" included several proposals for new and reorganized surface transportation programs, with a heavy emphasis on expanding the role of market forces and the private sector in the provision of surface transportation infrastructure. Numerous think tanks, research organizations, and transportation groups have called for organizational changes in the way federal surface transportation programs are administered. Reducing program size. If Congress chooses not to make changes that would increase the flow of revenue into the highway trust fund, it will face a choice between continuing to authorize annual general fund expenditures for surface transportation and reducing the programs' size. It could simply choose to limit the funding authorized in the surface transportation bill to the HTF revenues and interest projected to be available over the life of the bill (plus the general fund component of the transit title). It could shift some programs currently funded by the highway trust fund, such as the Appalachian Roads Program, to general fund status. It might reduce matching ratios (90:10 for interstates, 80:20 for most other roads, varying proportions for transit projects) in order to spread the available federal funds more broadly. More dramatically, it could limit surface transportation funding to programs that it determines fulfill clear national needs, and devolve other responsibilities to the states. Alternative funding mechanisms. Public-private partnerships, in which private companies take responsibility for construction, operation, and/or maintenance of particular transportation projects in return for a flow of payments from government agencies or project users, have been widely encouraged as a means of decreasing reliance on the trust fund. Other proposals for expanding alternative funding include federal grants or loans to state infrastructure banks; increased authority to lend to local agencies under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA); increased reliance on Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles (known as GARVEE Bonds) and the private activity bonds authorized by SAFETEA; and creation of a national infrastructure bank, as proposed by the Obama Administration in its FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012 budgets. Tolling. Congress could choose to expand the role of tolling in federal highway policy. Currently most interstate system highways are under a tolling prohibition. Tolling could help pay for the rebuilding or reconstruction of congested urban interstate highways. Tolling could also be encouraged to provide the funding flows often needed to support public private partnerships. Raising tolling to greater prominence in federal highway policy faces significant obstacles, notably the general public hostility to tolls and the difficulty of garnering political support. Revenue issues. The two commissions established in SAFETEA both recommended increases in the motor fuel tax to meet the immediate funding needs of surface transportation programs. Both urged an eventual shift to charges based on vehicle miles traveled as a longer-term funding source. VMT charges represent one type of user fee, but alternatives such as tolls and weight-distance taxes, which are already imposed in some instances on trucks, also might be employed to force road users to pay the costs of surface transportation programs.

The last several reauthorizations have resolved the disagreements over equity by creating a separate arrangement, currently known as the Equity Bonus Program, under which nearly all states are entitled to highway funding above and beyond that provided for in the funding formulas in specific programs. Under the Equity Bonus Program, FHWA is directed to allocate sufficient funds to ensure that each state receives a minimum share return on its highway payments\u201492% in FY2008 and FY2009. The calculation is more complicated than this figure suggests, as certain surface transportation programs are not included.", "The Equity Bonus Program includes a number of \"hold harmless\" provisions to guarantee minimum state shares of funding, based on certain thresholds. These thresholds include state population, population density, highway fatality rates, median household income, and state fuel tax rates. In part, these criteria appear to have been devised to assure the bill would get at least 60 votes in the Senate. The Equity Bonus Program also sets an annual percentage floor, relative to a state's TEA-21 average apportionment, beneath which no state can fall. The money is distributed to the states by increasing the amounts apportioned to the core formula programs.", "There was no equity bonus calculation for either FY2010 or FY2011. The distributions for these years were simply based on FY2009 overall funding distributions.", "The distribution of the equity bonus has had a number of unanticipated consequences. One of these is its interaction with High Priority Program earmarks used by Members of Congress to define their project priorities through the authorization process to their state DOTs. High Priority Program earmarks do not add significant amounts of money to a state's share of highway spending, because states whose earmarks are small tend to receive relatively larger equity bonus distributions than states that receive relatively large earmarks. This means that the total amount received by a state tends to be roughly the same whether or not it receives a large dollar total of earmarks. A corollary of this situation is that the more of a state's total funding is derived from High Priority Program earmarks, the less is ultimately available to the state for the federal-aid highway core formula programs, on which state departments of transportation depend to fulfill their state transportation plans. ", "The equity bonus distribution also negates the imposition of some penalties that are designed to discourage certain activities of the states. For example, a state that transfers some of its Highway Bridge Program funds to other programs is penalized by having its deficient bridge cost-to-repair total reduced a like amount in the next year's formula calculation. The purpose of this was to encourage states to reserve their Highway Bridge Program funds for bridges. However, the equity bonus distribution in effect gives back what the penalty takes away. The equity bonus overlay combined with the extensive ability given states to transfer funds across programs may undercut the effectiveness of the programmatic structure in achieving the national surface transportation goals specified by Congress.", "Since 1982 the equity provisions in surface transportation have been changed many times, and there is a high probability that changes will be discussed in the current reauthorization. Among the possible changes are:", "Increasing the share of its highway tax revenue that is guaranteed to each state above the current 92% level. However, the closer the guaranteed percentage comes to 100% of the total program the more difficult an increase becomes. Bringing the percentage guarantee closer to 100% would probably require a weakening of some of the \"hold harmless\" provisions that protect certain donee states from losing share. The hold harmless provisions exist primarily due to the practical politics of getting authorization bills through both houses of Congress, so eliminating them may raise political concerns. Expanding the scope of the equity provisions. This would require growth in program size to fund a larger equity overlay unless the underlying core program formulas were rewritten to bring the initial program apportionments more into line with the goals of an increased percentage return guarantee. Eliminating the counteracting impact of the equity bonus distribution on the highways program penalty provisions. This could be accomplished by imposing the penalties after rather than before the distribution of the equity bonus funding. However, this could affect some states' guaranteed percentage shares. Eliminating the equity provision altogether and allowing program formulas to determine the distribution of highway funds to the states. One way of doing this would be to modify the core formula programs so that they are all entirely weighted at or near 100% on states' annual contributions to the highway account. Providing an equity guarantee for transit funding. Roughly 80% of the Federal Transit Administration's budget comes from the fuel taxes paid by highway users. This funding could also be subject to a rate-of-return guarantee. While such a scenario might be attractive to some donor states not already receiving significant transit assistance, there are other donor states which might not benefit from a transit equity distribution. Further, any inclusion of transit in an equity bonus scenario is likely to be opposed by heavily urbanized states and states with large transit systems.", "The equity debate is complicated by the fact that significant amounts of general fund money have been transferred to the highway trust fund. Although much of transferred funding reflects interest payments on the trust fund's unexpended balances, such interest not paid directly by highway user fees. Other funds have been transferred to the highway trust fund for a variety of reasons, such as compensation for lower ethanol tax rates. Further transfers may be necessary in the years ahead. The larger the general fund share of federal highway spending, the harder it is to argue that states should get a return based on their highway users' payments, raising the question of whether the Equity Bonus Program is an appropriate part of a reauthorization bill.

", "Congress also faces competing claims for how transportation research funding should be used. In SAFETEA's research title, Congress earmarked more funding than the total amount that was authorized by the title, with the result that individual research programs and projects received less funding than each was authorized in order that the available funding could be stretched to cover all the designated programs and projects. No unearmarked research funding was available for some FHWA projects, such as the biennial conditions and performance reports, that in previous years had been funded with such moneys. In 2008 Congress addressed these funding shortfalls by enacting the SAFETEA Technical Corrections Act ( P.L. 110-224 ), which added additional funding to all of the research programs. The lack of peer review in the allocation of research funding has also surfaced as a concern.

NEPA requires all federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their proposed actions. To ensure that environmental impacts are considered before final decisions are made, NEPA requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for any federally funded project that significantly affects the quality of the human environment. If the level of significance of a proposed project is unclear, the agency must prepare an environmental assessment in order to make that determination.

During the reauthorization process, there will likely be debate regarding the level of CMAQ funding and possibly the types of projects eligible for funding.", "From FY2005 to FY2009, the CMAQ program provided over $8.6 billion to state departments of transportation and local transit agencies. Specific types of projects eligible for CMAQ funds include, but are not limited to: programs for improved public transit; traffic flow improvement programs that reduce emissions; and programs to control extended idling of vehicles. SAFETEA required states and metropolitan planning organizations to give priority in distributing CMAQ funds to diesel engine retrofits and other cost-effective emission reduction and congestion mitigation activities that provide air quality benefits.

But the threat of a conformity lapse and the potential \"loss\" of highway funds has been a powerful incentive to get local officials to focus on air quality considerations as they plan transportation projects.
