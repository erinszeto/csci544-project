", "Between March and April 2019, DOD approved $2.5 billion for seven of the border barrier projects requested by DHS and funded them in two tranches drawn from reprogrammed defense program savings. DOD completed a transfer of $1 billion for three projects (El Paso Sector Project 1 and Yuma Sector Projects 1-2) on March 26, 2019. On May 9, 2019, the Department completed a second transfer of $1.5 billion for four additional projects (El Centro Sector Project 1 and Tucson Sector Projects 1-3).

On July 26, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the lower court's injunction, allowing work to once again proceed. Litigation in this case (and related) lawsuits remains ongoing.", "In August 2019, DHS notified DOD that new estimates indicated construction costs would be lower than first projected, resulting in an overall funding surplus. DHS requested the anticipated savings be applied to the execution of three additional projects. DOD approved the request but later terminated the plan after savings proved insufficient.", "On September 30, 2019, DOD announced the transfer of an additional $129 million in expiring FY2019 appropriations drawn from counternarcotics accounts that Military Departments determined were excess to need.

On February 13, 2020, DOD approved 31 of these items and reprogrammed $3.8 billion in FY2020 military procurement funds for their execution.

The statute specifies that new construction must support the use of armed forces mobilized to address a national emergency declared by the President.", "On February 11, 2019, CJCS provided a preliminary assessment to the Acting Secretary of Defense that broadly assessed the utility of physical barriers on DHS operations, as well as ongoing demand for DOD support. The report acknowledged empirical challenges associated with quantifying the effectiveness of physical barriers on migration flows \"because reliable data is scarce and opinions are divergent,\" but pointed to anecdotal and historical evidence to suggest that barriers might reasonably be expected to reduce the demand for DOD resources over time:", "Although military construction projects along the southern border may not alleviate all DHS requirements for DoD support, the construction of physical barriers should reduce the challenges to CBP and, therefore, can be reasonably expected to reduce DHS requirements for DoD support.", "On February 18, 2019, following the release of the Administration's factsheet plan, DOD requested that DHS provide a prioritized list of projects along with a supplemental analysis explaining how the construction would support military personnel pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72808. DHS responded in March with the detailed information, characterizing the projects as force multipliers for mobilized DOD personnel:", "Because the requested projects will serve as force multiplier, it will also likely reduce DHS's reliance on DoD for force protection, surveillance support, engineering support, air support, logistical support, and strategic communications assistance. In other words, providing border barriers and the accompanies [sic] roads and technology will allow DoD to focus its efforts on a smaller, more focused area.", "In April 2019, having received the list of DHS projects, the Secretary of Defense requested the CJCS conduct a second, more detailed analysis of proposed construction and return with a recommendation on how to proceed. Concurrently, the Secretary directed the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to begin identifying $3.6 billion in existing military construction projects that might be deferred by use of the emergency authority under the statute. ", "In a memorandum report dated May 2019, CJCS General Joseph Dunford delivered his final assessment to Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan. The report's methodology was based on the presumption that while any barrier construction along the border could reasonably be expected to create \"ripple effects\" that would support the use of the armed forces, projects more beneficial than others should be prioritized, based on factors identified by DOD. The analysis assessed border barrier projects DHS had requested under 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72808, as well as those projects not funded by previous transfers under 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7284. Though the CJCS team considered the type of land associated with each project area (federal or private), it developed a prioritization scheme that was missing key details related to land jurisdiction. As a consequence, the CJCS' final recommendations were later revised and included in an action memorandum to the Secretary of Defense on August 21, 2019. ", "On September 3, 2019, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, having determined that border barrier construction would serve as a \"force multiplier\" for reducing DHS's demand for DOD personnel and assets, directed the Acting Secretary of the Army to proceed with the construction of 11 DHS border barrier projects, and the deferral of approximately 127 existing military construction projects ($3.6 billion).", "In a public briefing later that day, DOD officials described a plan for deferring in stages, otherwise authorized military construction projects under 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72808 authority. Those military construction projects located at non-U.S. locations ($1.8 billion) would be deferred first, followed later by projects within the United States. ($1.8 billion). Officials stated", "The intent is prioritizing funds in this manner is to provide time to work with Congress to determine opportunities to restore funds, as well as work with our allies and partners on improving burden sharing for overseas construction projects.", "USACE has noted that the pace for obligating military construction (MILCON) funds for border barrier construction projects will be highly dependent on project location, since land must first be administratively transferred to the Department of the Army before work can proceed. Construction on land that currently falls under the jurisdiction of DOD can be undertaken relatively quickly, since the military effectively manages the parcels. Projects in locations that fall under one or more other federal jurisdictions may be delayed while transfers are negotiated. Projects on private land are expected to take the longest to complete, since the government must first obtain administrative jurisdiction of the land by either purchase or condemnation.
