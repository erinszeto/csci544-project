The budget resolution does not include instructions for reconciliation. A budget resolution is not intended to establish details of spending or revenue policy and does not provide levels of spending for specific agencies or programs; it is not a law and is not signed by the President. Rather, the budget resolution provides the framework for the consideration of other legislation.

CBO was provided additional detail by the staff of the House Budget Committee regarding assumptions that should be made while conducting the analysis that was not included in the budget resolution or the accompanying report. CBO's analysis, however, does not provide an official cost estimate for legislation that might implement the proposal, as it did not conduct its analysis using actual legislative language and was asked to provide an impact analysis beyond the 10-year budgetary window.

Chairman Ryan provided unofficial 10-year spending estimates in the \"Path to Prosperity\" report. These estimates suggest that the budget plan would reduce federal health care spending about $2.2\u00a0trillion over FY2012-FY2021 from CBO's baseline estimate. This would include a reduction of approximately $1.4 trillion that would have been spent to implement PPACA health insurance reforms, and a reduction of $771 billion for Medicaid and $30 billion for Medicare during this time period. In its long\u2013term analysis of the proposal, CBO estimated that government mandatory spending for healthcare would be about 6% of GDP in 2030, 5.75% in 2040, and 4.75% in 2050, compared to 8.75%, 10.75% and 12.25% for the same years under CBO's baseline current-law projections.", "This report provides a synopsis of the health care related changes in Chairman Ryan's FY2012 budget proposal.

Generally, individuals are eligible for Medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment, are 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals under the age of 65 may also qualify for coverage if they have a permanent disability, have End-Stage Renal disease, or have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).", "In FY2011, the program will cover an estimated 48 million persons at an estimated total cost of about $569 billion, accounting for approximately 3.7% of GDP. CBO estimates that federal Medicare spending (after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts) will be about $485 billion in FY2011, accounting for over 15% of total federal spending. Medicare is an entitlement program, which means that it is required to pay for covered services provided to eligible persons so long as specific criteria are met. Spending under the program (except for a portion of the administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the appropriations process.", "The Medicare program has four parts, each responsible for paying for different benefits, subject to different eligibility criteria and financing mechanisms. ", "Part A (Hospital Insurance, or HI) covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, and home health and hospice care. The HI trust fund is mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, with employers and workers each paying 1.45%. (The self-employed pay 2.9%.) PPACA added an additional 0.9% hospital insurance tax on high-income taxpayers. Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI) covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. The SMI trust fund is funded through beneficiary premiums (set at 25% of estimated program costs for the aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount, approximately 75%). High income enrollees pay higher premiums. Enrollment in Part B is voluntary, with over 90% of Medicare beneficiaries choosing this option. Part C (Medicare Advantage, or MA) is a private plan option for beneficiaries that covers all Part A and B services, except hospice. Individuals choosing to enroll in Part C must also enroll in Part B. Part C is funded through both the HI and SMI trust funds. Part D covers prescription drug benefits. Funding is included in the SMI trust fund and is financed through beneficiary premiums (about 25.5%) and general revenues (about 74.5%). High income enrollees pay higher premiums. This portion of the program is also voluntary; about 60% of eligible Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Part D plan, while another 14% are enrolled in an employer plan subsidized by Medicare.", "Under traditional Medicare, Parts A and B, services are generally paid directly by the government on a \"fee-for-service\" basis, using different prospective payment systems or fee schedules. Under Parts C and D, private insurers are paid a monthly \"capitated\" amount to provide enrollees with at least a minimum standard benefit. Premium amounts may vary depending on which plan the enrollee selects. The capitated payment is adjusted to reflect the higher relative cost of older or sicker beneficiaries, but is not adjusted for the actual amount of health care used.", "Since its establishment in 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change.

Subsidizes related to closing the Part D prescription drug benefit coverage gap (doughnut hole). Prior to PPACA , under the standard benefit, most enrollees paid all of their drug costs during a period between an initial coverage limit and a catastrophic threshold when there was a gap in coverage. PPACA (Section 3301) and the Reconciliation Act (Section 1101) phase out the doughnut hole until it is closed in 2020. At that time, 75% of the cost of generic drugs and 25% of the cost of brand name drugs incurred during the coverage gap would be subsidized by Medicare. Also beginning in 2011, drug manufacturers are required to provide a 50% discount to enrollees off the cost of brand name drugs during the doughnut hole phase; it is unclear whether this discount would be retained or repealed under the budget proposal. The high-income payroll taxes. Under current law, employers and employees each pay a payroll tax of 1.45% to finance Medicare Hospital Insurance (Part A). Section 9015 of PPACA includes an additional 0.9% hospital insurance tax on high-income taxpayers levied on wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers effective for taxable years after December 31, 2012. Section 1402 of the Reconciliation Act also imposes a 3.8% surtax on unearned income, which includes interest, dividends, non-qualified annuities, royalties, rents, and taxable net capital gains for households with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers. This surtax is effective for taxable years after December 31, 2012. ", "The CBO analysis indicated that most of the other changes that PPACA and the Reconciliation Act made to the Medicare program would be retained. This would include provisions that reduce payments to various types of health care providers. None of the four documents (budget resolution, Chairman's \"Path to Prosperity\" report, the Committee report, or CBO analysis) provided sufficient detail regarding specific provisions that would be repealed or retained to determine the disposition of provisions related to the quality and efficiency of health care (in Title III of PPACA), such as those creating value-based purchasing programs, quality reporting systems, and demonstrations and pilot programs that would test various patient care models including accountable care organizations.

The sustainable growth rate (SGR) system was established because of the concern that the Medicare fee schedule itself would not adequately constrain overall increases in spending for physicians' services. Each year since 2002, the SGR has resulted in a reduction in the reimbursement rates. With the exception of 2002, when a 4.8% decrease was applied, Congress has passed a series of bills to override the reductions. However, these actions have required almost yearly attention from the Congress. Unless additional action is taken, Medicare physician payments will be reduced by approximately 30% at the end of 2011.", "Chairman Ryan's \"Path to Prosperity\" report specified that one of the objectives of the budget resolution is to \"fix the Medicare physician payment formula for the next ten years so that Medicare beneficiaries continue to have access to health care.\" The physician payment system would be designed so that physicians who treat Medicare beneficiaries would be provided incentives to improve quality and efficiency. The Committee Report ( H.Rept. 112-158 ) notes that the inclusion of the SGR reserve fund in the budget resolution accommodates a fix to the SGR. The reserve fund created by Section 304 of H.Con.Res. 34 would provide procedural flexibility to allow for the consideration within the framework of the budget resolution of legislation that would reform SGR, as long as the legislation\u00a0did not increase the deficit for the period FY2012-FY2021. CBO indicated, however, that on the basis of specifications provided by House Budget Committee staff, its analysis of the long-term budgetary impacts of the proposal did not include a change in the sustainable growth rate mechanism for payments to physicians under Medicare.

Those who are age 55 or older by the end of 2011 or qualify to receive Medicare benefits based on disability prior to 2022 would not see a change. Individuals who become eligible (based either on age or disability) for Medicare in 2022 and later years would not be able to enroll in the current Medicare program. Instead, they would be given the option of enrolling in a private insurance plan through a newly established Medicare exchange. These plans would be required to offer standard benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management, to accept all people eligible for Medicare who apply, and to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age. Those covered under traditional Medicare would also have the option of switching to the new system beginning in 2022.", "Under the new system, Medicare would pay a portion of the beneficiaries' premiums, i.e., provide \"premium support.\" The payments would be adjusted for age, health status, and income and would be paid directly by the government to the insurance plan selected by the Medicare beneficiary. In addition, plans with healthier enrollees, would be required to help subsidize plans with less healthy enrollees. In 2022, the premium subsidy would be set at $8,000, on average. The amount of premium support provided to high-income individuals would be reduced. Beneficiaries would pay the difference, if any, between the actual plan premium and the subsidy amount. Premium support payments would increase each year based on increases in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) and the age of the enrollee (under the assumption that older beneficiaries tend to be less healthy and require more and higher cost care). Additionally, for individuals with low income (including \"dual-eligibles\" \u2013 Medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for Medicaid), the federal government would establish medical savings accounts (MSAs) beginning in 2022. Eligibility for MSA payments would be determined annually and be based on income relative to federal poverty levels. The 2022 contribution to an MSA would be $7,800, in addition to the $8,000 premium subsidy, and the annual amounts in subsequent years would grow with the CPI-U. ", "Because the new system will be phased in over time, two separate Medicare systems would need to operate simultaneously as long as those aged 55 and older as of the end of 2011 are still living. In its analysis, CBO noted potential concerns with both systems. For example, CBO projects that restraints to payments to providers of health care services under the current system could lead to fewer providers willing to accept Medicare patients. Additionally, as the average age of individuals in traditional Medicare increased through time (because younger ones would be enrolling in a different system), the average per capita costs of individuals remaining in this system would be expected to increase as well (Medicare Part B and D premiums calculations are based on a percentage of costs). ", "Under the premium support model, CBO estimates that Medicare beneficiaries participating in the new system would bear a much larger share of their health care costs than they would under the current program. First, private plans would cost more than traditional Medicare because of differences in payment rates for providers, administrative costs and utilization of health care services. For example, in 2011, CBO estimates that average spending in traditional Medicare for a typical 65-year-old would be 11% less than the spending that would occur if that same package of benefits were purchased from a private insurer. ", "Additionally, CBO projects that the premium support payments would not keep pace with increases in health care costs and leave larger portions for beneficiaries to pay. CBO estimates that by 2030, beneficiaries' spending on premiums and out-of-pocket share of health care spending for a typical Medicare beneficiary would increase from projections of 25% under current law, or 30% under CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, to 68% for benefits similar to those currently provided by Medicare. The differences in specified growth rates are the fundamental reason why CBO projects that deficits and debt will be much smaller than under CBO's long-term budget scenarios. ", "Those who support converting the current system to a premium support model note that it sets a limit for the federal portion of Medicare spending and that an overhaul of the Medicare program is needed in order to avoid a debt crisis. Supporters also suggest that the new system would add price incentives at the consumer level and plans would be incentivized to control costs in order to be competitive. In addition to concerns over increased out-of-pocket spending for health care for the elderly and the potential for the erosion of benefit coverage, those who oppose the model maintain that the proposal does not address the main reason for the growth in Medicare spending, i.e., excessive costs in the health care delivery system."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["In FY2011, the Medicaid program will cover an estimated 69.5 million people. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services as well as long-term care. Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and the states. Federal Medicaid payments to states are estimated to reach $275\u00a0billion in FY2011, which would include $12 billion as a result of increased federal medical assistance percentage funding that Congress provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 111-5 ). In a typical year, the federal government covers roughly 57% of the total cost for Medicaid. As a percent of GDP, federal Medicaid spending is expected to reach about 1.9% of GDP in FY2011.", "Each state designs and administers its own version of Medicaid under broad federal rules. While states that choose to participate in Medicaid must comply with all federal mandated requirements, state variability is the rule rather than the exception in terms of eligibility levels, covered services, and how those services are reimbursed and delivered. PPACA makes changes along these dimensions for the Medicaid program. Some of the changes are mandatory for states and others are available at state option. Most notable of these provisions is the expansion of Medicaid eligibility levels for individuals under the age of 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level.", "Estimates provided in Chairman Ryan's \"Path to Prosperity\" report suggest that the proposed budget would reduce federal outlays for Medicaid by about $771 billion from FY2012-FY2021 compared to CBO's baseline projection.

According to CBO, in FY2022, the proposal would further reform the Medicaid program by reducing the Medicaid block grant amounts to reflect the elimination of acute care benefits for elderly individuals. While Medicaid benefits to the elderly would be reduced in FY2022, as discussed above in the Medicare section, beginning in FY2022, \"dual-eligibles\" (i.e. those individuals eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare) would receive full Medicare premium support plus federally-funded medical savings accounts (MSAs).", "Proponents of the block grant model suggest that this design would make federal Medicaid spending more predictable and provide states with stronger incentives to control the cost of their Medicaid programs. Additionally, this design could relieve some of the cost burden to states by removing certain federal Medicaid requirements. ", "However, this proposal would shift the responsibility for the growth in Medicaid spending over the federal block grant amount to states. According to CBO, the magnitude of the federal Medicaid spending reductions under this proposal would make it difficult for states to maintain their current Medicaid programs. As a result, states would have to weigh the impact of maintaining current Medicaid service levels against other state priorities for spending. They could choose to constrain Medicaid expenditures by reducing provider reimbursement rates, limiting benefit packages, or restricting eligibility. These types of programmatic changes could also impact access to and the quality of medical care for Medicaid enrollees.
