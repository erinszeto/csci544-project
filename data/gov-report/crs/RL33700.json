The scale of assessments for U.N. peacekeeping is based on a modification of the U.N. regular budget scale, with the five permanent U.N. Security Council members assessed at a higher level than they are for the U.N. regular budget. Since 1992, U.S. policy was to seek a U.N.

Since October 1, 1995, based on congressional requirements, U.S. peacekeeping payments had been limited to 25%.
