Specifically, some worry that Obama may have painted himself into a corner on settlements\u2014that if he accepts anything less than a total and permanent freeze, two things might result. His willingness to compromise could be interpreted as a sign of weakness with the potential to undermine U.S. leverage in a larger negotiating process; and he could lose the confidence of Arabs who believe that, historically, the United States has been biased toward Israel and had hoped Obama would be an \"honest broker.\" Others believe that Obama should explain the reasoning behind his policies directly to an Israeli audience in much the same way that he intended the Cairo speech to allay concerns about the compatibility of U.S. interests with the interests of Arabs and Muslims in the region.", "At the September 2009 trilateral meeting in New York, Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George Mitchell said, in acknowledging that agreement had not yet been reached on halting Israeli settlement activity or securing major Arab normalization with Israel:", "We are not identifying any issue as being a precondition nor an impediment to negotiation....

It is less clear whether they (1) signal that the parties are progressing to a new phase of the diplomatic approach the Administration envisioned would come regardless of the outcome of earlier phases, or (2) represent a conscious strategic choice by the Administration to deemphasize preliminary steps and confidence-building measures in favor of a more endgame-focused approach (see \" U.S. Policy \" below). ", "Subsequent efforts by the United States to prioritize the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian final-status negotiations over a full settlement freeze and over the Palestinian attempt to have various United Nations bodies scrutinize Israel's actions during the Gaza conflict (e.g. The Goldstone Report ) have been perceived by many Palestinians to be signs of continued pro-Israel bias and a lack of sensitivity to Mahmoud Abbas's domestic standing, which suffered in the final months of 2009. One notable example was Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's October 2009 statement that an announced Israeli moratorium on settlement construction in the West Bank, which was temporary (10 months) and excluded East Jerusalem, was nonetheless an \"unprecedented\" step.

Netanyahu welcomed the resumption of negotiations with the PLO without preconditions, but also insisted that in any peace agreement the PLO would need to recognize unequivocally that Israel is \"the nation state of the Jewish people\" \u2014a difficult demand for any Palestinian leader to accept because this would represent an implicit abandonment of the \"right of return\" for millions of Palestinian refugees and a blow to the roughly 20% of Israel's population composed of Arab Muslims and Christians.

The plan does not discuss if and how Gaza can be involved absent a general opening of the border crossings and a political arrangement accommodating both Hamas and Fatah.

Because Fayyad has no significant domestic political base, doubts exist regarding his ability to leverage his main political assets\u2014anti-corruption credentials and support from Western patrons\u2014into a sustained push to rally Palestinians around his plan.

In exchange, Meshaal said that Hamas would be willing to declare a 10-year hudna (\"truce\"), but would not agree to a permanent peace arrangement or formal recognition of Israel and its right to exist. He urged his interviewers and audience to ignore the Hamas charter of 1988, which calls for the destruction of Israel. Later, in a July interview with the Wall Street Journal , Meshaal essentially restated his May proposal, and added that Hamas would cooperate with the United States in achieving a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict if Israel freezes settlement building and if the economic and military \"blockade\" of the Gaza Strip is lifted.", "Some observers have interpreted Meshaal's statements as betokening a new, conciliatory Hamas approach that, while falling short of accepting the Quartet Principles, connotes implicit recognition of Israel's right to exist. Some who see a new approach see it as an indication that Hamas may have \"grown up\" and that, in time, it could move toward formal recognition of Israel. Others who acknowledge the appearance of a new approach claim that Hamas's conciliatory tone may be due to the movement's calculation that cultivating an image of reasonableness presently serves its interests in light of (1) the diplomatic climate following Obama's accession, (2) Israeli deterrence of Hamas-generated violence in the aftermath of the Gaza conflict, and/or (3) geopolitical changes affecting Hamas's principal allies in the region\u2014Syria, Hezbollah, and Iran.", "Those who are more skeptical of Hamas's intentions have countered that Meshaal's statements did not change anything of substance in Hamas's existing positions, and are best explained as a ploy to give the impression of moderation. They cite Hamas's continued efforts to build up its military capabilities and to plan attacks on Israelis, along with the reported rise in prominence of extremists (relative to other Hamas members) within the group's governing shura (or \"consultative\") councils, as evidence to support their claims. These skeptics assert that \"implicit recognition\" is no recognition at all, and that a 10-year hudna would simply allow Hamas to consolidate its position and await a more propitious moment to mount a Palestinian/Islamic takeover of Israel.

The revelations on the Olmert-Abbas talks have led to debate over whether Olmert was dealing reasonably\u2014particularly given that the contemplated deal was a shelf agreement, not something that would have been \"effective immediately\"\u2014and over whether Abbas's was unwilling to make difficult compromises deemed necessary for peace.

Other observers believe that the Annapolis process did not generate significant progress, and may even represent a step backward for chances at Israeli-Palestinian peace. Some assert that the parties remain stalemated on the core issues of the conflict (particularly Jerusalem, settlements, and refugees), and that the situation on the ground with regard to these disputed issues has become more entrenched. Several view the most recent round of talks\u2014and the accompanying international pledges of support\u2014as little or no different in substance from other failed negotiating cycles of the Oslo era. Another argument is that the Annapolis process may not have been primarily intended to facilitate Israeli-Palestinian peace, but to advance other U.S., Israeli, and Sunni Arab geopolitical goals\u2014such as consolidating support for stability in Iraq or possibly making diplomatic overtures to Syria in order to isolate Iran.", "Still others have asserted that the signal weakness of the Annapolis negotiations was the lack of third-party mechanisms within the negotiation process to bridge differences and rectify power imbalances between the Israelis and Palestinians, and to provide incentives for both parties to accept otherwise unappealing concessions.

Following the outbreak of the second i ntifada , Israel began construction of the West Bank separation barrier, increased security scrutiny at crossing points, issued permits to control access, and, in many cases, halted the flow of people and goods altogether.

At the Sixth Fatah Congress held in Bethlehem in August 2009, PLO Chairman/PA President Mahmoud Abbas made the following statement: ", "While we affirm that we have opted for peace and negotiations on the basis of international legitimacy, we reserve to ourselves the right to carry out legitimate resistance that is acknowledged by international law. This right also depends on our understanding and national consensus for defining the appropriate forms of this resistance and its timing....

As referenced in Abbas's statement above, in 1988, the Palestinian National Council, the legislative body of the PLO, declared Palestinian independence and statehood at the same time it moved toward recognizing Israel's right to exist. The declaration had no practical effect, however, because the PLO was in exile in Tunisia and did not define the territorial scope of its state. After the establishment of limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1990s, Yasser Arafat periodically threatened to declare statehood unilaterally, but he never did, and his threats were widely seen as bargaining tactics.

Acquiescing to the inclusion of Hamas in the peace process in some manner could involve its integration or reintegration into existing Palestinian leadership structures such as the PA and the PLO. Among current U.S. restrictions on aid aimed at Hamas and its affiliates is a prohibition on direct aid to any PA government that includes members of Hamas unless all government ministers publicly agree to recognize Israel's right to exist and to be bound by previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements. Prospects of Palestinian unity may also lead to calls for a redefinition of the mission of U.S.-assisted PA security forces in the West Bank, which target Hamas members and sympathizers for arrest under certain conditions.", "As demonstrated by Obama's Cairo speech, the Administration has not departed from the Bush Administration's stance on Hamas. It has conditioned Hamas's participation in the peace process on acceptance of the Quartet Principles. However, a June 2009 meeting by Thomas Pickering, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and current co-chair of the International Crisis Group, with Mahmoud al Zahar\u2014one of Hamas's most senior leaders\u2014has led some to wonder if the Administration might be open to indirect or secret talks with Hamas. In August, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius speculated that the timing could be right to pursue secret talks\u2014perhaps allowing the United States to take advantage of possible Hamas concerns occasioned by Iran's internal post-election turmoil:", "But Tehran's reliability as a patron is now open to question, and its friends may want to hedge their bets. It's an ideal time for the United States to explore alternatives\u2014through a broad diplomatic opening with Syria and secret contacts (using Saudi, Egyptian and Syrian channels) with Hamas.", "Although the other Quartet members formally espouse the Quartet Principles, Russia has regular dealings with Hamas, legislators from various EU countries have met publicly with Khaled Meshaal and other Hamas leaders, and Hamas representatives claim that high-ranking European officials\u2014including ambassadors\u2014are talking regularly to them. Some analysts believe that Khaled Meshaal's media overtures following Obama's speech were largely aimed at gaining EU (if not U.S.) acceptance of a Hamas role in Palestinian affairs and the peace process without having to commit to the Quartet Principles. Some might argue that European governments could be useful as go-betweens for Hamas and the United States, while others might counter that the go-between role may have limited utility\u2014using Bush-era European diplomacy with Iran as a case in point.", "Any possibility of U.S. policy shifts regarding Hamas's role could trigger heated debate. Those opposing policy shifts say dealing with Hamas would likely strengthen its political hand at the expense of Abbas and other more moderate Palestinians, allowing the movement to argue to Palestinians that its hardline tactics with Israel are more effective than Abbas's approach. They also might say that any move toward legitimizing Hamas could embolden it and other Palestinian militants to use the mechanisms of Palestinian leadership to mount attacks on Israel\u2014either before or after the establishment of a Palestinian state. Those favoring policy shifts might say that Hamas is less likely to attack Israel if it is made a stakeholder that is accountable to revived Palestinian hopes of a Palestinian state.", "Leaving Hamas out of a negotiated outcome could lead the United States to pursue one of the following courses of action. One would be to trust that the Palestinian people would rally to the support of Abbas in the event he reaches a final-status agreement with Israel, ratifying the agreement in a referendum or in some other manner regardless of Hamas's objections. Another would be to help the PA and/or Israel prepare for containment of Hamas or for further military action against it. It is possible that a combination of both courses of action could be used.", "There are several risks involved with both courses of action. Entrusting the fate of a final-status peace agreement to a divided Palestinian public after so many years spent striving for resolution could lead to an unpredictable result (along the lines of the 2006 PLC elections that brought Hamas to power). Even if the Palestinian public backs Abbas, Hamas could seek to nullify the popular will through force. Containment of or military action against Hamas could backfire, as some believe it did for Israel during the December 2008-January 2009 conflict, leading Hamas to broaden and/or deepen its control of Gaza and possibly also giving it inroads into the West Bank. Even military success could come at great cost, given Hamas's entrenchment in Gaza and its attack capabilities (either with rockets or through direct attacks on Israelis). By supporting the use of force against Hamas, the United States could open itself up to charges that it is an aggressor, possibly eroding U.S. international credibility as an \"honest broker\" and guarantor with regard to the peace process. If any of these risks materialize, Congress could face requests for heightened economic and security assistance\u2014as occurred in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 Gaza conflict\u2014at a time when discerning if potential aid recipients and their actions are hospitable to U.S. interests might become increasingly difficult."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aid to Palestinians", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration has expanded the amount of U.S. aid given to forward Palestinian reform and development priorities. U.S. economic assistance to the Palestinians began following the establishment of limited Palestinian self-rule in the mid-1990s. U.S. assistance levels have fluctuated in past years according to the composition of Palestinian leadership and other circumstances. Current Palestinian priorities include the internationally and congressionally supported programs of PA security and economic reform and assistance that were relaunched in conjunction with the Annapolis process in 2007. Since mid-2007, the United States has appropriated or reprogrammed nearly $2 billion in support of these programs, including $650 million for direct budgetary assistance to the PA and nearly $400 million (toward training, non-lethal equipment, facilities, strategic planning, and administration) appropriated to strengthen and reform PA security forces and criminal justice systems in the West Bank. The remainder is for USAID-administered programs implemented by non-governmental organizations in humanitarian assistance, economic development, democratic reform, improving water access and other infrastructure, health care, education, and vocational training. $500 million in total assistance was appropriated for FY2010 pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ). Many observers point to signs of progress with PA security capacities and West Bank economic development, along with greater Israeli cooperation. It is less clear whether the progress they cite can be made self-sustaining and can be useful in promoting a broader political solution, and whether the level of Israeli cooperation is sufficient. ", "The effectiveness of U.S. assistance is challenged, logistically and strategically, not only by the Israelis, the PLO, the PA, Fatah, Hamas, and their shifting and often conflicting interests, but also by the U.S. interagency process and by the need to coordinate assistance from the European Union, European states, Russia, Japan, Canada, China, Turkey, and Arab states, among others. Ensuring that all international assistance complements U.S. objectives can be difficult or even untenable depending on the circumstances. ", "Presently, assisting Palestinian development and reform advances the stated interests of both Israel and the PA (see \" Fayyad's Plan \u2013 A De Facto Palestinian State \" above). Opponents of an emphasis on Palestinian development and reform might argue, however, that efforts to bolster Palestinian moderates in the 16 years since Oslo have made Hamas stronger, not weaker. If this trend continues, their argument might go, Hamas might even attempt a takeover of the West Bank, either through the PA electoral process (according to Palestinian law, both presidential and legislative elections are scheduled to take place in early 2010) or, eventually, through force (as it took over the Gaza Strip in 2007). In such a situation, the future existence and/or posture of the PA and its security forces (on which millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours have been spent through U.S.-sponsored programs) could be thrown into doubt.", "Another reason some might oppose an emphasis on Palestinian development and reform is that U.S. security and economic assistance to Palestinians could come to be seen as reinforcing the status quo. A peace process with no end in sight could erode momentum for a two-state solution and intensify the jockeying between and among Israelis and Palestinians for alternatives, perhaps leading ultimately to greater conflict. Also, the attention and resources devoted to reform and to strengthening anti-Hamas groups in the West Bank could widen divisions between the two Palestinian territories, given perceptions that residents of the Gaza Strip\u2014almost totally dependent on humanitarian assistance and illicit economic activity under restrictive Hamas rule and the virtual Israeli/Egyptian shutdown of its borders\u2014are being neglected, left behind, or perhaps even targeted. This could lead to heightened Palestinian resentment of all parties promoting the peace process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Israeli Settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above (see \" Israeli Settlements and Infrastructure \"), extensive construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since Oslo may have complicated prospects for a two-state solution. The historical tendency for settlement construction to increase during negotiations has led to Palestinian and Arab complaints aimed not only at Israel, but also at the United States, as Israel's ally and as both parties' designee as \"monitor and judge\" of the peace process's implementation. Although longstanding official U.S. policy opposes the settlements as \"obstacles to peace\" and insists that existing settlement blocs should not prejudice final-status negotiations, Arab critics routinely charge that U.S. support of Israel indirectly supports settlement activity.", "The Obama Administration chose to make a settlement freeze (pursuant to the Roadmap) one of the cornerstones of its approach to restarting the peace process. Public U.S. and Israeli disagreement over the prospect of a settlement freeze lasted through summer 2009 and continued into the fall. Although the issue's centrality to the resumption of final-status negotiations was downgraded somewhat at the September 2009 trilateral meeting in New York, President Obama nevertheless reaffirmed the importance of \"real action\" on restraining settlement activity. ", "Differences have surfaced over what constitutes the type of settlement construction that would be subject to a freeze. At various points Israel has sought to exclude the following from a potential freeze: (1) construction projects already contracted, (2) construction within the bounds of existing communities (building \"up\" but not \"out\"), (3) planning and permitting for construction that would begin following the end of a freeze, and (4) construction in East Jerusalem. Israel also seeks to make an exception for so-called \"natural growth,\" even though the Roadmap explicitly calls for including it in a freeze. Israel has claimed that during the Bush Administration, the United States and Israel reached an unwritten understanding that \"Israel could add homes in settlements it expected to keep [once a final resolution was reached], as long as the construction was dictated by market demand, not subsidies.\" The accounts of former Bush Administration officials diverge in their characterization of U.S.-Israel talks on the subject, but the Obama Administration has insisted that if understandings ever existed, it is not bound by them. ", "Some observers, particularly Arabs, assert that a settlement freeze should not be subject to negotiation. They believe that Israel is obligated to stop settlement construction because of its agreement to the terms of the Roadmap, if not on other moral and legal grounds, seeking to reinforce their point by asking whether Israel would countenance the Palestinians negotiating down their security obligations under the Roadmap. ", "The willingness of the Obama Administration to accept the partial and temporary moratorium on settlement building announced by Israel in October 2009 (see \" Obama's Cairo Speech and Subsequent Diplomacy \" above) may have been at least partly due to concerns in Congress that the public debate over settlements had lasted too long and could damage U.S.-Israeli relations, and/or that the Administration's initial expectations were too drastic. In May 2009, a letter from 329 Members of Congress called on President Obama to work \"closely and privately\" with Israel on \"areas of disagreement,\" and 76 Senators signed a different letter to the President urging continued close relations with Israel. In June, Politico quoted Democratic Congressman Robert Wexler, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, as saying that a freeze should apply \"only to settlements outside Israel's security fence, or wall, and should exclude territory that appears likely to ultimately remain part of Israel.\" In August, while leading a delegation of 29 Democratic Members of Congress in Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Post reported that House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer \"felt that there was more acceptance [in Congress] of Jewish construction in east Jerusalem than in the settlements in the West Bank.\" ", "Given the structure of Israeli society and politics, it may be difficult to maintain a settlement freeze or any other external restraint on settlement activity for an indefinite period of time. Settlers affect the political and diplomatic calculus through (1) influence over key voting blocs in Israel's coalition-based parliamentary system (although they do not all share the same ideology or interests, settlers constitute about 6% of the Israeli population\u2014approximately 450,000 out of 7.2 million total); (2) renegade actions to foment public protest and even violence; and (3) what they represent for some symbolically, emotionally, and even spiritually as guardians of the last frontier for a country whose founding and initial survival depended on pioneering spirit in the face of adversity. During the public debate of summer 2009, the Netanyahu government's announcement of new plans for construction and repeated insistence that outside actors will not dictate Israeli policy demonstrated the government's sensitivity to these domestic concerns, or, at least, its willingness to claim that these concerns are constraints on its ability to comply with U.S. demands for a freeze.", "Some analysts have suggested that the Obama Administration and Congress consider going beyond rhetoric to apply various forms of pressure on Israel in order to compel it to restrain settlement activity. Loan guarantees figured prominently in the last significant U.S.-Israeli diplomatic standoff over settlements\u2014between President George H.W. Bush and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1991. Current legislation authorizing loan guarantees through FY2010 permits the U.S. government to make reductions in the guarantees equal in amount to Israeli expenditures on settlement activity. However, most analysts believe that any potential reductions are unlikely to have any practical financial effect on Israel.

Many observers believe that Arab states are uniquely positioned to provide key incentives to Israel and support to the Palestinians. While most Arab states want to be seen as supporting a positive solution to the Palestinian question because it is an issue of deep concern for their populations, they often differ with the international community and with one another on what they should do and how they should do it. ", "As discussed above (see \" Obama's Cairo Speech and Subsequent Diplomacy \"), the Obama Administration has encouraged Arab states to take measures to gradually normalize their relations with Israel. Many Members of Congress support the Administration's efforts on this front, and believe that any Israeli efforts to reduce or halt settlement building should be met reciprocally by normalization measures from Arab states. Some small Gulf Arab and North African states that had ties with Israel in the 1990s were reportedly willing in summer 2009 to renew them in the event of an Israeli settlement freeze, but other Arab states were unwilling to consider normalization under these conditions. Saudi Arabia explained its position by insisting that because of past failures with incremental confidence-building measures, the \"focus must be on the final settlement and on the final peace,\" as outlined in the Arab Peace Initiative. ", "In addition to normalization with Israel, observers have proposed other ways in which Arab states could play a constructive role in the peace process, including:", "Providing financial and political support to the Palestinian Authority and its leaders and to Palestinian refugees (through organizations such as the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA); Investing or encouraging investment by their companies and citizens in West Bank industry and infrastructure; Halting or reducing smuggling into Gaza; Facilitating talks aimed at ending Palestinian factional and territorial division; Encouraging the PLO to resume final-status negotiations without preconditions, and, if the negotiations resume, publicly supporting the PLO and its leaders if they decide to make difficult concessions on final-status issues (such as refugees and Jerusalem).", "Many analysts believe that Arab states have played an inconsistent role thus far. Egypt has been active in brokering Palestinian unity talks, but with little concrete progress to show for its efforts. Arab states (especially Gulf states) provided large amounts of aid to the Hamas-led PA government in 2006-2007 after the United States and European Union withdrew their aid, but following the reinstitution of U.S. and EU aid in mid-2007, most of them reduced contributions. Routinely, they make generous pledges (including over $1.8 billion dollars in the wake of the 2008-2009 Gaza conflict) of aid to the Palestinians, but often fulfill them only in part and after significant delay. Their reluctance to fulfill pledges may stem from misgivings over \"picking sides\" in Palestinian factional disputes and from concerns that without imminent prospects either for domestic political unity or for progress on the peace process, any money contributed could be a waste. On the part of the Gulf states in particular, reluctance may also stem from a feeling that they are less responsible historically for the Palestinians' current situation than Israel, the United States, and Europe.
