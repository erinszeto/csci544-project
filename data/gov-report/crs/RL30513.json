Bus services for students with special needs are routinely late ornonexistent.

The child'sdeath prompted a congressional hearing and recommendations that includedadditional training for social workers and requiring social workers to provide fieldreports to judges 10 days before hearings on a child's status. In the wake of theBrianna Blackmon case, the court-appointed receiver asked the city for $60 millionin additional funds.
