But there are several schools ofthought on how to achieve that objective. Some advocate a policy of keeping maximum pressureon the Cuban government until reforms are enacted, while continuing current U.S. efforts to supportthe Cuban people. Others argue for an approach, sometimes referred to as constructive engagement,that would lift some U.S. sanctions that they believe are hurting the Cuban people, and move towardengaging Cuba in dialogue. Still others call for a swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations bylifting the U.S. embargo. Policy debate in the past several years has focused on whether to maintainU.S. restrictions on food and medical exports as well as on travel to Cuba.", "Legislative initiatives introduced in the 107th Congress reflected these divergent views on thedirection of U.S. policy toward Cuba and also covered a range of issues including human rights, foodand medical exports, travel restrictions, drug interdiction cooperation, and broadcasting to Cuba.Many of these will likely be introduced in the 108th Congress. In the second session of the 107thCongress, the House version of the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill, H.R. 5120 , included three Cuba provisions that would have eased restrictions on travel,remittances, and U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba; the Senate version of the bill, S. 2740 ,as reported out of committee, would have eased restrictions on travel to Cuba.

While the Cubangovernment originally was predicting a growth rate of 4-5% for 1997, growth for the year was just2.5%, largely because of disappointing sugar production. For 1998, the government's goal was fora growth rate of 2.5-3.5%, but another poor sugar harvest, a severe drought in eastern Cuba, and theeffects of Hurricane Georges resulted in an estimated growth rate of just 1.2%.

The UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that Cuba's infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)was just 7.9 in 1996, the lowest rate in Latin America and among the world's top 20 countries forthis indicator.

Since 1993, Cubans have been allowedto own and use U.S. dollars and to shop at dollar-only shops previously limited to tourists anddiplomats. Self-employment was authorized in more than 100 occupations in 1993, most in theservice sector, and by 1996 that figure had grown to more than 150 occupations.

Moreover, some analysts fear that the government has begun to backtrack on its reform efforts.

This reflected a decrease in the estimate of 300-400 reflected in the State Department'shuman rights report for 2000.

On the minds of U.S.policymakers was the 1980 Mariel boatlift in which 125,000 Cubans fled to the United States. Inresponse to Castro's threat to unleash another Mariel, U.S. officials reiterated U.S. resolve not toallow another exodus. Amidst escalating numbers of fleeing Cubans, on August 19, 1994, PresidentClinton abruptly changed U.S. migration policy, under which Cubans attempting to flee theirhomeland were allowed into the United States, and announced that the U.S. Coast Guard and Navywould take Cubans rescued at sea to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

In the agreement, the United States and Cuba agreed to facilitate safe, legal, and orderlyCuban migration to the United States, consistent with a 1984 migration agreement. The UnitedStates agreed to ensure that total legal Cuban migration to the United States would be a minimumof 20,000 each year, not including immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. In a change of policy, theUnited States agreed to discontinue the practice of granting parole to all Cuban migrants who reachthe United States, while Cuba agreed to take measures to prevent unsafe departures from Cuba.", "In May 1995, the United States reached another accord with Cuba under which the UnitedStates would parole the more than 30,000 Cubans housed at Guantanamo into the United States, butwould intercept future Cuban migrants attempting to enter the United States by sea and would returnthem to Cuba. The two countries would cooperate jointly in the effort. Both countries also pledgedto ensure that no action would be taken against those migrants returned to Cuba as a consequenceof their attempt to immigrate illegally. On January 31, 1996, the Department of Defense announcedthat the last of some 32,000 Cubans intercepted at sea and housed at Guantanamo had left the U.S.Naval Base, most having been paroled into the United States.

The incident prompted outrage from the CubanAmerican community in Florida and several Members of Congress. President Clinton characterizedthe incident as \"outrageous,\" and stated that the treatment was not authorized (Associated Press, July1, 1999). Another incident occurred on July 9, 1999, when a boat being interdicted by the CoastGuard capsized and resulted in the drowning of a Cuban woman. The State Department expressedregret over the incident and noted that the Department of Justice and the Immigration andNaturalization Service would investigate whether this was a case of alien smuggling.", "The Cuban government has taken forceful action against individuals engaging in aliensmuggling.
