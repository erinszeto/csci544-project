Those committee rules then elaborate, within Senate rules, how the committee will handle questions of order and procedure. A committee's rules may \"not be inconsistent with the Rules of the Senate.\" Committees may add to the basic rules, but they may not add anything that is in conflict with Senate rules.", "Examining the rules for each committee can show how each approaches issues of comity and fairness in the conduct of its business. The rules also serve to illustrate how each committee handles the division of power and the allocation of responsibility within its membership. Several committees, for example, require that if the committee is conducting business with a quorum that is less than a majority of its members, a member from the minority party must be present. When issuing subpoenas or starting investigations, committees may take different approaches on how to give authority to the chair of the committee while still allowing the ranking minority member a role in the process. Some committees require the agreement of the ranking minority member, others require that he or she be notified before the subpoena is issued.", "The requirement that each committee must adopt its own set of rules dates back to the 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act (P.L. 91-510). That law built on the 1946 Legislative Reorganization Act (P.L. 79-601), which created a framework for most Senate committees by setting out some basic requirements that most committees must adhere to. Under the provisions of the 1970 law, Senate committees must adopt their rules and have them printed in the Congressional Record not later than March 1 of the first year of a Congress. Typically, the Senate also publishes a compilation of the rules of all the committees each Congress, and some individual committees also publish their rules as a committee print.", "Although committee rules govern the actions of Senators in committee proceedings, there is no means for the Senate to enforce rules on committee conduct if the requirement that a physical majority be present for reporting a measure or matter is met. There also is no means for the Senate to enforce committee rules that go beyond those set out in the Senate's standing rules. For example, if a committee's rules contain a provision requiring that a member of the minority party be present for a quorum, but the committee acts without regard to that provision, the minority could register their disapproval with the committee's actions, but there is no point of order that could be raised on the Senate floor.", "Other factors may come into play when studying a committee's procedural profile. Along with the formal rules of the Senate and the individual rules for each committee, many committees have traditions or precedents they follow in practice that can affect their procedures. One committee, for example, does not allow Senators to offer second degree amendments during committee markups. This restriction is not contained in either the Senate or the committee's rules, it is a tradition. It is a tradition, however, the committee follows closely.", "This report analyzes the different approaches Senate committees have taken with their rules, focusing on additions to the overall Senate committee rules structure or unique provisions. A committee's rules can be extensive and detailed or general and short. The tables that conclude this report compare key features of the rules by committee. The tables, however, represent only a portion of each committee's rules. Provisions of the rules that are substantially similar to or that are essentially restatements of the Senate's standing rules are not included.", "This report reviews the requirements contained in Senate rules for committees, then explores how each Senate committee handles 11 specific procedural issues: meeting day, hearing and meeting notice requirements, scheduling of witnesses, hearing quorum, business quorum, amendment requirements, proxy voting, polling, nominations, investigations, and subpoenas.

The following provisions are taken from Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate. Some committees reiterate these rules in their own rules, but even for those committees that do not, these restrictions apply. This is not an exhaustive explanation of Senate Rules and their impact on committees, rather this summary is intended to provide a background against which to understand each committee's individual rules.", "Rules. Each committee must adopt rules; those rules must be published in the Congressional Record not later than March 1 of the first year of each Congress. If a committee adopts an amendment to its rules, that change only becomes effective when it is published in the Record . (Rule XXVI, paragraph 2). Meetings. Committees and subcommittees are authorized to meet and to hold hearings when the Senate is in session and when it has recessed or adjourned. A committee may not meet on any day (1) after the Senate has been in session for two hours, or (2) after 2:00 p.m. when the Senate is in session. Each committee must designate a regular day on which to meet weekly, biweekly or monthly (this requirement does not apply to the Appropriations Committee). A committee is to announce the date, place, and subject of each hearing at least one week in advance, though any committee may waive this requirement for \"good cause.\" (Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a); Rule XXVI, paragraph 3). Special meeting. Three members of a committee may make a written request to the chair to call a special meeting. The chair then has three calendar days in which to schedule the meeting, which is to take place within the next seven calendar days. If the chair fails to do so, a majority of the committee members can file a written motion to hold the meeting at a certain date and hour. (Rule XXVI, paragraph 3). Open meetings. Unless closed for reasons specified in Senate rules, such as a need to protect national security information, committee and subcommittee meetings, including hearings, are open to the public. When a committee or subcommittee schedules or cancels a meeting, it is required to provide that information, including the time, place, and purpose of the meeting, for inclusion in the Senate's computerized schedule information system. Any hearing that is open to the public also may be open to radio and television broadcasting, at the committee's discretion. Committees and subcommittees may adopt rules to govern how the media may broadcast the event. A vote by the committee in open session is required to close a meeting. (Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(b)). Quorums. Committees may set a quorum for doing business that is not less than one-third of the membership. A majority of a committee must be physically present when the committee votes to order the reporting of any measure, matter, or recommendation. The motion to order the reporting of a measure or matter requires the support of a majority of the members who are present and, in turn, the members who are physically present must constitute a majority of the committee. Proxies cannot be used to constitute a quorum. (Rule XXVI paragraph 7(a)(1)). Meeting Record . All committees must make public a video, transcript or audio recording of each open hearing of the committee within 21 days of the hearing. These shall be made available to the public via the Internet (Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(2)(A)). Proxy voting. A committee may adopt rules permitting proxy voting. A committee may not permit a proxy vote to be cast unless the absent Senator has been notified about the question to be decided and has requested that his or her vote be cast by proxy. A committee may prohibit the use of proxy votes on votes to report. (Rule XXVI, paragraph 7(a)(3)). Investigations and subpoenas. Each standing committee and its subcommittees is empowered to investigate matters within its jurisdiction and to issue subpoenas for persons and papers. (Rule XXVI, paragraph 1). Witnesses selected by the minority. During hearings on any measure or matter, the minority shall be allowed to select witnesses to testify on at least one day, when the chair receives such a request from a majority of the minority party members. This provision does not apply to the Appropriations Committee. (Rule XXVI, paragraph 4(d)). Reporting. Senate committees may report original bills and resolutions, in addition to those that have been referred to the panel. As stated in the quorum requirement, a majority of the committee must be physically present for a measure or matter to be reported. Also, a majority of those present are required to order a measure or matter reported. A Senate Committee is not required to issue a written report to accompany a measure or matter it reports; if the committee does write such a report, Senate rules specify a series of required elements that must be included in the report.

The Armed Services Committee chose both Tuesday and Thursday. Two committees, Appropriations and Select Aging, meet at the call of the chair. Within those categories, some committees, including the Armed Services; Foreign Relations; Indian Affairs; and Judiciary provide for meeting at least once a week. The other committees set the meetings at once or twice a month."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hearing Notice Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Committees must, according to Senate Rules, provide one week's notice of their hearings.

The rules of the Armed Services Committee, for example, say it is the decision of the committee as a whole.", "Three committees, Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; and Finance give the chair of the panel the authority to schedule a hearing with less than a week's notice.", "Six committees require some type of cooperation between the chair and ranking member of the committee to meet with less than a week's notice. Four of those committees, Budget; Environment and Public Works; Judiciary; and Special Aging, require the chair to obtain the agreement of the ranking member to make the decision to hold a hearing with less than usual notice.

The Foreign Relations Committee minority may request an equal number of witnesses as the majority, and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee allows for an equal number of witnesses for the majority and minority unless there is to be just one administration witness. Similarly, if the Senate is evenly divided, the Budget Committee provides for equal numbers of witnesses for the majority and minority, with the same exception for a single administration witness.", "The Ethics and Select Intelligence committees' rules have provisions according an opportunity for an individual to testify before the committee if that person believes his or her reputation is at issue or if his or her name came up in previous testimony."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hearing Quorum", "paragraphs": ["For receiving testimony at hearings, most Senate committees reduce their quorum requirement to one or sometimes two Senators.

For the conduct of business, the requirement that a member of the minority be present is a common feature of committee quorum rules. In order to report out a measure, Senate rules require that a majority of the committee be physically present. A dozen committees feature some kind of minority attendance requirement for the conduct of business during a committee business meeting (see Table 2 ). The Environment and Public Works Committee's business quorum requires two members of the minority and one-third of the committee in total. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and Small Business and Entrepreneurship committees require the presence of one member of the minority, as do the Veterans' Affairs and Special Aging committees. The Veterans' Affairs Committee rules also contain a provision designed to make sure that the lack of a minority member cannot indefinitely delay action on a measure or matter.", "The Finance Committee requires one member from the majority and one member of the minority for its business quorum as do the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Foreign Relations and Ethics committees. The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee requires that any business quorum that is less than a majority of the committee include a member of the minority. The Armed Services Committee sets a business quorum at nine members, which must include a member of the minority party, but the committee may bypass the minority representation requirement if a simple majority of the committee is present.

It also provides an opportunity to Senators to draft second degree amendments to possible first degree amendments before the markup begins.", "The Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and Small Business and Entrepreneurship committees call for submitting such amendments two business days before the markup, if sufficient notice of the markup has been given.", "The Appropriations; Environment and Public Works; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; and Veterans' Affairs committees require 24 hours notice of first degree amendments.

Five committees have general provisions for polling in their rules: Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Budget; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; Homeland Security and Government Affairs; and Aging. Of those, all the committees except the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, allow a member to request that the matter being polled be formally voted on by the committee at the next business meeting.
