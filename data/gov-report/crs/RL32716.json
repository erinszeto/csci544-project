The statute also contains detailed due process provisions to ensure the provision of FAPE.

The 108 th Congress completed another wide-ranging reauthorization of IDEA. The following is a brief legislative history:", "On April 30, 2003, House passed H.R. 1350 by a vote of 251 to 171.

P.L. 108-446 links its definition to the definition of \"highly qualified\" in Section 9101(23) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) but modifies that definition as it applies to special education teachers. Most notably, it addresses concerns that have been raised about certain groups of special education teachers, such as those who teach more than one \"core academic subject.\"", "The ESEA definition of \"highly qualified\" applies only to teachers of core academic subjects and differentiates between new and veteran teachers and between those teaching at the elementary level and above the elementary level. Thus, under ESEA, the \"highly qualified\" definition applies only to those special education teachers who teach core subjects (although this is probably most special education teachers).", "P.L. 108-446 provides additional requirements and options to the definition with respect to special education teachers. (See Table 1 below for a summary of these requirements.) First of all, to be highly qualified under IDEA, all special education teachers (whether they teach core subjects or not) must hold at least a bachelor's degree and must obtain full state special education certification or equivalent licensure (\u00a7602(10)(B)). Special education teachers who have emergency, temporary, or provisional certification do not meet the IDEA definition. In addition, P.L. 108-446 modifies the ESEA requirements with respect to two groups of special education teachers: those who teach only the most severely disabled children and those who teach more than one core subject . (If the teachers in these two groups meet the IDEA criteria, they are considered to have met the ESEA requirements.)", "Both new and veteran special education teachers who teach core subjects exclusively to children with disabilities who are assessed against alternative achievement standards under ESEA can, of course, meet the definition of highly qualified by meeting their applicable ESEA standards. Alternatively, new and veteran teachers of these severely cognitive disabled students at the elementary level may meet the \"highly qualified\" definition by demonstrating \"competence in all the academic subjects in which the teacher teaches based on a high objective uniform State standard of evaluation\" (often referred to as HOUSSE). Teachers of these students at levels above elementary school can meet the definition by demonstrating \"subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction ... as determined by the State, needed to effectively teach to those standards [i.e., alternative achievement standards]\" (\u00a7602(10)(C)(ii)).", "New and veteran special education teachers who teach two or more core subjects exclusively to children with disabilities may qualify as highly qualified by meeting the requirements in each core subject taught under applicable ESEA provisions. Alternatively veteran special education teachers teaching two or more core subjects may also qualify as highly qualified based on the ESEA HOUSSE option (\u00a7602(10)(D)(ii)), which may include a single evaluation covering multiple subjects. Finally, newly hired special education teachers teaching two or more core subjects who are already highly qualified in mathematics, language arts, or science are given two years from the date of employment to meet the highly qualified definition with respect to the other core subjects taught through the HOUSSE option (\u00a7602(10)(D)(iii)). This two-year window is the only exception to the deadline, explicitly applied to special education teachers, for meeting the \"highly qualified\" definition under either IDEA or ESEA, which is the end of school year 2005-2006 (ESEA, Section 1119(a)(2)).", "Regarding other classifications of special education teachers, one can infer that those who do not teach core subjects would meet the IDEA definition if they meet the IDEA criteria for all special education teachers (full certification and at least a bachelor's degree). With respect to special education teachers who provide only consultative services to other teachers, the Conference Report observes that:", "a special education teacher who provides only consultative services to a highly qualified teacher ... should be considered a highly qualified special education teacher if such teacher meets the requirements of Section 602(10)(A).... Such consultative services do not include instruction in core academic subjects, but may include adjustments to the learning environment, modifications of instructional methods, adaptation of curricula, the use of positive behavioral supports and interventions, or the use of appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of individuals children.", "The apparent intent is that consultative teachers who do not provide direct instruction in a core subject need only meet the requirements of having obtained at least a baccalaureate degree and be fully state certified as a special education teacher.", "Other special education teachers who teach only one core subject would appear to have to meet the relevant criteria under the ESEA definition (in addition to the overarching IDEA certification and degree criteria) and would then also be considered highly qualified under IDEA.

In the latter situation, the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the LEA unless a hearing officer or a court makes certain findings. However, IDEA does require some services for children in private schools, even if they are unilaterally placed there by their parents. Exactly what these services are or should be has been a contentious subject for many years. The 1997 reauthorization of IDEA expanded on the private school provisions, and the 2004 reauthorization includes several changes to the provisions relating to children who are placed in private school by their parents.

The first is that the funds expended by the LEA, including direct services to parentally placed private school children, shall be equal to a proportionate amount of federal funds made available under part B of IDEA.

The IDEA infants and toddlers program has parallels with the provisions and requirements of Part B; however, these provisions and requirements differ in important respects from those of Part B because this disabled population differs in significant ways from the mainly school-aged population served under Part B. For example, while Part B eligibility is based on categories of disabilities (\u00a7602(3)), eligibility for Part C programs is often based on a diagnosis of \"development delay\" that requires early intervention services (\u00a7632(5). Instead of an IEP, Part C programs have individualized family service plans (IFSPs) (\u00a7636), in recognition that services must be provided to the family as well as to the infant or toddler. Because infants and toddlers are served in a variety of locations (including the home), Part C services are to be provided in \"natural environments in which children without disabilities participate\" (\u00a7632(4)(G)) \"to the maximum extent appropriate\" (\u00a7635(a)(16)(A)).", "P.L. 108-446 maintains the overall purposes and structure of Part C with some additions and revisions.
