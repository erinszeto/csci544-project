Environmental groups, seven states, and the District of Columbia intervened in defense of the rule. Before any court could address the merits of the claims, however, an impasse arose over what court was the proper forum for the litigation. Whereas some plaintiffs filed suit in federal district courts, others argued that a judicial-review provision in Section 509 of the Clean Water Act gave the U.S. circuit courts of appeals direct appellate-level review over challenges to the Clean Water Rule.", "At the district court level, some courts dismissed their suits, concluding that the courts of appeals had exclusive jurisdiction. But one district court\u2014the District Court for the District of North Dakota (District of North Dakota)\u2014ruled that it had jurisdiction to review the Clean Water Rule. In August 2015, the District of North Dakota concluded that the rule was likely to be struck down on the merits, and it granted a motion for preliminary injunction, temporarily barring the Clean Water Rule's implementation in 13 western states.

In the consolidated, appellate-level litigation, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the agencies should not apply the Clean Water Rule during the pendency of the legal challenges, and it issued a nationwide stay of the rule. The Sixth Circuit also concluded that it\u2014and not the district courts\u2014had exclusive jurisdiction over the challenges to the Clean Water Rule, setting the stage for the Supreme Court to address the threshold question of which court or courts possess jurisdiction to hear the Clean Water Rule cases.

Department of Defense , the Supreme Court disagreed with the Sixth Circuit and concluded that the Clean Water Act did not provide direct appellate-level jurisdiction over the pending cases. Section 509 of the Clean Water Act lists seven categories of agency actions subject to direct appellate review, Justice Sotomayor explained in an opinion for the unanimous Court, but a legal challenge to a rule defining \"waters of the United States\" does not fall within those categories. \"Congress has made clear that rules like the [Clean Water] Rule must be reviewed first in federal district court[,]\" the Court concluded.", "While NAM resolved the threshold question of which courts can hear challenges to the Clean Water Rule, it did not address the merits of the challenges themselves.

Prior to NAM , the Sixth Circuit's nationwide stay of the Clean Water Rule prevented EPA and the Corps from applying the Clean Water Rule anywhere in the United States. But after NAM concluded that challenges to the rule must begin in federal district courts, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the consolidated appellate-level challenges and vacated its stay. With no nationwide stay in place and with the step-one repeal rule still in proposed form, the Clean Water Rule could have reverted into effect in states that were not subject to a district court injunction.

In late 2018, two federal district courts determined that EPA and the Corps did not comply with administrative rulemaking requirements in promulgating the Applicability Date Rule. By declining to consider comments on the substantive merits of the pre-Clean Water Rule regulations, the agencies deprived the public of a \"meaningful opportunity\" to comment on the Applicability Date Rule in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the courts held.
