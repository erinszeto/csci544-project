Bankruptcy is often said to provide debtors with a \"fresh start,\" eliminating their debts and allowing them to move forward. However, some debts cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. To the extent that debts cannot be discharged, debtors may be hindered in their quest for a fresh start. Although Section 523 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the U.S. Code) provides an extensive list of debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, there are other debts whose discharge in bankruptcy is either limited or prohibited under legislation not codified in Title 11 of the United States Code.", "This report provides a table of statutory limitations on discharge in bankruptcy that are not included in the Bankruptcy Code. Many of the limitations prohibit discharge of the obligation when the bankruptcy discharge order is entered into within a particular time period (frequently five years) after an event that triggered the repayment obligation, with many of them including the further condition that the court must also find that it would be unconscionable to not discharge the debt. However, four provisions prohibit discharge in bankruptcy at any time. Although most limitations and outright prohibitions on discharge in bankruptcy involve debts owed to the United States, support obligations that have been assigned to a state or municipality are debts whose discharge is completely prohibited.", "In the 111th Congress, at least two bills have been introduced that include limitations on discharge of debts in bankruptcy but do not amend the Bankruptcy Code to include those limits.

H.R. 4364, the Citizen Participation Act of 2009, would prohibit discharge in bankruptcy for certain court-awarded fees or costs.

This search produced 2,235 results, the majority of which were within Title 11. Initially, it appeared that all provisions outside the Bankruptcy Code were related to either the military or intelligence communities.

Reviewing those results identified specific language pertaining to the effect of bankruptcy on particular types of indebtedness. Three more focused searches were performed and revealed ten additional provisions outside the Bankruptcy Code. Five were found using \"bankruptcy or 'title 11' and discharge w/s 'not release'\"; four were found using \"bankruptcy or 'title 11' w/s nondischarge\"; one was found using \"bankruptcy or 'title 11' w/s released w/s 'no obligation.'\" These searches produced results in three additional titles of the U.S. Code: Titles 20 (Education), 25 (Indians), and 47 (Telegraphs, Telephones, and Radiotelegraphs).", "These search strategies revealed 53 instances outside of title 11 in which the U.S. Code limits the effect of bankruptcy on discharge of indebtedness.
