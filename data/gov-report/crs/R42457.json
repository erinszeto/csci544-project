The material may then be produced in tangible, printed form, but is with greater frequency distributed by electronic means via website or other electronic dissemination technology, and retained for archival purposes in searchable electronic databases. In many cases, born digital material that previously appeared only in paper form is available only in digital form. In other cases, digital information, including websites, blogs, datasets, and audio or video content, is not intended for tangible distribution. Some materials are available in both tangible and digital forms.", "The transition to digital information raises a number of issues that may be of interest to Congress. Some of the possible concerns focus on access to government information in an environment in which tangible and digital materials are available, and issues related to the security and authentication of digital materials.

This is due in part to the highly decentralized manner in which materials are stored and accessed, differences in the ways depository libraries might track collection use, and the lack of requirements to develop and maintain utilization metrics. There are some suggestions that parts of the collection might be underutilized, due to the lack of cataloging information for much of the collection distributed prior to 1976, when GPO began creating cataloging information. Others suggest that some materials that are cataloged and available receive little use. On the other hand, it has been suggested that some tangible items that had not been used were more frequently accessed when made available online. In the absence of any systematic inquiry, it cannot be determined whether the lack of utilization is the result of minimal demand, lack of catalogue information for some materials in the FDLP collection, or inadequate communication of the collection's availability.", "As seen in the ASERL proposals, some depository libraries see opportunities to digitize tangible FDLP collections to ensure their preservation and to make them more available to users who are better able to access the materials online than to visit libraries. Such efforts might provide broader access to the public, assuming that technological infrastructure is in place to ensure sufficient access to the Internet. Provision of digital government information in digital form could reduce the costs of maintaining a tangible collection, or provide the opportunity to reduce the number of copies of tangible government publications held by depository libraries through consolidation of collections. On the other hand, as discussed in more detail below, there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient number of paper copies. Further, it is possible that the costs of ongoing maintenance and technology upgrades necessary to support digitized materials could be higher than the current costs to maintain tangible collections.

Nevertheless, the question of how to retain and preserve government information contained in tangible form alone, and to provide access to that information to all who wish to see it, raises a number of questions.

With regard to preservation, it would be necessary to have a more fully cataloged FDLP collection to be able to determine what the preservation requirements are.", "On questions about the number of tangible copies to be retained permanently, there is little consensus. Some studies note the opportunities to consolidate collections to free up storage space, and potentially reduce costs, while still ensuring that library users' needs are met. Others cite a lack of data to demonstrate how many copies might be needed to meet those needs. The ASERL plan calls for the development of two complete sets for the use of libraries within the southeast region. Another proposal calls for the creation by GPO of two national retrospective collections, to be housed separately in secure facilities. One study, focusing not on government documents, but on the number of copies of scholarly journals in academic settings that must be retained in print form to ensure enduring access, ranges from as few as 6 to as many as 96 copies, depending on the manner of storage and the time period during which the materials are expected to be available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tangible Digitization", "paragraphs": ["A number of questions related to the retention and preservation of digitized materials are similar to issues that arise in the consideration of born digital materials, and are discussed in more detail in \" Retention and Preservation of Born Digital Information ,\" below.

For example, whereas tangible items are produced and distributed through FDLP, born digital materials may be accessible through the FDLP Electronic Collection, or available only through federal executive branch agency websites, or the websites of GPO content partners. This may have implications for the systematic collection and cataloging of materials, or, as just mentioned, public access to them. Born digital materials\u2014such as databases, websites, and publications\u2014may also be dynamic, and their content more readily changed than tangible materials.

The potential consequences of format obsolescence, media failure resulting in data loss, and the challenges of migrating government information to newer formats or storage solutions appear to be incompletely addressed by those who create information technology systems, government agencies that create and distribute information, information professionals who curate and preserve those materials, and users who may rely on contemporary and historical government information in digital formats.

Whereas the costs of tangible support rest largely with depository libraries, the costs of providing digital materials, including storage of digital materials, Web development, maintenance, and upgrades, fall on GPO for FDSys and other entities that provide content through the FDLP Electronic Collection. Over time, the costs of digital delivery could require additional appropriations for GPO and other federal content providers, or force those agencies to revaluate service levels in a hybrid system of tangible and digital delivery.

The somewhat vague language could also lead to differences by agency in the type of materials that get into FDLP collections. In addition, there is no clear link to which digital material should be included in FDLP collections; The extent to which there is a need to expand the current institutional model of FDLP beyond regional and selective libraries. Information management is a more specialized activity now than when the current version of FDLP was established. Activities that might be of benefit to the program could include curatorial services, tangible preservation or digitization, information integrity assurance (e.g., digital signatures or other authentication schemes), and the cataloging of older tangible materials.
