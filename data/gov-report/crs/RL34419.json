The President's budget predicted a deficit of $407 billion for FY2008 and $410 billion for FY2009, up from $162 billion in FY2007. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the FY2008 deficit would total $396 billion if the President's proposals were enacted, about $39 billion more than the current-law baseline. CBO projected that the President's proposals would generate a FY2009 deficit of $342 billion. Tax rebates and business investment incentives enacted in the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-185), which passed in January, will push up the FY2008 deficit by an estimated $152 billion. CBO estimated the on-budget deficit, which excludes Social Security surpluses, for the President's budget proposals would reach $592 billion in FY2008 and $525 billion in FY2009. Budget and economic estimates issued later in 2008 have been less optimistic.", "In February, the Administration foresaw a steady improvement in federal finances, including a surplus of $29 billion in FY2013, the last year projected. The FY2013 on-budget deficit was projected at $201 billion. These projections omitted costs of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq beyond FY2008 aside from a $70 billion supplemental request. Federal deficits are projected to rise rapidly after FY2020. Major Administration proposals include extending expiring tax cuts, limiting domestic discretionary spending, and halting the expanding reach of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for calendar 2008, but not for later years. Medicare and Medicaid were expected to grow more slowly than in recent years.", "The FY2009 budget also discusses long-term fiscal problems. According to longer-term projections from the Administration, CBO, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the impending retirement of the baby boom generation and rising health care costs will substantially expand spending on Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid over the coming decades. The long-term growth of outlays, if left unchanged or if not offset by new revenues, could overwhelm the government's ability to finance its obligations.", "September 2008 CBO baseline projections, which incorporate costs of the Economic Stimulus Act and legislation affecting housing policy, veterans' benefits, and unemployment benefits, show a $407 billion deficit in FY2008, a $147 billion deficit in FY2013, and a $135 billion deficit in FY2018. CBO baseline projections assume that key tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 (as well as some others) expire as scheduled, real discretionary spending is fixed, and the AMT is unchanged.", "On March 7, 2008, the House and Senate Budget Committees introduced budget resolutions (S.Con.Res. 70 and H.Con.Res. 312).

Early in 2008, CBO predicted that economic growth would slow in calendar year 2008 and recover in 2009. The President's budget acknowledged economic challenges, but predicted strong growth in both 2008 and 2009. Over the course of 2008, the economy weakened according to many measures such as employment, although other measures such as economic growth and household consumption did not slow as much as some had expected. As a result of the deepening of the economic slowdown, OMB and CBO in summer 2008 adjusted forecasts of revenues downwards and outlays upwards. CBO's September 2008 baseline estimate for FY2009 revenues ($2.817 trillion) was $97 billion below its January figure ($2.720 trillion), while the September baseline estimate for outlays ($3.158 trillion) was $143 billion above the January estimate ($3.015 trillion)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Outlays and Budget Authority", "paragraphs": ["Spending in Table 1 is shown in terms of outlays, which are federal funds disbursed in a given time period.

Budget authority has been compared to funds deposited into a checking account, which then can be used for federal purposes. Outlay data are more convenient for assessing the macroeconomic effects of the federal budgets, while analysts focusing on specific federal programs typically rely on budget authority figures. Appropriations legislation is generally framed in terms of budget authority, because Congress can control the amount of funds made available for specific purposes. The timing of federal outlays, on the other hand, often depends on administrative decisions of federal program officials, made within bounds set by Congress.

This report projected a FY2009 current-law baseline deficit of $198 billion, up slightly from the FY2007 deficit of $162 billion. This projection, however, assumed that AMT relief would lapse and that the FY2009 costs of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would be a little less than costs in FY2008. That CBO baseline projection showed a surplus of $87 billion emerging in FY2012 that was expected to rise to $223 billion in FY2018.", "CBO baseline projections are computed using certain assumptions set by law. These assumptions typically yield higher revenue estimates and projections of slower growth of discretionary spending relative to scenarios that independent forecasters consider likely. Three key assumptions incorporated in CBO baseline projections are that discretionary spending remains constant in inflation-adjusted terms; the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts fully expire after 2010 (as current law specifies); and the \"patch\" to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which currently applies to tax year 2007, would lapse. After 2010, when most of the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 expire, according to baseline projections, receipts grow substantially. The assumption that these tax cuts expire and that growth in discretionary spending is zero in real terms explains most of the declining deficit and the surpluses that emerge over the 10-year baseline forecast window. Nonetheless, unless major policy changes are made, federal deficits are expected to grow rapidly beyond the 10-year forecast window, largely because of rapidly growing health care costs and the retirement of the baby boomers.", "CBO's January report also included estimated budgetary effects of selected policies on revenues and outlays. These included estimates of the costs of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent and indexing the AMT for inflation to limit its expanding coverage. CBO also presented projections based on assumptions that differ from current-law baseline assumptions. One alternate projection assumed that discretionary appropriations increase at the rate of growth of gross domestic product (GDP), which leads to faster growth of outlays relative to the baseline. Another alternative projection assumed that total discretionary appropriations would be frozen at FY2008 levels, yielding slower growth in outlays relative to the baseline.", "Estimated cost savings for troop reductions are also reported: reducing troops deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other Global War on Terror postings to 75,000 by FY2013 would reduce outlays (including borrowing costs) by $250 billion over the FY2009-FY2013 period relative to baseline levels.", "In February 2008, CBO issued an update of its economic projections due to new evidence of slower economic activity, interest rate cuts and other actions taken by the Federal Reserve, and the economic stimulus package. The revised estimates showed slightly faster economic growth in FY2008 due to fiscal stimulus measures, but slightly slower growth in FY2009, when those measures lapse.

For example, funding for military operations after FY2009 is omitted for budgetary scoring purposes. Projected future outlays would be far higher were these war costs included in projections. These proposals also all assume a sharply larger portion of middle-income taxpayers will become subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) after calendar 2007, even though in recent years Congress and the President have agreed to annual fixes to limit the AMT's reach.

CBO routinely provides a breakdown of economic, legislative, and technical factors responsible for divergences between past forecasts and actual outcomes. The FY2009 budget documents contain an OMB analysis of the divergence between the Administration's February 2006 budget estimates and actual results for FY2007. Differences are decomposed into (1) legislative and administrative changes, (2) changed economic conditions, and (3) technical factors.", "Budget estimates depend in part on some stable trends, such as population demographics. For instance, many baby boomers will retire in the next decade, leading to higher spending for Medicare and Social Security. Estimating the growth in these beneficiary populations eligible for these programs is relatively straightforward. Budget estimates also depend on factors that are difficult to predict, such as future productivity growth and business cycles. Some factors that effect federal revenues, such as financial market trends, can be extremely volatile.", "Small changes in economic conditions, such as GDP growth, can produce large changes in the budget estimates. According to CBO estimates, a persistent 0.1% decrease in the real GDP growth rate would increase a deficit, including interest costs, by $61 billion cumulatively over a 5-year period and by $273 billion over 10 years. Faster GDP growth would decrease deficits. In addition, new government policies also affect budget estimates.

Most forecasters try to produce projections that are both unbiased and accurate, as far as possible.", "The President's FY2009 budget includes measures that can be used to assess the accuracy and statistical bias of previous forecasts. The accuracy of forecasts generally declines as the forecast window extends to later years because more policy and economic changes can occur in the interim.
