In addition, provisions in P.L. 111-117 altered school eligibility criteria to receive SIG to include any school eligible to receive assistance under Title I-A that has not made adequate yearly progress (AYP) for at least two years or is in the state's lowest quintile of performance based on proficiency rates or, for secondary schools, includes any school with a graduation rate below 60%. The FY2011 ( P.L. 112-10 ) and FY2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ) appropriations acts included the same provisions relevant to the identification of schools for SIG funds and changes to the maximum amount that can be awarded to a school. Schools that are eligible for SIG as a result of the new criteria included in the appropriations acts are referred to as \"newly eligible schools.\" In addition to the aforementioned provisions, the FY2012 appropriations act also included a provision permitting the Secretary of Education to reserve up to 5% of the funds appropriated for SIG to carry out activities to build SEA and LEA capacity to implement the SIG program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Part A: Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Title I, Part A, of the ESEA authorizes federal aid to local educational agencies (LEAs) for the education of disadvantaged children. Title I-A grants provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending pre-kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. It has also become a \"vehicle\" to which a number of requirements affecting broad aspects of public K-12 education for all students have been attached as a condition for receiving Title I-A grants.", "Title I-A funds are allocated by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to state educational agencies (SEAs), which then suballocate grants to LEAs. It is one of the few federal K-12 formula grant programs for which substate grants are, in most cases, calculated by ED. Portions of each annual appropriation for Title I-A are allocated under four different formulas\u2014Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and Education Finance Incentive Grants\u2014although funds allocated under all of these formulas are combined and used for the same purposes by recipient LEAs. Although the allocation formulas have several distinctive elements, the primary factors used in all four formulas are estimated numbers of children aged 5-17 in poor families plus a state expenditure factor based on average expenditures per pupil for public K-12 education. Other factors included in one or more formulas include weighting schemes designed to increase aid to LEAs with the highest concentrations of poverty, and a factor to increase grants to states with high levels of expenditure equity among their LEAs. Each formula also has a LEA hold harmless provision (no LEA may receive less than 85-95% of its previous year grant, depending on the LEA's poverty rate) and a state minimum grant provision (up to either 0.25% or 0.35% of state grants, depending on the formula).", "Within LEAs, Title I-A funds are used to provide supplementary educational services to students at public schools with the highest percentages or numbers of children from low-income families, as well as eligible students who live in the areas served by these public schools, but who attend private schools. While there are several program rules related to school selection, the participating schools must generally have a percentage or number of children from low-income families that is greater than the LEA's average. LEAs can generally choose to focus Title I-A services on selected grade levels (e.g., only in elementary schools), but they must usually provide services in all schools, without regard to their grade level, where the percentage of students from low-income families exceeds 75%. Once schools are selected, Title I-A funds are allocated among them on the basis of their number of students from low-income families.", "There are two basic types of Title I-A programs. Schoolwide programs are authorized if the percentage of low-income students served by a school is 40% or higher. In schoolwide programs, Title I-A funds may be used to improve the performance of all students in a school. For example, funds might be used to provide professional development services to all of a school's teachers, upgrade instructional technology, or implement new curricula. The other major type of Title I-A school service model is the targeted assistance program (TAP). This was the original type of Title I-A program, under which Title I-A-funded services are generally limited to the lowest achieving students in the school. For example, students may be \"pulled out\" of their regular classroom for several hours of more intensive instruction by a specialist teacher each week, or they may receive such instruction in an after-school program, or funds may be used to hire a teacher's aide who provides additional assistance to low achieving students in their regular classroom. ", "A number of major accountability requirements apply to public schools in a state that participates in the Title I-A program. Participating states must administer annual, standards-based assessments in reading/language arts and mathematics to students in each of grades 3-8, plus at least once in grades 10-12. Beginning with the 2007-2008 school year, such assessments must also be administered to students in each of three grade levels (3-5, 6-9, and 10-12) in science. Student performance standards for all required assessments must include at least three performance levels: advanced, proficient, and basic. The state assessments must meet a variety of criteria regarding accommodations for students with disabilities and LEP students, and linkages between state content standards, student performance standards, and assessments. Participating states must also administer annual assessments of English language proficiency to all of their LEP students, and participate in National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests of 4 th and 8 th grade students in reading and math every two years.", "States must develop annual measurable objectives (AMOs) that are established separately for reading and mathematics assessments, are the same for all schools and LEAs, identify a single minimum percentage of students who must meet or exceed the proficient level on the assessments that applies to the all students group and each subgroup for which data are disaggregated, and must ensure that all students will meet or exceed the state's proficient level of achievement on the assessments based on a timeline established by the state. The timeline must incorporate concrete movement toward meeting an ultimate goal of all students reaching a proficient or higher level of achievement by the end of the 2013-2014 school year. ", "States participating in Title I-A must use results of the required reading and math assessments to make annual adequate yearly progress determinations. AYP standards must be applied to all public schools, LEAs, and to states overall. However, under the ESEA, consequences for failing to meet AYP standards need only be applied to schools and LEAs participating in Title I-A, and consequences for states as a whole are limited to potential identification and provision of technical assistance. AYP is defined primarily on the basis of the percentage of students scoring at a proficient or higher level of achievement. AYP standards must also include at least one additional academic indicator; in the case of high schools, this must be the graduation rate.", "AYP calculations must be disaggregated\u2014that is, determined separately for several demographic groups, as well as for an \"all students\" group. The specified groups include economically disadvantaged students, LEP students, students with disabilities, and students in major racial and ethnic groups. However, student groups need not be considered if their number is so small that results would not be statistically significant or the identity of students might be divulged (minimum group size). In order to make AYP, at least 95% of students overall and 95% of each demographic group must participate in assessments. Schools or LEAs meet AYP standards only if they meet the required threshold levels of performance on assessments, other academic indicators, and test participation with respect to all of the designated student groups that meet the minimum group size criterion selected by the state. The primary structure for AYP determination under the ESEA applies the same required threshold level of achievement to all students and schools statewide (a \"status\" model). The ESEA also includes a \"safe harbor\" provision, under which AYP may be met by a student group if it experiences a 10% reduction, compared to the previous year, in the number of students below proficiency. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using \"growth\" models to determine AYP, by which the achievement of individual students is tracked from year to year. Interested states may apply to receive a waiver from the Secretary of Education (hereinafter referred to as the Secretary) to implement a growth model.", "The ESEA requires states to identify LEAs and schools that fail to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years for improvement. Students attending these schools must be provided with options to attend other public schools that make AYP. If a Title I-A school fails to meet AYP standards for a third year, students from low-income families must be offered the opportunity to receive instruction from a supplemental educational services (SES) provider of their choice. One or more additional \"corrective actions,\" such as implementing a new curriculum, must be taken with respect to Title I-A schools that fail to meet AYP for a fourth year. Those that fail to meet AYP standards for a sixth year must develop a \"restructuring\" plan, involving such actions as reopening as a charter school. If a school fails to make AYP for a subsequent year, the school must implement its restructuring plan. Procedures analogous to those for schools apply to LEAs that receive Title I-A grants and fail to meet AYP requirements.", "Finally, states participating in Title I-A are required to provide that all public school teachers in core subjects are \"highly qualified.\" In order to be deemed a highly qualified teacher (HQT), all such public school teachers must hold at least a bachelor's degree, have obtained full state certification or passed the state teacher licensing examination, and must hold a license to teach. In addition, teachers who are new to the profession must demonstrate subject area knowledge, including (if teaching at a secondary level) passing a state academic test or completing an academic major, graduate degree, or advanced certification in each subject taught. A public school teacher who is not new to the profession may also be deemed to be \"highly qualified\" by demonstrating competence in all subjects taught \"based on a high objective uniform State standard of evaluation\" (HOUSSE). Further, paraprofessionals (aides) providing instruction in Title I-A programs must have either: (a) completed at least two years of higher education; or (b) earned an associate's (or higher) degree; or (c) met a \"rigorous standard of quality.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Part B: Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants", "paragraphs": ["Subpart 1 of Title I-B authorizes the Reading First program.
