In FY2018, Congress provided $8.7 billion for global health programs through State, Foreign Operations appropriations and $488.6 million through Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education (Labor-HHS) appropriations. These funds are managed by several U.S. agencies and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund)\u2014a multilateral organization aimed at combating the three diseases worldwide. Concern about infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria (HTAM), continues to drive budget growth. In FY2001, roughly 47% of the U.S. global health budget was aimed at these three diseases. By FY2018, almost 75% of U.S. global health funding was provided for fighting HTAM. The Appendix outlines U.S. funding for global health by agency and program. The 115th Congress may debate several pressing global health issues, including the following:", "Strengthening Health Systems. The global spread of recent disease outbreaks, including Ebola and Zika, has intensified debates about the advantages and disadvantages of disease-specific funding. Congressional interest in bolstering weak health systems was particularly strong during the Ebola outbreak. Congressional discussions about health system strengthening have been waning, though some interest remains, including in proposed legislation (see for example H.Res. 342, 115th Congress). Bolstering Pandemic Preparedness. Since 1980, infectious diseases have caused outbreaks that have been occurring with greater frequency and have been leading to higher numbers of human infections. Outbreaks caused by diseases that were once concentrated in tropical regions, including Ebola and Zika, are spreading through international travel. At the same time, long-standing diseases like tuberculosis and malaria are becoming increasingly resistant to available drugs and also threaten global health.", "The United States has been a key supporter in global efforts to bolster pandemic preparedness in low- and middle- income countries. It is unclear whether the 115th Congress will sustain high levels of supports, including through funding, for global health security efforts. In its report on H.R. 5515, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, the House Committee on Armed Services directed the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the Department of Health and Human Services, to develop an action plan to counter emerging infectious disease threats.", "Considering the FY2019 Budget Request. The 115th Congress is considering the FY2019 budget request, which includes over $7 billion for global health assistance, roughly 24% less than FY2018 enacted levels. The Trump Administration proposes reducing the USAID global health budget by nearly 40% through the elimination of funding for global health security, vulnerable children, and HIV/AIDS programs and reductions to other health programs. The Trump Administration also recommended cuts for PEPFAR programs managed by the State Department (-11%), the Global Fund (-31%), and CDC global health programs (-16%). Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance. In 1984, former President Ronald Reagan issued what has become known as the \"Mexico City policy,\" which required foreign nongovernmental organizations receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, even if such activities were conducted with non-U.S. funds. The policy has been rescinded and reinstituted across Administrations. Under the Trump Administration, the policy was reinstated, renamed to Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA), and expanded to apply to all global health programs.", "Global health experts are working to measure the impact of the PLGHA policy. Opponents maintain that the policy imperils all global health programs because some health providers may not be able to disentangle FP/RH, HIV/AIDS, and maternal and child health services from one another, particularly in areas with limited access to health workers and facilities. Supporters maintain that although existing laws ban U.S. funds from being used to perform or promote abortions abroad, money is fungible and the PLGHA policy closes loopholes. Since the Mexico City Policy was first established, Members on both sides of the issue have introduced legislation to permanently enact or repeal the policy (for example, see H.R. 671 and S. 210, Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights Act, 115th Congress).", "Authorizing the extension of PEPFAR. Legislation that authorizes appropriations for PEPFAR and describes congressional priorities for the initiative expires September 30, 2018. PEPFAR continues to receive bipartisan support and is being maintained by the Trump Administration, though at lower levels than previous administrations. Following the release of the FY2018 budget and Strategy, some HIV/AIDS advocates and Members of Congress questioned the Administration's commitment to controlling the global AIDS epidemic and expressed concern about whether people on ART would lose coverage due to spending cuts. The Administration has pledged to maintain the current level of antiretroviral treatment provided through PEPFAR", "Plans to maintain treatment levels are a departure from the Bush and Obama Administrations, under which executive and legislative priorities for PEPFAR included steadily increasing the number of people receiving ART through PEPFAR programs. Some Members of Congress have challenged the Trump Administration's approach to PEPFAR, raising questions about whether executive and legislative consensus around broadening the reach of PEPFAR and advancing the global goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation is fraying."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress has made global health a high priority for several years, with notable appropriations increases for global health during the George W. Bush Administration. During this period, global-health-related appropriations rose from less than $2 billion in FY2001 to almost $8 billion in FY2008 ( Figure 1 ). Much of the funding increases were provided to support programs, such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), which fought HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria (HTAM). Executive and legislative priorities in global health mostly aligned under the George W. Bush Administration. They largely remained so under the Obama Administration, though some debates emerged on more finite issues, such as the type of HIV/AIDS interventions to support and the extent to which the United States should support international family planning and reproductive health programs. It remains to be seen whether legislative and executive priorities will align under the Trump Administration. ", "While congressional support for global health remained steadfast throughout the Obama Administration, the great recession that began in 2008 slowed overall federal spending, and appropriations for global health programs became relatively stagnant. On average, Congress appropriated roughly $9 billion annually for global health throughout the Obama Administration. ", "U.S. support for global health has been motivated in large part by concern about emergent and reemerging infectious diseases. Following outbreaks of diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HIV/AIDS, and pandemic influenza, several Presidents highlighted the threats such diseases pose to economic development, stability, and security and launched a variety of health initiatives to address them. Congress demonstrated support for each initiative by meeting requested levels, and in some instances exceeded budget proposals. ", "In 1996, for example, President Bill Clinton issued a presidential decision directive that called infectious diseases a threat to domestic and international security, called for U.S. global health efforts to be coordinated with those aimed at counterterrorism, and established a health advisor on the National Security Council (NSC) for the first time. President Clinton later requested $100 million for the Leadership and Investment in Fighting an Epidemic (LIFE) Initiative in 1999 to expand U.S. global HIV/AIDS efforts. President George W. Bush recognized the impact of infectious diseases on domestic and global security in his 2002 and 2006 national security strategy papers and created a number of initiatives to address them, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005, and the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Program in 2006.", "President Barack Obama also recognized the risk of infectious diseases and made several statements about how their spread across developing countries might affect U.S. security. In the 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) and the 2010 National Security Strategy, the Obama Administration advocated for the coordination of global health programs in other areas, such as security, diplomacy, and development. Rather than create an initiative aimed at infectious diseases, President Obama announced the Global Health Initiative (GHI) in 2009 to improve the coordination and impact of U.S. global health efforts. Implementation of the initiative was short-lived, though efforts to deepen integration of global health programs continued throughout the Obama Administration.", "Prompted in part by the West Africa Ebola epidemic, the 115 th Congress has continued deliberating approaches for strengthening weak health systems while preserving congressional priorities for key global health programs like PEPFAR. The Ebola epidemic not only revealed the threat that weak health systems in developing countries pose to the world, but also exposed gaps in international frameworks for responding to global health crises. Consensus is emerging that health system strengthening is important for protecting advancements in global health and for bolstering international security, though debate abounds regarding the appropriate approach for achieving this goal, as well as identifying the role the United States might play in such efforts, especially in relation to other U.S. global health assistance priorities. ", "While legislative and executive commitment to global health remained strong during the Bush and Obama terms, the 115 th Congress and the Trump Administration appear to have prioritized funding for global health programs differently. In FY2018, for example, the Trump Administration proposed that funding for global health programs that year be cut by roughly $2.3 billion from FY2017 levels. The $6.8 billion FY2018 request included $6.5 billion for related efforts financed through State-Foreign Operations (SFOPS) appropriations and $0.3 billion for global health programs supported through Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education (Labor-HHS) appropriations. In response, Congress funded global health programs in excess of $2.3 billion of the FY2018 budget request in FY2018 and almost $100 million more than FY2017 levels. For FY2019, the Trump Administration again has sought to reduce U.S. global health spending by more than $2 billion from FY2018 levels. The $7.1 billion request includes $6.7 billion through SFOPS and $0.4 billion through Labor-HHS. Language in the congressional budget justifications (CBJ) for the State Department and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that the Trump Administration \"will continue to challenge the global community to devote resources and political commitments to building healthier, stronger, and more self-sufficient nations in the developing world.\" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Advancements in Global Health", "paragraphs": ["In 2015, the international community adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to continue progress achieved through the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

SDG3 includes 13 targets, such as reducing child and maternal mortality; ending epidemics of key communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria; and strengthening state capacity to manage national and global health risks through the achievement of universal health coverage.

WHO estimates that more than half of the 16,000 child deaths that occurred in each day of 2015 could have been avoided through low-cost interventions, such as medicines to treat pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria, as well as tools to prevent the transmission of malaria and HIV/AIDS from mother to child. Other factors, like inadequate access to nutritious food, also affect child health. WHO estimates that undernutrition contributes to roughly 45% of all child deaths.

The policy has been rescinded and reinstituted across Administrations. Under the Trump Administration, the policy was reinstated, renamed to Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA), and expanded to apply to all global health programs. ", "Global health experts are working to measure the impact of the PLGHA policy. Opponents maintain that the policy imperils all global health programs because some health providers may not be able to disentangle FP/RH, HIV/AIDS, and maternal and child health services from one another, particularly in areas with limited access to health workers and facilities. This integration of services was accelerated during the Obama Administration when NGOs were encouraged to colocate services in one facility, including contraceptive care, HIV/AIDS services, prenatal checkups, immunizations, and information or referrals on safe abortion. A number of global health experts wrote a letter to former Secretary of State Tillerson warning that the PLGHA policy could reduce access to reproductive health commodities and services that are unrelated to abortions. Some Members of Congress have agreed with those arguing that implementing PLGHA would reduce efficiencies, depress access to some health services, and worsen health outcomes in participating countries.", "Supporters of the policy maintain that although existing laws ban U.S. funds from being used to perform or promote abortions abroad, money is fungible and the PLGHA policy closes loopholes. The Trump Administration contends that \"the impact on those service providers is going to be minimal,\" and has committed to routinely \"capture, monitor, and use age- and sex- disaggregated data, by partner and by site, to track precisely whether and to what extent the policy has affected life-saving activities related to HIV/AIDS.\" ", "On February 6, 2018, the Department of State released a report entitled, Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Six-Month Review . The report indicated that as of September 30, 2017, \"three centrally funded prime partners and 12 sub-awardee implementing partners\" working with USAID declined funding due to the terms of the PLGHA policy. One implementing partner with the Department of Defense and no partners with the Department of Health and Human Services declined U.S. assistance. The Administration has agreed with observations that it is too early to determine any effects the policy will have on programming, and has committed to conduct another assessment in December 2018.", "Since the Mexico City Policy was first established, Members on both sides of the issue have introduced legislation to permanently enact or repeal the policy. In the 115 th Congress, H.R. 671 and S. 210 , Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights Act , would prohibit the application of the PLGHA to foreign NGOs.

PEPFAR continues to receive bipartisan support and is being maintained by the Trump Administration, though at lower levels than previous administrations. The first budget request from the Trump Administration, issued in early 2017, sought roughly $5 billion for global HIV/AIDS programs in FY2018 (about $1 billion less than FY2017 enacted levels), including $1.1 billion for a U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees disagreed with the budget proposal and recommended that HIV/AIDS funding levels in FY2018 remain mostly at FY2017 levels. ", "Following the release of the FY2018 budget and Strategy, some HIV/AIDS advocates and Members of Congress questioned the Administration's commitment to controlling the global AIDS epidemic and expressed concern about whether people on ART would lose coverage due to spending cuts. The Administration maintained that requested levels would enable PEPFAR to \"accelerate efforts toward achieving epidemic control in 13 high impact epidemic control countries.\" Outside of these countries, the Administration asserted that \"PEPFAR will maintain its current level of antiretroviral treatment through direct service delivery and expand both HIV prevention and treatment services, where possible, through increased performance and efficiency gains.\"", "The Trump Administration proposal to maintain treatment levels is a departure from the Bush and Obama Administrations, under which executive and legislative priorities for PEPFAR included steadily increasing the number of people receiving ART through PEPFAR programs. Some Members of Congress have challenged the Trump Administration's approach to PEPFAR, raising questions about whether executive and legislative consensus around broadening the reach of PEPFAR and advancing the global goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation is fraying. ", "The Oversight Act, the current iteration of PEPFAR authorizing legislation, neither includes performance targets nor specifies countries in which PEPFAR should operate, as previous authorizing legislation had. The lack of such details in the legislation may have suggested broad consensus at the time on PEPFAR priorities. Concerns expressed by some Members of Congress about Trump Administration priorities for PEPFAR may prompt new discussions about whether such details should be included in future authorization legislation. Key discussions about extending PEPFAR have centered around three key policy issues: performance targets, focus countries, and the Mexico City Policy. ", "Performance Targets. The Lantos-Hyde Act mandated that PEPFAR programs support ART for at least 4 million people by the end of FY2013. In 2011, President Obama announced that PEPFAR would help the world achieve the global target of an AIDS-free generation by helping 6 million people get on ART by the end of 2013\u20142 million more than originally planned. Congress did not include treatment targets in the Oversight Act, though President Obama steadily increased treatment goals throughout his tenure. Members concerned about plans announced by the Trump Administration to increase treatment levels in the 13 priority countries while maintaining treatment levels elsewhere might consider including treatment targets in authorizing legislation. Others may seek to maintain executive branch flexibility over determining treatment targets and program goals more broadly. ", "Focus Countries. The Leadership Act named 14 priority countries in which the bulk of PEPFAR resources were to be invested. The Lantos-Hyde Act later named Vietnam as the 15 th focus country. By the end of FY2013 (when authorization for funding PEPFAR was set to expire), roughly 86% of all bilateral PEPFAR resources were spent in these 15 countries. The Oversight Act did not identify countries where PEPFAR should concentrate its investments, though it defined a partner country as any country receiving at least $5 million from the U.S. government for HIV/AIDS assistance. The Trump Administration has proposed concentrating efforts in 13 countries (bolded countries are also among the 15 original focus countries): Botswana , Cote d'Ivoire , Haiti , Kenya , Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia , Rwanda , Swaziland, Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia , and Zimbabwe. In these countries, the Administration commits that PEPFAR will work with other partners to ensure that 95% of HIV-positive people know their status, 95% of those who know their status are on ART, and that 95% of those on treatment maintain suppressed viral loads for at least three years. These efforts, the Administration maintains, will lead to AIDS epidemic control. ", "Some observers criticized the strategy, asserting that it could lead to a resurgence of the epidemic, while others applauded the move and described the strategy as \"reassuring.\" Congress could consider evaluating where PEPFAR funding is concentrated and mandating which countries should be deemed priorities, as it had in the Leadership and Lantos-Hyde Acts. It might also consider identifying criteria for establishing a priority country. ", "Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance . It remains to be seen what impact, if any, the PLGHA policy may have on global HIV/AIDS programs. Debates about the possible effects of the PLGHA policy on PEPFAR programs mirror broader debates, as discussed above. In 2003, the Bush Administration exempted PEPFAR programs from the Mexico City Policy. Uncertainty about the impact of PLGHA on PEPFAR programs might prompt Congress to consider including language requiring regular monitoring, assessment, and reporting on the impact of the PLGHA policy in any PEPFAR reauthorizing legislation. Congress might also consider including exemption language in appropriations legislation or PEPFAR reauthorization legislation as well as developing standalone legislation that exempts PEPFAR or certain elements of PEPFAR from the policy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Outlook", "paragraphs": ["Despite ongoing debates about the utility or appropriate levels of foreign assistance, global health programs have, in general, continued to receive bipartisan support, possibly indicating that global health remains a congressional priority. While the international community has achieved significant gains in curbing preventable deaths, some experts are concerned about looming health challenges. In a growing number of countries, deaths and illness from noncommunicable diseases (like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease) are outnumbering fatalities and ailments from communicable diseases (like malaria and HIV/AIDS). Many middle-income countries like South Africa face dual epidemics of diseases associated with growing prosperity (diabetes) and persistent poverty (vaccine-preventable child deaths). In the absence of higher spending levels, bolstering health systems will likely gain greater importance in U.S. global health programs. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
