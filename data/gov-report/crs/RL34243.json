The President elevated global development as a third pillar of national security, with defense and diplomacy, as articulated in the U.S. National Security Strategy of 2002, and reiterated in 2006. At the same time that foreign aid is being recognized as playing an important role in U.S. foreign policy, it has also come under closer scrutiny by Congress, largely in response to a number of presidential initiatives, and by critics who argue that the U.S. foreign aid infrastructure is cumbersome and fragmented, and that aid policy is unfocused.", "In recent years, several initiatives have heightened congressional interest in, and caused a re-examination of, U.S. foreign assistance policy and programs, including organizational structure. In January 2006, Secretary of State Rice announced an initiative to bring coordination and coherence to U.S. aid programs. The Secretary created a new State Department position\u2014Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA)\u2014the occupant of which serves concurrently as Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). A new Bureau of Foreign Assistance (F) was created to coordinate assistance programs, led by the DFA, who in 2006, developed a Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance to align U.S. aid programs with strategic objectives. The Framework guided the writing of the FY2008 and FY2009 budgets, and is expected to be reflected in the FY2010 budget request.", "U.S. foreign aid programs began in earnest with the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe following World War II. Arguably, the underlying rationale for aid during most of the post-war period was to counter Communist influence in the world. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and particularly since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, aid programs have increasingly been justified within the context of anti-terrorism. Despite changing global conditions and challenges, U.S. foreign aid programs, their organizational structure, and their statutory underpinnings, reflect the Cold War environment in which they originated.", "These factors are, arguably, motivating the heightened interest in re-evaluating how U.S. aid programs function, and in revamping how they are administered. There is also a growing recognition of the role that foreign assistance can play as a foreign policy tool that is equal to the role of diplomacy and defense within the current international environment characterized by regional conflicts, terrorist threats, weapons proliferation, concerns with disease pandemics, and the difficulty in overcoming poverty.

The Administration also unveiled in early 2006 a restructuring of foreign aid programs administered by the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The restructuring is meant to link aid programs with strategic objectives and to provide more coordination and coherence.

Each of these agencies develops its own budget and those funds are appropriated in domestic funding bills. These programs remain outside of the jurisdiction of foreign operations appropriations subcommittees and foreign affairs authorizing committees that have oversight of foreign assistance. In addition, there is no central reporting mechanism for these programs, making it difficult to ascertain the full amount that the United States is providing in foreign assistance in any given year.

From a beginning in rebuilding Europe after World War II and assisting newly independent states in Africa, aid programs reflected Cold War tensions that continued through the 1980s. U.S. assistance programs were viewed in a national security context, as a way to prevent the incursion of Soviet influence in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.", "In the immediate aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, aid programs lost their Cold War underpinnings. With the end of the Cold War, foreign aid programs reflected less of a strategic focus on a global scale, and instead responded to regional issues such as Middle East peace initiatives, supporting the transition to democracy of eastern Europe and republics of the former Soviet Union, addressing international drug production and trafficking in the Andes, and stemming illegal immigration. Foreign aid lost its anti-Communism rationale, and decreasing foreign aid budgets in the 1990s reflected the lack of an overarching theme.", "Even during periods when aid programs were justified in the context of the Cold War, and more recently in the context of anti-terrorism, foreign aid programs also were justified for commercial and humanitarian reasons. Foreign assistance has long been defended as a way to either promote U.S. exports by creating new customers for U.S. products, or by improving the global economic environment in which U.S. companies compete. At the same time, a strong current has existed that explained U.S. assistance as a moral imperative to help poverty-stricken countries and those trying to overcome disasters or conflict. Providing assistance for humanitarian reasons or in response to natural disasters has generally been the least contested within the American public and policymakers alike.", "The purposes of aid are thought to fit within these rationales. By promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, improving governance, addressing population growth, expanding access to basic education and health care, protecting the environment, promoting stability in conflictive regions, protecting human rights, curbing weapons proliferation, and addressing drug production and trafficking, the United States would achieve its goals of promoting national security, ensuring a global economic environment for American products, and demonstrating the humanitarian nature of the U.S. people. Some observers have returned to the view that poverty and lack of opportunity are the underlying causes of political instability and the rise of terrorist organizations, much as poverty was viewed as encouraging a breeding ground for communist insurgencies in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. At the same time, the rise of disease pandemics that have the ability to spread with increasing speed has also brought focus to U.S. aid programs.", "The present national security rationale for foreign affairs programs has transitioned from a largely anti-communist orientation for some 40 years following World War II to a more recent focus on anti-terrorism in the post September 11, 2001, environment. In 2002, President Bush released his National Security Strategy that for the first time established global development as the third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy. Development was again underscored in the Administration's re-statement of the National Security Strategy released on March 16, 2006.", "The Bush Administration has also announced significant initiatives relating to diplomacy and foreign aid. A new transformational diplomacy initiative, announced in 2006, would reposition diplomats to global trouble spots, create regional public diplomacy centers, localize small posts outside of foreign capitals, and better train diplomats in language, public diplomacy, and democracy-promotion skills. Also announced in 2006 was the creation of a new position at the State Department, the Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA), who serves concurrently as USAID Administrator. Heading up the new \"F bureau\" at State, the DFA has created a new Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance with the objectives of providing more coordination, coherence, transparency, and accountability for aid programs. New presidential initiatives, including the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) have resulted in large increases in the foreign aid budget.

Should U.S. assistance emphasize poverty alleviation without regard for the nature of the recipient country government?

Should U.S. assistance be focused on countries that have the best chance of graduating from aid? Such a focus would reduce the number of countries in which the United States conducts development activities, as \"best cases\" are identified, and as countries graduate from assistance. On the other hand, it would omit countries that have not reached a level of development that approaches sustainability.

The Commission was composed of 21 members: 6 appointed by the President, 4 each appointed by the Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader, and 3 each appointed by the House Minority Leader and Senate Minority Leader, with the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development serving as an ex officio member.", "The Commission was charged with identifying past and present objectives of U.S. development assistance, analyzing whether such assistance should be used as a means to achieve U.S. foreign policy objectives, and considering how to evaluate the performance of aid programs. The Act called for a comprehensive review of policy decisions, delivery obstacles, and best practices. The Commission held a series of meetings with development experts, and conducted study missions to aid recipient countries. It looked at both the efficiency and effectiveness of aid programs government-wide, including development, security, humanitarian, and food assistance.", "Major HELP Commission recommendations include the following:"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policy", "paragraphs": ["In general, the HELP Commission recommends that there be a recognition that security and development reinforce each other.", "Rewrite the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to reflect current and anticipated world conditions. Build vibrant private sectors by increasing U.S. technical assistance and funding for small and medium businesses that do not have access to private capital. Renew efforts to improve agricultural productivity and related industries in the developing world, including taking actions to minimize the effects of domestic agricultural subsidies and to encourage G-8 countries to do the same. Increase the local purchase of food aid. Form partnerships with local public and private entities to increase demand-driven programs. Leverage non-governmental actors and growth in philanthropy and private investment through programs like the Global Development Alliance (GDA). Align U.S. trade and development policies. One suggestion is to allow duty-free, quota-free provisions for MCC-eligible countries and for the poorest countries with a per capita Gross Domestic Product below $2,000. Establish a Quadrennial Development and Humanitarian Assistance Review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structure", "paragraphs": ["The HELP Commission did not reach a consensus on an organizational structure, although the majority of commissioners supported a redesigned Department of State.

The new department would have four sub-cabinet agencies reporting to the Secretary: economic affairs, development, and trade; humanitarian services and stabilization; political and security affairs; and public diplomacy and consular affairs. The report argues that this is not to \"simply move USAID into the current Department of State. It would completely reorganize these and other agencies and departments by functions to ensure a coordinated, coherent approach.\" (Page 15, Executive Summary.) Establish an entity to conduct research and development modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that would create and commercialize technological products that would benefit developing countries.

Improve the monitoring and evaluation, human resources, and procurement and contracting capabilities of U.S. international affairs agencies. This includes strengthening staff resources devoted to development and doing away with the Operating Expense account. Agree on uniform procedures for reprogrammings and congressional holds.
