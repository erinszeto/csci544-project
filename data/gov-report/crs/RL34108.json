They stated that they had made it clear to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) that those issues should be resolved prior to certification of the agreement. Other Members of Congress issued statements in support of the agreement, stating that it will remove trade barriers and open new markets for U.S. exports in goods and services.

Peruvian law restricted foreign investment in the following way: majority ownership of broadcast media to Peruvian citizens; ownership of land or investment in natural resources within 50 kilometers of a border; and operation of national air and water transportation.

According to the USITC study, the largest U.S. employment gain (1%) is estimated to be in wheat production. Declines are estimated in metals (gold, copper, and aluminum), rice production, and miscellaneous crops (cut flowers, live plants and seeds) which could lose up to 0.2% of their employment, displaced by imports. Some labor groups argue that U.S. exports of basic grains could adversely affect the livelihoods of subsistence farmers in Peru, where agriculture is the main source of jobs.", "Another factor for consideration is the extent to which the PTPA would provide trade creation over trade diversion. One of the drawbacks to a bilateral free trade agreement is that it may result in trade diversion because it is not fully inclusive of all regional trading partners. Trade diversion results when a country enters into an FTA and then shifts the purchase of goods or services (imports) from a country that is not an FTA partner to a country that is an FTA partner but still a higher cost producer. In the case of the United States and Peru, for example, goods from the United States may replace Peru's lower-priced imports from other countries in Latin America. If this were to happen, the United States would now be the producer of that item, not because it produces the good more efficiently, but because it is receiving preferential access to the Peruvian market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Issues32", "paragraphs": ["The labor provisions have been among the more controversial in the negotiation of the agreement. Supporters of the agreement have argued that Peru has ratified all eight International Labor Organization (ILO) core labor standards; that a PTPA would reinforce Peru's labor reform measures of recent years ; and that PTPA provisions would go beyond labor protections in U.S. laws under the ATPA and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Critics argue that, with enforceable ILO core labor standards in the language of the agreement, the main issues at this point are Peru's adoption of new labor laws and enforcement of labor law.", "A number of Members of Congress indicated early in 2007 that PTPA labor requirements would have to be strengthened for the agreement to be approved, stating that enforceable ILO core labor standards should be included in the text of the agreement. In March 2007, the Democratic leadership of the House Ways and Means Committee announced a set of trade principles (Democratic Trade Principles) that can \"pave the way to re-establishing a bipartisan consensus on trade.\" These principles included a commitment that free trade agreement (FTA) signatory countries adopt basic ILO labor standards and agree to enforcement provisions for those standards in agreements.", "On May 10, 2007, after much negotiation, Congress and the Administration announced an agreement for a \"New Trade Policy for America,\" which incorporated key Democratic priorities relating to labor and other issues. Key concepts in the new trade-labor policy include fully enforceable provisions that 1) incorporate ILO core labor standards as stated in the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (henceforth referred to as the ILO Declaration ); and 2) prohibit partner countries from weakening laws relating to ILO core labor standards in order to attract trade or investment.", "Before the new PTPA language was released, some observers noted that the United States has ratified only two ILO conventions, while Peru has ratified all eight. In addition, the U.S. has some laws that may not totally conform with language of ILO conventions. A possible example is some state laws which permit employment-without-pay for prisoners. Consequently, they express concern that including enforceable ILO core labor standards into trade agreements could subject the entire U.S. labor code to challenges by trading partners. This issue is addressed by language in the PTPA that (a) restricts the application of the PTPA provisions to trade-related matters; and (b) incorporates only the principles of the four basic ILO rights listed in the ILO Declaration and quoted on p. 4, footnote 2, rather than the detailed language of the specific eight conventions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Patent Protection and Access to Medicines", "paragraphs": ["Another of the controversial issues surrounding the PTPA is that of patent protection and access to medicines. Some organizations were concerned that the agreement's stronger protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), patents, and trade secrets could jeopardize access to medicines by poorer segments of the population. They argued that the agreement's provisions could delay the entry of generic drugs into the market in Peru and cause the price of medicines to rise.", "The primary issue related to patent protection and access to medicines involves the data exclusivity term. To bring a patented drug to market, a drug company must demonstrate through clinical trials that the drug is both safe and effective. Under U.S. law, the data used to establish these claims are protected from use by generic manufacturers to certify their own products for a period of five years from the time the patented drug is approved for use in a country's market. This protection refers the so-called data exclusivity term. The amendments to the text of the PTPA on data exclusivity would grant Peru the period of data protection to be concurrent with the term of protection provided in the United States, which could shorten the time line for allowing generic medicines into the Peruvian market. The original text of the agreement would have delayed the availability of generic pharmaceuticals in the Peruvian market for at least five years, even if the patent had already expired.", "In April 2005, Peru's Health Ministry released an evaluation of potential effects of a free trade agreement on access to medicines in Peru. The study stated that an agreement would affect generic brands of medicine in that many of these medicines would no longer be eligible to be branded as generic. A number of non-government organizations based in the United States and Latin America were also concerned that a PTPA would reduce access to essential medicines by the poor populations of Peru. They argued that the agreement's provisions far exceeded international standards established by the WTO.", "The pharmaceutical industry has denied claims that patents may prevent access to essential medicines in developing countries. According to industry representatives, very few medicines on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines are patented. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA) and Associations report that 95% of essential medicines, including antiretrovirals for treating HIV/AIDS, are off-patent and can therefore be legally copied by generic manufacturers anywhere in the world. However, according to IFPMA, generic copies of these products are still not reaching the poorest populations of the world. The pharmaceutical industry believes that without patent protection, many of the innovative medicines that are saving lives would not be available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Illegal Logging", "paragraphs": ["A major environmental issue surrounding a possible PTPA is related to U.S. imports of bigleaf mahogany and reports of illegal logging in Peru. Environmental groups are concerned that an agreement could lead to an increase in exports of illegal logged mahogany to the United States from Peru. The United States is the world's largest wood products consumer and one of the top importers of tropical hardwoods. Some environmentalists believe that U.S. demand for tropical timber from countries in Latin America may be a driving force for illegal logging. PTPA environmental provisions require each country to enforce domestic environmental laws and establish a policy mechanism to address public complaints that a party is not enforcing its environmental laws, whether or not the failure is trade-related.", "In early 2007, a number of Members of Congress emphasized that environmental provisions of the agreement needed to be strengthened. The May 10 Bipartisan Democratic Trade Principles stated that Peru should be required to adopt and enforce laws on logging Mahogany and that the United States should promote sustainable development and combat global warming by requiring countries to implement and enforce common Multilateral Environmental Agreements. These principles were incorporated into the agreement in the June 2007 amendments. Annex 18.3.4 of the amendment to Chapter 18, the environmental chapter, of the PTPA is devoted to forest sector governance and subject to the dispute settlement provisions of the agreement. The annex specifically mentions protection measures for mahogany within the norms established by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The annex includes a section on enforcement measures on forest sector governance, and provisions related to the harvest of and trade in timber products.", "The United States currently requires an export permit from Peru validating that mahogany entering the United States was harvested in a sustainable manner that is not detrimental to the species. Some argue, however, that Peruvian mahogany is nonetheless harvested illegally at times and that export permits provided by Peru have been granted without sufficient monitoring and assessment of harvesting practices. The Peruvian non-government organization, Native Federation of Madre de Dios (FENAMAD) recently teamed with the Natural Resource Defense Council to file a suit against the U.S. government and U.S. timber importers to the U.S. Court of International Trade stating that the government was authorizing trade in bigleaf mahogany from Peru without valid export permits. The court, however, rejected these claims and moved to dismiss the complaint stating a lack of jurisdiction. U.S. timber importers announced in a press release after the court's decision that they were pleased with the court decision and that the lawsuit was a \"mischaracterization\" of international trade regulations.", "Under the PTPA, there are more legal protections for U.S. investors in Peru which could potentially lead to a larger timber industry in Peru and greater harvesting. On the other hand, an agreement may increase awareness of the illegal logging issue and add mechanisms that may be used to increase protection. Critics of the PTPA environmental provisions, in the original text prior to the amendments, claimed that the provisions were weak and that illegal logging should be addressed specifically in the agreement. FENAMAD joined forces with U.S. environmental groups to urge Members of Congress to include specific provisions in the PTPA to prevent imports of illegally logged mahogany."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Implementing legislation for a PTPA was considered by the U.S. Congress under Title XXI (Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002) of the Trade Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-210 ) on an expedited basis that is limited in debate and with no amendments. Gaining passage of a PTPA was a high priority for the government of Peru. Peruvian President Alan Garc\u00eda Perez met with President Bush on at least two occasions to discuss the free trade agreement. After an April 2007 meeting, President Garc\u00eda stated that he was in the United States to promote a free trade agreement with the United States. He said that \"It is vital for our country. It is fundamental to continue this path of growth and social redistribution that we have started in my country.\"", "The Bush Administration was a strong supporter of the expansion of free trade with Peru and issued a statement in October 2006 that a PTPA would be mutually beneficial \"in strengthening bilateral ties while leveling the trade playing field, spurring job creation, and reducing poverty and inequality\". On July 9, 2007, President Bush reaffirmed his support for the agreement and called on Congress to approve the PTPA by the beginning of August 2007. House Democratic leaders expressed concerns in 2007 and early in 2009 regarding Peru's labor and environmental laws, with particular concern regarding workers rights to freely associate and collectively bargin. They believe that Peru's adoption of new labor laws and regulations in 2008 created loopholes to laws that had been passed by the Peruvian government in 2007 to strengthen worker rights. Other Members of Congress have expressed strong support for the PTPA and for the government of Peru in its efforts to strengthen laws and regulations on labor, environment, intellectual property. They stated that the implementation of the PTPA reflected over fourteen months of work between the U.S. and Peruvian governments to improve labor and environmental conditions in Peru. ", "President Alan Garc\u00eda met with Members of Congress on several occasions to emphasize the importance for Peru of strengthening trade relations with the United States in its efforts to fight poverty and strengthen equality among the Peruvian people. President Garc\u00eda had stated that a considerable share of Peru's exports to the United States receives trade preferences under the ATPA and, without renewal or passage of a PTPA, many of Peru's exports to the United States would have faced higher duties. ATPA supporters maintain that the program has had a positive impact in the region by increasing investor confidence, creating thousands of jobs in alternative sectors, and preventing organized crime. Some Peruvian policymakers believe that maintaining confidence in the bilateral trade environment with the United States is key to the long-term stability of the region.", "In the United States, a number of groups, such as the AFL-CIO, Public Citizen, and American Friends Service Committee generally are skeptical of free trade agreements. They argue that, among other things, that the PTPA will erode protection for the environment and workers' rights in Peru. In general, such groups argue that FTAs tend to protect the rights and profits of multinational corporations and cost the U.S. economy jobs. Public Citizen issued a statement after the May 10 bipartisan agreement, saying that bipartisan agreement between Congress and the Administration did not go far enough in making changes to the PTPA in order to protect the rights of the people and that the FTAs with Peru and Panama would undermine access to essential services in these countries. According to the statement, the provisions on trade in services and foreign investment would place limits on the ability of the government to regulate essential services such as education, health services, and electric power distribution. Such limitations, according to Public Citizen, could potentially prevent the distribution of these services throughout the country.", "Much of the business community in the United States supports a U.S.-Peru FTA. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), for example, issued statements in support of the PTPA. After the Bush Administration's January 2009 proclamation to implement the PTPA, NAM issued a statement welcoming the implementation of the agreement. NAM \"expressed satisfaction\" that the agreement was to go into effect, stating that about 80% of Peru's tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods would disappear immediately after implementation and that the rest would follow in phases. The President of NAM stated that NAM would ask the Commerce Department to work with U.S. manufacturers to help U.S. companies take advantage of the newly-opened Peruvian market."], "subsections": []}]}}
