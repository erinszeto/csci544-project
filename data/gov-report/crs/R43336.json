The two countries signed a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) that spelled out the terms of the agreement: Brazil relinquishes its rights to countermeasures against U.S. trade or any further proceedings in the dispute; the United States agreed to new rules governing fees and tenor for the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program; Brazil agreed to a temporary Peace Clause with respect to any new WTO actions against U.S. cotton support programs while the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) is in force or against any agricultural export credit guarantees under the GSM-102 program as long as the program is operated consistent with the agreed terms; the United States would make a one-time final payment of $300 million to the Brazil Cotton Institute (BCI) with explicit use-of-fund conditions; and both counties agreed to routine semi-annual reporting under the MOU.", "The cotton dispute settlement case (DS267) was initiated by Brazil\u2014a major cotton export competitor\u2014in 2002 against specific provisions of the U.S. cotton program. In September 2004, a WTO dispute settlement panel ruled that (1) certain U.S. agricultural support payments for cotton distorted international agricultural markets and should be either withdrawn or modified to end the market distortions; and (2) U.S. Step-2 payments and agricultural export credit guarantees for cotton and other unscheduled commodities were prohibited subsidies under WTO rules and should be withdrawn.", "In 2005, the United States made several changes to both its cotton and export credit guarantee programs in an attempt to bring them into compliance with WTO recommendations; however, Brazil argued that the U.S. response was inadequate. A WTO compliance panel ruled in Brazil's favor and was upheld on appeal. The United States made additional changes to its export credit program in the 2008 farm bill, but Brazil found the overall level of changes to fall short of the WTO ruling. The threat of retaliation led Brazil and the United States to negotiate a temporary agreement, referred to as the Framework Agreement (June 17, 2010), to avoid trade retaliation with the understanding that the WTO cotton dispute would be resolved definitively within the context of the next U.S. farm bill.", "In this regard, the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) included several substantive changes to both U.S. cotton support programs and the export credit guarantee program.

Cotton no longer has access to the price and income support programs offered for other program crops, but instead will rely on a within-year, market-based insurance guarantee\u2014referred to as the Stacked Income Protection Program or STAX\u2014as its primary support measure. Under this new cotton program, producers would have to pay into the program in order to participate, a loss (albeit at the county level) would have to occur before an indemnity payment would be made, and the sum of program indemnity payments under STAX and any other crop insurance policy would be prohibited from exceeding the value of the insured crop to minimize any production incentive. In addition, U.S. export credit guarantee programs have been substantially reformed, including a shortened tenor (i.e., contract length) of only 24 months\u2014down from 36 months\u2014and increased user fees to ensure that the program's operating costs are fully covered by fees so as to avoid any implicit subsidy.

U.S. cotton no longer has access to the price and income support programs offered for other program crops, but instead will rely on a within-year, market-based insurance guarantee as its primary support measure. Under the new cotton program, producers have to pay into the program in order to participate, a loss (albeit at the county level) has to occur before a payment is made, and the sum of program payments is prohibited from exceeding the value of the crop insured in order to minimize any potential incentive. Because the program price guarantee is based on within-year prices, cotton will eventually have no safety net against multiple-year low returns, an unlikely outcome without the WTO ruling in the U.S.-Brazil cotton case.", "The major cotton-related provisions in the enacted 2014 farm bill are briefly described here (the related 2014 farm bill provision is cited in brackets for easy reference).", "1. Current cotton support programs are repealed . The price and income support programs direct payments (DP), counter-cyclical program (CCP), and Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) available under the 2008 farm law are repealed [ \u00a7 1101, \u00a7 1102, \u00a7 1103] . This represents a significant concession for the U.S. cotton sector. Under the direct payment program, national average direct payments of $6.67/hundredweight (cwt.) or $39.82/acre (using the national yield of 597 lbs./acre) were made annually to cotton base acres irrespective of market conditions. Since 1996, owners of upland cotton base acres have received over $10 billion in direct payments. Similarly, owners of upland cotton base acres have received nearly $7.6 billion in CCP payments since their origin in FY2003. 2. Cotton is ineligible for most new price and income support programs . Cotton is not eligible for coverage under the following new price and income programs: Price Loss Coverage (PLC), Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) [ \u00a7 1111(6)] ; and the shallow-loss insurance program Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) [ \u00a7 11003(C)(iv)] . As a result, cotton producers do not benefit from yield and base updating available to other program crops under these programs. 3. Reduced marketing loan program benefits for cotton . Marketing loan benefits continue for all major program crops, including upland cotton, but at a reduced marketing loan rate for upland cotton. The new marketing loan rate for upland cotton is to be calculated as the simple average of the adjusted world price for the two preceding marketing years within a range of 45 cents/lb. to 52\u00a0cents/lb. (down from a fixed 52 cents/lb. in the 2008 farm bill) [ \u00a7 1202(a)(6)] . 4. Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX) . The 2014 farm bill handles upland cotton separately from the other major program crops. In lieu of the farm revenue programs available to program crops\u2014PLC, ARC, and SCO\u2014upland cotton producers are eligible for a stand-alone, county-based revenue insurance policy called the Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX). Producers can purchase this policy in addition to their individual crop insurance policy or as a stand-alone policy [ \u00a7 11017] . a. STAX covers county-wide revenue losses of greater than 10% but not more than 30% of expected county revenue, offered in 5% increments. In other words, a loss of at least 10% must occur at the county level (and relative to the county-level guarantee) before any indemnity is made under STAX. b. Total indemnity payments received\u2014including both STAX and other crop insurance\u2014cannot exceed the total insured value of the crop. c. Participating producers must pay 20% of the STAX policy premium, while the federal government pays the remaining 80% share. The government subsidy rate of 80% for STAX is more generous than for other insurance products, but is viewed by U.S. interests as a partial offset for the other program benefits sacrificed to obtain STAX. In addition, this is unlike all previous cotton support programs over the past eight decades when producers did not have to pay to participate. Under STAX, producers must pay to participate. d. Premiums are based on the risk of loss and the value of the insured crop. As a result, when crop prices move higher the cost of premiums also rises. e. In years where no loss or STAX indemnity is incurred, cotton producers will still be required to make premium payments under the program, thus incurring costs with no offsetting monetary benefits (although producers would implicitly benefit from the reduced risk of loss). f. Under STAX, the expected price used in determining the program's revenue guarantee is based on market conditions. STAX only provides within-year protection. The initial price guarantee is determined in February based on the price of a harvest-time futures contract, although a Harvest Revenue Option allows the expected price to be replaced by the actual harvest-time price, if higher than the initial guarantee. In other words, the price component of the revenue guarantee moves up and down from year to year with market conditions\u2014a recommendation of the WTO panel. Thus, as mentioned earlier, under STAX, cotton will eventually have no safety net against multiple-year low returns. g. Because it is designed as an insurance product, STAX (like all other crop insurance programs) is not subject to a cap on individual payments. However, the restriction that combined STAX and crop insurance indemnities may not exceed the insured value of the crop is itself a type of payment limitation. h. The STAX payment rate multiplier of 120% available to producers seeking higher per-acre protection is poorly understood by casual observers. Brazil has expressed dismay over this program feature. However, it simply allows producers to improve their risk management coverage relative to the county average. The restriction on total STAX plus crop insurance indemnities not exceeding the value of the insured crop dampens the potential for abnormal production incentives and subsequent market distortion. 5. Temporary Upland Cotton Transition Payments . Cotton producers will be given special transition payments in 2014 and possibly 2015 [ \u00a7 1119] in light of the repeal of Direct Payments; the ineligibility of cotton producers for PLC, ARC, or SCO; reduced marketing loan benefits; and the delayed implementation of STAX. However, the transition payments are only a partial offset to the previous benefits under DP, CCP, and the reduced marketing loan program benefits. In 2014, an estimated transition assistance rate of $53.73/acre will be made on 60% of cotton base acres in existence in the 2013 crop year (i.e., a national average DP equivalency of $32.24/acre. 6. Brazil Cotton Institute spending concessions . The 2014 farm bill allows for funds that have already been disbursed to Brazil's special cotton fund created under the 2010 memorandum of understanding to be used for agricultural research in Brazil, provided that it is conducted in collaboration with USDA or a college, university, or research foundation located in the United States [ \u00a7 1615] . 7. Additional changes made to the GSM-102 program . The maximum contract length (i.e., tenor) was capped at 24 months, down from 36 months under the 2008 farm bill [ \u00a7 3101(a)(1)] ; and USDA was given additional flexibility to negotiate with Brazil on GSM-102 use in order to ensure compliance with the WTO cotton case recommendations [ \u00a7 3101(a)(5)E] .", "Some additional provisions related to the U.S. cotton sector, but unrelated to the WTO cotton case, were also extended in the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ), including payment of upland cotton storage costs, but at reduced rates (down 10%) [ \u00a7 1204(g)] , and special marketing provisions to help keep the U.S. upland cotton spinning industry competitive. These include a special import quota [ \u00a7 1207(a)] and a limited global import quota [ \u00a7 1207(b)] when certain market price conditions are met. Also, domestic users of upland cotton (from all sources, regardless of origin) are eligible for an economic adjustment assistance (EEA) payment of 3 cents/lb. [ \u00a7 1207(c)] .

This would have to be determined by empirical analysis, but it is likely that relative returns from other program crops will play a much larger role in producer planting decisions than the size of the federal premium subsidy under STAX ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore, total indemnity payments under both STAX and any other cotton-specific crop insurance are prohibited from exceeding the value of the insured crop, thus further minimizing any potential production incentive.", "Market forces have already played a large role in allocating resources away from cotton and toward other crops. Since 2006 the rapid rise in prices of corn and other feed grain and oilseed crops has pulled area away from upland cotton ( Figure 2 ) while contributing to lower levels of government support payments ( Figure 3 ). Globalization and the search for low-cost, unskilled labor markets have contributed to the steady decline of the U.S. textile sector and domestic mill use of U.S. upland cotton in recent decades ( Figure 4 ). As this phenomenon has played out it has coincided with increasing U.S. costs of production to impair upland cotton's relative competitiveness against other program crops. ", "The rapid decline of corn and feed grain prices of 2013\u2014due in part to a return to normal weather conditions and trend yields after two years of poor weather and below-trend yields, but also reflecting a plateauing of corn-for-ethanol demand as fuel markets reached the ethanol blend wall\u2014encouraged some acres to return to cotton in 2014 based on regional comparative advantage. However, it has been suggested that the increase in cotton plantings in 2014 more likely reflects relative market conditions than government program incentive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prelude to a Permanent Resolution", "paragraphs": ["At first glance, it would appear that upland cotton's treatment under the 2014 farm bill falls within the WTO criteria of causing minimal distortion in domestic and international markets. The principal cotton support program is now the insurance-like STAX program. A key finding of the original WTO panel hearing the cotton case was that crop insurance payments did not cause serious prejudice to Brazil's interests because Brazil was unable to show a necessary causal link between crop insurance programs and significant price suppression\u2014such a link was established for Step 2 payments, market loss assistance payments, marketing loan program payments, and counter-cyclical payments.", "Both U.S. and Brazilian commercial interests appeared ready to see the dispute come to a satisfactory resolution. In accordance with the Framework Agreement, officials from Brazil and the United States were to meet to review and evaluate the farm bill changes and to attempt to finalize a solution to this long-running WTO dispute case. However, according to news media, the Brazilian government prepared a report on the 2014 farm bill that was presented to CAMEX, a group of Brazilian ministers responsible for deciding whether to retaliate in the cotton case, in early February. Then, on February 19, 2014, CAMEX announced its recommendation that Brazil request a WTO panel to assess whether the new farm bill brings the United States into compliance with the original 2004 WTO decision that faulted U.S. subsidies to upland cotton producers and the agricultural export credit guarantee program GSM-102. The decision to proceed with a compliance panel is based on Article 21.5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. ", "Where there is disagreement as to the existence or consistency with a covered agreement of measures taken to comply with the recommendations and rulings such dispute shall be decided through recourse to these dispute settlement procedures, including wherever possible resort to the original panel. The panel shall circulate its report within 90 days after the date of referral of the matter to it. When the panel considers that it cannot provide its report within this time frame, it shall inform the DSB in writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of the period within which it will submit its report.", "The next day, February 20, the Brazilian government informed the U.S. government that it would seek negotiations to achieve a mutually agreeable resolution before moving ahead with a WTO compliance panel request. The offer for new negotiations was positively received by the United States. By seeking negotiations with the possibility of moving to a WTO compliance panel, CAMEX and Brazil once again postponed trade retaliation for which Brazil had received WTO authority in 2009.

The two countries signed a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) that spelled out the terms of the agreement as described earlier in this report. ", "With respect to U.S. farm policy, perhaps the most notable conditions defined by the MOU were new rules governing fees and tenor for the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program. The 2014 farm bill had explicitly granted USDA additional flexibility to negotiate with Brazil on GSM-102 use in order to ensure compliance with the WTO cotton case recommendations. USDA used this flexibility to agree to a shorter maximum tenor of 18 months (down from the 24-month tenor established by the 2014 farm bill) and a new risk-based fee system that includes an additional fee component for longer tenors of greater than 12 months but less than 18 months, or of 18 months. These policy concessions were supplemented with a one-time payment of $300 million to the Brazil Cotton Institute. In return, Brazil agreed to drop the WTO cotton dispute and to abide by a temporary Peace Clause with respect to any new WTO actions against U.S. cotton support programs while the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) is in force or against any agricultural export credit guarantees under the GSM-102 program as long as the program is operated consistent with the agreed terms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In the end, the successful resolution of the WTO cotton dispute avoided a trade war between two of the world's major agricultural trading nations, the United States and Brazil, while resulting in substantial and substantive changes in U.S. domestic support programs for upland cotton and the U.S. export credit guarantee program in general. The resolution to the cotton case could have an important bearing on how domestic support programs are treated in future WTO trade negotiations or in future dispute settlement cases. In addition to the implications for domestic support policy, the heightened attention surrounding the WTO Brazil-U.S. cotton case has set precedent by singling out cotton for special treatment within ongoing WTO trade negotiations. ", "Whether this case becomes a role model for future domestic support-related trade disputes remains to be seen. However, the inability of the WTO to move forward with its multilateral trade negotiations (i.e., the Doha Round) or to successfully implement the December 2013 Bali Agreement suggests that the WTO may not rapidly achieve the global trade goals of its members. As a result, the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism\u2014which remains a primary forum for allowing members to resolve trade grievances\u2014could likely serve as the primary mechanism for effecting future change in domestic support policies."], "subsections": []}]}}
