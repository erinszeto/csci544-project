The Privacy Rule generally applies to individually identifiable health information created and maintained by payers and providers of health care, collectively referred to as covered entities. The rule establishes certain individual rights, including the right to inspect and obtain a copy of one's health information; describes the circumstances under which covered entities are permitted to use or disclose health information; and requires covered entities to put in place administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect health information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.", "Broadly speaking, the Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing \"protected health information\" (PHI) except as expressly permitted or, in two instances, required by the rule. The Privacy Rule describes a wide range of circumstances under which it is permissible to use or disclose PHI. In so doing, the rule seeks to preserve the discretion that health care professionals have traditionally exercised when using or disclosing patient information. For all uses or disclosures of PHI that are not otherwise permitted or required by the rule, a covered entity must obtain a patient's written authorization.", "Under the Privacy Rule, covered entities generally may use or disclose PHI for the purposes of treatment, payment, and other routine health care operations. Under certain other circumstances, the rule requires covered entities to give individuals the opportunity to object to the use or disclosure of their PHI. The rule also permits the use or disclosure of PHI for various specified activities not directly connected to treatment (e.g., research, law enforcement, public health).", "The Privacy Rule does not specify the types of safeguards that need to be implemented to protect PHI from misuse. That is the purpose of the companion HIPAA Security Rule, under which each of the safeguards\u2014administrative, physician, and technical\u2014is composed of a number of standards. The security standards are designed to be scalable to the size and complexity of the covered entity, as well as technology-neutral. They include implementing security management policies and procedures, workforce security procedures, facility access controls, and controls on access to information technology (IT) systems. Each standard consists of one or more implementation specifications (i.e., detailed instructions for implementing the standard). Covered entities have considerable discretion and flexibility in how they implement the security standards.", "The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 included a series of modifications to the HIPAA privacy and security standards. Many of the changes were enacted to address the concerns of privacy advocates and other stakeholders. The HITECH Act created a notification requirement for breaches of unsecured (i.e., unencrypted) PHI, increased the civil monetary penalties for violating HIPAA, and expanded and strengthened enforcement activities by the Office for Civil Rights. It also made business associates of covered entities (i.e., companies and consultants with whom covered entities share PHI to help them operate) directly liable and subject to civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction to the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Standards", "paragraphs": ["The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 was enacted to improve the availability and continuity of health insurance coverage; promote long-term care insurance and the use of health savings accounts; and combat waste, fraud, and abuse, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid.

The Secretary also was directed to adopt unique identifiers (ID numbers) for health care providers, health plans, and employers for use in standard electronic transactions.

Lawmakers also included a three-year deadline for enacting health privacy legislation. If Congress and the President were unable to enact such legislation by the deadline, the Secretary was instructed by regulation to adopt privacy standards based on the recommendations. HIPAA stipulated that the standards would not preempt (i.e., supersede) state health privacy laws that are more protective of medical information.", "On September 11, 1997, the Secretary submitted to Congress a framework and set of recommendations for health privacy legislation (see text box). Several legislative proposals were introduced and debated, but lawmakers could not reach agreement and were unable to meet the deadline (i.e., August 21, 1999) they had set for themselves to enact legislation. Consequently, the Secretary proposed and finalized a set of health privacy standards by regulation.

OCR refers such cases to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for criminal prosecution. OCR maintains an extensive website with information on the HIPAA privacy and security standards, including information on compliance and enforcement activities.", "HHS finalized a HIPAA Enforcement Rule in February 2006.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns About the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards", "paragraphs": ["The Privacy and Security Rules have been contentious and the subject of ongoing debate since they were first implemented. Privacy advocates have complained about the limited scope of the rules. HIPAA applies all the Administrative Simplification standards to three entities\u2014health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers\u2014but personal health information is handled by many other types of organizations that are not covered under the law. In an effort to address this issue, HHS took steps when it promulgated the Privacy and Security Rules to broaden their scope so that they apply to the business associates of HIPAA-covered entities. These actions were further strengthened by Congress in subsequent legislative action (discussed later in this report) to expand the HIPAA standards.", "Another key concern is whether the Privacy Rule strikes the right balance between protecting individual privacy and supporting important societal goals. The Secretary's 1997 recommendations recognized the importance of balancing the privacy rights of individuals and the amount of control they have over the use and disclosure of their health information, with the need to permit health information to be used not just for routine health care activities (e.g., treatment and payment) but also for other purposes related to health care that are in the public interest (e.g., oversight, research, law enforcement, public health and safety).", "Researchers, in particular, have criticized the Privacy Rule. They claim its privacy protections are unnecessarily impeding their access to and use of health information. These concerns, some of which have been addressed administratively by HHS, are part of a broader set of challenges posed by the rapid digitization of medical information. Since 2009, the federal government has spent over $30 billion to promote the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and the development of an infrastructure that allows providers, patients, and other stakeholders to share electronic health information in ways that improve health care quality and outcomes. But in order to realize the full value of EHR use, researchers need to be able to access and analyze clinical data from patient records to identify best practices, and then share those findings with others to create a learning health care system. ", "To ensure public trust in the analytic uses of health data for learning purposes, patient privacy concerns must be effectively addressed. A lack of trust in the privacy of medical information can have important implications for both individual and population health. Surveys show that individuals may avoid needed care, withhold information from providers, or lie about their medical conditions if they are concerned about the privacy and security of their health information.", "The HIPAA privacy standards were developed in the late 1990s, when most medical information was still paper-based. While many privacy advocates view the Privacy Rule as a good start, one that creates a foundation of privacy protections, they are concerned that the rule does not sufficiently protect digital health information maintained and exchanged by EHR systems.", "Implementation of the Privacy Rule continues to challenge covered entities. The rule is complex and seeks largely to preserve the traditional right of health care providers to exercise discretion and professional judgment in deciding whether and how to use or disclose patient information. Providers who are unsure of the rule's requirements, and who perhaps have been warned of the potential penalties for violating it, will sometimes err on the side of caution. They will refuse to disclose health information in an otherwise routine situation\u2014for example, to a family member who calls inquiring about a hospital inpatient\u2014claiming (incorrectly) that the disclosure is prohibited by HIPAA. In fact, the Privacy Rule accommodates such routine circumstances and neither requires nor prohibits the provider from using or disclosing health information. Instead, the rule leaves that decision up to the provider.", "The growing number of breaches of electronic health data also has led to renewed criticism of the Security Rule, whose standards are intended to protect electronic information when stored in place and during transmission from one location to another. The standards are technology-neutral and scalable, based on the size and complexity of the organization. HIPAA-covered entities have considerable latitude in how they implement them.", "Congress addressed some of the concerns about the Privacy and Security Rules in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009. The HITECH Act expanded and strengthened the privacy and security standards, principally by addressing enforcement of the standards and by establishing a breach notification requirement.

HHS responded in the omnibus rule by removing the harm threshold and modifying the risk assessment portion of the breach notification rule to require the use of a more objective assessment. An impermissible use or disclosure of PHI \"is presumed to be a breach unless the covered entity or business associate ... demonstrates that there is a low probability that the [PHI] has been compromised based on a risk assessment.... \" The modified rule lists the factors that must be included in the risk assessment. Now the default is notification, and the burden is on the covered entity or business associate to perform a risk assessment to determine whether there is a low probability that PHI was compromised. If that determination is made (and documented), then the covered entity or business associate need not provide notification.", "The Secretary is required annually to submit a report to Congress on the number and nature of the breaches reported to OCR, and the actions taken in response to such breaches. To date, the Secretary has submitted two reports, each analyzing two years of information.

Over the same period, OCR received 77,420 reports of breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals. In all, these breaches affected approximately 400,000 individuals. Thus, while the major breaches made up about 1% of breach reports, they accounted for more than 98% of all the individuals who were affected by a breach of their PHI.", "Of all the categories of causes of breaches, theft accounted for about half of all incidents. OCR identified the following lessons learned from the two breach reports:", "Ensure that an organization's risk analysis and risk management plan is thorough and addresses all potential risks and vulnerabilities to ePHI, regardless of location or media. That includes ePHI on computer hard drives, USB drives, laptops, mobile phones, and other portable devices, as well as ePHI transmitted across networks. Ensure that security evaluations are conducted when there are operation changes (e.g., office moves) and technical upgrades for hardware and software so that ePHI remains secure. Ensure that ePHI stored on portable electronic devices is properly secured, including through encryption, with clear policies on the use and removal of such devices from a facility. Implement clear policies and procedures for the proper disposal of PHI in all forms. Ensure physical safeguards are in place to limit access to facilities and workstations that maintain PHI.

Privacy advocates criticized the agency for not being more aggressive in its enforcement activities and for not penalizing noncompliant organizations. At the time of the HITECH Act enactment, OCR had not levied a single civil penalty against a covered entity, though cases had been referred to DOJ for criminal prosecution. ", "The HITECH Act clarified that the criminal penalties for wrongful disclosure apply to individuals who without authorization use or disclose such information maintained by a covered entity, whether they are employees or not. This provision was prompted by a Memorandum Opinion issued by the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel in June 2005 clarifying the scope of HIPAA criminal enforcement. The opinion was interpreted by some to mean that employees of covered entities could not be held liable for a HIPAA criminal violation; only covered entities could be prosecuted directly.", " Table 2 summarizes the four tiers of CMPs that replaced the original HIPAA penalty of $100 per violation up to an annual maximum of $25,000 for multiple violations of the same requirement. The lowest tier applies to entities that \"did not know, and by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known\" of the violation. The second tier applies to violations due to reasonable cause and is likely to cover many common violations by otherwise generally compliant covered entities; for example, those that occur due to human error, despite workforce training and appropriate policies and procedures. Reasonable cause covers violations in which the entity \"knew, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have known\" of the violation, \"but did not act with willful neglect.\"", "The final two tiers, both dealing with violations due to willful neglect, are distinguished based on whether the entity took corrective action within 30 days. Willful neglect means \"conscious, intentional failure or reckless indifference to the obligation to comply.\"", "OCR must investigate whenever there is evidence of a possible violation due to willful neglect. However, the omnibus rule states that, absent indications of willful neglect, OCR will continue to seek compliance through informal, voluntary action if appropriate.", "The HITECH Act requires the Secretary to conduct periodic audits to ensure that covered entities and business associates comply with the Privacy and Security Rules. Unlike complaint investigations or compliance reviews, which are initiated in response to specific events or incidents, audits are based on a set of objective selection criteria.", "OCR developed and conducted a pilot audit program that targeted 115 covered entities representing a broad range of sizes and complexities. The audits were conducted according to a protocol that identified the processes, controls, and policies of covered entities in three areas: privacy, security, and breach notification. OCR engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to evaluate the pilot audit program and is using PwC's findings to finalize plans for a permanent audit program. OCR has requested additional funding to establish the audit program, which it believes will generate tools for covered entities to self-evaluate and help spread a culture of compliance within the health care sector as entities become aware of the program and its expectations.", "The HITECH Act requires the Secretary annually to submit a report to Congress that summarizes the number and types of complaints received; the compliance reviews and enforcement actions taken; the number of audits performed and their findings; and the Secretary's plan for improving HIPAA compliance and enforcement for the following year.

Thus, a Privacy Rule authorization for a specific research study could be combined with Common Rule informed consent to participate in the research. But any separate research activity, such as collecting specimens or data for a central research database or repository, would require its own authorization. Unlike Common Rule informed consent, Privacy Rule authorizations also had to be study-specific; authorizations for future research were prohibited.", "The omnibus rule addressed some of these inconsistencies. The Privacy Rule now permits compound authorizations for any type of research activity (with limited exceptions) and allows authorizations for future research, provided the description of the future research uses is sufficiently clear that it would be \"reasonable for an individual to expect that his or her protected health information could be used or disclosed for such future research.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
