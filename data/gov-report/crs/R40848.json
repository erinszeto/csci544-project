They are widely viewed as essential components of a strategy to reduce unauthorized immigration. ", "Under Section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), it is unlawful for an employer to knowingly hire, recruit or refer for a fee, or continue to employ an alien who is not authorized to be so employed. Employers are further required to participate in a paper-based (I-9) employment eligibility verification system in which they examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work eligibility, and to complete and retain I-9 verification forms. Employers violating prohibitions on unlawful employment may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties. Enforcement of these provisions is termed \"worksite enforcement.\" While all employers must meet the I-9 requirements, they also may elect to participate in the E-Verify electronic employment eligibility verification system. E-Verify is administered by DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Participants in E-Verify electronically verify new hires' employment authorization through Social Security Administration (SSA) and, if necessary, DHS databases. ", "At the start of the 111 th Congress, E-Verify was scheduled to expire on March 6, 2009. Prompted by the approaching expiration, the House and Senate considered several provisions related to electronic employment eligibility verification and enacted a series of extensions. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 111-8 ) extended E-Verify until September 30, 2009, and the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2010 ( P.L. 111-68 , Division B, \u00a7128) extended the program until October 31, 2009. With the enactment of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-83 , \u00a7547), E-Verify is currently authorized until September 30, 2012. This extension represented a compromise between the House-passed version of the underlying bill ( H.R. 2892 ), which would have extended the program until September 30, 2011, and the Senate-passed version which would have made E-Verify permanent.", "P.L. 111-83 also included language on E-Verify that was in both the House-passed and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2892 to prohibit any funds made available to the DHS Office of the Secretary and Executive Management under the act to be used for any new DHS hires who were not verified through E-Verify (\u00a7533). Other E-Verify provisions in the House-passed or Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2892 were not enacted in P.L. 111-83 . The omitted language included two Senate-passed provisions. One would have allowed any employer participating in E-Verify to verify the employment eligibility of existing employees. The other Senate provision would have directed federal departments and agencies to require, as a condition of contracts they entered into, that the contractors use E-Verify to verify the employment eligibility of all individuals hired during the term of the contract to work in the United States and all individuals (whether new hires or existing employees) assigned to perform work in the United States under the contract.", "Other bills introduced in the 111 th Congress would have more broadly changed existing law on employment verification. For example, the Secure America Through Verification and Enforcement Act of 2009 (SAVE Act; H.R. 3308 ) would have made E-Verify permanent and would have phased in a requirement that all employers use it to verify the employment authorization of new hires and current employees.

There was much debate about whether DHS had sufficient resources to fulfill its border security mission. A number of bills were introduced that would have added resources for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the lead agency at DHS charged with securing U.S. borders at and between official ports of entry (POE). At ports of entry, CBP officers are responsible for conducting immigration, customs, and agricultural inspections on entering aliens. Between ports of entry, the border patrol, a component of CBP, enforces U.S. immigration law and other federal laws along the border. In the course of discharging its duties, the border patrol patrols over 8,000 miles of U.S. international borders with Mexico and Canada and the coastal waters around Florida and Puerto Rico.

The act included $420 million for the construction and modification of ports of entry.", "In response to the drug-related violence on the Mexican side of the Southwest border, Congress appropriated additional resources for border activities. Title VI of the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-32 ) contained $140 million to support activities along the Southwest border with Mexico in response to reports of increasing drug-related violence. This funding included $40 million for CBP for various activities and $5 million for CBP Air and Marine to support additional air operations along the Southwest border.

Within DHS, P.L. 111-230 provided CBP with a total of $306 million, including $39 million for CBP officers at ports of entry on the Southwest border and $10 million to support integrity and background investigation programs. The remaining funding for DHS was to be focused largely on efforts between ports of entry, as discussed below.", "Another CBP-related law, the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-376 ), requires that within two years after enactment all applicants for law enforcement positions within CBP receive polygraph examinations before being hired.

The Administration requested $574 million for the deployment of SBInet-related technologies and infrastructures in FY2011, a decrease of $226 million over the FY2010 enacted level of $800 million. This reduction occurred, in part, because the management and deployment of SBInet had come under scrutiny. DHS Secretary Napolitano ordered a department-wide assessment of the SBInet technology project, but continued to support the deployment of border supervision and protection technologies.", "Additionally, P.L. 111-83 imposed reporting requirements on the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify \"additional border patrol sectors that should be utilizing Operation Streamline programs\" and the resources needed to make the program more effective, and to report on improvements of cross-border inspection processes. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-281 ) included provisions to establish a program in the maritime environment for the mobile biometric identification of suspected individuals, and to conduct a cost analysis of expanding the Coast Guard's biometric identification capabilities for use by other DHS maritime vessels and units. This law also directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to study the use by the Coast Guard and other DHS agencies of a combination of biometric technologies, including facial and iris recognition and emerging biometric technologies, to identify individuals for security purposes. Maritime biometric identification was also the subject of another bill passed by the House ( H.R. 1148 ).", "As mentioned above, P.L. 111-230 provided DHS with a total of $394 million in FY2010 emergency supplemental funding, including $306 million for CBP. The majority of this CBP funding was allocated to border patrol activities between ports of entry, with $176 million provided for additional border patrol agents, $14 million for tactical communications, $32 million for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acquisition and deployment, and $6 million for the construction of forward-operating bases for the border patrol. Outside CBP, the DHS funding in P.L. 111-230 \u00a0included $80 million for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), of which $30 million was directed toward efforts to reduce the threat of violence along the Southwest border and $50 million was for additional ICE personnel.

In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which, among other provisions, explicitly gave the Attorney General broad authority to construct barriers along the border and specified where fencing was to be constructed. In 2008, Congress included provisions in P.L. 110-161 requiring DHS to construct reinforced fencing or other barriers along not less than 700 miles of the Southwest border, in locations where fencing was deemed most practical and effective. In carrying out this requirement, the Secretary was further directed to identify either 370 miles or \"other mileage\" along the Southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective in deterring smugglers and illegal aliens, and to complete construction of fencing in identified areas. Although no legislation to amend this requirement moved beyond committee referral in the 111 th Congress, border fencing continued to be a source of contention in Congress as numerous Members called for the deployment of at least 700 miles of double-layered fencing designed to delay and deter pedestrian crossings.

In the aftermath of failed efforts to enact comprehensive immigration reform in the 110 th Congress, some supporters of comprehensive reform argued for an incremental approach, in which components of reform, such as DREAM Act legislation, would be pursued individually.

Immigrant investors comprise the fifth employment-based preference category, and the visa is commonly referred to as the EB-5 visa. In 1992, a pilot program was authorized under the EB-5 visa category to achieve the economic activity and job creation goals of that category by encouraging investment in economic units known as Regional Centers. These Regional Centers were designed to more easily facilitate investment, as well as target investment toward specific geographic areas. This pilot program has been extended multiple times, most recently through September 30, 2012, by P.L. 111-83 (\u00a7548). The Senate-passed version of the act had included language to permanently reauthorize the EB-5 Regional Center Program but this language was not included in the conference agreement.

In cases where only the first half of the process had been completed (i.e., the immigrant relative petition had been approved), the petition could be revoked where the related application for LPR status had not been granted or where the alien spouse had not been admitted into the United States on an immigrant visa. This penalty resulted from USCIS's interpretation of the statutory definition of \"immediate relative.\" USCIS interpreted the definition to mean that an alien spouse ceased to be married to a U.S. citizen and to be an \"immediate relative\" of a U.S. citizen upon the death of the U.S. citizen spouse. Where a couple had been married at least two years at the time of a U.S. citizen's death, however, USCIS converted the immigrant petition filed by a U.S. citizen for an alien spouse into a self-petition by the surviving spouse.", "The new law enables the surviving alien spouse of a deceased U.S. citizen to self-petition for an immigrant visa/adjustment to LPR status regardless of the length of the marriage as long as the petition is filed within two years of the U.S. citizen's death and the surviving alien spouse has not remarried. As of the date of this report, USCIS has not issued new regulations, although it has issued revised guidelines implementing the new law. USCIS has also issued a draft policy memorandum on which the American Immigration Lawyers Association has commented, but apparently no final memorandum has been issued as of the date of this report. USCIS may extend its practice of converting any pending petitions filed by a U.S. citizen spouse before death into a self-petition for the surviving alien spouse, to include the petitions of previously ineligible alien spouses who were married for less than two years. An alien whose U.S. citizen spouse died before P.L. 111-83 was enacted, and who was previously ineligible to self-petition because of the widow penalty, can now self-petition as long as the petition is filed within two years of October 28, 2009, and the alien has not remarried.", "In addition to repealing the widow penalty, the new law ( P.L. 111-83 , \u00a7568(d)) provides similar relief for surviving relatives who were the beneficiaries or derivative beneficiaries of pending or approved petitions for an immigrant visa/adjustment to LPR status immediately before the death of the relative who was the petitioner or primary beneficiary of the petition. Instead of being terminated or revoked, petitions will be adjudicated despite the death of the relative, as long as the surviving relatives resided in the United States at the time of the death and have continued to reside in the United States. Surviving relatives include the spouse, parent, or minor child of a U.S. citizen; other relatives of a U.S. citizen/LPR eligible for family preference immigrant visas; dependents/derivative beneficiaries of an employment-based immigrant; refugee or asylee relatives; and a dependent/derivative beneficiary of a T (trafficking) or U (crime victim) visa non-immigrant.", "Prior to the repeal of the widow penalty, several lawsuits, including a class-action lawsuit, challenged the widow penalty on the grounds that, under the INA, a widowed, surviving spouse still qualifies as an immediate relative for the purpose of an immigrant petition and related, pending LPR/visa application, and that therefore the petition should not be terminated. Some of these lawsuits reportedly are still pending. The class action lawsuit has been settled in accordance with new USCIS guidelines implementing the new statute, essentially ordering plaintiffs claims to be processed in accordance with the new statute, as implemented under USCIS guidelines. Class members whose petitions/applications have been denied may have their cases reopened without filing a new application or formal motion with the accompanying fees. Class members are persons with petitions/applications pending or adjudicated by administrative or judicial action in the Ninth Circuit or persons who were residing in the Ninth Circuit at the time of the citizen spouse's death.", "The new statute resolves the issue presented in a petition for certiorari arising in the Third Circuit that was pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. The issue presented by the petition was whether a noncitizen spouse is automatically disqualified from classification as a \"spouse\" under the \"immediate relative\" provision of the INA, notwithstanding a duly filed petition by the citizen spouse, where the couple was married for less than two years at the time of the citizen's death and immigration officials had not yet acted on the petition. The new statute reportedly enabled the petitioner in this case to obtain lawful permanent resident status. The petition was subsequently dismissed upon the joint motion of all parties to the case, pursuant to the Court rules. ", "In response to the new statute and the litigation, USCIS has issued (1) a memorandum providing updated guidance for processing immigrant/LPR petitions of surviving spouses of deceased U.S. citizens and amending the USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual, (2) a fact sheet, and (3) an updated petition form.

Established by a 1994 law, this program initially applied to aliens who acquired J status before June 1, 1996.
