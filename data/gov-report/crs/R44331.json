Data Collectors \u2014In some cases the same companies that offer data collection services also offer data management services. They are generally affiliated with other agricultural products (e.g., equipment, seed, or chemicals). Independent Agricultural Data Banks \u2014These are private companies that offer to store, organize, and, in some cases, analyze data for a fee.

This stage is where the actual tools are created and the value of private big data occurs for producers. A combination of big data sources is generally analyzed and packaged into an easily understandable and useful product. These can cover the spectrum of qualitative analytical products: descriptive products (e.g., those that provide a better or more advanced way of looking at an operation); prescriptive products (e.g., those that provide timely recommendations for operation improvement based on real-time and historical data); and predictive products (e.g., those that use current and historical data sets to forecast future events and returns). Depending on the size and complexity, this stage may encompass all three types of analytical products. ", "The primary players and users of private big data products are the farmers and ranchers themselves. Other interested parties, however, recognize the value of big data and the ways it can be used beyond improving an individual operation (e.g., retail, marketing, or environmental improvement). Examples of key players in the use of private big data include", "Farmers and Ranchers \u2014The end user of private big data is frequently the farmer or rancher from which the data originated. The value is derived from a big data product that offers improved production (e.g., lower costs, increased yields, or reduced inputs). Retailers \u2014These are the creators of the big data products themselves. They derive value by analyzing the data, packaging it into a useable and timely product, and selling it to the producer. In some cases these are parties from other stages (i.e., data collectors or data managers) or retailers of other products (e.g., equipment and seed companies) or both. Increasingly, retailers themselves might find value in big data or the products they create separate from the value derived from the producer. It is generally these groups that advocate for big data to get bigger in order to create a greater value for themselves and consumers. Industry Groups \u2014The terms and uses of big data are often confusing and not well defined. Producer concerns related to privacy, security, and ownership abound, leaving many producers to look toward national commodity and agricultural industry groups for guidance regarding licensing language and data contracts. These groups are frequently active in establishing standards and issuing guidance for members on how to navigate big data. Environmental Interests \u2014Economics is only one benefit from the use of private agricultural big data. The power of technology and information can also result in a positive environmental effect through reduced inputs (e.g., fertilizer, pesticides, and water) and efficiencies (e.g., reduced air emissions through reduced tillage overlap). This has caused various environmental interests to pay attention to agricultural big data and in some cases become active players."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Benefits", "paragraphs": ["As the use of private big data continues to expand, the number and scope of benefits continue to grow. Examples of observed benefits include", "Production Benefits \u2014The number of benefits created by private big data\u2014from increases in yields and greater efficiencies to reduced costs, inputs, and farm risk\u2014continues to grow. Most of these benefits are directly received by the producers themselves through increased profits; however, spillover effects from increased farm revenue and environmental sustainability are also possible. Environmental Benefits \u2014Similar to production benefits, the environmental benefits of private big data continue to develop. On-farm environmental benefits, including improved soil quality and water availability, can further benefit production as well as the environment. The reduction of inputs, including pesticides, fertilizer, water, and energy, often results in off-farm benefits through improved water quality and biodiversity. New and Expanded Business Opportunities \u2014The rise of big data and the advances in technology have created a number of new business opportunities around its use. While much of the attention has been directed at the creation of these large, prescriptive, analytic tools, other businesses have developed around or been modified by one or more aspects of the farming operation. For example, in the custom applicator industry, the use of big data allows the third party (i.e., custom applicator) to invest in the technology in order to provide a more precise application of various inputs as a service. For instance, instead of producers investing in the equipment required for certain big data collection, they may contract with another party who can use the same equipment and networks to determine and apply required amounts of inputs. Real Time \u2014Advances in technology have led to the real-time collection and processing of data and congruently to the ability to receive real-time decisionmaking tools. This can further expedite decisionmaking and possibly lead to increases in automation.

The complex nature of big data and the pace with which it is moving have created much confusion in the industry. This has led to a number of challenges for production agriculture and raises questions about whether the industry can manage these challenges and whether there is a role for federal involvement. Examples of challenges include", "Ownership \u2014This is a widely discussed concern within the agricultural community. Many believe that the owner of private big data is obvious; it is the producer from which it is collected. This is not always true, however, because of how the data moves through the different stages of collection, management, and use. For example, when data is analyzed and provided to the producer during the use stage as a decision tool for their operation, the producer would seemingly be the clear owner because they derive the most value from the data's use. It is not that simple, however, because that same data might also have value to a third party who is able to aggregate it and analyze it for a different purpose (e.g., a company might be interested in seed, yield, and input rates for determining future pricing of their product). Therefore the answer to the question of ownership generally lies in who owns and controls the value of the data. As previously discussed, raw, large data sets frequently hold little value to the end consumer. It is the combination of this data with that of quantitative analytics that creates the value. Other questions also include the following: who owns the secondary and tertiary uses of the data; can this ownership be limited or expanded, and in what way; who is the owner if the data is collected under a separate contract (e.g., custom harvesting or custom applicator); and are the ownership rights of the landowner different from the producer when they are not the same party; what are the options, if any, to not having or limiting data collection? Privacy \u2014Agricultural production presents unique challenges related to localized competition for resources (e.g., access to land and water). In many cases neighbors are competing against one another for access to such resources. The concern of privacy is one that most producers acknowledge in the context of big data. Information related to yields and performance can hold incredible value. The independent nature of farming tends to drive privacy concerns. While most concerns are in respect to market competition, there are an increasing number of privacy concerns related to regulatory and non-agricultural interest groups coming into possession of a producer's data. Security \u2014Many producers are concerned about the security implications of big data getting bigger and requiring the use of more advanced networks. As previously discussed, concerns about security and privacy have resulted in producers opting to store their data locally rather than through a third party or in a cloud computing environment. In some ways, however, this reduces the value of the data because in most cases, the bigger the data set, the greater the additional value created. With recent security breaches in both the public and private sectors it may be unreasonable to believe that all data is fully secure. Market \u2014Unbalanced access to information can frequently distort the marketplace. Some speculate that the use of yield or sales data could create a market advantage for some input companies (e.g., seed and fertilizer companies). Others are concerned that big data will increase the competitiveness of rental agreements, while others see the potential for big data to affect commodity markets. Expense \u2014Similar to the discussion under public big data, the collection, management, and analysis of data are not free. The use of big data products can come at a cost, albeit one which larger operations are able to afford with the anticipation of higher returns. Smaller operators, however, may face challenges related to economies of scale given the high price of equipment and services related to big data. Arguments have also been made that while some private big data products offer greater returns with greater investment, some smaller companies present small operators with options to capture the benefits of big data through more affordable technologies and services. Infrastructure \u2014Recent surveys and studies indicate that, in general, rural areas tend to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment. In the context of big data, the ability to send and receive data as well as the speed with which this occurs is central to its use and adoption. The federal government has played a role in addressing rural broadband infrastructure through financial assistance programs and spectrum policy for wireless connectivity. Technology System Failure \u2014Users of technology know that it can be wonderful until it stops working. Basic system failures and limitations will continue to be a challenge for big data. In some cases the collection of the wrong data or inaccurate data can lead to poor decisions, rather than improved ones. Technology Adoption \u2014The adoption of technology itself could prove a hurdle for the agricultural industry. While some producers are open to the adoption of technology on their operations, the sector's aging producer population may be slow to adopt it.
