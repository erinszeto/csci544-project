The 1964 Economic Report of the President, in Chapter 2, \"The Problem of Poverty in America,\" used a flat figure of $3,000 for families, and $1,500 for individuals not in families, to represent the poverty line. However, research on poverty measurement using a more detailed measure of need began before the Johnson Administration announced the War on Poverty. In the early 1960s, Mollie Orshansky, an analyst at the Social Security Administration, had been conducting her own analysis of poverty using food costs. Rather than attempting to compute the costs of all major goods and services a family would need to live, the Orshansky thresholds were based on the Economy Food Plan, developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Economy Food Plan indicated the money that a family under economic stress would need to spend on food for \"temporary or emergency use when funds are low.\" The food plan used different amounts of food (and in turn, different costs of food) for males and females by age group, based on recommended dietary allowances. Orshansky condensed the full detail by specific age groups and for males and females into amounts that varied by family size, number of children under 18, and whether the family head was older than 65. Having obtained the cost of food by family size and composition, Orshansky then derived the amounts of total family income by finding the average percentage of it that families spent on food. According to the USDA's 1955 Household Food Consumption Survey, families spent an average of one-third of their income on food; therefore, multiplying the family food costs by three provided figures for total family income. For two-person families, a factor of 3.7, rather than 3, was used in order to capture the higher fixed costs faced by smaller families. Income amounts for individuals not in families were set at 80% of the amounts for two-person families.", "Apart from three minor methodological revisions, the above methodology undergirds the official poverty thresholds as they are used today.

This same ratio, when expressed as a percentage, conveys a measure of the severity of poverty. A ratio of exactly one is the same as \"100% of the poverty level,\" and is the minimum amount to be considered \"not in poverty.\" A ratio of less than 50% (or 0.5) has been characterized as \"severe poverty\" or \"deep poverty\" and indicates that resources are less than half the measure of need. Other ratios, such as 200% of poverty (twice the poverty level), have been used for measuring the low-income population intended to be the target beneficiaries of some programs, such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The higher the ratio is, the higher the income amount will be, and therefore more people will fall below that amount. These ratios, called \"income-to-poverty ratios,\" convey the sense that economic well-being is not binary (poor versus not poor), but rather it falls along a spectrum."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Whose Resources and Needs? Defining the Family Unit", "paragraphs": ["In the poverty measures discussed in this report, resources and needs are defined for family units. The information used to identify family relationships comes from household surveys, and varies from survey to survey. The CPS ASEC, which is used for the official poverty estimates for the nation as a whole, uses a detailed questionnaire administered by trained representatives, and asks about the relationships among all household members. ", "Because the information comes from household surveys, there are limitations to which populations can be measured. The CPS ASEC is conducted primarily for households, but also includes some noninstitutional group quarters, such as emergency shelters and group homes. Persons who are homeless are only included in the poverty estimates if they are living in shelters. Institutional group quarters, such as prisons and nursing homes, are not included, and therefore neither the incarcerated population nor those in other institutions are included in poverty estimates. College students living in dormitories are only included in poverty estimates if information about them is reported in an interview at their parents' home. Students living in households off-campus, however, are included. Military personnel are included only if they live in a household with at least one civilian adult.", "In the official poverty measure, people related to each other by birth, marriage, or adoption are considered to be related. Foster children under age 15 who have not been legally adopted are excluded. In the CPS ASEC, children under age 15 are not asked questions about income; thus, income is unknown for any child under 15 whose family relationship is not tied to an older relative in the household whose income is known. The unrelated individuals under age 15 (mostly foster children) are not considered to be \"poor\" or \"nonpoor,\" and their removal from the total prevents them from having an effect on poverty rates (the percentage of the total that is poor). Unmarried domestic partners are regarded as belonging to separate family units in the official definition of poverty, and their poverty statuses are computed accordingly. ", "It is therefore important in measuring poverty that the data source provide information to identify family relationships\u2014who is related, and who is not\u2014and can provide a means to match income amounts with specific family units. The family relationship data available through the survey can thus affect how individuals' poverty status is determined, as does the definition of poverty used.

The poverty thresholds are not adjusted to reflect geographic variations in costs. 2. Owing to the limitations of the source data available at the time the official measure was developed, its resource measure is based on money income before taxes, while most individuals pay for their basic necessities using after-tax income. This represents an important disconnection between the way needs were specified in the thresholds and the definition of resources available for meeting those needs. 3. The official measure captures the effects of some but not all government programs intended to provide relief for the poor. The programs that are captured are those based on money income before taxes: Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and any state or local relief programs based on money income. The programs that are not captured are the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which, despite its large effects for low-income workers, is not captured because it is a tax credit and is only reflected in after-tax income; and a host of noncash benefits such as SNAP, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), public housing subsidies, and subsidized medical care. 4. The official measure does not capture the needs incurred, nor the resources brought in, by household members who are not related by birth, marriage, or adoption; these include unmarried partners and their children (if any are present), and foster children not legally adopted. 5. While the official measure is adjusted for overall inflation, it does not adequately consider the extent to which the prices of basic necessities have shifted in relation to all goods and services. Therefore, it can be argued that the inflation adjustment used in the official measure does not accurately reflect the purchasing power needed, in a practical sense, to remain comparable with those at the poverty line in previous decades."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Supplemental Poverty Measure", "paragraphs": ["There has been broad agreement among poverty scholars that the limitations noted above represent serious drawbacks to the official poverty measure, and also that fixing them has not been a straightforward task. Experts within the federal government, in universities, and in private research institutions have spent decades developing approaches to address these shortcomings, and evaluating the effectiveness of those approaches. In 2009, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) convened an Interagency Technical Working Group (ITWG) to consolidate the research and propose a single Supplemental Poverty Measure, which would be used for research purposes only. The ITWG did not recommend supplanting the official poverty measure, nor did it recommend using the Supplemental Poverty Measure for administrative purposes. Comments on the Supplemental Poverty Measure were solicited through a Federal Register notice. Pursuant to research recommendations, the Supplemental Poverty Measure focused on ensuring that the definition of need specified in the thresholds, and the resources available to meet those needs, were consistent with each other.

Three sets of thresholds were developed\u2014those for renters, homeowners with a mortgage, and homeowners without a mortgage\u2014to take account of housing costs, given that it can vary widely between these groups. The thresholds are geographically adjusted using housing data from the American Community Survey (ACS), because its large sample size enables it to provide detail for areas smaller than states. The equivalence scale for the new thresholds uses three factors to adjust for family size: (1) children on average consume less than adults; (2) as family size increases, some expenses like food or clothing increase additively with each person but other fixed expenses like housing do not; and (3) the first child in a single-parent family represents a greater increase in costs than the first child in a two-adult family.

The values of noncash benefits were estimated, to reflect resources available for meeting the food and housing costs specified in the thresholds and to capture the effect of government programs intended to help the poor meet those needs. Additionally, work-related expenses were subtracted from income, as the money that a person applies toward his or her job cannot be used to meet the needs in the threshold. These expenses include transportation to and from work, child care (capped at the amount earned by working), and any miscellaneous costs that workers are required to pay as part of their job. Medical out-of-pocket expenses were also subtracted from income, such as co-pays at doctor's offices, insurance premiums, and deductibles. This approach was intended to capture that medical costs in many cases are not optional and must be paid in order for basic needs to be met\u2014and therefore money applied toward those costs is not available for meeting other basic needs\u2014but also that a person who incurs a large amount of health care costs that are paid for by government or private insurance should not be viewed as wealthier than a healthy person with otherwise identical needs and resources. As a result, the Supplemental Poverty Measure does not capture the full effects of Medicare and Medicaid on the poor population, because the health care needs that those programs address are not the same as the economic needs that are incurred on a recurring and predictable basis specified in the thresholds (i.e., food, clothing, shelter, and utilities).

Because the CPS is administered using professional interviewers with computerized questionnaires, the CPS ASEC is able to gather more detail from respondents with greater accuracy than other surveys that rely on the respondents to fill out paper questionnaires.

As a result, they are not well-suited to measure the changes in a particular respondent's poverty status over time\u2014or for that matter, changes to other social or economic conditions that he or she may experience such as changes in marital status, changes in the number of children in his or her family, obtaining or losing work, changes in his or her health insurance coverage or health status, receiving or no longer receiving government assistance, changing residence, etc.", "A longitudinal survey is one that follows the same respondents over a series of interviews. Longitudinal poverty data have been available from the SIPP since 1984. The length of the time over which respondents have been interviewed has varied through the years, and has usually lasted from two to four years. By using SIPP longitudinal data, researchers have been able to identify characteristics of both the short-term and long-term poverty populations, the percentage of people who enter or leave poverty, and the average number of months a person stays in poverty.", "In order to measure the initial effects of welfare reform under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), longitudinal data were needed for the same respondents from both before and after welfare reform took effect. The SPD was created by selecting households from the 1992 and 1993 SIPP Panels for an additional five years of interviews, from 1997 to 2002.", "The households that were in sample before the passage of PRWORA in 1996 and chosen for the SPD are no longer being interviewed, and in that sense the SPD has concluded. However, interest in the dynamics of poverty and program participation and in evaluating welfare reform continues, and is funded through mandatory spending in the Health and Human Services budget. Since the end of the original SPD panel, these dynamics have been and continue to be measured in the SIPP.

These are different from the Census Bureau's poverty thresholds shown in Table 1 . Unlike the measures discussed in this report, the poverty guidelines are not used to count the number of people or families in poverty. Rather, they are used for administrative purposes, such as determining whether an individual or a family qualifies for programmatic assistance.", "Programs sometimes use different multiples of the poverty guidelines for determining eligibility. For instance, under the National School Lunch Program, a child qualifies for free lunch if his or her household's income is less than 130% of (that is, 1.3 times) the poverty guidelines, and qualifies for a reduced-price lunch if his or her household income is 185% of (that is, 1.85 times) the poverty guidelines. These poverty guidelines are referenced in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981.", "The HHS poverty guidelines are not used to measure the poverty population, and therefore this report does not refer to them as a poverty \"measure.\" Because both the poverty guidelines and the poverty thresholds are issued by federal agencies, either set of dollar amounts could conceivably be called the \"federal poverty level\" (FPL), and thus that term is ambiguous. Which dollar amounts are to be used depends on the context: thresholds for obtaining counts of the population in poverty; or guidelines for administrative use, particularly with regard to an individual's or family's program eligibility. To clarify, the official poverty measure discussed in this report is based on the poverty thresholds that are computed and published by the Census Bureau, and are used for statistical purposes. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Simplification of the Poverty Thresholds for Administrative Use", "paragraphs": ["As explained earlier, the official poverty thresholds were based on empirical measures of dietary need, the amount that a family in economic distress might need to spend on food in order to attempt to meet its dietary needs, and the spending patterns of families across the income distribution (to determine what percentage of an average family's budget was spent on food). However, this method yielded dozens of thresholds that were not evenly stepped by family size. As the War on Poverty developed, a set of dollar amounts was needed for practical administrative use. The HHS poverty guidelines serve that purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development of the Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["The HHS poverty guidelines do not directly reflect family needs as measured by food cost and family spending data because they were simplified for administrative use. Beginning in 1965, the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) began to issue poverty guidelines that were based on the poverty thresholds, but with one dollar amount per family size (and at that time, farm/non-farm status). These earliest OEO dollar amounts, which were the predecessors of the HHS poverty guidelines, were averages of the poverty thresholds that Orshansky developed. To obtain one dollar amount per family size, OEO averaged the thresholds that had the same family size but different compositions, weighted the average to reflect that not all family compositions occurred with equal frequency, and rounded to the nearest $5. A 1967 OEO memo introduced guidelines that were rounded to the nearest $100 and adjusted so that family size increments were evenly spaced by the same dollar amount. Like that of OEO, current HHS practice also applies rounding, but instead of rounding to the nearest $100, the difference between family sizes is computed first, rounded to the nearest $20, and then used to compute the guidelines for each family size, starting from a rounded figure for a four-person family as the base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Release of Inflation-Adjustment of the Guidelines to Support Programmatic Use", "paragraphs": ["The HHS poverty guidelines are published every winter, typically in late January or early February. They are computed using the weighted average thresholds published by the Census Bureau in its annual poverty release the previous fall, inflated forward to the current year using the Consumer Price Index. The steps to even out the differences between family sizes, and apply rounding, are performed after the inflation adjustment. By applying the inflation adjustment to the poverty thresholds from the previous year, HHS is able to publish the guidelines for the current year six to eight months before the Census Bureau releases that year's survey estimates, and thus they can be used by program administrators that much sooner.
