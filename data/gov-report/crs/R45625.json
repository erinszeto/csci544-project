For example, a 2018 study analyzed various impacts of four carbon tax rate scenarios: a $25/metric ton of CO2 and $50/metric ton of CO2 carbon tax, increasing annually by 1% and 5%. The study concluded that each of the scenarios would likely achieve the U.S. GHG emission reduction target pledged under the international Paris Agreement (at least in terms of CO2 emissions).", "A carbon tax system would generate a new revenue stream, the magnitude of which would depend on the scope and rate of the tax, among other factors. In 2018, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that a $25/metric ton carbon tax would yield approximately $100 billion in its first year. CBO projected that federal revenue would total $3.5 trillion in FY2019.", "Policymakers would face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of the new carbon tax revenues. Congress could apply revenues to support a range of policy objectives but would encounter trade-offs among the objectives. The central trade-offs involve minimizing economy-wide costs, lessening the costs borne by specific groups\u2014particularly low-income households and displaced workers in certain industries (e.g., coal mining)\u2014and supporting other policy objectives.", "A primary argument against a carbon tax regards it potential economy-wide impacts, often measured as impacts to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Some may argue that projected impacts should be compared with the climate benefits achieved from the program as well as the estimated costs of taking no action. The potential impacts would depend on a number of factors, including the program's magnitude and design and, most importantly, the use of carbon tax revenues.", "In general, economic literature finds that some of the revenue applications would reduce the economy-wide costs from a carbon tax but may not eliminate them entirely. In addition, some studies cite particular economic modeling scenarios in which certain carbon tax revenue applications produce a net increase in GDP compared to a baseline scenario. These scenarios involve using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in other tax rates (e.g., corporate income or payroll taxes). Although economic models generally indicate that these particular revenue applications would yield the greatest benefit to the economy overall, the models also find that lower-income households would likely face a disproportionate impact under such an approach. As lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their income on energy needs (electricity, gasoline), these households are expected to experience disproportionate impacts from a carbon tax if revenues were not recycled back to them in some fashion (e.g., lump-sum distribution).", "A price on GHG emissions could create a competitive disadvantage for some industries, particularly \"emission-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\" Policymakers have several options to address this concern, including establishing a \"border carbon adjustment\" program, which would levy a fee on imports from countries without comparable GHG reduction programs. Alternatively, policymakers could allocate (indefinitely or for a period of time) some of the carbon tax revenues to selected industry sectors or businesses. Relatedly, a carbon tax system is projected to disproportionately impact fossil fuel industries, particularly coal, and the communities that rely on their employment.

", "A carbon tax may apply to CO 2 emissions alone, which account for most U.S. GHG emissions, or to multiple GHGs. Carbon tax proposals that apply only to CO 2 generally attach a price to a metric ton of CO 2 emissions (mtCO 2 ). Some sources emit non-CO 2 GHGs, such as methane, nitrous oxides, and sulfur hexafluoride. GHG emissions from these sources could be addressed by attaching a price to a metric ton of CO 2 emissions-equivalent (mtCO 2 e). This term of measure is used because GHGs vary by global warming potential (GWP). At these sources, the determined GWP values would be an important issue.", "Policymakers may consider limiting the tax to sectors or sources that emit above a certain percentage of total U.S. GHG emissions, many of which currently report their emissions to the government. For more than 20 years, monitoring devices or systems have been installed in smokestacks of most large facilities, such as power plants, which are required to periodically report emissions data to EPA. In addition, since 2010, EPA has collected annual emissions data from approximately 8,000 facilities that directly release above certain amounts of GHG emissions. Using these established monitoring frameworks, policymakers could employ a \"downstream\" approach, applying a carbon tax at the point where the GHGs from these facilities are released to the atmosphere. ", "Alternatively, the tax could be applied to reliable proxies for emissions, such as emission inputs. For example, the carbon content of fossil fuels\u2014coal, natural gas, petroleum\u2014can serve as a proxy for the emissions released when the fuels are combusted. Applying a tax on emission inputs allows for the consideration of various points of taxation. For instance, emission inputs could be taxed at \"upstream\" (e.g., wells) or \"midstream\" stages in that process (e.g., refineries), the latter allowing for potential tax administration advantages that may be provided by specific infrastructure chokepoints in the fossil fuel market. For example, with respect to petroleum, the number of upstream sources\u2014wells that produce crude oil\u2014is over 445,000, but the number of midstream sources\u2014facilities that refine crude oil\u2014is only 137. ", " Table A-1 (in Appendix A) lists the top GHG emission sources in the United States. These sources combined to account for approximately 95% of U.S. GHG emissions in 2016. Table A-1 identifies the number of entities for each source category (e.g., number of coal mines, number of steel production facilities) and the percentage of total U.S. GHG emissions the category contributes. ", "In the case of fossil fuel combustion\u2014which accounted for 76% of total U.S. GHG emissions\u2014the table provides several options for segmenting the universe of sources if policymakers choose to implement a carbon tax. It identifies the number of entities that might be subject to the carbon tax under a particular option (pending any exclusions). For example, policymakers could address fossil fuel combustion emissions by applying a carbon tax to fossil fuels (based on their carbon content) at the following entities, which include both upstream and midstream infrastructure chokepoints:", "137 petroleum refineries (based on 2017 data) and 166 petroleum importers (based on 2018 data); 671 coal mines and eight companies supplying imported coal (based on 2017 data); and 1,679 entities that report natural gas deliveries to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Form EIA-176 and 123 natural gas fractionators (based on 2016 data).", "Some of the above points of taxation might take advantage of the administrative frameworks for existing federal excise taxes.

The net benefits would be the avoided net damages (i.e., costs) of climate change. The estimates of net benefits of avoided emissions often rely on analyses of the social cost of carbon (SC-CO 2 ) or the social cost of greenhouse gases (SC-GHG ). Therefore, policymakers could use SC-CO 2 measurements\u2014as the basis for an estimate of the net benefits of a marginal change in emissions\u2014to set the rate of a carbon tax or emissions fee.", "One potential challenge of relying on SC-CO 2 estimates to set a carbon fee are methodological concerns. For example, the existing estimates in peer-reviewed research cover a wide range. In addition, some argue that the underlying simulation models for estimating the SC-CO 2 values are insufficient. For any level of emissions, the projected increase in global average temperature may cover multiple degrees Fahrenheit, and other measures of climate change, such as precipitation patterns, may encompass directional uncertainties. No estimates of impacts are comprehensive at this time, and many of the risks are difficult to estimate and value.", "When valuing the SC-CO 2 , analysts encounter a range of views on methods and assumptions, and establishing study parameters may be challenging. For example, estimates of the monetary values of climate change impacts may be difficult or controversial to estimate, such as the monetary values associated with human deaths or sickness. A related framework question is whether to include global climate impacts or just domestic impacts.", "In addition, the element of time in climate change impacts particularly complicates the valuation. The fact that many impacts of climate change will occur in the distant future requires consideration of society's willingness to pay in the near term to reduce emissions that would cause future damages, mostly to future generations. To take time into account, economists discount future values to a calculated \"present value.\" Economists do not agree on the appropriate discount rate(s) to use for a multi-generational, largely nonmarket issue such as human-induced climate change. The choice of discount rate can significantly increase or decrease values of the SC-CO 2 . A low discount rate would give greater value today to future impacts than would a higher discount rate. High discount rates can reduce the value today of future climate change impacts to a small fraction of their undiscounted values. A high discount rate would recommend applying fewer of today's resources to addressing climate change impacts in the future. ", "Since 2008, federal agencies have used SC-CO 2 estimates in dozens of final rulemakings as a method to estimate the net benefits of abating CO 2 emissions. An Interagency Working Group prepared SC-CO 2 estimates, which were updated over time and subjected to expert and public comment. On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13783, \"Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth,\" which effectively withdrew the federal SC-CO 2 estimates. Nonetheless, federal agencies have used new, interim values generated by EPA in 2017, modified from the withdrawn technical support documents, in regulatory and other decisions. Legislation could set a carbon price citing any of these SC-CO 2 values or others available from nonfederal researchers or prescribe methods for estimating new ones. ", "Using SC-CO 2 estimates to set the tax rate would involve a cost-benefit framework. Although many posit that a cost-benefit framework remains the best option, some economists argue that a cost-benefit framework may be inappropriate for climate change policy for these reasons ", "Many experts expect climate change\u2014and policies to address it\u2014to cause nonmarginal changes to economies and ecosystems. The changes are expected to increase disproportionately with incremental climate change with a potential for crossing critical \"tipping points\" after which systems change dramatically and rapidly. Climate change impacts are multi-generational, and uncertainty and disagreement exists about whether and how to assign a present value to social costs and benefits over generations.

Advantages of this approach include providing an opportunity for consumers and investors to adjust their behavior before the higher tax rates go into effect, such as purchasing more energy efficient appliances or investing in low-emissions technologies.

A central concern is that a U.S. carbon tax could raise U.S. prices more than the prices of goods manufactured abroad, potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for some domestic businesses. Certain businesses may become less profitable, lose market share, and reduce jobs. ", "The industries generally expected to experience disproportionate impacts under a U.S. carbon tax are often described as \"emission-intensive, trade-exposed\" industries. An industry's CO 2 emission intensity is a function of both direct CO 2 emissions from its manufacturing process (e.g., CO 2 from cement or steel production) and indirect CO 2 emissions from the inputs to the manufacturing process (e.g., electricity, natural gas). Such industries are likely to experience greater cost increases than less carbon intensive industries, all else being equal. In general, trade-exposed industries are those that face greater international competition compared to other domestic industries. A carbon tax could present a particular challenge for these industries, because they might be less able to pass along the tax in the form of higher prices, because they may lose global market share\u2014and jobs\u2014to competitors in countries lacking comparable carbon policies.", "Policymakers might consider approaches to mitigate these potential economic impacts in several ways. One approach that has received interest in recent years is a border adjustment mechanism, which is often described as a border carbon adjustment (BCA) in the carbon tax context. A BCA would apply a tariff to emission-intensive, imported goods such as steel, aluminum, cement, and certain chemicals. Each of the carbon price proposals in the 115 th Congress would have established a BCA to address emission-intensive imports.", "Another rationale for adding a BCA to a carbon tax system is the possibility that it would encourage other nations to adopt comparable carbon price policies. Many of the recently proposed BCA mechanisms allow for exemptions for nations with comparable programs.", "To date, no nations have implemented a BCA as part of their climate change policies. Establishing an economically efficient BCA would likely present substantial challenges. For example, policymakers must decide which goods and/or industries would be covered by a BCA and how the adjustment program would assess the comparability of varied climate-related policies in other nations. In addition, accurately determining and verifying the volume of GHG emissions embodied in a particular imported product would be data intensive and challenging. To alleviate some of the measurement complexity, policymakers could limit the program to selected industries and apply default values and assumptions to particular manufacturing processes. However, this simplified approach could result in less accurate import price adjustments, which could potentially affect the accuracy of GHG emission reductions achieved by the carbon tax program. Another option would be to allow companies to provide measured, independently verified emissions data as an alternative to default values.", "In addition, the border adjustment approach would likely raise concerns of violating international trade rules. Further, some researchers have highlighted the potential for unintended consequences from a BCA. For example, some studies have found that a border adjustment may lead to lower net exports than the carbon price alone, due to the adjustment's terms-of-trade effect on U.S. currency. These issues are beyond the scope of this report, but some of the concerns may be lessened to some degree if a larger number of nations establish comparable emission reduction policies, as many have agreed to do under the Paris Agreement. ", "Another possible rationale for a BCA is to address the concern of \"emissions leakage\" (or \"carbon leakage\"). Emissions leakage \"occurs when economic activity is shifted as a result of the emission control regulation [e.g., a carbon tax program] and, as a result, emission abatement achieved in one location that is subject to emission control regulation is [diminished] by increased emissions in unregulated locations.\" The concern of emissions leakage has been central in the debate over whether the United States (or any nation) should unilaterally address GHG emissions. A BCA may diminish the potential for emissions leakage by reducing the incentive to shift economic activity to a nation without a comparable carbon tax. However, some recent studies raise questions regarding the degree to which emissions leakage would be a concern under a unilateral U.S. carbon tax.

", "Carbon tax revenues could be treated as general fund revenue without a dedication to a specific purpose in the enacting legislation (i.e., subject to the annual appropriations process), or policymakers could state that the new revenues would support deficit (or debt) reduction. Alternatively, the enacting legislation could return the tax revenue to the economy in some manner, sometimes called \"revenue recycling.\" All of the carbon tax legislative proposals in recent Congresses have proposed some manner of revenue recycling, specifically directing the carbon tax revenue to support specific policy objectives.

A large body of economic literature has examined the economic impacts of hypothetical carbon tax programs, particularly the impacts of using the carbon tax revenues for different purposes. Many of the economic studies cited below were prepared prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA, P.L. 115-97 ). Signed by President Trump in December 2017, the act changed various elements of the U.S. federal tax system. In particular, the act lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As discussed below, adjusting the corporate income tax rate is one of the central policy options generally considered in carbon tax economic literature both before and after enactment of P.L. 115-97 .

This outcome is inherent to the carbon tax, as its purpose is to increase the relative price of the more carbon-intensive energy sources compared to less carbon-intensive alternatives, encourage innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies, and promote other activity (e.g., energy efficiency) that may decrease emissions. These expected outcomes will have some economy-wide impacts.

Fewer studies have examined deficit reduction scenarios, because \"modeling the effects of budget deficits is much more difficult than modeling the effects of tax cuts.\" Some studies have concluded that using tax revenues for this purpose would help alleviate economy-wide costs from a carbon tax because of the reduced need to impose distortionary taxes in the future. These studies indicate that the economy-wide benefit would be delayed and its realization assumes policymakers would, sometime in the future, address the deficit by raising taxes.", "Many recent legislative proposals would distribute the carbon tax revenue back to households in lump-sum payments. Policymakers have generally included this carbon tax revenue application to address distribution impacts (discussed below). These payments could take multiple forms. Economic analyses typically assume an equal payment to individuals or households regardless of their income or location or the effects of the carbon price on them individually. Alternatively, payments could be targeted or scaled to different segments of the population.", "Among the options mentioned above, economic studies indicate that using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in existing, distortionary taxes would be the most economically efficient use of the revenues and yield the greatest benefit to the economy overall.

This study assessed the GDP impacts under a $50/mtCO 2 e carbon tax (starting in 2020 and increasing by 2% annually) that would apply to CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and methane emissions from fossil fuel production activities. The figure compares projected GDP impacts under a baseline scenario (i.e., no carbon tax) with three carbon tax revenue applications: a payroll tax rate reduction tax swap, a lump-sum distribution to households, and a scenario that would use tax revenue to reduce the national debt for 10 years and then use revenues for a lump-sum distribution to households. The figure projects GDP impacts in 2020, 2024, 2029, and 2039.

Policymakers and stakeholders may have different perspectives regarding whether the magnitude of the GDP impacts are significant. In addition, GDP impact estimates may be presented in several ways. For example, one could compare the differences in GDP value for a particular year between carbon tax scenarios and a baseline scenario. This approach is employed in the above figure. Alternatively, one could present the GDP losses with a cumulative measure.

The uncertainty of resulting emissions may lead some stakeholders to disfavor a carbon tax or fee option to control GHG emissions. Although uncertain emissions are inherent with a carbon tax approach, Congress could employ certain design elements to enhance the emission control certainty. For example, the existing GHG emission reporting data could be used to track the impact and performance of a carbon price. If policymakers determine that emission reduction is not occurring at a desired pace, the price could be amended. Legislation could establish the conditions and process by which price changes could occur.", "Some may argue that adjusting the carbon price to reflect actual emissions performance would undermine the benefits of price certainty. Others may point out that unplanned adjustments to the carbon price could be politically unpalatable. For example, it may be difficult for policymakers to increase the tax rate, especially during periods of high energy prices. Some have suggested that Congress authorize an independent board or agency with the mandate to modify the tax rate administratively in order to meet pre-determined emission reduction objectives. Although this approach would likely improve emission certainty, long-term price certainty may be sacrificed to some degree, depending on the authority of the delegated entity to adjust the tax rate.

As of 2016, the transportation sector contributes the largest percentage (36%) of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, with electric power second at 35%. Carbon tax analyses generally agree that the majority of the emission reductions resulting from a carbon tax program would occur in the electricity sector. By comparison, economic models generally conclude that a carbon tax would have much less of an impact on emissions in the transportation sector. Several factors explain this projected outcome. The transportation sector offers fewer opportunities to switch to less carbon-intensive fuels in the short term than does the electric power sector, which can displace coal with natural gas relatively quickly. In addition, short-term emission changes in the transportation sector are largely influenced by changes in driving demand, which has historically been relatively insensitive to gasoline price increases.
