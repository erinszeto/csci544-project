The CCC has also beenthe funding source for a large portion of emergency supplemental spending over theyears, particularly for ad-hoc farm disaster payments, and direct market losspayments to growers of various commodities which have been provided in responseto low farm commodity prices. ", "The CCC must eventually repay the funds it borrows from the Treasury. Because the CCC never earns more than it spends, its losses must be replenishedperiodically through a congressional appropriation so that its $30 billion borrowingauthority (debt limit) is not depleted, which would render the corporation unable tofunction. Congress generally provides this infusion through the regular annualUSDA appropriation law. Because of the degree of difficulty in estimating itsfunding needs, which is complicated by crop and weather conditions and otheruncontrollable variables, the CCC in recent years has received a \"current indefiniteappropriation,\" which in effect allows the CCC to receive \"such sums as arenecessary\" during the fiscal year for previous years' losses and current year's losses.

A general provision in the final consolidated appropriations act requires the Secretaryof Agriculture to more diligently support the farm price of milk at the farmbill-mandated support price of $9.90 per hundredweight (cwt.). Under the dairy pricesupport program, USDA indirectly supports the farm price of milk by standing readyto purchase surplus cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk from processors at a price thatshould allow the processors to pay at least the support price to farmers for the milkused in the manufacturing of those products. Supporters of this provision argued thatthe government purchase prices for surplus dairy products are set too low by USDAto support the farm price of milk at $9.90 per cwt. Late in 2002 and in early in 2003the market price of farm milk used for cheese fell below the $9.90 support price foreight consecutive months. USDA officials say they are evaluating the situation andpoint out that the authorizing statute for the dairy price support program ( P.L.107-171 , the 2002 farm bill) requires USDA to set dairy purchase prices so that theannual farm milk price on average is supported at $9.90, not the monthly price.

The annualagriculture appropriations bill makes two separate appropriations for the federal cropinsurance program. It provides discretionary funding for the salaries and expensesof the RMA. It also provides \"such sums as are necessary\" for the Federal CropInsurance Fund, which funds all other expenses of the program, including premiumsubsidies, indemnity payments, and reimbursements to the private insurancecompanies.

As is customary, the final consolidated appropriations act ( P.L. 108-199 ) concurs with the Administration'sestimate and provides \"such sums as may be necessary\" for the fund. Legislativeenhancements ( P.L. 106-224 ) made to the crop insurance program in 2000 greatlyincreased the federal subsidy of insurance premiums.

According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, enactment ofthis proposal would have saved $81 million in FY2004.

P.L. 108-199 concurs with theAdministration proposals for the Dam Rehabilitation Program, the Ground andSurface Water Conservation Program, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, andthe Farmland Protection Program (now called the Farm and Ranch Lands Programby USDA). ", "Technical Assistance Funding. The rapid expansion in funding for conservation programs and activities hasincreased requests for technical assistance. Technical assistance had been funded inpart through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), in part by reprogrammingcarry-over funds, and in part by using funds from Conservation Operations, adiscretionary program, to pay for this assistance. A statutory cap on the use of CCCfunds to provide such assistance for mandatory conservation programs, combinedwith limits from the other sources and rapid growth in these programs, has createda funding shortfall. Congress attempted to address these funding concerns in the2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ). However, in late 2002, the Office of Management andBudget, supported by a Department of Justice opinion, ruled that the farm bill didnot remove the CCC cap and the Administration would have to continue to limitmandatory technical assistance funding through the CCC. ", "The Administration initially sought to address this problem by proposing to create a new farm bill technical assistance line item in FY2003, funded at $333million. This would have provided the technical assistance for all of the mandatoryconservation programs (authorized at a total of $1.2 billion), plus the ConservationReserve Program, a mandatory program authorized in acres rather than dollars. Congress rejected this proposal, and specifically prohibited the use of discretionaryfunds (funds from the Conservation Operations account) to implement any mandatoryconservation programs. This prohibition, combined with a retention of the cap onCCC funds, meant that some of the mandatory programs were significant \"donorprograms\" by funding technical assistance for other programs, thereby leaving lessmoney available to implement their activities. USDA estimated that four programswere donor programs, with the largest donations being made from the EQIP ($107.9million) and the Farmland Protection Program ($27.6 million). ", "The Administration again proposed a new discretionary technical assistance line item for FY2004 and Congress again rejected it. P.L. 108-199 includes a provisionwithin each of the five discretionary accounts that prohibits using these funds to payfor technical assistance in support of the mandatory conservation programs. TheHouse bill, as reported, contained a provision prohibiting the spending of funds in theConservation Operations account for this purpose. This provision was removed ina floor amendment. The Senate bill contained provisions prohibiting funding fortechnical assistance for mandatory programs from all the discretionary programsexcept the Resource Conservation and Development Program. The conferencecommittee does not otherwise address the issue. Earlier, during floor debate on theagriculture appropriations bill, the Senate defeated an amendment that would haveprohibited technical assistance funding for the Conservation Reserve Programcoming from four programs (EQIP, Farmland Protection, Grassland Reserve, andWildlife Habitat Incentives), so there will again be donor programs among themandatory programs unless Congress enacts freestanding legislation, such as H.R. 1907 , that would prohibit funds in three of the mandatory programs(EQIP, the Grasslands Reserve Program, and Farmland Protection) from being usedfor technical assistance for any of the other mandatory programs. ", "Other Provisions. Also in P.L. 108-199 are general provisions that (1) waive cost sharing requirements for theEmergency Watershed Protection Program to repair or prevent damage to non-federallands in watersheds that have been affected by fires initiated by the federalgovernment; (2) prohibit making land enrolled in the CRP and planted to hardwoodtrees ineligible for re-enrollment; and (3) prohibit NRCS from reorganizing regionalconservationists and regional offices without approval by the appropriationscommittees. Additionally, report language for the Office of the Secretary encouragesimplementation of a new program to establish a conservation corridor along theDelmarva peninsula; encourages a study of cropping techniques in the UpperMidwest; and requires consultation with the agriculture committees beforeproceeding with possible mergers involving the NRCS and FSA. ", "Division H of P.L.108-199 also includes conservation provisions that are not part of the regular annual funding for conservation programs. One provisionauthorizes the Conservation Security Program (CSP) through FY2007 rather thanFY2013, and removes a lifetime cap of $3.77 billion on total program spending thatwas placed on the CSP by the FY2003 consolidated appropriations act ( P.L. 108-7 )so that the remainder of the estimated spending could be used to offset the cost ofdisaster assistance. Other separate provisions in the FY2004 consolidatedappropriations act make disaster assistance funds available to deal with the resourceproblems stemming from the wildfires in California during the fall of 2003, including$150 million to the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, $12.5 million to theTree Assistance Program, and $12 million to the Emergency Conservation Program.The cost of these wildfire assistance provisions is offset by a mandated rescission of$225 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

In FY2003, the Secretary of Agriculture announced availability from the Emerson Trust of 200,000 tons of wheat for emergency relief in the Hornof Africa (Ethiopia and Eritrea) and 600,000 tons of wheat for emergency relief inIraq. Of the total amount made available, only about half was used (400,000 metrictons).

In the EEP and DEIP programs, USDA makes cash bonuspayments to exporters of U.S. agricultural commodities to enable them to be pricecompetitive when U.S. prices are above world market prices. EEP has been littleused in recent years. No EEP bonuses were provided in FY2002 or FY2003. Reflecting this program experience, the President's budget assumes a program levelof $28 million in FY2004, compared with $478 million authorized for EEP in the2002 farm bill. Consequently, USDA would retain some flexibility to increase thelevel of EEP subsidies. For DEIP, the Administration expects a program level of $57million for FY2004.

The United States has proposedthat agricultural export subsidies be eliminated, while the European Union, whichopposes complete elimination of such subsidies, has conditioned its willingness tonegotiate reductions in export subsidies on the inclusion of export credit programs(such as CCC export credit guarantees) and food aid based on surpluses (such assection 416(b)) on the WTO agriculture negotiating agenda.
