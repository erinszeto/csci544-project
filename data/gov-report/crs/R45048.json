Increasingly, states are attempting to use assessments for these purposes within a balanced assessment system. A balanced assessment system often incorporates various assessment types, such as formative and summative assessments. Formative assessments are used to monitor progress toward a goal and summative assessments are used to evaluate the extent to which a goal has been achieved.", "Types of Tests: Educational assessments can be either norm-referenced tests (NRTs) or criterion-referenced tests (CRTs). An NRT is a standardized test that compares the performance of an individual student to the performance of a large group of students. A CRT compares the performance of an individual student to a predetermined standard or criterion. The majority of tests used in schools are CRTs. The results of CRTs, such as state assessments required by Title I-A of the ESEA, are usually reported as scaled scores or performance standards. A scaled score is a standardized score that exists along a common scale that can be used to make comparisons across students, across subgroups of students, and over time. A performance standard is a generally agreed upon definition of a certain level of performance in a content area that is expressed in terms of a cut score (e.g., basic, proficient, advanced).", "Technical Considerations in Assessment: The technical qualities of assessments, such as validity, reliability, and fairness, are considered before drawing conclusions about assessment results. Validity is the degree to which an assessment measures what it is supposed to measure. Reliability is a measure of the consistency of assessment results. The concept of fairness is a consideration of whether there is equity in the assessment process. Fairness is examined so that all participants in an assessment are provided the opportunity to demonstrate what they know and can do.", "Using Assessment Results Appropriately: Assessment is a critical component of accountability systems, such as those required under Title I-A of the ESEA, and can be the basis of many educational decisions. An assessment can be considered low-stakes or high-stakes, depending on the type of educational decisions made based on its result. For example, a low-stakes assessment may be a formative assessment that measures whether students are on-track to meet proficiency goals. On the other hand, a state high school exit exam is a high-stakes assessment if it determines whether a student will receive a diploma. When the results of assessments are used to make high-stakes decisions that affect students, teachers, districts, and states, it is especially important to have strong evidence of validity, reliability, and fairness. It is therefore important to understand the purpose of educational assessments, and the alignment between the purpose and their use, and to give consideration to the appropriateness of inferences based on assessment results.", "A glossary containing definitions of commonly used assessment and measurement terms is provided at the end of this report.

States develop criteria to determine eligibility for special education and select assessments that are consistent with the criteria for all areas of suspected disability. For example, if it is suspected that a student has an \"intellectual disability,\" a state may administer a test of cognitive functioning, such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). If it is suspected that the same student may have a speech-language impairment, a state may require hearing and vision screenings, followed by a comprehensive evaluation.

The addition of instructional, diagnostic, and predictive assessments at the state and local levels may contribute to the perception that there are \"too many assessments.\" And while assessments may occasionally intrude on instructional time, some of these are conducted to guide and improve instruction (i.e., instructional and diagnostic assessments). ", "One type of balanced assessment system uses a combination of formative and summative assessments. This type can be seen as overlapping with the purposes of assessment discussed above. That is, the purposes of assessment are embedded within \"formative\" and \"summative\" assessments.", "Generally speaking, formative assessments are those that are used during the learning process in order to improve instruction, and summative assessments are those that are used at the end of the learning process to \"sum up\" what students have learned. In reality, the line between a formative assessment and a summative assessment is less clear. Depending on how the results of an assessment are used, it is possible that one assessment could be designed to serve both formative and summative functions. The distinction, therefore, between formative and summative assessments often is the manner in which the results are used. If an assessment has been designed so that results can inform future decision-making processes in curriculum, instruction, or policy, the assessment is being used in a formative manner (i.e., for instructional, diagnostic, and predictive purposes). If an assessment has been designed to evaluate the effects or the outcome of curricula, instruction, or policy, the assessment is being used in a summative manner (i.e., for diagnostic or evaluative purposes). For example, a teacher may give a pretest to determine what students know prior to deciding what and how to teach. The results of the pretest may be used to plan instruction; therefore, the pretest is a formative assessment. When the teacher has finished teaching a certain concept or topic, however, the same test could be administered as a posttest. The results of the posttest may be used as the student's grade; therefore, the posttest is a summative assessment.", "In a balanced assessment system, a state must consider its and the LEAs' needs for various types of information and choose formative and summative assessments consistent with those needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Formative Assessment", "paragraphs": ["While this topic has received a lot of attention in recent years, there is no universal agreement on what constitutes a formative assessment.

The confusion over exactly what a formative assessment is has led some in the testing industry to avoid the term altogether and others to offer alternative names for certain types of formative assessment. In this section, various types of assessments that have been described as formative will be discussed, including classroom-based and interim assessments.", "Formative assessments are often used in the classroom. They can be as informal as teacher questioning strategies and observations or as formal as standardized examinations. Teachers use formative assessments for both instructional and predictive purposes. The results of formative assessment can be used to determine holes in a student's knowledge and to adjust instruction accordingly. Teachers may adjust their instruction by changing the pace of instruction, changing the method of delivery, or repeating previously taught content. After these adjustments, teachers may administer another assessment to determine if students are learning as expected. The process of administering assessments, providing feedback to the student, adjusting instruction, and re-administering assessments is what makes the assessment formative.", "To supplement classroom-based formative assessments, test publishers began promoting commercial formative assessment products in the form of interim assessments. Some testing experts believe that referring to interim assessments as \"formative\" is inaccurate because the results are not likely to generate information in a manner timely enough to guide instruction. Others believe that these assessments can be used in a formative way to determine how school or LEA practices need to change to meet policy goals. The latter position considers the use of interim assessments as formative assessment at the school or LEA level as opposed to the classroom level. Instead of adjusting teaching practices to increase student learning, this type of formative assessment would require adjusting school or district practices to increase student achievement across the board. Interim assessments can track the progress of students, schools, and LEAs toward meeting predetermined policy goals. For example, as discussed above, PARCC and SBAC provide interim assessments as part of their state assessment systems for reading and mathematics. The results of the interim assessments can be used in a formative way to adjust school or district policies and practices that affect student achievement. ", "While both classroom-based assessments and interim assessments can be considered formative, they are not interchangeable. In classroom-based formative assessment, results are often immediate and instructionally relevant, allowing teachers to adjust instruction. On the other hand, this type of formative assessment may not provide any information on whether a student or school is on-track to be proficient on a future summative assessment. In the case of interim assessments, the content and timing of the assessment is usually determined by the state, not the teacher, making it a less flexible classroom tool. In addition, interim assessments are less likely to be used to guide classroom instruction because the results of the assessments may not be reported quickly enough to be useful to a classroom teacher. Interim assessments can, however, be used to predict whether a school or district is likely to meet predetermined goals on a later summative assessment and to identify areas requiring additional support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summative Assessment", "paragraphs": ["Summative assessments are tests given at the end of a lesson, course, or school year to determine what has been learned.

State assessments required by the ESEA, the NAEP, international assessments, and state exit exams are all summative assessments. Some forms of summative assessment are considered high-stakes assessments because they have rewards and consequences attached to performance.

Some fault NRTs for measuring only superficial learning through multiple choice and short-answer formats instead of measuring higher-level skills such as problem solving, reasoning, critical thinking, and comprehension. Others have criticized NRTs for lacking instructional utility because they sample a wide range of general skills within a content area, but NRTs are rarely linked to the standards or curriculum.

When using CRTs, there is no normative sample; therefore, there is no common metric for comparisons. It is possible to design CRTs so that comparisons can be made. However, to facilitate good comparisons, it would be necessary to have (1) consistent standards across schools, LEAs, and states; and (2) consistent definitions of \"mastery\" across schools, districts, and states.", "In elementary and secondary education, one way that test designers create a common metric for comparisons with CRTs is by using scaled scores and performance standards. Scaled scores and performance standards are two different ways of representing the same assessment result. A scaled score is a single score that exists along a scale ranging from limited mastery of a content area to complete mastery of it. A performance standard is a description of whether a certain level of mastery is achieved based on the grade level of the student. These types of scores are discussed in more detail below.", "Scaled Scores. State assessments used for accountability often report a scaled score. A scaled score is a standardized score that exists on a common scale that can be used to make annual and longitudinal comparisons across students and subgroups of students. \"Scaling\" is conducted by adjusting a raw score based on the differences in form difficulty from a \"reference form.\" Just as an NRT score can be compared to a \"normative group\" of students, a scaled score can be compared to the \"reference form.\" In the case of scaled scores, students and subgroups of students can be compared to each other directly even though there is no \"normative group.\"", "A scaled score is usually a three- or four-digit score that exists across a scale with cut points determining various levels of mastery. Sometimes, the scaled score is accompanied by a grade level. For each grade level, there is a range of scaled scores that corresponds to students achieving mastery of a specific content area.", "Scaled scores are particularly useful if they are \"vertically scaled.\" A vertically scaled score can be compared across time and can be used to measure growth of students and student subgroups. A vertically scaled assessment is independent of grade level; however, the descriptors attached to the scaled score (e.g., basic, proficient, advanced) change according to the grade level. For example, consider a group of third grade students and a group of fifth grade students that both scored 300 on a reading assessment. The two groups are comparable in terms of their reading ability; however, a scaled score of 300 may represent that the third-grade students \"met expectations\" but the fifth-grade students \"did not meet expectations.\"", "Performance Standards. A performance standard is another way to report results from a CRT. Performance standards are also sometimes referred to as achievement levels. ", "A performance standard is a generally agreed upon definition of a certain level of performance in a content area that is expressed in terms of a cut score. The predetermined cut score denotes a level of mastery or level of proficiency within a content area. An assessment system that uses performance standards typically establishes several cut scores that denote varying levels of mastery. For example, NAEP uses a system of performance standards with three achievement levels: basic, proficient, and advanced. Similarly, common assessments use performance standards to determine whether students met expectations. SBAC uses a four-level system (Level 1 through Level 4), which corresponds to \"novice, developing, proficient, and advanced.\" PARCC uses a five-level system (Level 1 through Level 5), which corresponds to \"did not yet meet expectations, partially met expectations, approached expectations, met expectations, and exceeded expectations.\" ", "Performance standards can be aligned with state content standards and curricula, and results can be used for planning, modifying, and adapting instruction. The main difference between reporting a score as a scaled score or a performance standard is the label itself, which can attach meaning to a score and provide an appropriate context. A CRT may report that a student scored 242 on a scale of 500, but the score of 242 may be meaningless to most educators and parents unless there is some context surrounding it. Performance standards provide the context. If the cut score to meet expectations was predetermined to be 240, a score of 242 would be above the cut score, and therefore the student would be considered to have \"met expectations\" in the content area.", "Although they can provide a meaningful context for assessment results, performance standards are criticized for being imprecise and for their inability to adequately measure student growth. While there are rigorous methods of determining cut scores that denote various levels of mastery, there is rarely any meaningful difference between the abilities of a student who scores just below the cut score and a student who scores just above the cut score. Consider the example above in which a score of 240 is the cut score for \"met expectations . \" One student may score 238 and not be considered to have met expectations, while another student may score 242 and be considered to have met expectations. In reality, the cut score of the performance standard may be making an inappropriate distinction between two students who have similar abilities. Another criticism of performance standards is that they are insensitive to student growth. Suppose the cut score for the \"exceeded expectations\" level is 300. A student in the previous example could move from a score of 242 to 299 within one year, making considerable progress; however, a score of 242 and a score of 299 are both considered to be within the same performance standard of \"met expectations.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Technical Considerations in Assessment", "paragraphs": ["This section will discuss technical considerations such as validity, reliability, and fairness.

Inferences may be either appropriate or inappropriate based on a number of technical and contextual factors. Following a discussion of the concepts of validity, reliability, and fairness, this report will conclude with a discussion of how to avoid making inappropriate inferences from educational assessments.

When making instructional or policy decisions on the basis of an assessment, the question is often asked, \"Is the test valid?\" Validity, however, is not a property of the test itself; it is the degree to which a certain inference from a test is appropriate and meaningful. The appropriate question to be asked is, therefore, \"Is the inference being drawn from the test result valid?\" The distinction between these questions may seem unimportant, but consider the following situation. Teachers, administrators, or policymakers often would like to support multiple conclusions from the same assessment. Some of these conclusions, or inferences, may be valid and others may not. For example, the SAT, a college entrance examination intended to measure critical thinking skills that are needed for success in college, is taken by many high school students. Suppose a group of high school seniors in School A scored well on the SAT and a group of high school seniors in School B scored poorly. One potentially valid inference from this result is that seniors from School A are more likely to succeed in college. However, there are many possible inferences that may be less valid. For example, one could infer that School A had a better academic curriculum than School B, or that School A had better teachers than School B. Neither of these inferences may be valid because the SAT was designed for the purpose of predicting the likelihood of success in college and not for the purposes of evaluating teachers or curriculum. The validity of an inference, therefore, is tied inextricably to the purpose for which the test was created.", "When an assessment is created or a new use is proposed for an existing assessment, a process of validation is seen as necessary. Validation involves collecting evidence to support the use and interpretation of test scores based on the test construct. In testing, a construct is the concept or characteristic that a test is designed to measure. The process of validation includes, at a minimum, investigating the construct underrepresentation and construct irrelevance of the assessment instrument. Construct underrepresentation refers to the degree to which an assessment fails to capture important aspects of the construct. For example, if the construct of an assessment is addition and subtraction skills, the entire construct would include addition, addition with carrying, subtraction, subtraction with borrowing, two-digit addition, two-digit addition with carrying, and so forth. If the assessment does not measure all the skills within a defined construct, it may be susceptible to construct underrepresentation, and the inference based on an assessment score may not reflect the student's actual knowledge of the construct. ", "Similarly, construct irrelevance can threaten the validity of an inference. Construct irrelevance refers to the degree to which test scores are affected by the content of an assessment that is not part of the intended construct. Again, if the construct of an assessment is addition and subtraction skills, any test items that contain multiplication or division would create construct irrelevance, and the inference based on the assessment score may not reflect the student's actual knowledge of the construct.", "Construct underrepresentation is investigated by answering the question, \"Does the assessment adequately cover the full range of skills in the construct?\" Construct irrelevance is investigated by answering the question, \"Are any skills within the assessment outside of the realm of the construct?\" These two questions are investigated using statistical procedures that examine properties of the assessment itself and how the properties of the assessment interact with characteristics of individuals taking the test. One important consideration is to determine if the degree of construct underrepresentation or construct irrelevance differentially affects the performance of various subgroups of the population. If, for example, there was a moderate degree of construct irrelevance (e.g., multiplication questions on an assessment designed to measure addition and subtraction skills), students from higher socioeconomic subgroups may be more likely to score well on a test than students from lower socioeconomic subgroups, even if both subgroups have equal knowledge of the construct itself. Students from higher socioeconomic subgroups are more likely to have learned the irrelevant material, given that they generally have more access to early education and enrichment opportunities. The construct irrelevance, therefore, may lead to an invalid inference that students from higher socioeconomic subgroups outperform students from lower socioeconomic subgroups on a given construct.", "There are many other types of evidence that may be collected during validation. For example, test developers might compare student scores on the assessment in question with existing measures of the same construct. Or, test developers might investigate how well the assessment in question predicts a later outcome of interest, such as pass rates on a high-stakes exam, high school graduation rates, or job attainment.

It describes the precision with which assessment results are reported and is a measure of certainty that the results are accurate. The concept of reliability presumes that each student has a true score for any given assessment. The true score is the hypothetical average score resulting from multiple administrations of an assessment; it is the true representation of what the student knows and can do. For any given assessment, however, the score that is reported is not a student's true score; it is a student's observed score. The hypothetical difference between the true score and the observed score is measurement error. Measurement error includes student factors, such as general health, attention span, and motivation. It can also include environmental factors, such as the comfort or familiarity of the assessment location. Reliability and measurement error are inversely related: the lower the measurement error, the higher the reliability. As reliability increases, the likelihood that a student's observed score and true score are reasonably equivalent is increased.", "Reliability can be reported in multiple ways.

It is useful because it is independent of the scale of the assessment and can be compared across multiple assessments. A reliability coefficient of 0 implies that a score is due completely to measurement error; a reliability coefficient of 1 implies that a score is completely consistent and free of measurement error. There is no rule of thumb for deciding how high a reliability coefficient should be; however, most commercially available assessments report reliability coefficients above 0.8, and many have reliability coefficients above 0.9.", "The most common types of reliability coefficients used in educational assessment are alternate-form coefficients, test-retest coefficients, inter-scorer agreement coefficients, and internal consistency coefficients. Alternate-form coefficients measure the degree to which the scores derived from alternate forms of the same assessment are consistent. For example, the SAT has multiple forms that are administered each year. A high alternate-form reliability coefficient provides some certainty that a student's score on one form of the SAT would be reasonably equivalent to the student's score on another form of it. Test-retest coefficients measure the stability of an individual student's score over time. If a reading assessment was administered to a student today and re-administered in two weeks, one would expect that the student would have comparable scores across the two administrations. A high test-retest reliability coefficient provides a measure of certainty that a student's score today would be similar to the student's score in the near future. Inter-scorer agreement coefficients measure the degree to which two independent scorers agree when assessing a student's performance. A high inter-scorer agreement coefficient provides a measure of certainty that a student's score would not be greatly affected by the individual scoring the assessment.", "Internal consistency coefficients are slightly more complicated. They are a measure of the correlation of items within the same assessment. If items within an assessment are related, a student should perform consistently well or consistently poorly on the related items. For example, a mathematics assessment may test multiplication and division skills. Suppose a student is proficient with multiplication but has not yet mastered division. Within the mathematics assessment, the student should score consistently well on the multiplication items and consistently poorly on the division items. A high internal consistency coefficient provides a measure of certainty that related items within the assessment are in fact measuring the same construct.", "The decisions regarding the type of reliability coefficients to investigate and report depend on the purpose and format of the assessment. For example, many assessments do not use alternate forms, so there would be no need to report an alternate-form coefficient. As another example, consider a test that was designed to measure student growth over a short period of time. In this case, it may not make sense to report a test-retest reliability coefficient because one does not expect any stability or consistency in the student's score over time. Test developers also typically consider the format of the test. In tests with multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank formats, inter-scorer agreement may not be of great concern because the scoring is relatively objective.

A confidence interval estimates the likelihood that a student's true score falls within a range of scores. The size of the confidence interval, or the size of the range, depends on how certain one needs to be that the true score falls within the range of uncertainty.", "A confidence interval is calculated by using an estimated true score, the standard error of measurement (SEM), and the desired level of confidence.
