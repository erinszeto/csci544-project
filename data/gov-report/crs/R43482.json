For certain programs, however, the period of availability for some or all of their funds may be delayed until after the start of the fiscal year or even until a future fiscal year. Three types of delayed periods of availability are discussed in this report: \"advance appropriations,\" \"forward funding,\" and \"advance funding.\"", "Advance appropriations become available for obligation one or more fiscal years after the budget year covered by the appropriations act. Although advance appropriations are provided in order to manage specific planning concerns, they also have implications for the prevention of funding gaps and the avoidance of continuing appropriations for those programs. Advance appropriations are typically enacted at an interval of one fiscal year prior to when such appropriations become available. For accounts that receive advance appropriations, the amount of budget authority that will become available once the fiscal year commences is sometimes adjusted in subsequent appropriations acts through supplemental appropriations or rescissions.", "Forward funding becomes available beginning late in the budget year and is carried into at least one following fiscal year. This period of availability's main implication is that it facilitates obligations during the summer months for programs that start their activities during the fall, particularly for the Department of Education and Department of Labor. Forward funds tend to become available at an interval that starts on July 1 and are available during at least two fiscal years. Typically, this schedule of availability is combined with annual or advance appropriations so that only the portions of the program that require summer obligations are funded in this manner.", "Advance funding becomes available late in the budget year and is in addition to the funds for that entire fiscal year; any expenditure of the advance funds is charged to the following fiscal year's appropriation. This period of availability has tended to be used for accounts that fund mandatory payments to individuals. The aggregate amount of such payments may be particularly sensitive to changes in eligible beneficiaries or difficult to predict more than a year in advance. In such instances, providing extra funds that become available late in the fiscal year might lessen or eliminate the potential for a funding shortfall and the need for separate supplemental appropriations. In the two cases where advance funds are currently used, they are available only during the final weeks of the fiscal year.", "Choosing a delayed period of availability when funding a program may have budget process implications due to the scorekeeping rules that govern the fiscal year to which such funds are attributed. The congressional budget resolution has also imposed various limits on advance appropriations for discretionary spending since FY2001. For FY2014, these limits were established in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.

This period of availability most often begins on the first day of the fiscal year of the appropriations act (October 1), also referred to as the \"budget year.\" For example, appropriations provided by the FY2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-289 ), which was enacted on September 29, 2006, were generally available for obligation and expenditure on October 1, 2006, the first day of FY2007, and remained available through September 30, 2007.", "However, a delayed period of availability that begins after the start of the fiscal year, or even during a future fiscal year, may be provided for particular programs that are funded through the annual appropriations process. Delayed periods of availability are typically provided to meet specific budgetary needs related to the purpose or structure of a program. Some of the reasons to provide such periods of availability may be more broadly applicable, such as to prevent a funding shortfall late in the fiscal year or a funding gap in the following fiscal year. Although only a comparatively small number of individual programs receive funds that are available during such periods, many of these programs have a large number of beneficiaries. For example, portions of the Medicaid program, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Department of Education formula grants are funded for delayed periods of availability. ", "The statutory authority for a particular delayed period of availability may derive from provisions authorizing a particular program, those that provide appropriations to fund it, or a combination of the two. Under congressional rules, a statutory authorization of such a period of availability must precede an appropriation for those purposes. A program's authorizing statute may specifically address such a period of availability in the authorization of appropriations or address it more generally in the provisions that govern the program. If the authorizing statute itself does not suggest a delayed schedule for the funds, the legislative history associated with that statute could anticipate that such funds will be provided. Another possibility is that Congress could decide to use a delayed period of availability during the annual appropriations process even if the program's authorization or associated legislative history is silent as to timing of future funds or only authorizes a schedule that is aligned with the budget year. On the other hand, even when the authorization anticipates that funds will be available for a delayed period, appropriations may subsequently be provided on a schedule that is aligned with the budget year. In either instance, the period of availability associated with the appropriations would be controlling.", "A variety of approaches have been used during the annual appropriations process to provide funds that become available at some point after the beginning of the fiscal year. These include, but are not limited to, the three periods of availability: \"advance appropriations,\" \"forward funding,\" and \"advance funding.\" Advance appropriations become available for obligation starting at least one fiscal year after the budget year. Forward funding becomes available beginning late in the budget year and is carried into at least one following fiscal year. A dvance funding is funding for the following fiscal year that becomes available for obligation late in the budget year and would be in addition to the funds for that fiscal year. Any expenditure of advance funds is counted as part of the following fiscal year's appropriation. These particular periods of availability as compared to annual appropriations are illustrated in Figure 1 .", "While these three delayed periods of availability all share some similarities, they are distinct concepts in three regards due to the timing of the funds. First, advance appropriations become available after the end of the budget year, whereas forward funds become available during the budget year. Second, advance appropriations become available at some point after the budget year has ended, whereas advance funds are available only during the budget year. Third, forward funds are available into the following fiscal year, whereas advance funds expire once the budget year ends. ", "Although advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding are each discrete concepts, they tend to have some degree of variation in how they are implemented, including the interval in advance for which funds are provided and the duration of availability for those funds. For example, advance appropriations may be provided one or two fiscal years prior to when they become available for obligation and be available during a single fiscal year or multiple fiscal years or with no fiscal year limitation. In addition, a program may receive funds on a combination of timetables. ", "Providing funds for a delayed period of availability may have budget process implications for Congress. Funds provided for such periods are generally subject to both procedural and statutory budget enforcement, and their budgetary effects are attributed (or \"scored\") to particular fiscal years for such purposes. Since FY2001, the budget resolution has also imposed limits for the House and Senate on advance appropriations for discretionary spending. For FY2014, these limits were established through the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act (Division A, H.J.Res. 59 ). As was previously mentioned, congressional rules require a statutory authorization that allows a delayed period of availability to precede an appropriation for those purposes. If a delayed period of availability for a program is not authorized by existing law, providing funding in a general appropriations bill or amendment thereto for such a period may subject that bill or amendment to a point of order. ", "This report examines concepts, practices, and procedural implications associated with the particular delayed periods of availability described above. The following three sections discuss the origins, relevant budgetary concepts, and practices associated with advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding. The fourth section explains the budget process implications that are associated with these funding approaches. The scope of this report is generally restricted to an analysis of advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding in the context of the budget process. The program-specific considerations and potential consequences of these funding approaches are not discussed. For information on particular programs, see the CRS reports on those issue areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advance Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Advance appropriations is a form of budget authority that becomes available one or more fiscal years after the budget year covered by the appropriations act. For example, in an appropriations act for FY2016, funds would generally become available for obligation on October 1, 2015. Advance appropriations in the FY2016 act would not become available until the start of FY2017 or later. ", "According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), advance appropriations were first provided in 1962 for grants-in-aid that funded airport construction. Other early uses included grants for urban renewal and the Department of Education. Currently, this period of availability is used for a wide variety of programs funded by discretionary and appropriated mandatory spending. ", "Perhaps the most significant implication of advance appropriations relates to funding gaps. The congressional budget process currently requires that annual appropriations be enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year (October 1). If such appropriations are not enacted by that time, one or more continuing resolutions (CRs) may be enacted to prevent a funding gap from occurring until regular appropriations are completed or the fiscal year ends. Programs that are funded through the appropriations process are at risk of a funding gap at the beginning of the fiscal year if annual appropriations or a CR is not enacted or at any point during the fiscal year when a CR expires and has not been replaced by a further CR or annual appropriations. However, if a program's appropriations for all or part of a fiscal year are enacted in the previous year's appropriations act, the program might not experience a funding gap, assuming that such appropriations were available during that period and were unexpended. ", "A related implication, but one that is more generally associated with a program's annual operations, is that advance appropriations may enable that program to avoid the need for any continuing appropriations during periods when the regular appropriations bills for that fiscal year have not yet been enacted. The potential consequences of CRs on program operations have been noted by a variety of observers, including funding levels, program delivery, management support, and revenue collection. The extent to which a program has previously been provided advance appropriations that are available at the start of a fiscal year, that program would not be reliant on funding that would otherwise be provided through a CR. ", "Some have argued that programs that receive advance appropriations may be better able to engage in advance planning. Enacting funding for a program in advance may enable it to make long-term commitments related to its internal operations or the population that it serves. Similarly, advance appropriations may assist agencies in planning and carrying out multi-year capital expenditures by spreading the cost over a number of fiscal years. However, others argue that the ability to make such commitments may be limited by the extent to which programmatic needs can be forecasted in advance. Congress may also prefer to exercise control over programs through regular annual appropriations in certain circumstances."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Funding Practices27", "paragraphs": ["Advance appropriations are typically enacted at an interval of one fiscal year prior to when such appropriations become available.

This budget authority is often available for a period of more than 12 months, in which case it can be classified as multi-year budget authority but may also be provided in shorter increments. ", "While the first use of forward funding is unknown, the modern practice appears to have begun around the same time as the change in the federal fiscal year from July 1 to October 1, which occurred in fiscal year 1976. As a consequence of this new schedule, the ability to obligate funds for certain activities became difficult, for example, if the activities required obligations to be made in the summer and remain available through the fall. At least partially in response to this issue, some programs were provided forward funding to allow such obligations to occur during the summer months and the funds to remain available into the following fiscal year. Under current practice, this period of availability is used only for programs that are funded by discretionary spending. ", "The main implication associated with forward funding relates to the seasonal timing of obligations that it may enable. The following two departments currently receive forward funding. ", "1. The Department of Education, for the largest formula grant programs to states; and 2. The Department of Labor, for vocational training programs.", "These particular programs require significant obligations during the summer to prepare for activities that coincide with the school year. Although advance appropriations might enable these programs to plan ahead based on those budgetary resources, such advance appropriations could not be obligated until they became available at the beginning of the fiscal year.

Second, advance funds become available only after the budget year has begun, usually during the last two months of that year, and are no longer available once the budget year ends. Third, any expenditure of the advance funds is directed in the appropriations act to be charged to the succeeding fiscal year's appropriation.
