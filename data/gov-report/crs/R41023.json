The quake, centered about 15 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, had a magnitude of 7.0. A series of strong aftershocks have followed. Experts estimate the earthquake caused $8 to $14 billion in damage. Approximately 3 million people, roughly one-third of the overall population, have been affected by the earthquake with estimates ranging from 1.2 to 2 million people displaced. The government of Haiti is reporting an estimated 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, President Rene Pr\u00e9val described conditions in his country as \"unimaginable,\" and appealed for international assistance. As the humanitarian relief operation continues, the government is struggling to restore the institutions needed for it to function, ensure political stability, and address long-term reconstruction and development planning. Prior to the earthquake, the international community was providing extensive development and humanitarian assistance to Haiti. With that assistance, the Haitian government had made significant progress in recent years in many areas of its development strategy. The destruction of Haiti's nascent infrastructure and other extensive damage caused by the earthquake will set back Haiti's development significantly. A post-disaster needs assessment estimated the total value of recovery and reconstruction needs to be $11.5 billion. The Haitian government presented an action plan for reconstruction and development at a global donors' conference held on March 31, 2010. Donors pledged over $5 billion for the first 18 months of Haiti's reconstruction. The United States pledged $1.2 billion.

On January 12, 2010, President Barack Obama assembled heads of U.S. agencies to begin working immediately on a coordinated response to the disaster, with the U.S. Agency for International Development through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance as the lead agency. On January 14, the Administration announced $100 million in humanitarian assistance to Haiti to meet the immediate needs on the ground. As of April 30, 2010, total humanitarian funding provided to Haiti for the earthquake had reached over $1 billion. In the FY2010 supplemental request, the Administration is seeking a total of $2.8 billion for Haiti. Of that, $1.5 billion is for relief and disaster assistance, which would reimburse U.S. government agencies for services provided and for funds already obligated for ongoing relief activities. The request for recovery and reconstruction is $1.1 billion. This is primarily for new activities, focused on urgent infrastructure repairs, especially in the energy and agricultural sectors; critical health care; governance; and security.", "The Department of Homeland Security has temporarily halted the deportation of Haitians and granted Temporary Protected Status for 18 months to Haitian nationals in the United States as of January 12, 2010.

Thousands of buildings collapsed, leaving unknown numbers of people trapped, and hundreds of thousands of people homeless in the streets. Estimates of casualties are constantly being updated. According to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, \"[o]f Haiti's 9 million people, initial reports suggest roughly a third may be affected by the disaster.\" ", "The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) issued a study on February 11 estimating the damage caused by the earthquake to be at least $8 billion, and as high as $14 billion. One of the report's authors, economist Andrew Powell, said that, \"This disaster, given the size of Haiti ... is the most devastating catastrophe that a country has experienced possibly ever.\" The report compared the damage to other catastrophes, finding, for example, that the earthquake's damage amounted to 117% of Haiti's annual economic output, while the 2004 tsunami damage amounted to 2% of Indonesia's annual economic output. The Haiti Post Disaster Needs Assessment, conducted by Haiti and international institutions, reported similar findings, estimating the total value of recovery and reconstruction needs to be $11.5 billion.

Among the missing and dead were Haitian government officials and international aid personnel, including many U.N. personnel. Housing, hospitals, schools, and many government buildings collapsed. Basic services such as electricity and water were almost completely disrupted. Major transportation routes were damaged and/or blocked. The Port-au-Prince airport control tower was destroyed; the airport continued to function, and air traffic control authority was quickly transferred to U.S. personnel with portable radar. On February 18, commercial air traffic in and out of Port-au-Prince resumed. As of early March, relief flights into Haiti had dropped from a peak of 160 flights per day to an average of 75. The main port suffered heavy damage; U.S. troops are repairing the port facilities. The port is expected to handle 1,500 containers of relief supplies once it is fully repaired. The use of airfields and ports in the Dominican Republic, with humanitarian corridors over land, have also eased the burden on Haitian facilities.

With that assistance, the Haitian government had made significant progress in recent years in many areas of its development strategy, including security; judicial reform; macroeconomic management; procurement processes and fiscal transparency; increased voter registration; and jobs creation. It had also made progress in providing broader access to clean water and other services. Parliamentary elections scheduled for February 2010 have been delayed.

The IDB damage assessment stated that donor coordination will be key in any reconstruction effort. The report further noted that there are different models for coordination, but that however it is coordinated, \"[a] single executing agency with appropriate powers, transparency and accountability to the Haitian Government and donors would be helpful\" in achieving the needed coordination on the ground.

The capacity was still in its early stages, however, and the focus of much of its risk management efforts was not geared toward earthquakes, but toward hurricanes, which are the most common cause of natural disasters on the island. The last major earthquake in Haiti was 150 years ago, in 1860.", "Some Haitians complain that they have seen or heard little of President Pr\u00e9val since the earthquake. The perception that the Haitian government was not doing enough contributed to calls by some Haitians, both in Haiti and the United States, for the United States to take control of Haiti in place of the current government in the days following the disaster.", "The destruction of buildings, equipment, and loss of skilled personnel has drastically reduced the ability of the government to respond rapidly. According to the Haitian Chamber of Commerce, the earthquake destroyed approximately 25,000 public and commercial buildings. Twenty-one out of 22 Ministry buildings were destroyed. Along with the buildings, government records were destroyed; re-establishing and expanding transparency in government spending will be particularly challenging. These losses, plus the difficulty of delivering and transporting material supplies, will hinder delivery of services. The already significant need for services is now vastly expanded.", "Haitian ministries are addressing issues such as long-term housing for those left homeless by the earthquake as they operate out of makeshift offices. Haitian authorities and international relief agencies are delivering food and water to hundreds of makeshift camps in Port-au-Prince. The government provided free transportation to evacuate people from the capital to cities not damaged by the earthquake. Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime indicated that as many as 482,000 people may be relocated outside Port-au-Prince.

The massive humanitarian relief operation underway was hampered by a number of significant challenges, including a general lack of transportation, extremely limited communications systems, and damaged infrastructure. In many parts of Port-au-Prince, roads were ruptured or blocked by collapsed buildings, debris, bodies, and people seeking open space. Working conditions remain hugely challenging for aid personnel.

Three months after the disaster, the relief effort remains an immediate and critical priority amid plans under discussion for early recovery and reconstruction. There are concerns about security and potential for looting and violence, but according to the United Nations, the overall situation remains calm and stable, with some incidences of looting and criminality. However, 5,000 or so prison inmates escaped the National Penitentiary and other jails in Port-au-Prince during the earthquake (with some re-apprehended) and the whereabouts of the others is unknown, although it is suspected that a significant number may have retreated to Cite Soleil. Reports of rape cases in camps, roadblocks and fake tolls along roads, and other possible gang activity related to drugs and other crimes point to involvement by some of these criminals. U.N. and government officials are urging Haitians to turn in escaped criminals while also focusing on specific security interventions focused on their recapture.", "More in-depth assessments, necessary to obtain a better understanding of the situation on the ground, continue.

It was estimated that there were 500 or more makeshift camp sites with a combined total of more than 700,000 people. Aid workers are delivering basic necessities to areas with population concentrations. Emergency shelter was in very short supply. Reports indicate that 97,000 houses were destroyed and 188,000 sustained damage. It is estimated that 1.9 million lost their homes. Approximately 597,000 people were initially reported to have relocated in departments outside the city, with the highest number concentrated in Artibonite Department. Reports indicated that a number of areas saw increases of 15%-20% in the population. Ninety percent of the new arrivals were staying with host families. Reportedly, prices of basic commodities increased. See the maps in Appendix B and Appendix C . In early April, the estimated number of displaced was adjusted, with an increase in the number of IDPs in Port-au-Prince to 1.69 million and IDPs displaced in areas outside the city appearing to decrease to 300,000. The adjustment may in part reflect more accurate numbers as a result of IDP registrations. It may also reflect a \"pull factor\" where those who left Port-au-Prince initially are now returning to the capitol as services improve and recovery gets underway. The United Nations reports that 86% of the known caseload of IDPs have been reached with emergency shelter materials. As the rainy season begins, there remain concerns about whether there is sufficient waterproof emergency shelter, the need to move people from unsafe settlements, and ongoing challenges to improve sanitation. In addition, houses and buildings weakened by the earthquake could collapse or slide in wet conditions, adding to the 65 million tons of rubble needing to be removed. Finding space to shelter the displaced remains an issue. For those living in unsafe areas, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has identified several options: (1) return to the permanent home if the structure is considered safe; (2) return to home area to a temporary shelter or proximity site; (3) seek accommodation with host communities\u2014usually relatives or friends; (4) relocate to a new site. The first phase of humanitarian relocations for vulnerable families living in high-risk displacement sites was completed at the end of April, with more than 1,750 families moving to two temporary relocation sites at the edge of Port-au-Prince. Another plot in Corail Cesselesse (Port-au-Prince) has received over 3,000 people. IOM also reported that an estimated 49% of IDPs in the Port-au-Prince area were renters prior to the earthquake and 37% owned their own homes (14% did not identify their status.) Providing sustainable, long-term shelter to renters may be more problematic as renters do not own land for shelter installation and landowners may decide not to rebuild rental homes. In addition, owners of private schools have forced the eviction of those inhabiting their property as they seek to reopen their schools. Where to build on a more permanent basis will be a major decision\u2014many of the poorest people were squatters on land subject to landslides and floods. The type of structures to be built will also have to be determined as there will be a need for inexpensive housing that is both earthquake- and hurricane-resistant. Food: Food and water are reaching people every day, but the needs remain constant. It is estimated that 2 million people in Haiti need regular food aid. Some areas outside Port-au-Prince that were previously considered food secure are facing difficulties as prices increase. Supplementary food programs have been launched for children under 5 and pregnant women in the Port-au-Prince area. WFP has provided emergency food rations to 3.5 million people since the earthquake struck. The heads of three U.N. agencies \u2013 WFP, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) formed a new Task Force for Food Security in Haiti. The task force aims to assist the Haitian government with the implementation of a coordinated and targeted immediate and long term food security strategy. It will also work with the relevant U.N. humanitarian clusters. The WFP is now transitioning to a focus on long-term food security and investments in human capital programs. As part of this initiative, it is also rolling out food- and cash-for-work initiatives. Health: Acute respiratory illness is the most commonly reported illness, and in recent weeks, there have been some possible cases of malaria identified, but disease remains at baseline rates with none at epidemic levels. The health cluster is coordinating closely with other clusters on food assistance, shelter, sanitation, and education to assist the Haitian population. The need for sanitation and medical assistance remains. Limited follow-up, post-operative care is available and amputees are among those requiring longer-term assistance. The government of Haiti has shifted away from emergency services to focus on primary health care, health centers, and hospitals. The focus of the health cluster is also on basic primary health care services, such as maternal child health, rehabilitation services, and chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, HIV, and tuberculosis. Vaccination programs are being implemented and a targeted immunization program for populations in temporary settlements began on February 2. The provision of mental health care and psychosocial support to help survivors deal with trauma is also a recognized priority and organizations are mobilizing to address this issue. The identification and collection of mortal remains continues. Logistics: In both Haiti and the Dominican Republic, WFP is heading the in-country Food aid, Logistics and Emergency Telecommunications clusters. UNHAS is running a twice daily flight from Santa Domingo to Port-au-Prince. The WFP is prepositioning food and non-food items as well as equipment throughout Haiti in preparation for the hurricane season. Protection: The sub-cluster is focused on child protection activities in settlements, orphanages, and hospitals to determine the needs of children and to provide care to separated and unaccompanied children. Another main priority is protection of children during the relocation process. With so many people displaced and in need of protection, general security against crime is a critical concern. In addition, protection activities are focused on Haitian children displaced in the Dominican Republic. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH): A water supply strategy is being planned to phase out water trucking and to develop more sustainable options. Limited water network capacity remains a challenge. Access to safe drinking water has improved. Latrine usage and sanitation remain problems at spontaneous settlements. Increasing sanitation support is a main priority. This is seen as an important public health issue to avoid spread of disease, particularly during the rainy season. Plans are underway to increase the provision of water and sanitation services in communities. Education: Schools in areas unaffected by the earthquake reopened on February 1. Schools continue to open progressively, although the official reopening of schools was on April 5. Approximately 700 schools have now reopened in Port-au-Prince. The United Nations reports that 4,000 students were killed in the earthquake. It is estimated that 1,300 schools were destroyed and between 2,000 to 4,600 schools were damaged by the earthquake. Temporary schools are being provided with shelters, safe water, sanitation facilities, and educational materials for the rainy/hurricane season. Fourteen percent of the population of Haiti is under 14 years of age. Early Recovery: More than 95,700 people have been employed under UNDP's cash-for-work program.

As soon as the earthquake hit, some Members of Congress had called for the Obama Administration to do so. On January 13, 2010, DHS had announced that it was temporarily halting the deportation of Haitians. On January 15, 2010, DHS Secretary Napolitano granted TPS to Haitian nationals for 18 months. ", "Haitian children who were legally confirmed as orphans eligible for intercountry adoption by the government of Haiti and who were in the process of being adopted by U.S. residents prior to the earthquake have been given humanitarian parole to come to the United States. Other Haitian orphans potentially eligible for humanitarian parole include children who were identified by an adoption service provider or facilitator as eligible for intercountry adoption and who were matched to prospective American adoptive parents prior to January 12, 2010. The parole program stopped taking new applications on April 14, 2010. DHS anticipates that approximately 1,200 orphans will ultimately receive parole under this program. The Haitian government says its first priority regarding displaced children is to try to reunite them with relatives.", "On January 29, 2010, 10 U.S. citizens, most from an Idaho Baptist group, were arrested in Haiti and charged with child kidnapping and criminal association. The U.S. citizens were trying to cross the Haitian border with the Dominican Republic with a busload of 33 children who they said were orphaned by the January 12, 2010, earthquake. The U.S. citizens did not have authorization to remove the children from Haiti, and it appears that many of the children were not orphans. On February 11, Haitian Judge Bernard Sainvil ordered the release of the U.S. citizens on their own recognizance \"because there had been no evidence demonstrating 'criminal intentions' on their part to support charges of child kidnapping and criminal association leveled against them.\" The charges have been dropped against all 9 of the U.S. citizens, while the remaining U.S. citizen will be tried in Haiti on the charge of arranging \"irregular travel.\"", "Those Haitians who are given humanitarian parole to come to the United States are deemed Cuban-Haitian Entrants and, thus, are among the subset of foreign nationals who are eligible for federal benefits and cash assistance much like refugees. Those Haitians who are newly arriving legal permanent residents, however, are barred from the major federal benefits and cash assistance for the first five years after entry. The President has included funding to cover additional costs for federal benefits and cash assistance resulting from Haitians evacuees, among other activities in his FY2010 supplemental request. Specifically, the President has requested $220.0 million for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to fund four types of activities, of which two are directly related to Haitians brought to the United States after the earthquake. These two are: the state share of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) costs for eligible Haitians; and cash, medical, and repatriation assistance for eligible Haitians. The supplemental request also includes $15 million for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to use for fee waivers for eligible Haitians granted TPS, those given humanitarian parole to bring medical evacuees and certain categories of Haitians into the United States, and to cover costs associated with processing the adoption of Haitian orphans. ", "According to the Department of State, there are 54,716 Haitians who have approved petitions to immigrate to the United States and who are waiting for visas to become available. Advocates for Haitians are asking Secretary Napolitano to give humanitarian parole to those Haitians with approved petitions for visas. Proponents of expediting the admission of Haitians with family in the United States maintain that it would relieve at least some of the humanitarian burden in Haiti and would increase the remittances sent back to Haiti to provide critical help as the nation tries to rebuild. Those opposed to expediting the admission of Haitians assert that it would not be in the national interest, nor would it be fair to others foreign nationals waiting to reunite with their families.", "There are growing concerns that the crisis conditions in Haiti may result in mass migration from the country. The phenomenon of Haitians coming to the United States by boat without proper travel documents dates back at least to the 1970s. The Reagan Administration reached an agreement in 1981 with the Haitian government to interdict (i.e., stop and search certain vessels suspected of transporting undocumented Haitians), and this policy, with some modifications, has continued. During the first two weeks of February, the U.S. Coast Guard returned almost 90 Haitians found at sea to northern Haiti, although U.S. officials say there is no sign of a mass exodus from Haiti by sea. If mass migration were to occur, Congress may weigh in on the balancing of immigration control responsibilities with humanitarian concerns in the midst of Haiti's humanitarian disaster."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medical Evacuation94", "paragraphs": ["In the initial weeks after the earthquake, U.S. military airlifts brought non-U.S.-citizen Haitians to Florida for medical care that was unavailable in Haiti. These patients, who often had very serious injuries, were admitted to a number of non-federal hospitals, principally in south Florida. On January 27, 2010, Florida Governor Charlie Crist wrote to Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), saying that the state's health care system was reaching saturation, and asking Sebelius to activate the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) to coordinate the distribution of medical evacuees to other states, and to compensate states for the costs of their care. On February 1, 2010, HHS announced that it was activating the NDMS hospital component. Federal medical evacuations resumed at that point, but are no longer underway as of early March, 2010, as the most critical needs have abated or can now be addressed in Haiti.", "HHS administers the NDMS, which consists of three components for the response to mass casualty incidents. First, teams of medical providers deploy rapidly to provide critical medical care in disaster conditions when local health care capacity has been destroyed or overwhelmed. Second, NDMS provides medical evacuation, the coordinated movement of seriously ill or injured victims to sites where they can receive definitive care. Typically, U.S. military assets such as cargo planes and attending medical personnel are used for this purpose. Third, participating U.S. hospitals agree to provide medical care to NDMS evacuees on a voluntary basis, and receive federal reimbursement at 110% of the Medicare rate.", "The first NDMS component is used frequently. Teams are deployed many times each year in response to domestic disasters (for which deployment costs are typically paid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund ) and international humanitarian relief efforts (for which deployment costs are often paid by USAID). NDMS teams were deployed to Haiti shortly after the earthquake. In contrast, the second (medical evacuation) and third (U.S. participating hospital) NDMS components have rarely been activated. Although U.S. military flights had initially brought Haitian medical evacuees to Florida during January, the NDMS hospital component had not yet been activated, and it was not clear at that time if the federal government would assume the costs of care for those patients. ", "The HHS Secretary has considerable discretion with respect to the activation of NDMS. No specific legal triggers or other requirements must be met. However, the Secretary does not have a dedicated funding mechanism to support extensive NDMS deployments. Under HHS policy for this incident, NDMS will reimburse hospitals for the costs of care, for 30 days, for any individual who was medically evacuated from Haiti by NMDS, regardless of citizenship or nationality. NDMS does not pay costs beyond 30 days, costs for services provided by non-hospital facilities (such as rehabilitation facilities), or costs for the care of individuals who were not evacuated through the NDMS system. President Obama has requested emergency supplemental funding to support the Haiti earthquake response. The request includes $220 million for HHS, which would be used, among other things, to reimburse NDMS hospitals that cared for medical evacuees.

In particular, flexible and generous tariff preferences are provided to Haiti's apparel assembly business, which has been established for decades, with admittedly mixed success over time, and viewed by many as one pillar of economic growth in an economy with limited opportunities in the short-run.", "The U.S. Congress continued to support this approach with the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act ( S. 3275 ), introduced on April 28, 2010. The bill, which had bicameral and bipartisan support, extends the CBTPA and the Haiti HOPE Act through FY2020. It focuses on expanding preferences for apparel exports, benefits some have argued might also be extended to other industries to help promote economic diversification. Currently, however, such opportunities are very limited, and Congress appears to have opted to review the HOPE Act carefully and enhance those trade preferences rules that have had the most demonstrable effect in stimulating increased apparel production and exports for the U.S. market, and by extension, job creation in Haiti.", "Apparel accounts for 93% of Haitian exports to the United States and reflects a comparative advantage based on low-cost labor and proximity to the U.S. market. Earthquake damage to apparel firms created new hardships for this industry, and there is need for a considerable increase in both domestic and foreign investment for the apparel industry to survive and expand. Of the 23 plants operating in late 2009, the earthquake completely destroyed one, killing some 500 people, and seriously damaged four others. Currently 19 are fully operational, two are being relocated, and two are closed. Employment attendance rates have returned to levels seen prior to the earthquake, but with fewer factories operating, total employment has fallen from 26,500 to 23,300. Monthly apparel exports have declined from $58.2 million in February 2009 to $33.1 million in February 2010.", "Focusing trade assistance on this sector attempts to respond to Haiti's level of development and play into the best prospects for creating employment in the near term. The strategy does have its critics, who argue that it has had limited effects in the past and should be employed within a broader development plan that seeks to diversify growth of output and exports over the longer term. In addition, critics contend that more needs to be done to provide better job opportunities as the country faces wholesale reconstruction. Congress recognizes these problems and has responded with broader development assistance and within the parameters of the HOPE Act with the detailed labor provisions. For example, the HOPE Act has put in place a system that requires Haitian firms that wish to avail themselves of the tariff preferences to conform to internationally recognized labor standards, and submit to an independent factory monitoring system operated by the United Nations.

It would establish a Senior Coordinator for Haiti within the Department of State who would advise and coordinate all U.S. government policies related to Haiti. It would also direct the USAID Administrator, with input provided by the Coordinator, to submit to Congress a multi-year strategy to provide assistance in support of Haiti's reconstruction.

Emergency Shelter Gap: April 19, 2010", "Appendix D. U.S. Earthquake Assistance to Haiti", "Appendix E. The U.S. Government Emergency Response Mechanism for International Disasters ", "The United States is generally a leader and major contributor to relief efforts in response to humanitarian disasters. The President has broad authority to provide emergency assistance for foreign disasters and the U.S. government provides disaster assistance through several U.S. agencies. The very nature of humanitarian disasters\u2014the need to respond quickly in order to save lives and provide relief\u2014has resulted in a rather unrestricted definition of what this type of assistance consists of at both a policy and an operational level. While humanitarian assistance is assumed to provide for urgent food, shelter, and medical needs, the agencies within the U.S. government providing this support typically expand or contract the definition in response to circumstances. Funds may be used for U.S. agencies to deliver services or to provide grants to international organizations (IOs), international governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private or religious voluntary organizations (PVOs). The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the U.S. government agency charged with coordinating U.S. government and private sector assistance. It also coordinates with international organizations, the governments of countries suffering disasters, and other governments.", "The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) in USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) provides immediate relief materials and personnel, many of whom are already abroad on mission. It is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance and can quickly assemble Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) to assess conditions. OFDA has wide authority to borrow funds, equipment, and personnel from other parts of USAID and other federal agencies. USAID has two other offices that administer U.S. humanitarian aid: Food For Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). USAID administers emergency food aid under FFP (Title II of P.L. 480) and provides relief and development food aid that does not have to be repaid. OTI provides post-disaster transition assistance, which includes mainly short-term peace and democratization projects with some attention to humanitarian elements but not emergency relief.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funds three Dodd humanitarian programs: the Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP), Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) Program, and Foreign Disaster Relief and Emergency Response (FDR/ER). OHDACA provides humanitarian support to stabilize emergency situations and deals with a range of tasks including providing food, shelter and supplies, and medical evacuations. In addition the President has the authority to draw down defense equipment and direct military personnel to respond to disasters. The President may also use the Denton program to provide space-available transportation on military aircraft and ships to private donors who wish to transport humanitarian goods and equipment in response to a disaster.", "Generally, OFDA provides emergency assistance for 30 to 90 days after a disaster. The same is true for Department of Defense humanitarian assistance. After the initial emergency is over, assistance is provided through other channels, such as the regular country development programs of USAID.", "The State Department also administers programs for humanitarian relief with a focus on refugees and the displaced. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Account (ERMA) is a contingency fund that provides wide latitude to the President in responding to refugee emergencies. Assistance to address emergencies lasting more than a year comes out of the regular Migration and Refugee Account (MRA) through the Population, Migration and Refugees (PRM) bureau. PRM assists refugees worldwide, conflict victims, and populations of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), often extended to include internally displaced people (IDPs). Humanitarian assistance includes a range of services from basic needs to community services.", "Appendix F.
