During consideration of H.R. 3058 , the House passed an amendment offered by Representative Souder to prohibit the use of any funding provided under that bill to enforce Section 702 of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 (Section [phone number scrubbed].02, DC Official Code)\u2014the provision that requires District residents to keep their firearms unloaded and disassembled, or bound by a trigger lock. Citing ongoing efforts to reduce firearms-related violence in the city, the District's Delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Mayor Anthony Williams, and Police Chief Charles Ramsey oppose this funding limitation included in H.R. 3058 , as well as bills to overturn the District's handgun control law. Neither the House, Senate, or conference versions of the TTHUD Appropriations Act for FY2006 include a provision that would amend or repeal the District's gun control legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Payment for School Improvement", "paragraphs": ["Beginning with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 ( P.L. 108-199 ), a federal payment for school improvement has been included as part of each year's District of Columbia appropriations act. As part of this payment, funding has been provided for three activities: for the District of Columbia Public Schools to improve public education; for the State Education Office to expand public charter schools; and for the Secretary of the Department of Education to fund opportunity scholarships (private school vouchers) under the District of Columbia School Choice Incentive Act (which was enacted as part of P.L. 108-199 ). Funding for these activities has been provided to show a commitment toward supporting school improvement in traditional public schools and public charter schools, while also demonstrating and evaluating the effectiveness of fostering school improvement through a scholarship or voucher program in which students receive public funding to support their attendance at private schools.", "Under the District of Columbia School Choice Incentive Act, the Secretary of Education funds the operation of a five-year demonstration scholarship program that enables children from low-income families in the District of Columbia to attend private elementary or secondary schools located in the District of Columbia. Students who are residents of the District of Columbia and who are from families with incomes not exceeding 185% of the poverty level are eligible to apply for scholarships valued at up to $7,500 to cover the costs of tuition, fees, and transportation expenses associated with attending a participating private elementary or secondary school located in the District of Columbia. Students are selected to receive scholarships through a lottery. Scholarship recipients remain eligible to continue to participate in the program in subsequent years, so long as their family income does not exceed 200% of the poverty level. Students enrolled in schools identified for school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act are given priority in receiving scholarships (through weighting procedures in the lottery); however, all students meeting program eligibility criteria are eligible for scholarships regardless of whether they were previously enrolled in public or private schools.", "The demonstration project includes a rigorous evaluation component. Among the issues required to be evaluated as part of the program are the academic achievement of scholarship recipients compared with non-recipients, the success of the program in expanding school choice options, and the impact of the program on students and public schools in the District of Columbia. In the first year of implementation, school year 2004-2005, 58 of 109 private schools located in the District of Columbia participated in the program, making available slots for 1,264 students. Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, it is estimated that over 40,000 students may be eligible for the program, and for 2004-2005, 1,848 students who met the program's eligibility criteria applied for scholarships.", "The enactment of the program was contentious, and following the first year of implementation, the program remains controversial. Some of the controversy may be fueled by effects of the limited time for implementation following enactment. The program has been criticized on several fronts including", "the participation of students and schools has not been as great as was anticipated; a sizeable percentage of first-year scholarship recipients had previously been enrolled in private schools; a mismatch between scholarship applicants and available slots in schools across the various grade levels (with an oversupply at the elementary level and a shortage at the secondary level); and the $7,500 scholarship amount does not meet the full cost of attendance for most secondary schools.", "In reaction to some of these concerns, proposals may be made to amend some of the terms and conditions of the opportunity scholarship program. However, given the early stages of the program and the evaluation component, value may found in continuing the demonstration program in its current form before significant changes are made.", "The House version of H.R. 3058 would appropriate $14.566 million for the program, including $1 million for administrative expenses. This is part of a larger effort to strengthen elementary and secondary education in the District. The House bill also includes $13.525 million for the District's public schools and $13.525 million for District's public charter schools. This is consistent with the amount requested by the President for FY2006. The Senate and conference versions of the TTHUD Appropriations Act for FY2006, included $14 million for private school vouchers, which is $1.566 million less than the House bill and the President's request. The Senate and conference versions of the act also included $13 million for public school improvements and $13 million in support of the city's public charter schools. In addition, the conference version of the act includes a provisions conveying, by lease, 15 acres of District land for the construction of a pre-collegiate public charter boarding school."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Marriage Development Accounts", "paragraphs": ["Citing marriage as an important determinant in the poverty status of children and noting that a majority of low-income children in the District are born to single mothers, Senator Brownback, the chairman of the Senate District of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee, included a provision in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2006, S. 1446 , that would establish Marriage Development Accounts (MDAs). The District appropriations, including the MDA provisions included in S. 1446 , were incorporated into H.R. 3058 , the TTHUD Appropriations Act of FY2006, and approved by the House and the Senate during conference consideration of the act.", "As a strategy for strengthening families and improving the life chances of low-income children, the MDA provisions of the TTHUD Act for FY2006 includes $3 million in a special federal payment to fund efforts to encourage marriage among low-income District residents through the use of financial incentives and life skills training. The provision appropriates $1.5 million to establish a Marriage Development Account Fund to be administered by the Capital Area Asset Building Corporation, $850,000 to be awarded to the National Center for Fathering, and $650,000 for the East Capitol Center for Change in support of mentoring and counseling programs. Under the proposal, married couples with adjusted gross incomes of less than $50,000 and net assets of less than $10,000 would be encouraged to establish MDAs. Savings deposited in such accounts would be matched at a ratio of 3:1, with a maximum amount of $9,000. According to the report accompanying the bill ( S.Rept. 109-106 ), couples would receive money management training and assistance to help repair their credit or improve their financial skills. Couples could used their MDA savings to purchase a home, finance education, or start a business. Under the program, engaged couples may receive similar benefits, and the act provides similar assistance to individuals with an adjusted gross income that is less than $25,000. They may receive a maximum match of $4,500.", "In addition to financial incentives, the program is suppose to provide life skills training for participating couples. This training is to be provided through the two local non-profit organizations\u2014the National Center for Fathering and the East Capitol Center for Change. These organizations would be encouraged to expand their network of service providers to include churches, faith-based organizations, and other nonprofit organizations. The program, which was sponsored by Senator Brownback, has the support of the District officials. However, the provision is not without its critics, who argue that there may be more important reasons for marriage other than financial incentives.", "The MDA accounts are similar to Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), which are also designed to assist low-income persons in increasing their savings and improving their financial futures. IDAs provide a 2:1 match to reward the monthly savings of people who are trying to buy their first home, pay for college, or start or expand a small business. Eligibility is not linked to marriage. In the District, IDAs are limited to couples earning less than $25,660 and individuals earning less than $19,140. The House bill does not include a similar provision."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
