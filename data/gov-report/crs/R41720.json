These areas are the focus of this report.", "CES and related concepts have been debated for more than a decade and several Clean/Renewable Energy Standard proposals were offered during the 111th Congress, although none became law. The scope of this report includes a comparative analysis of four proposals of the 111th Congress: S. 20, Clean Energy Standard Act of 2010; S. 3464, Practical Energy and Climate Plan Act of 2010; S. 3813, Renewable Electricity Promotion Act of 2010; and a substitute amendment offered for H.R. 2454, American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. This analysis, which illustrates commonality and key differences among the legislative proposals, includes an assessment of each bill based on a uniform set of design elements.

However, the amount of partial credits received by clean coal and efficient natural gas generation is not explicitly defined.", "CRS analysis of 2009 electricity generation data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) also suggested that 40% of electricity generated could be considered clean energy if renewable energy, nuclear power, and 50% of electricity generated from natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants are classified as clean energy. Further analysis of EIA data assessed the amount of clean energy generation in each state. This work revealed differences among the states regarding existing clean energy generation, with some states currently generating more than 80% of electricity from such clean energy sources and other states generating less than 5%.", "Finally, the Clean Energy Standard debate involves several policy design options that Congress might consider, including (1) Should the policy credit existing and/or incremental clean energy generation? (2) What should be the value of alternative compliance payments? (3) Should utility companies of a certain size be exempt?

The fuel mix for U.S. electricity generation includes four primary categories: (1) coal, (2) natural gas, (3) renewables, and (4) nuclear. As illustrated in Figure 1 , coal is the largest electricity generation fuel source for both actual (2009) and projected (2035) generation. However, EIA projects that natural gas and renewables are the only fuel sources that would experience growth, in terms of percentage of the electricity generation mix, over the projection period. ", "During his January 25, 2011 State of the Union speech, President Obama proposed a Clean Energy Standard (CES) policy framework that would result in 80% of U.S. electricity generation coming from \"clean energy\" sources by 2035. \"Clean energy,\" as described by President Obama, would include renewables, nuclear power, and partial credits for clean coal and efficient natural gas.

Many CES proposals require individual utility companies to comply with a federal CES, although some utilities may be exempt from CES requirements based on their total amount of annual electricity sales. Generally, utilities can comply with CES requirements through a combination of (1) electricity generation from qualified clean energy sources, (2) purchasing clean energy credits, and (3) making alternative compliance payments (ACPs). Each of these will be discussed below.", "Previous CES proposals have addressed multiple policy design parameters, including (1) technologies that qualify, (2) base quantities of electricity, (3) goals and requirements, (4) alternative compliance payments.

A clear definition of qualifying sources is important as it allows a utility company to determine which electricity generation options are available for compliance. Each of the four proposals analyzed in this paper include typical renewable energy as qualified sources. All four proposals also include coal-mine methane and landfill gas as qualifying sources. Differences among the proposals, generally, are associated with the inclusion and definition of qualified hydropower and incremental geothermal as well as the inclusion/definition of waste-to-energy, qualified nuclear, advanced coal/fossil with carbon capture and storage, and re-powering/co-firing biomass at existing coal generation facilities.

In order to qualify for energy efficiency/savings credits, utility companies may have to institute programs that result in consumer demand reductions. One example of such a program might be subsidies for high efficiency air conditioning systems. All four proposals analyzed allow for energy efficiency/savings credits, although some proposals place limits on how much energy efficiency/savings credits can be used to comply with a broader Clean Energy Standard. For example, one proposal allows utility companies to use energy efficiency credits to satisfy up to 25% of the CES target. Therefore, 75% of a utility company's CES target must be met by generating electricity from qualified sources, purchasing CES credits, or making alternative compliance payments. One challenge associated with energy efficiency/savings credits might be determining a baseline for calculating energy efficiency and therefore the number of credits that result from various energy efficiency programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Compliance Payments", "paragraphs": ["Alternative compliance payments (ACPs) can be paid by utility companies in lieu of generating qualified clean energy or purchasing clean energy credits. Typically expressed in cents per kilowatt-hour, ACPs provide utility companies with some degree of flexibility associated with meeting the targets/goals of a Clean Energy Standard. From a policy perspective, determining the value of ACPs can be somewhat complicated. Setting the ACP too low could potentially result in minimal development of \"clean\" electricity generation because some companies might choose to pay the ACP instead of generating or purchasing qualified clean energy. At the same time rate payer costs may increase as utility companies seek to recover their compliance costs. However, setting the ACP value too high might result in relatively large electricity rate increases in areas/regions that lack clean energy resources. Nevertheless, ACPs are basically a cost containment mechanism that effectively place a cap on the value of clean energy credits. Determining the value of ACPs will likely involve comparing the cost of generation from all qualified sources to the lowest generation cost from any fuel (e.g., coal, natural gas, nuclear, renewable) source.

However, allowing existing generation to count toward a CES puts some states in a better position when compared to other states, as indicated in Figure 3 . Under this scenario, and depending on specifics of the proposed legislation, some states may experience some degree of wealth transfer as a result of purchasing CES credits from states with an excess of qualified \"clean energy\" electricity generation. Alternatively, Congress might decide to only allow incremental generation capacity added after the policy is enacted to count towards CES compliance. If such a policy were adopted, Congress may choose to structure the CES in a different manner than that proposed by President Obama.

In essence, ACPs act as a cost ceiling for complying with a Clean Energy Standard. Setting the value of ACPs can be complicated by factors such as the cost of electricity generation, transmission availability, regional \"clean energy\" resources, and finance costs for advanced technology. As a result, setting a single ACP that encourages \"clean energy\" electricity generation for the entire country can be difficult and challenging. An ACP set too low may simply raise rate payer electricity costs and encourage minimum amount of \"clean energy\" generation. In contrast, an ACP set too high may not be acceptable for states that are not endowed with \"clean energy\" resources. Evaluating the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of qualified \"clean energy\" generation options may be a way to begin estimating an ACP. However, since each region's \"clean energy\" resource base varies (solar in the southwest versus the northeast) and each technology may have different financial requirements due to real or perceived levels of technology risk, an LCOE-based analysis of ACP levels may, at best, only produce a reasonable range for the ACP. Setting a single, absolute ACP value that will be perceived as fair and equitable for all regions, and for all technologies, may be a challenging endeavor.

Second, the back-end loaded approach, where targets are low in the beginning years of a policy and then increase steeply in later years, may be beneficial for nuclear and \"clean-coal\" generation as it allows more time for development and commercialization. However, under this scenario if beginning year targets are too low some may argue that this approach does not result in demand large enough to incentivize investment in new renewable and natural gas projects. Finally, the stepped approach might include targets and goals that increase every three to five years (example: 45% by 2015, 50% by 2020, etc.).
