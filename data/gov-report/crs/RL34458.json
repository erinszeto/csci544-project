While proponents of the franking privilege argue that the frank allows Members to fulfill their representational duties by providing for greater communication between the Member and individual constituents, critics argue that it is both financially wasteful and gives an unfair advantage to incumbents in congressional elections.

A mass mailing is defined by statute as a franked mailing of 500 or more substantially similar pieces of unsolicited mail sent in the same session of Congress. Mass communications include all unsolicited mailings or communications of substantially identical content distributed to 500 or more persons, regardless of media. Examples of mass communications include radio, television, newspaper, and Internet advertisements; automated phone calls; mass facsimiles; and mass emails distributed to a non-subscriber emailing list.", "Between 1997 and 2008, House Members sent 1.34 billion pieces of mass mail at a total postage cost of $224.5 million, producing a calendar-year average of 111.6 million pieces of mass mail costing an average of $18.7 million (Table 1). Most Representatives sent mass mailings. During each calendar year 1997-2008, an average of 84% of House Members sent at least one mass mailing. Among Members who sent at least one mass mailing, the average annual number of pieces of mail sent by a Member was 303,270 at a postage cost of $50,834.", "Although the annual number of pieces of mail sent remained relatively constant between 1997 and 2008, significant quarterly variations occurred within each Congress (Figure 1). These expenditures continue a historical pattern of Congress spending less on official mail costs during non-election years than during election years (Table 3). However, analysis of quarterly data on Member mass mailing costs indicates that, due to the structure of the fiscal year calendar, comparisons of election-year and non-election-year mailing data tend to overstate the effect of pre-election increases in mail costs, since they also capture the effect of a large spike in mass mailings from the fourth quarter of the previous calendar year.", "At the direction of the Committee on House Administration, in January 2009, the House began reporting the volume and cost of individual mass communications instead of only mass mailings. Between 2009 and 2011, House Members sent 1.27 billion pieces of mass communication at a total cost of $131.5 million, producing a calendar-year average of 573.1 million pieces of mass communication costing an average of $43.8 million (Table 2). During 2009 and 2010, an annual average of 92% of House Members sent at least one mass communication.", "Beginning with the second quarter of calendar year 2011, the House began separately reporting the volume and cost of both mass mailings and mass communications.

This is an expected result; the definition of mass communication used during that period is inclusive of all mass mailings as well as numerous other forms of communication. It is important to note, however, that this should not be interpreted as an increase in overall communication between Members and constituents.

The highest peak occurs in the fourth quarter of the first year, when 24.7% of all pieces of mass mail are sent.

In particular, mass mail sent in the third quarter of the second year of any Congress (July-September) must be sent during the first month of the quarter, prior to the beginning of the prohibited period in early August. Thus, the above-average third quarter mass mailing totals for even-numbered years somewhat understate the increased rate of mailing prior to the election; all third-quarter mail is sent in the six-week period between July 1 and the beginning of the prohibited period in early August.", "Below-average totals are observed in the fourth quarter of the second year of each Congress and the first quarter of the first year of each Congress (marked as 'C').

With only 28 quarters of data on mass communications, it cannot be determined whether the observed variation is cyclical (like the mass mailing data from 1997-2008) by Congress or merely random variation within the observed seven-year period. Since mass mailings are a component of mass communications and it is probable that mass mailings volumes would continue on a cyclical pattern as in the past, it might be expected that mass communications would also systematically vary, in similar patterns. However, such observable variation may disappear or be strongly attenuated if the volume of mass communications other than mass mailings did not vary by quarter, or if such variation followed a different pattern than mass mailing variation. In addition, the large increase in 2011 suggests that Member use of mass communications is changing, and future use may defy past patterns.

A fiscal year comparison results in a large difference, while a calendar year comparison results in virtually no difference. In 2011 and 2012, however, there is a substantial difference. This is due to a large increase in the amount of mass communications sent in the third and fourth quarters of 2011.

Proponents of the franking privilege also argue that Representative accountability is enhanced by use of the frank. By regularly maintaining direct communication with their constituents, Members provide citizens with information by which they can consider current public policy issues, as well as information on policy positions by which voters can judge a Member in future elections. It is maintained that if legislative matters could not be easily transmitted to constituents free of charge to Members, most Members could not afford to pay for direct communications with their constituents.", "The analysis presented here offers three contributions to this debate. First, the analysis finds that most Representatives make use of mass communications, mass mailings, or both to communicate with their constituents, with an annual average of 84% of Members sending at least one mass mailing during the period 1997-2008, and an annual average of 94% of Members sending at least one mass communication between 2009 and 2015. Second, the analysis confirms that the cost per piece of mass communication is indeed less than the cost per piece of mass mailing. Although this is not an unexpected finding, it implies that new communications technology may lower the overall cost to Congress for constituent communication, or allow for a greater amount of communication at the same cost.", "Finally, the analysis finds significant and regular quarterly variation in Member mass mailing through 2008, with the total number of pieces sent by Members following an eight-quarter pattern that corresponds to the two-year cycle of each Congress. The analysis shows two peaks in mailings, the first during the last quarter of the first session of Congress and the second during the two quarters prior to the pre-election prohibition on Member mass mailings. While there is currently not enough data on mass communications to conclude that similar patterns exist beyond 2008, the observed variation implies that mass communications are probably not evenly distributed throughout a Congress.", "These findings provide insight regarding concerns about election-year mass mailing expenditures. Although they confirm that Members send more pieces of mass mail or communications in the quarters just prior to the biennial elections, the findings also show that mass mailing peaks twice, and the larger peak takes place not prior to the election, but at the end of the first session.", "These findings also suggest that previous comparisons of election-year and non-election-year franked mail data may need to be considered. When mass mailings are compared by fiscal year, both the first session spike and the pre-election increase are in the same year, so the data show inflated election-year numbers and suppressed non-election-year numbers.
