An example of the latter case is a 1947 report on postwar foreign assistance, which found that some foreign-aid spending had been \"specifically defined and authorized, and that this ... may be compiled, verified, and estimated,\" but that other aid was not documented, could not be estimated, and was not monitored by Congress. In that report, and many others, the joint committee identified areas where government agencies were too autonomous from congressional control in determining how money was spent. While neither narrative is necessarily exclusive of the other, being aware of each helps to understand the joint committee's interests.", "On the eve of World War II, the United States owed $55 billion to its creditors. In two years, massive national defense requirements expanded the debt by nearly 50% to $80 billion, with the \"prospect [of] a national debt of at least $200 billion by conservative estimates.\" While these figures may today seem modest, a $200 billion debt in 1942 represented 123% of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with current debt, which stands at 92% of GDP.", "For many policymakers, the debt was so high and the prospect of war so certain that immediate action was required to strengthen federal finances. This view was reflected on the pages of many of the nation's leading newspapers. A 1940 Chicago Tribune headline warned: \"America Limps Financially As Arming Starts.\" The Los Angeles Times reported that the National Chamber of Commerce cautioned that even entering the war would bankrupt the country.", "Furthering the call for fiscal austerity was a quickly increasing inflation rate. Testifying before the Senate Committee on Finance in 1941, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau warned that a \"strong fiscal program\" was required to counteract an accelerated increase in prices and the cost of living. Fears of inflation as a result of the fiscal situation ran so high that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt considered price fixing to control rising prices. Marriner Stoddard Eccles, chair of the Federal Reserve, echoed these concerns in December 1940 in a special report to Congress encouraging higher taxes and reduced federal expenditures as an alternative to deficit spending to finance the war in order to \"forestall the development of inflationary tendencies.\" Deficit reduction was seen as an essential component of war preparedness.", "These fears were not lost on Members of Congress, who began to discuss the federal debt as a national security concern. Just three weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Senator Byrd, the joint committee's chairman, capturing the sentiment of the time, noted, \"[B]efore the war, economy in nonessential spending was important. Now it is vital.\" Thus, the call for a reduction of nonessential federal expenditures served many purposes. Spending that was eliminated would save money that could be applied to the war effort. Additionally, it was argued, American taxpayers would be more willing to shoulder the high taxes needed to fund the war if they saw that the federal government was acting frugally. Finally, reduced federal deficit spending could help control potentially damaging rates of inflation.", "For the duration of the war, the joint committee was fairly active in identifying potential savings in the federal budget. The conclusion of the war, however, may have deprived both the joint committee and Congress as a whole of such a strong sense of urgency to control spending. The joint committee's interests narrowed as time passed, and Senator Byrd's retirement in 1965 further slowed the output of the joint committee."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Initial Reports (1941\u20131943)", "paragraphs": ["On December 26, 1941, the Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures released a \"partial report,\" in the nature of a working draft, largely limited to programs \"established originally as depression measures.\" In this report, the joint committee pledged to determine which permanent agencies were essential to the operation of the government and how those agencies could operate more efficiently. In particular, the report singled out government corporations and the Department of Agriculture as prospective targets of scrutiny, and suggested immediately abolishing the Office of Education, Works Progress Administration, Civilian Conservation Corps, and National Youth Administration, totaling $1.3 billion in potential reductions. A supplemental report issued in July 1942 followed up on each of these suggested reductions and claimed that $1.313 billion had been saved as a result of the joint committee's recommendations. A progress report issued in December 1943 claimed credit for approximately $2 billion in savings to-date.", "Debate and statements in the Congressional Record reflect only limited disagreement on the need to cut certain agencies. Senator Byrd and Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau supported \"drastic cuts\" in these programs, while Senators Gerald Nye and Robert M. La Follette Jr. urged caution in jeopardizing the nation's food sources in a time of war. In minority views to the 1941 report, Senator La Follette expressed concern about unforeseen problems with Senator Byrd's proposals. Cuts in aid to farmers and youth would disproportionately affect lower-income Americans. Nearly half of all farm families earned less than $3 per month and depended on assistance from the Farm Security Administration, a program the joint committee recommended be abolished. Additionally, the Works Progress Administration and National Youth Administration, programs also recommended for discontinuation, provided school lunches to over 3 million underprivileged children.

Senator Byrd offered a caveat in these reports in noting that the joint committee had not been given unrestricted access to government data about the stockpiles. In 1962, the day after President John F. Kennedy requested a congressional investigation of the federal stockpiles, Senator Byrd in a letter to the President explained that \"effective work in [the area of federal stockpiles] will continue to be difficult until the mantle of secrecy is lifted.\" He went on to request an executive order declassifying more information on the stockpiles.", "Although the President in calling for the investigation said he was \"astonished\" by the size of the stockpiles, being more than double emergency requirements, the President's action may be an instance where the joint committee's interest played a role.

The joint committee shone a light on many federal programs and activities, but it was the responsibility of other committees to follow through. The joint committee's role was solely oversight. The joint committee's authority also duplicated the oversight authority of the Appropriations Committees and other committees, and it lacked legislative authority.", "The joint committee was so synonymous with the interests and perspectives of Senator Byrd that its eponymous byname was the Byrd committee. The joint committee existed in the era of strong committee chairs, which may be part of the explanation for the committee's activities and recommendations. Its membership also comprised chairs and ranking minority members of other committees, who could exercise legislative authority in those roles without resorting to any power or influence that might reside in the joint committee, leaving it to Senator Byrd to define the joint committee's role.", "Senator Byrd was an advocate for viewing the federal budget as a whole, rather than in its separate parts as the House and Senate divided the President's budget for individual committees to act on. Senator Byrd's idea, however, was not broadly embraced in Congress during his tenure. Acceptance came later. In addition, Senator Byrd's purposes generally aligned with a perspective favoring fewer federal commitments\u2014a perspective congressional observers have noted was increasingly out of step with his party in the post-war era.", "Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the joint committee was Senator Byrd's desire to exert congressional control over all components of federal spending and to recapture congressional authority where the executive branch had managed to obtain discretion to make budget decisions. Many subsequent legislative enactments of the modern congressional era, including the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, projected congressional budget authority. Senator Byrd's views on Congress's own consideration of the budget in its totality and Representative Mahon's scorekeeping reports live on as key components of the Congressional Budget Act.", "As indicated, with political support, it is a straightforward process to create a House, Senate, or joint committee. The challenge arises in assigning it a role. Standing committees are protective of their jurisdictions, and the House is protective of its constitutional prerogatives over budget decision making vis-\u00e0-vis the Senate. It can be difficult to carve out a unique role for a new committee, whether it is temporary or permanent. If the committee is given only study authority, it may be difficult to obtain legislative results based on its recommendations. If the committee is granted legislative authority, it may be difficult to avoid crippling conflict with standing committees.", "The creation of a committee charged with a role in cutting federal spending could itself be challenging. Does federal spending include only appropriations or also entitlements and possibly even tax expenditures? There are committees that could assume such a charge, and there are processes\u2014appropriations, authorization, and reconciliation\u2014that could be used to consider and pass legislation making cuts.", "Moreover, the objective of a new committee would be its role in cutting federal spending\u2014cutting spending would be the desired end, not the means to the end. Attaining that objective responsibly and with public support would require one or more committees to examine federal programs and activities on the basis of some agreed-on criteria, for example, cost-benefit, effectiveness, duplication of similar programs or activities, constitutional authority, administrative controls and potential for corruption, national purpose, need for federal action and capacity of states and localities, market failure addressed, economic impact, demographic and socioeconomic impact, alternatives, or continuing need.", "Alternately, standing congressional committees have oversight power circumscribed only by constitutional limits, and legislative authority circumscribed only by chamber rules. Either chamber can direct one or more of its committees to undertake an activity or set of activities or series of activities, and party conferences can condition chairmanships on adherence to an oversight or legislative agenda. Coordination of many actors in a large legislative purpose, however, can be a complex exercise.", "The first 25 years of the joint committee's existence preceded the modern era's expansion of the federal government's role and responsibilities, including the creation and growth of health-care entitlements.
