The U.S. Congress must approve the United States and South Korea free trade agreement (KORUS FTA) and the European Parliament must vote on the European Union and South Korea free trade agreement (KOREU FTA) before the FTAs can take effect. If the FTAs are ratified, it is possible there could be a \"first mover\" advantage for either the United States or the European Union, depending on which FTA is approved first. Some argue that both agreements have shortcomings and should not be approved.", "This report provides U.S. lawmakers with a comparison of the manufacturing components in the KORUS and KOREU FTAs. Congressional interest in an FTA between the European Union and South Korea mostly centers on those U.S. industries competing with European industrial sectors, especially motor vehicles. The two pending FTAs raise questions about what it could mean for U.S. manufacturers if the United States takes longer, or fails altogether, to implement the KORUS FTA, while the European Union and South Korea possibly move ahead to approve and implement their outstanding FTA. In such a case, the possibility exists that the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers between the European Union and South Korean markets could result in U.S. manufacturers losing South Korean market share to European competitors. On balance, most U.S. and European manufacturing sectors, with some auto manufacturers in particular among notable dissenters, argue that the pending FTAs will be beneficial and are largely supportive. On the other side, labor unions in the United States and the European Union are considerably more skeptical, claiming that South Korean companies could be the biggest beneficiaries, since they could gain even greater access to the significantly larger U.S. and EU markets. Labor union leaders say the FTA will result in further job losses as their respective manufacturing workforces compete for market share with competitive South Korean manufacturers in their own domestic markets.", "Various forces will affect how and when each side might move forward on its respective FTA. Congress has a direct role in the approval of the KORUS FTA, but until recently legislative consideration of the agreement had been at a standstill. On December 3, 2010, President Obama announced that cabinet-level negotiations and his discussions with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak produced modifications in the KORUS FTA that he believes addresses his concerns and those of Congress. Some lawmakers argue that the KORUS FTA provides a greater advantage to South Korean manufacturers than to U.S. manufacturers. Others have expressed their support for economic and national security reasons.", "No specific date has been announced by the European Union on when it expects to approve its FTA with South Korea, but the European Commission (the EU's executive charged with negotiating agreements with other countries, among its areas of responsibility) has indicated that it would like to move forward in 2011.", "Automotive trade is the primary focus of this report because it is one of the most contentious and high-profile manufacturing issues in the KORUS and KOREU FTA deliberations. Additionally, brief overviews are included of other selected U.S. manufacturing sectors that could be affected by these FTAs, such as home appliances, consumer electronics, and pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

To date, the United States has entered into a dozen FTAs with various trading partners including Israel, Canada, Singapore, Chile, and Australia. FTA agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea are pending before Congress now. This report evaluates the implications of the potential U.S. agreement with South Korea for American manufacturers and compares it with a similar pending free trade agreement between South Korea and the European Union (EU). South Korea has already enacted FTAs with countries such as Chile, Singapore, and India, and also is currently negotiating FTAs with other trading partners, including Australia, Canada, Japan, and Mexico. The implications of these arrangements for the United States are not discussed in this report. ", "A major outstanding issue in the commercial relationship between the United States and South Korea is the three-year old pending FTA, commonly referred to as the KORUS FTA. It was signed by the Bush Administration in 2007, but has yet to be submitted to Congress for approval. If accepted, it would be the second-largest free trade arrangement approved by the United States next to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which entered into force in 1994. On December 3, 2010, President Obama announced that cabinet-level negotiations and his discussions with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak produced modifications in the KORUS FTA that he believes addresses his concerns and those of Congress. In a nutshell, the pending KORUS FTA would eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers for U.S. and South Korean manufacturers in a range of industrial sectors, including automobiles, consumer and industrial products, textiles and apparel, and pharmaceuticals and medical devices. ", "The main section of this report compares the manufacturing components of the two agreements. In particular, it reviews automotive trade, the most politically and economically sensitive manufacturing sector in both agreements. Also included is a brief overview of the possible implications of the two pending FTAs on other selected industrial sectors affected by the FTAs: home appliances, consumer electronics, textiles and apparel, and pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The report begins by providing a legislative outlook and reviews the positions of key stakeholders.

", "As Congress considers what action it might take on the KORUS FTA, the European Union and South Korea have completed their own negotiations of a comprehensive free trade agreement (KOREU FTA). They initialed the agreement on October 15, 2009. Signing and ratifying the KOREU FTA is a complicated process. The FTA must be formally adopted by the EU Council of Ministers, which represents the national governments and is the European Union's main decision-making body. Thereafter, it can be submitted to the European Parliament, which represents the citizens of the EU, for a vote. The KOREU FTA is the first bilateral trade agreement subject to an up or down vote in the European Parliament under the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty, which became effective in 2009. If approved, it means the FTA is provisionally ratified in the European Union and can enter into force. Provisional application is a common practice in the European Union (EU trade agreements with Mexico (2000) and Chile (2003) were also subject to provisional application). Full ratification of the KOREU FTA requires approval by all 27 member states. In South Korea, the process is easier since only the approval of the National Assembly is required for ratification. ", "In many ways, the KOREU FTA is a similar agreement to the pending KORUS FTA. It is expected to facilitate manufacturing trade between the European Union and South Korea by eventually removing most customs duties and addressing regulatory obstacles across various sectors, including autos, consumer electronics, and pharmaceuticals. The possible competitive impact on U.S. manufacturers of a KOREU FTA will likely be debated by Congress when it considers whether or not to ratify the KORUS FTA, which could be in 2011. ", "Likewise, the competitive implications of a KORUS FTA for European manufacturers, particularly for European automakers, will be considered as the European Parliament debates whether to approve the KOREU FTA. It remains to be seen if the KORUS FTA or KOREU FTA will be ratified first, or if either agreement will be approved. Some observers speculate that the auto sections of the FTAs may require some form of side agreement or other arrangement, which have yet to be worked out, before either agreement can be passed by the U.S. Congress or the European Parliament."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholder Perspectives", "paragraphs": ["A large number of U.S. and EU industry observers expect gains for their respective industrial sectors upon the implementation of the KORUS FTA and the KOREU FTA. Various economic impact studies are used to support their positive assessments. One U.S. business advocacy group, the U.S.-Korea FTA Business Coalition, which represents a broad-based group of U.S. companies, concludes the KORUS FTA \"will give U.S. exporters and investors a competitive edge.\" Similarly, U.S. business groups such as the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) are also supportive of the KORUS FTA. A cross-section of U.S. manufacturing sectors, including information technology, aircraft equipment, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals, stand to gain from the KORUS FTA based on assessments by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) and the U.S. Department of Commerce. ", "The ITC, which generates official estimates of the likely impacts of proposed trade agreements, estimates that the reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers to U.S. manufactured and agricultural goods under the KORUS FTA would increase U.S. goods exports to Korea by $10 billion to $11 billion and boost U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by nearly $12 billion. The Administration estimates that full implementation of the KORUS FTA could add up to 70,000 jobs in the United States. ", "Europe's business federation, Business Europe, has a positive assessment of the pending KOREU FTA stating \"the EU-Korea FTA will bring significant benefits to European firms.\" One study estimates the KOREU FTA would create up to $24.2 billion (\u20ac19 billion) in new trade in goods and services for EU exporters. Almost all EU and member states business confederations and sectoral groups support the agreement.", "Nevertheless, the business communities in the United States and the European Union are not uniformly in favor of their respective pending bilateral agreements with South Korea. Most prominently, until the December 2010 supplemental agreement between the U.S. and South Korea, trade in automobiles remained a lingering issue. A key stumbling block to approval of the KORUS FTA had been complaints by Ford, Chrysler, and the United Auto Workers (UAW) that it did not do nearly enough to open the South Korean market to U.S. auto sales. Ford changed its position on the KORUS FTA in December 2010 and issued a statement in support of the revised agreement based on the strengthened automotive provisions. GM issued a positive statement on the KORUS FTA in December 2010. The UAW is also supportive of the revised agreement.", "Views also diverge among European carmakers. Some European car producers are relatively neutral on the KOREU FTA, particularly those that export larger European luxury cars and have created a strong market niche for their automobiles in South Korea (see Appendix A ). European automakers of smaller and middle-sized cars, such as Fiat, are most often in direct competition with South Korean manufacturers like Hyundai and Kia. Thus, they continue to push for what they deem a balanced and symmetric liberalization of the two auto markets. Beyond a possible competitive threat, some European automakers claim their access to the South Korean market might remain hampered by non-tariff barriers. Ivan Hodac, secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), claims 30,000 manufacturing jobs could be lost and 10 plants closed across Europe if the KOREU FTA is implemented.", "The steel sectors in the United States and the European Union are also notable dissenters. U.S.-based steel manufacturers argue the KORUS FTA would weaken U.S. trade remedy laws (i.e., antidumping and countervailing duty). EUROFER, the European Union's steel industry representative, has raised concerns about the KOREU FTA stating, \"the result is sectoral winners and losers with potential negative effects for steelmaking in Europe.\" ", "Initially U.S. and EU labor groups were largely opposed to their respective pending FTAs with South Korea. They viewed the FTAs as bad deals for their workers, possibly threatening U.S. and EU manufacturing jobs because of the asymmetrical commercial relationship, among other reasons. Unlike the positive data presented by the U.S. government and most business groups, research by the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute claims the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea would increase by about $16.7 billion and cost 159,000 American jobs within seven years after the KORUS FTA takes effect.", "However, with the modifications announced in December 2010 the UAW issued a statement in support of the KORUS FTA. The UAW stated that \"the changes announced to the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA) today are a dramatic step toward changing from a one-way street to a two-way street for trade between the U.S. and South Korea.\" Other labor groups like the United Steelworkers and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) remain opposed. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) also remains opposed to the agreement with South Korea, citing major concerns over provisions that the union believes would encourage the offshoring of U.S. jobs. ", "In Europe, the European Metalworkers' Federation (EMF) has expressed similar apprehension explaining the pending KOREU FTA would further worsen the already difficult situation of the European car sector and could result in significant job losses. They see the pending KOREU FTA as unbalanced, which could give South Korean automakers a competitive advantage. European trade unions representing textiles, clothing, and leather workers are also on record against the KOREU FTA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Possible First Mover Advantage", "paragraphs": ["Manufacturers from the United States and the European Union compete to export their products to South Korea. Each side sells many of the same products to South Korean consumers. In 2009, U.S. goods exports to South Korea totaled $28.6 billion, while EU goods exports to South Korea were about the same at $29.8 billion (see Table 1 ). For U.S. manufacturers, South Korea was the sixth-leading goods export destination behind the larger and more commercially significant markets of the European Union, Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan in 2009. For EU manufacturers, South Korea ranked as the 12 th -leading export market, well behind the United States, Switzerland, China, Russia, India, Canada, and Australia, among others, in 2009. Major U.S. merchandise export categories to South Korea are machinery, medical devices, and aircraft and parts, while top EU goods exports to South Korea include machinery, vehicles (cars and trucks), and medical devices. U.S. and EU negotiators paid particular attention to these sectors as they negotiated their respective FTAs with South Korea. ", "Given this, some argue the implementation of a KORUS FTA or a KOREU FTA could provide a competitive advantage (a so-called first mover advantage) by displacing the other's products in the South Korean market. There is concern among some U.S. manufacturers that they could find themselves at a disadvantage if European goods enter the South Korean market duty-free, or if non-tariff barriers are eliminated for EU manufacturers, before U.S. products receive comparable benefits. If the KOREU FTA takes effect first, business groups such as NAM claim U.S. manufacturers could find themselves locked out of the South Korean market. According to NAM, ", "Hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs depend already on existing exports of manufactured products to Korea. We risk those jobs by not moving forward on the KORUS agreement as quickly as possible\u2014already the EU is close to implementing their own FTA with Korea, which will make their exports far more competitive. We cannot fall behind in crucial markets like Korea.", "Notwithstanding a possible first mover advantage, it seems U.S. and EU manufacturers are likely to benefit less from their respective FTAs with South Korea when compared with the possible gains for South Korean manufacturers in the larger U.S. and EU markets. This is mostly because South Korea is a relatively smaller market with 48.6 million consumers and a gross domestic product (GDP) of $1.4 trillion. The United States market has nearly 310 million people and a GDP of $14.3 trillion, while the European Union market consists of 492 million people with a GDP of $14.4 trillion. Yet, of the three pending FTAs negotiated by the United States, the one with South Korea is the largest. ", "So far, no data have been released by the U.S. government comparing the possible trade effects on U.S. exporters if the KOREU FTA is implemented before the KORUS FTA. One business advocacy group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, funded a study which found the United States could lose 345,017 jobs, $20.3 billion in export sales, and $40.4 billion in U.S. national output nationwide if the EU and Canada FTAs with South Korea are enacted and the KORUS FTA is not implemented. Another estimate produced by the Ways & Means Committee Republican Staff found that the United States could lose $1.1 billion in exports to South Korea if the pending KOREU FTA is fully implemented and the United States fails to implement the KORUS FTA. ", "A 2007 U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) study on the KORUS FTA concluded the United States likely would import more South Korean products such as motor vehicles and parts, textiles and apparel, and footwear if the agreement is implemented. The same pattern is forecast for Europe. Economic studies indicate South Korea will likely increase its exports of goods to the European Union, especially of automobiles and electronics. South Korean-built cars exported to the European Union could be among the major beneficiaries once the KOREU FTA is implemented, as the European Union would eliminate its existing 10% tariff on South Korean-built cars within three to five years. Other South Korean industrial sectors might also gain market share in the European Union. Comparable export and import patterns also mean the KORUS FTA and KOREU FTA tackle many of the same issues because U.S. and European manufacturers compete directly in various industrial sectors. U.S. and EU consumers also stand to benefit from the two pending FTAs as a broader selection of goods, possibly at lower prices, become available due to increased trade with South Korea."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Competing Automobile Manufacturers", "paragraphs": ["Motor vehicles are the most controversial manufacturing issue in both agreements because of the industry's importance as a domestic employer and source of innovation, as well as an export sector for all three trading partners.

Passenger vehicles built in South Korea are exported to the United States and the European Union in large numbers, even though exports were down considerably in 2009 over the previous year largely due to the overall economic downturn in the auto market.

There is a low import penetration rate: passenger car imports (cars made in the United States, the European Union, and other foreign markets and exported to South Korea) accounted for 5.2% of South Korea's total domestic sales in 2009 of 1.2 million cars, compared with 6.4% the previous year. Cars manufactured by GM-Daewoo or Renault Samsung in Korea and sold in Korea are excluded from this market share figure. ", "Foreign carmakers exported nearly 61,000 passenger vehicles to South Korea in 2009, as shown in Table 3 . Of these sales, European luxury vehicles such as BMWs, Mercedes, and Audis comprised over half; six of the top 10 best-selling imported cars by model were European brands, reports the Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association (KAIDA, see Appendix A ). Japanese automakers accounted for 28% of all imported domestic passenger vehicles in 2009. U.S. car manufacturers represented the smallest share at 10% (with no American models among the top 10 best sellers among imported cars in 2009). Based on these figures, some U.S. and European car manufacturers argue an unbalanced trade relationship exists. This has become a central issue for some lawmakers, both in the United States and the European Union. They believe auto trade needs to be more fully addressed before the pending KORUS or KOREU FTAs can be ratified.", "On the other side, South Korea's auto industry, and the South Korean government, argues that while the number of imported cars may seem low, there has been a substantial increase in imports of U.S. and European-built cars over the last decade. Exports of U.S. automobiles to South Korea rose by nearly 400%, from 1,214 to more than 6,100, between 2000 and 2009, while European auto exports grew over 1,000% from 3,176 to 37,826 during the same period (see Table 3 ).

The European Parliament's Committee on International Trade has proposed a clause to accompany the KOREU FTA, which would strengthen the safeguard clause in case of an import surge. It would, among other things, allow industry and the European Parliament to request an investigation (this provision applies not just to autos, but to any industries affected by increased imports) and proposes applying safeguard measures at the regional level in exceptional cases. This matter remains unresolved, as it raises several sticky issues for the European Union, including whether regional emergency safeguard measures (i.e., imposition of emergency tariffs in a single EU member state or group of countries in the event of an import surge) would violate the European Union's single market rules, and possibly threatens to delay ratification of the KOREU FTA for months.
