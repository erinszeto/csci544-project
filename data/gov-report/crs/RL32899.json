These included appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); assistance for families and communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma; reform of the Government Sponsored Enterprises\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Federal Home Loan Banks (GSEs and FHLBs); revisions to the FHA loan insurance program; and changes to existing housing programs such as the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. However, the 109 th Congress adjourned without completing action in many of these areas.", "During the appropriations process for both FY2006 and FY2007, Congress faced possible cuts in various HUD programs. In FY2006, the President proposed to reduce the HUD budget by 9%, which included removing the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program from HUD. Congress did not make the majority of the reductions requested by the President. In FY2007, the President proposed to reduce funding to at least 13 HUD programs, while increasing funding for 11 others. In its proposed spending bills, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees restored many of the proposed cuts. However, at the end of calendar year 2006, Congress had not passed a budget bill for FY2007. Instead, it provided funding for HUD, among other agencies, through three continuing resolutions, the third of which expires on February 15, 2007. For most HUD programs, this means that funding continues at the FY2006 level.", "Congress twice appropriated funds to HUD after the 2005 hurricanes. First, Congress provided $11.5 billion for the CDBG program to be used in affected areas ( P.L. 109-148 ). This amount was divided among the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and Texas. The second appropriation ( P.L. 109-234 ) provided $5.2 billion more to the CDBG program for hurricane recovery. In addition to these two allocations of CDBG funds, in P.L. 109-148 Congress provided $390 million in supplemental funding for Section 8 vouchers for families that had received HUD assistance before being displaced by Hurricane Katrina.", "Other activities in the 109 th Congress included consideration of two bills to strengthen oversight of the GSEs and FHLBs under one regulator ( S. 190 and H.R. 1461 ). The House passed H.R. 1461 on October 26, 2005, while the Senate Banking and Urban Affairs Committee reported S. 190 to the Senate on July 28, 2005. Another bill ( H.R. 5121 ) would have raised the FHA one-family mortgage limit, and allowed mortgage premiums based on the borrower's risk. In the area of affordable housing, the House Financial Services Committee considered and passed a number of housing bills, including H.R. 5443 to reform the Section 8 voucher program and H.R. 5347 , a bill to reauthorize the HOPE VI program. Legislation was also introduced in the first session that would have increased Low-Income Housing Tax Credits available to develop affordable housing ( H.R. 2681 , H.R. 659 , and H.R. 3159 ).

Legislation was also introduced on behalf of the Administration to replace the Section 8 voucher program with a new block grant and to make major changes to the public housing program.", "In the area of the budget generally, as of the date of this report, Congress had not yet enacted an FY2007 spending bill for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The President submitted his budget request on February 6, 2006. It included reductions for several programs, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, and increases for other programs, such as the Section 8 voucher program. The Appropriations Committees in both houses held hearings on the budget in which Members from both parties expressed concern about several proposed funding reductions. The House of Representatives passed its version of the funding bill ( H.R. 5576 ) on June 14, 2006, and the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version to the full Senate on July 26, 2006. Both versions of H.R. 5576 restored some of the proposed reductions in the President's budget, including funds for the CDBG program, the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program, and the Section 811 Housing for the Disabled program. At the time of this update, Congress has enacted three continuing resolutions that provide funding for HUD; the third of these expires on February 15, 2007.", "After Hurricane Katrina, Congress enacted two FY2006 funding bills that provided funds to HUD for hurricane recovery and reconstruction ( P.L. 109-148 and P.L. 109-234 ).

The President has outlined a two-pronged approach for reducing the federal budget deficit: (1) increase revenues to the Treasury without raising taxes and (2) cut spending. In both FY2006 and FY2007, the President sought to keep discretionary spending growth below the rate of inflation. Although as of the date of this report, Congress had not passed an FY2007 spending bill, in FY2006 Congress kept growth below the rate of inflation.", "The majority of HUD's budget is discretionary funding, and many of its programs were targeted for funding reductions in the 109 th Congress. In his FY2006 budget, the President asked Congress to cut funding for several programs, including Housing for the Elderly and Disabled, and to eliminate funding for several others, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, HOPE VI, and Brownfields redevelopment. Congress did not enact most of the requested cuts in FY2006. In FY2007, the President again requested large cuts for several HUD programs, including Housing for the Elderly and Disabled, and CDBG. The Administration criticized all of the programs slated for reduction for being ineffective or inefficient.", "Efforts to contain discretionary spending have also increased internal pressures in the HUD budget. The cost of the Section 8 voucher program is partially pegged to housing costs, which have risen faster than inflation. As a result, the voucher program requires increased funding to serve the same number of people. Since HUD's overall budget has been constrained, any increases in funding for the voucher program have come at the expense of other programs. Another internal HUD budget pressure involves the contribution of the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) insurance program. FHA collects fees from participants, and excess fees are used by Congress to offset the cost of the HUD budget. FHA's market share has been dropping in recent years, and as a result, the amount of excess fees has been declining. With fewer fees to offset the cost of the HUD budget, the President and Congress have had to find additional dollars to keep the overall budget at the same level.", "In this budget environment, Congress faced pressure to reduce funding for HUD's programs in the FY2006 and FY2007 appropriations processes.

At the same time, problems remain. The bipartisan, congressionally mandated Millennial Housing Commission's 2002 final report identified \"affordability\" as \"the single greatest housing challenge facing the nation.\" The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies found that between 2001 and 2004, the number of households paying more than 30% of their income toward housing increased from 31.3 million to 35 million.

Home equity stood at $11.2 trillion in 2005, up from $10 trillion in 2004, and it is estimated that the wealth effect from rising housing prices generated one-third of the growth in consumer spending that year, helping to buoy the economy. Homeownership rates slipped just slightly from their previous high in 2004, from 69% to 68.9% in 2005. And minorities, who have consistently lagged behind whites in homeownership rates, have made some gains. Between 1995 and 2005, the percentage of minority homeowners increased from 43.7% to 53.1%; during the same period, the percentage of white homeowners increased from 70.9% to 75.8%. Despite this positive news, fears about the health of the housing market and the sustainability of recent homeownership gains are growing.", "Speculation about a housing \"bubble\" has permeated local and national real estate news. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on June 9, 2005, noted that, while he did not believe that the U.S. was experiencing a national housing bubble, home prices in some markets seemed to have risen to unsustainable levels. The pace of future interest rate increases, the health of the economy, and the rate of job growth will all play an important role in determining the pace of future housing price appreciation. More serious market corrections could occur if speculators begin to fear the end of the boom has arrived.", "Soaring home prices have also resulted in a proliferation of exotic and potentially risky mortgage products that make the entry into homeownership in these hot markets more affordable. Loans for more than the value of the home, interest-only loans, and various forms of adjustable rate mortgages have all become options for households buying high-priced homes they could not otherwise afford. At the lower end of the market, relaxed credit standards and the proliferation of subprime loans have expanded the pool of first-time homebuyers to include families with little or no cash and with limited or blemished credit histories. While all of these practices have helped to increase the national homeownership rate, they come with repayment risks. If interest rates soar, buyers with adjustable rate loans and interest-only loans will be in for payment shocks, and some might find themselves at risk of default. If the economy falters and there are job losses, some low- and moderate-income families could be at risk of default if they become unemployed. A small but growing number of low- and moderate-income homeowners are already considered severely \"cost-burdened,\" meaning that they are spending half or more of their incomes on housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rent Burdens", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, 8.4 million renter households were severely cost-burdened (paying more than 50% of their income toward housing), an increase of more than 1 million from 2001. While moderate-income renters are not immune from severe rent burdens, low-income renters face the greatest burdens; more than 86% of severely cost-burdened renters were in the bottom quintile of the income distribution. When low-income families pay such a large portion of their incomes for housing, they have little left to meet their other needs, let alone establish savings or build assets. The problem of severe rent burdens appears to be growing as the supply of low-cost rental units continues to dwindle. Harvard University's 2006 Joint Center for Housing Studies report attributes the growing affordability problem to two factors: land use regulations that drive up the price of housing and the growth of low-wage jobs. The report notes that solving the problem will be difficult, and will require the cooperation of government, business, and nonprofit organizations. However, the federal government's role in addressing what HUD has termed \"worst-case housing needs\" is increasingly in question, as deficits grow and pressure to restrain domestic spending mounts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Rebuilding after the 2005 Hurricanes", "paragraphs": ["After the initial need to evacuate and relocate families after the 2005 hurricanes, the focus primarily shifted to recovery and rebuilding of flood-damaged areas. The storms caused unprecedented damage to the Gulf Coast housing stock. Studies estimated that the hurricanes and their related flooding damaged 1.2 million housing units. Of those, over 305,000 were seriously damaged. Most of the seriously damaged units were owner occupied\u00e2\u0080\u0094about 63% or 193,000 homes. More than half of them lacked flood insurance (55%) and about a quarter of them lacked any insurance (23%).

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released flood maps for New Orleans on April 12, 2006. The levees have been mostly rebuilt. As of August 2006, one year after Hurricane Katrina, the Army Corps of Engineers had demolished 185 housing units in Orleans Parish, and just under 38,600 building permits had been issued. In part, the pace of rebuilding has been slowed by uncertainty at the local, state, and federal levels about what the new New Orleans should be and how it should look.", "The appropriate balance of public sector and private sector effort in rebuilding the damaged housing stock is also still under debate. Private insurance will cover some of the cost, and new investment may come to the area, but given the enormity of the damage, the local, state, and federal governments have been heavily involved. Thus far, Congress has approved more than $16 billion in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds and increased tax credit allocations to affected states to aid in their rebuilding. The plans developed by local communities for spending the CDBG funds were approved in the late spring and early summer, so the money is beginning to flow to local communities. Other proposals were offered to expand the government's role, including one to create an entity to buy out owners of damaged properties in at-risk areas, although none was enacted before the close of the second session of the 109 th Congress.

Using data from these agencies, HUD calculated for each of the five states, the extent of each state's unmet housing needs and areas of concentrated distress. HUD defined unmet housing needs as homeowners and low-income renters whose homes had major or severe damage, while concentrated distress was defined as the total number of housing units with major or severe housing damage in counties where 50% or more of the units had major or severe damage.

In FY2006, Congress funded the program at $15.8 billion, a 7% increase over FY2005, and it accounted for more than 46% of the total HUD budget (in part because of reductions to other programs). The program has also been criticized for not promoting self-sufficiency among its participants and for its administrative complexity, which results in high rates of error in calculating subsidies.", "In response to these critiques, two major initiatives have emerged over the past several years. The first involves changes to the way the program is funded. Beginning with the FY2003 appropriations act and continued in the FY2004, FY2005, and FY2006 laws, Congress has converted the voucher program from a unit-based, actual cost program to a budget-based, fixed cost program. Prior to FY2003, PHAs had a number of vouchers that they were authorized to distribute, and HUD reimbursed them for the actual cost of those vouchers (statutorily set at roughly rent minus 30% of family income). In FY2005, PHAs were funded based on the number of vouchers they were using and the cost of those vouchers in a snapshot of time\u00e2\u0080\u0094May through July 2004\u00e2\u0080\u0094with an adjustment for inflation. This new \"budget-based\" environment left some PHAs with less funding than they required to continue serving the same number of families at the same level that they had in the past. Many PHAs made program adjustments to reduce costs, but they were constrained by federal laws and regulations governing the size of benefit they must provide and the income levels of the families they must serve. The FY2006 appropriations law continued the trend and allocated funds to agencies based on what they received in FY2005, plus inflation, pro-rated to fit within the amount appropriated. The President's budget requested that Congress use the same formula again for FY2007, but a final FY2007 funding formula was not adopted before the close of the 109 th Congress.

It would have replaced the Section 8 voucher program with the Flexible Voucher Program and would have expanded eligibility for the program to higher-income families. It would also have given PHAs the option to set time limits or increase tenant contributions toward rent. The bills included two additional titles, one that would have modified the eligibility and rent rules for public housing and another that would have extended and expanded the Moving to Work Demonstration program.

HUD then adds together all of the agencies' budgets and compares the total to the amount Congress appropriated for the operating fund that year. Typically, Congress appropriates less than the full amount that PHAs qualify for under the formula, so HUD applies an across-the-board cut to agencies' budgets, called a proration. The 2006 proration was 86%, so agencies' budgets were cut by 14%.", "The new funding formula for FY2007, established by HUD through regulation, adopts new allowable expense levels.
