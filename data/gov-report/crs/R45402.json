As a result, lame duck sessions are no longer an automatic feature of Congress. Today, lame duck sessions consist of any portion of a regular second session that falls after the November election in an even-numbered year and before the next Congress commences on January 3.

Typically, sessions have started around the third week of November. Between 1935 and 2016, the average session length was about one calendar month. Within that time frame, the House held an average of 15 daily sessions, and the Senate held an average of 18 daily sessions. ", "The shortest lame duck sessions featured a limited agenda. For instance, in 1998, the House spent three days considering the President Clinton impeachment proceedings. In 1948, the House and Senate met for one day, mainly to wrap up the 80 th Congress, and in 1994, the Members spent the two-day lame duck session considering a tariff and trade agreement.
