For the other 30% of beneficiaries, the hold-harmless provision would not apply. These individuals would shoulder the entire beneficiary share of the increase in Part B costs.", "The hold-harmless provision does not apply to four main groups of beneficiaries (there may be some overlap among groups):", "Low-income beneficiaries whose Part B premiums are paid by the Medicaid program (about 19% of beneficiaries); High-income beneficiaries who are subject to income-related Part B premiums (about 6% of beneficiaries); Those whose Medicare premiums are not deducted from Social Security benefits (about 3% of beneficiaries); and New enrollees in 2016 (about 5% of beneficiaries).", "Additionally, late-enrollment premium surcharges would be based on the premium amount of those not held harmless. Thus, those held harmless in 2016 who pay a late-enrollment penalty may still see reduced Social Security benefits as a result of the increased surcharges.", "The substantial majority of those not held harmless are low-income beneficiaries whose Part B premiums are paid by the federal-state Medicaid program. As a result, most of the cost of the increase in Part B premiums in 2016 would be paid by Medicaid.", "The statutory formula for determining the general revenue portion of Part B funding is based on aggregate beneficiary premiums.

For example, the 2014 tax return (with 2013 income) was used to determine who would pay the 2015 high-income premiums. The income definition on which these premiums are based is modified adjusted gross income (MAGI).

Unexpected expenditures in 2015 are expected to draw down on this reserve. By the end of the year, reserves are projected to represent about 12% of expected 2016 costs.

The standard monthly premiums paid by those not held harmless were $110.50 in 2010 and $115.40 in 2011. In 2011, of the 27% who were not eligible to be held harmless, about 3% were new enrollees, about 5% were high-income beneficiaries, about 17% had their premiums paid for by Medicaid, and the remaining 2% did not have their premiums withheld from Social Security benefit payments. Premiums paid by enrollees in each of these years are shown in Table 3 .", "In calculating the actuarial rates in 2010 and 2011, the amount of the lost premium income due to the application of the hold-harmless provision was included in the determination of the monthly actuarial rate for the aged (the rate used to determine both premiums and general revenue matching). Specifically, the percentage of expected per capita expenditures for those years was calculated first. Then, a higher contingency margin than normal was added to this amount to offset the lost premium income from those held harmless. (See \" Calculation of the 2015 Premium \" for a description of contingency margins.) In 2010 and 2011, the contingency margins were $34.32 and $41.22, respectively, which were included in the actuarial rates of the aged\u2014$221.00 in 2010 and $230.70 in 2011. Standard premiums were then calculated by determining one-half of the actuarial rate for the aged, which was $110.50 in 2010 and $115.40 in 2011. By comparison, the contingency margin in 2012, when the hold-harmless provision was no longer in effect, was $9.64, the actuarial rate was $199.80, and the standard monthly premium was $99.90. If the actuarial rates had not been increased in 2010 and 2011 to account for the lost premium incomes, funding from premiums and general revenues would have been insufficient to cover expenditures in those years.", "In 2012 and 2013, Social Security beneficiaries received a 3.6% and a 1.7% COLA, respectively, which more than covered the Part B premium increase in those years; therefore, the hold-harmless provision was not applicable for most beneficiaries. Similarly, in 2014 and 2015, with a Social Security COLA increase of 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively, and no increase in Part B premiums, the hold-harmless provision has not been applicable.

Because most beneficiaries would be held harmless in this situation and their premiums would remain at the 2015 amount ($104.90 per month), the premiums of the 30% of beneficiaries not held harmless would need to cover all of the expected increased costs so that 25% of Part B costs would still be covered by beneficiary premiums. In other words, if the hold-harmless provision were not in effect in 2016, everyone who pays the standard premium would pay about $120.70 per month; however, if it goes into effect, those not held harmless are expected to pay standard premiums of close to $160 per month ($159.30), while those who are held harmless would continue to pay $104.90 per month.

Therefore, even if protected by the hold-harmless provision in regard to their standard premiums, those who pay the late-enrollment penalty could see a large increase in their penalty payments in 2016. For example, an individual with a 30% penalty currently pays an additional $31.50 per month on top of the standard premium of $104.90. In 2016, a 30% penalty could increase to close to $47.80.

However, given that the SSA also requires that income from beneficiary premiums be set at 25% of expected per capita costs and that income to the SMI Trust Fund from general revenues be based on the aggregate dollar amount of beneficiary premiums, CMS has determined that substantially increasing the premiums on those not held harmless is the only way to make up for the revenue shortfalls caused by the hold-harmless provision.

A positive COLA increase would have resulted in fewer beneficiaries being held harmless from Medicare Part B premium increases in those years. Several other bills would have provided one-time additional Social Security payments. Most of those bills did not directly address the issue of Part B premiums but rather focused on payments to Social Security beneficiaries, veterans, and retired railroad workers.

For example, H.R. 3631 , the Medicare Premium Fairness Act, would have frozen the 2010 monthly Medicare Part B premium at the 2009 level for all Part B enrollees. Another bill, H.R. 1832 , the Medicare Prescription Drug Affordability Act of 2009, would have, among other things, expanded the hold-harmless provision to premiums paid for Medicare Part D.

For example, S. 2148 , the Protecting Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 2015, and H.R. 3696 , the Medicare Premium Fairness Act, both introduced on October 7, 2015, would keep the 2016 Part B premiums at the 2015 level for all beneficiaries, including those with high incomes. Late-enrollment surcharges would also be based on the 2015 standard premium, and the deductible would remain at the 2015 rate.
