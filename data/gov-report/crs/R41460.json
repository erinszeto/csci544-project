In particular, the share of cellulosic biofuels is mandated to grow to 16 billion gallons by 2022\u2014a daunting challenge considering that no commercial production existed as of mid-2010. Cellulosic biofuels can be produced from almost any sort of biomass. As a result, a variety of biomass types that can be produced or collected under a range of geographic settings are potential feedstock sources. However, part of the mandate's challenge will be encouraging farmers to produce or collect non-traditional biomass materials that require multiple growing seasons to become established, and for which markets currently do not exist. Participation represents a substantial risk for producers, and even under the most optimistic conditions, U.S. agriculture will be challenged to produce the enormous volume of biomass needed to meet the biofuels mandate.", "Potential biomass feedstocks are numerous and widespread throughout the United States, and include woody biomass, perennial grasses, and agricultural and forest residues. Each type of biomass faces tradeoffs in terms of production, storage, and transportation. Dedicated energy and tree crops have large up-front establishment costs and will likely take several years to produce a commercial harvest, but can produce high yields with relatively low maintenance costs thereafter. Residues are nearly costless to produce, but confront difficult collection strategies and do not always produce uniform biomass for processing. Agricultural residues face complicated trade-offs between soil nutrient loss and biomass yield, as well as questions about the optimal timing strategy for harvesting the main crop and residue (either jointly or separately). Logging residues confront a tradeoff with energy production at the plant (via burning).", "None of the potential feedstocks (other than starch from corn) are economical to convert into biofuels under current commercial technology without substantial federal policy intervention. In addition to federal policy and the choice of feedstock, the processing technology used, the distribution infrastructure, and blending rates are expected to play major roles in the economic viability of cellulosic biofuels. Different processing technologies yield different biofuels in terms of energy content and usability, while also strongly influencing the economic viability of biofuels production. Ethanol produced under current biochemical processes yields only 67% of the energy of an equivalent volume of gasoline, and (due to its chemical properties) cannot use the same storage tanks, pipelines, and retail pumps as gasoline. In contrast, synthetic petroleum products (i.e., green hydrocarbons) obtained from biomass processed using more costly thermochemical technology yield an energy content nearly equal to petroleum fuels and can be used in existing fuel infrastructure. Currently ethanol is blended in most gasoline at about a 10% rate. If the rising usage mandate is to be met, the biofuels blending rate will necessarily have to increase, at which point the energy equivalence of a biofuel will likely influence the choice of processing technology, distribution infrastructure, and federal policy incentives.", "Many uncertainties remain concerning biomass producer participation rates, the choice of biomass, and associated yields and costs of production, harvest, storage, and transportation, as well as contractual marketing arrangements, plant location, and conversion technology, among other issues.

", "Feedstock characteristics . The preferred biomass feedstocks, known as lignocellulosic feedstocks, are composed of three main parts: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The different concentrations of these components in particular feedstocks will affect the efficacy of the conversion technology. Feedstocks with larger quantities of cellulose and hemicellulose are favored in biochemical conversion processes as the conversion technology stands presently, but research is being conducted to incorporate lignin into conversion or modify some of its properties through hybrid feedstocks. As a result, research offers the potential to alter the viability and preference of various feedstocks. ", "Feedstock sources . Potential biomass feedstocks are numerous and widespread throughout the United States, and include agricultural residues from such crops as corn, wheat, rice, and sugarcane, perennial grasses such as switchgrass and Miscanthus , short-rotation woody crops such as poplar and willow, and forest residues removed directly from the forest or taken from mills after processing. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the 16 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuels mandated by the RFS for 2022 will be derived from dedicated energy crops (49.4%), agricultural residues (35.6%), urban waste (14.4%), and forest residue (0.6%). Several studies based on agronomically viable U.S. biomass production suggest that the biofuels potential is significantly larger than 16 billion gallons. ", "Feedstock production and harvest costs . Each type of biomass faces tradeoffs in terms of production, storage, and transportation. Dedicated energy and tree crops have large up-front establishment costs and may take several years to produce a commercial harvest, but can produce high yields with relatively low maintenance costs thereafter. Residues are nearly costless to produce, but confront difficult collection strategies and do not always produce uniform biomass for processing. Agricultural residues also face complicated trade-offs between soil nutrient loss and biomass yield, as well as questions about the optimal timing strategy for harvesting the main crop and the residue (either jointly or separately). Logging residues confront both a tradeoff with energy production at the plant (via burning) and a uniformity of quality issue for processing. ", "Producer participation . A key aspect of biomass production will be understanding what economic incentives will encourage producer participation in growing and/or collecting biomass feedstocks. Whether the feedstock is a residue or dedicated crop, there is not much experience among producers, markets do not presently exist for most potential biomass crops, and few risk management tools (e.g., crop insurance) are available to producers. Studies presently use a wide range of estimated participation\u201430% to 80%\u2014depending on the size and location of the processing plant, the price being paid for biomass by the plant, the cost of producing, harvesting, and collecting biomass for a producer of a given size, and the terms of producer contracts. ", "Feedstock transportation . From the perspective of the biofuels processing plant, the choice of which feedstock to use will depend on the location of the plant and the local feedstock supply availability. Agricultural residues and perennial grass feedstocks have relatively low energy density, which means a large volume would be needed by a plant to meet demand. As a result, transportation costs may be crucial in the biomass choice. For example, a 50-million-gallon-per-year cellulosic ethanol plant (that converts a ton of corn stover\u2014which includes the stalks, leaves, and cobs of the corn plant\u2014into 90 gallons of biofuel) would need over 550,000 tons of corn stover harvested from roughly 280,000 acres of land (assuming 2 tons per acre of removable corn stover) in order to stay operational for a year. Because trucks become physically full when hauling biomass before reaching their weight limits, more truckloads would be required for cellulosic biofuel production relative to corn-based ethanol, thus making the per-unit transport cost much higher for cellulosic feedstocks than for corn. The greater number of trucks required to transport cellulosic feedstocks might also impose a heavy burden on rural transportation infrastructure. Compacting the biomass prior to transport may result in net savings if transport cost savings offset densification costs.", "Feedstock storage . Because the harvest of dedicated energy crops and agricultural residue is concentrated during one part of the year, long-term storage will be needed to hold the biomass until the plant is ready to use it (keeping in mind that biofuels plants are designed to run year-round). For plants that can eventually use multiple feedstocks, they will be able to use fall-harvested biomass around the time it is harvested, followed by perennial grasses with their wider harvest period, or woody biomass or urban waste that can become available throughout the year. Storage costs, inclusive of biomass dry-matter loss due to weathering and exposure, could be crucial in determining optimal feedstock sources in certain agro-climatic zones.", "Uniformity of feedstoc k. Biomass can have highly inconsistent quality and characteristics, not only among feedstocks but within a feedstock type. Delivering a uniform feedstock to the plant will decrease processing and pretreatment costs. Plants receiving biomass that has been harvested differently and stored under a variety of conditions will incur additional costs to arrive at a uniform feedstock product. With more experience and the development of the appropriate harvesting, collecting, and storage technologies, both standardization and densification of biomass could take place before the biomass even arrives at the plant, which would lower per-unit transportation costs and allow the plant to start with a uniform and consistent product, regardless of its source.

Energy yields and production costs for each process may vary substantially based on the specific implementation design and feedstock. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Biochemical Conversion", "paragraphs": ["Process . The biochemical conversion process is similar to the process currently used to produce ethanol from corn starch. Enzymes or acids are used to break down a plant's cellulose into sugars, which are then fermented into liquid fuel. Four key steps are involved. First, feedstock is pretreated by changing its chemical makeup to separate the cellulose and hemicellulose from the lignin in order to maximize the amount of available sugar. Second, hydrolysis uses enzymes or acids to break down the complex chains of sugar molecules into simple sugars for fermentation. Third, fermentation is used to convert the sugar into liquid fuel. Fourth, the liquid fuel is distilled to achieve a 95% pure form.", "Production costs . Each step of the conversion process incurs costs. A key cost of pretreatment is the time incurred. Biological pretreatment, using fungi, for example, can take 10 to 14 days. Chemical pretreatment may be faster but with higher costs for chemicals. Hydrolysis cost depends largely on the cost of enzymes, which has been estimated at $0.50 per gallon. However, hydrolysis may require different enzymes for different parts of the plant, thus incurring varying enzyme costs for different feedstocks. The effectiveness of hydrolysis is highly dependent on the effectiveness of pretreatment\u2014too much lignin remaining after pretreatment will impede enzyme efficiency. More accessible sugar (following efficient pretreatment) may improve enzyme function at lower costs. Regarding fermentation , different sugar types, for example, hexoses (six-carbon sugars) or pentoses (five-carbon sugars), may require different yeast strains for fermentation. Improved yeast strains that ferment various sugars could lower production costs. Some cost savings may be available through management of r ecovered lignin , which can be burned to generate electricity and steam to power the bio-refinery or for other outside uses. Primary research areas for potential improvement in energy yield and cost reduction are in pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation. Distillation is already a well-established technology. Successful improvements should make the process adaptable to multiple feedstocks. ", "Energy e quivalency . The biochemical conversion of biomass into alcohol produces a liquid fuel (i.e., ethanol) that contains only about 67% of the energy content of gasoline. When ethanol is blended with gasoline at low rates (e.g., 10% or less), the reduced gas mileage resulting from the blended fuel is sufficiently small that most consumers are likely to treat the blended fuel as equivalent volumetrically (i.e., gallon for gallon) with gasoline. However, at higher blend rates, especially at an 85%-ethanol blend rate (E85), the lower mileage is more noticeable and consumers may prefer energy-equivalent pricing, whereby the price for a gallon of E85 should be only 72% of the price of a gallon of gasoline.", "Petroleum infrastructure equivalency . Because of its physical properties, ethanol cannot be used in the same infrastructure (e.g., pipelines, storage tanks, service pumps) used to deliver retail gasoline. Nor can it be used directly by standard vehicle systems that have not been adjusted for ethanol blends greater than 10% (or 15% for model year 2007 or newer light-duty vehicles). This both limits ethanol retail delivery opportunities and raises the cost of delivery. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Thermochemical Conversion", "paragraphs": ["Process . Thermochemical conversion processes, which use heat to decompose the feedstock, are well established and developed. Unlike biochemical conversion, thermochemical conversion uses the entire biomass, including the lignin portion. There are two main types of thermochemical conversion processes\u2014gasification and pyrolysis. ", "Gasification is an anaerobic process where the partial combustion of biomass feedstock at over 700\u00b0C generates synthesis gas, or syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The syngas must be cleaned of tar, ash, and other impurities prior to the next processing step. The Fischer-Tropsch process is then used to convert the \"cleaned\" syngas into a variety of liquid fuels. The presence of impurities in syngas might disrupt the Fischer-Tropsch process by inactivating the catalyst. Also, prior to gasification, the biomass must have 20% or less moisture. For practically any type of biomass, drying will be required. Established drying technologies usually take place at high temperatures, which creates an opportunity for improvement. Gasification is prohibitively expensive and would only be used commercially at extremely high gasoline prices. ", "Pyrolysis is the partial combustion of biomass feedstock at 450\u00b0C to 600\u00b0C in the presence of no oxygen, which produces bio-oil. Bio-oil, which is rich in carbon, is similar to crude oil and must be refined into biofuels. Fast pyrolysis requires higher temperatures than slow pyrolysis but occurs in about two seconds. Currently, fast pyrolysis is receiving the most attention as a viable conversion process. Keeping the pyrolysis oil stable long enough to transform the bio-oil into hydrocarbons is one of the major barriers in the pyrolysis pathway. Because pyrolysis converts the biomass into a liquid form, it is easier to store and transport. ", "Energy and infrastructure e quivalency . The thermochemical conversion of biomass into synthetic fuels (or green hydrocarbons) produces liquid fuels that are essentially energy-equivalent to their petroleum counterparts, and fully adaptable for use in existing petroleum fuel infrastructure. As a result, energy-equivalent pricing favors thermochemically processed biofuels over biochemically processed biofuels.", "Research keys .

Presently, most cellulosic biofuels production is taking place in laboratories and small-scale demonstration and pilot plants.

Substantial cost reductions will be necessary for successful commercial development. Several processes are currently being researched and developed in laboratories, but it is difficult to know with any certainty whether those that appear successful in trials will also be successful on a commercial scale. Given the lack of commercial production to date, per-gallon cost estimates for cellulosic biofuels are highly uncertain, but estimates based on laboratory and pilot plant results range from $2.50 per gallon to slightly over $3.00 per gallon.

In other words, the tax credit allows ethanol plants to operate profitably whenever oil prices are $56.33 per barrel or higher. Without the ethanol tax credit, the breakeven price of oil rises to $71.45 per barrel (still below recent market prices). Higher oil prices are needed to offset higher corn prices. The breakeven oil price scenarios are substantially higher for cellulosic biofuels\u2014even with a much higher tax credit of $1.01 per gallon, whether produced from biochemical or thermochemical processes ($92.74 and $113.77, respectively, with tax credit).

Biomass-based cellulosic biofuels are not yet profitable under either pricing approach (volumetric or energy-equivalent), even with a much higher tax credit of $1.01 per gallon. Currently, the fixed tax credit ($0.45 per gallon) incentivizes biofuels production during periods of low petroleum fuel prices; however, during periods of high oil prices (when biofuels are inherently more competitive with fossil fuels), the fixed subsidy adds to plant profitability at taxpayers' expense while encouraging greater biofuels production than is sought by the marketplace. A variable subsidy that declines with higher oil prices has been proposed as a policy tool to maintain biofuels incentives while limiting taxpayer exposure. This report includes a comparative analysis of a fixed versus variable tax credit, not as a policy recommendation, but strictly as a comparative analysis to aid Congress's understanding of the differences between the two policy options.

Crop insurance programs for perennial grasses will only be developed once a base of acreage is planted, but many producers may be reluctant to plant perennial grasses in the absence of crop insurance. Switchgrass is currently being grown by the University of Tennessee Biofuels Initiative and by the Oklahoma Bioenergy Center. In Tennessee, 725 acres of switchgrass were planted during spring 2008 and an additional 1,900 acres were planted during spring 2009. Producers accepted into the program are paid at a rate of $450 per acre of switchgrass per year for a three-year contract. An additional 3,000 acres were expected to be planted in 2010. In Oklahoma, 1,100 acres of switchgrass were planted in spring 2008, with 1,000 acres in a single tract of land, which is the largest area of switchgrass planting in the world. ", "A stand of switchgrass will grow annually for 10 years, while a stand of Miscanthus may grow annually for 15 to 20 years. Perennial grasses must first be established and may not be harvested during the first year. It may also take a few harvests before the grasses reach their peak yields. Deep roots help the plant store resources from year to year, which reduce necessary fertilizer inputs. Perennial grasses are also able to take advantage of long growing seasons. This is because planting and germination do not take place annually and the plants are above the ground and taking in sun for more days starting in the spring and going until early fall. ", "Due to their nutrient storage ability, these grasses can be grown on marginal cropland that is often considered unfit for growing corn or soybeans. However, simply because these grasses will grow on marginal land does not mean that they will yield well, and lower yields will ultimately increase the production cost per ton. Recent studies from the University of Tennessee arrived at contrary conclusions on this matter, with one finding that a biofuels processing plant would look for switchgrass from more productive soil types in order to minimize delivered costs, while the other found that producers would choose to plant switchgrass on less productive soils, since more productive soils are reserved for corn production. This contrast reflects the differences in objectives from the perspectives of producers and biofuels processing plants.", "Most early Miscanthus research has taken place in Europe, but some research plots are now being grown in the United States. Miscanthus is expected to yield well in the same locations where switchgrass yields well. However, field experiments in Illinois and Iowa conducted thus far indicate that switchgrass yields can be as little as one-fourth of Miscanthus yields. Miscanthus yields are higher than switchgrass yields due to their larger mass, taller height, and longer growing season. Yields for both switchgrass and Miscanthus are high relative to agricultural residues. This higher yield serves to decrease the production cost per ton, but perennial grasses are still more costly to produce than residues, because they are dedicated crops that must be established and maintained. Current estimates for yields tend to be reported from small-scale research trials, where establishment may be more likely to succeed within the first year and allow for a first-year cutting. It is uncertain whether perennial grass yields will be as high once it is grown commercially by producers with limited switchgrass production experience. Switchgrass is planted as a seed, while the most productive variety of Miscanthus does not produce seeds and must be planted as rhizomes, which makes establishment costs much higher. Miscanthus will also require more machine power to harvest because the quantity of biomass per acre is so much larger than with switchgrass. Despite establishment and harvesting costs being higher for Miscanthus , high yields allow those costs to be spread out over more tons of biomass per acre than switchgrass, which serves to lower the production cost per ton of Miscanthus . Further discussion of yields and production costs are in the sections that follow.", "In the United States, perennial grasses could likely be grown on land that is currently not in use or is part of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which protects land from erosion and environmental damage by maintaining vegetative cover such as native grasses. For grasses, in particular, to be a viable feedstock for cellulosic biofuels, producers of these fairly uncommon crops will need to assume the risk of growing a long-run crop with high upfront establishment costs and possibly having to replant. Studies have found that switchgrass must be replanted 23% to 25% of the time due to seed dormancy and mistakes with establishment, in which case establishment costs would increase substantially and overall per ton production costs would increase. Risk associated with high upfront establishment costs may be addressed through government grants to help with establishment costs, university planting programs that provide funding and expertise regarding planting and maintenance, or contracts with area cellulosic biofuels plants to supply biomass. The profitability of these relatively unknown crops in large-scale production, the profitability of other crops that could be grown in place of perennial grasses, and the proximity of production facilities will be important in determining the extent to which they are planted. Many producers who will enter into contracts with plants may be small and/or part-time operators who may lack the education, expertise, and equipment necessary to establish and maintain a perennial grass stand in a cost-effective manner. These producers may also be growing the grasses on small and dispersed fields, which will make management more expensive and less efficient. It is expected that land grant university extension programs will play a role in helping producers streamline and perfect the growing process once commercial production becomes more common."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agricultural Residues", "paragraphs": ["Agricultural residues, such as corn stover, which includes the stalks, leaves, and cobs, are the by-products left after harvest of crops already being planted. Residues are more readily available than perennial grasses, which need to be established, and are typically put forth as a less expensive feedstock option, because their establishment cost is attributed to the initial crop. Instead, the primary costs associated with residues are nutrient replacement, harvesting, storage, and transportation. For the purposes of this discussion, corn stover will be used as the primary residue.", "Crop residues serve to prevent erosion and nutrient loss while a field is fallow, and excess removal of residue can compromise that protection and reduce soil organic matter. The appropriate amount to remove will depend on tillage practices, crop rotation, soil type, and topography. Extensive literature exists regarding the effect of residue removal on the health of the soil. Generally, more residue removal is thought to reduce organic matter and leave the soil susceptible to erosion. However, no one conclusion has been reached on the maximum amount that can safely be removed. In fact, with increasing corn yields and residues roughly equal in weight to corn, some have argued that residue removal may be necessary as residue amounts increase. The amount of residue removed will depend, in large part, on the equipment used to remove it. For example, if conventional hay equipment is used, the amount of residue removed can vary depending on the number of passes. Baling alone will collect about 38% of residue, raking and baling will collect about 52.5% of residue, and shredding, raking, and baling could collect 70% of residue. ", "Work remains to find the most efficient residue collection technique. For example, making multiple passes through the field\u2014first to harvest the main crop, then to shred, rake, bale, and collect the residue\u2014will increase the cost of collecting the residue and increase soil compaction in the field. In contrast, a single-pass system that performs several functions simultaneously may be overly slow to collect the principal crop and may run the risk of unanticipated inclement harvest-time weather. More efficient collection technologies will be capital-intensive and will likely be adopted by larger producers, which will leave smaller producers to use existing hay equipment or hire a custom operator to harvest residues. ", "Time is a critical factor for farmers in the fall harvest period. Harvest of residues must take place within a fairly small window after corn has been harvested and will be highly dependent on weather conditions. The top priority of producers will certainly be the corn crop, and if removing residue puts their corn yield at risk, producers may be reluctant to agree to remove it. ", "A one-pass harvest system that attaches to the combine appears to be the next step in equipment development for residue harvest if it can be done without slowing down the harvest. Hay equipment is available but is less efficient, and equipment that will only collect residues may not appear for another 15 to 20 years. Current research at Iowa State University is developing a one-pass harvesting system that attaches to a conventional combine as a modified header in the front and a chopper and blower in the back. This was preferred to a one-pass system that harvests the grain and the residue at the same time in a single stream, because additional equipment would be needed to separate the grain and the residue, and this mixture of crops may change a producer's eligibility for government programs and crop insurance. Stover is chopped into two-inch pieces and blown into a wagon running alongside the combine. Currently, this attachment system is estimated to cost between $35,000 and $50,000. The system is equipped with a switch to shut off the attachment and allow the residue to be left in a windrow behind the combine should residue harvest interfere with or slow grain harvest. Work continues to ensure that the use of this system does not slow down conventional grain harvest, regardless of the amount of residue the producer chooses to remove. ", "A one-pass harvesting system allows for residue to be harvested with the grain and keeps the residue from ever touching the ground, which may cause soil contamination and make conversion to liquid fuels less efficient. However, a current shortcoming of this method is that residue coming directly from the combine only has a density of about 3 to 4 pounds per cubic foot, while the density would need to be between 12 and 14 pounds per cubic foot to transport it efficiently and fill a truck to its allowed weight limit. ", "Research is also being conducted to determine at what height residue should be cut. Corn plants tend to have more moisture in the lower part of the plant, making this portion less efficient for conversion as moisture must be removed prior to conversion; this portion also is best left on the field to protect against soil erosion. The upper part and the cobs, however, have lower moisture contents and are most suitable for producing biofuels to make pretreatment and processing as efficient as possible. ", "While residues are convenient because they accompany the primary crop, there is no reason that they must be removed and no long-term commitment to do so unless the producer enters into a contract with the plant.

Short-rotation woody crops also provide environmental benefits such as low inputs, improved soil and water quality, reduced CO 2 emissions, and enhanced biodiversity. ", "To establish short-rotation woody crops, cuttings from year-old trees taken during the dormant season must be planted. In addition to high establishment costs (as with dedicated energy crops), it takes three to four years before the trees are ready to be harvested and begin yielding commercial returns. The life of the entire stand will be at least 20 years, and multiple (but not annual) harvests will take place. For example, seven to eight harvests (i.e., harvests every three to four years) may occur during the life of a willow tree crop. During the growing time, very little annual maintenance is needed. Cost reduction for tree crop production will likely come from increased yields and production efficiency, as well as a mechanism for valuing environmental benefits. Poplar and willow hybrids that will increase yield potential and reduce lignin content are currently being researched.

Using forest residues can mitigate greenhouse gases, improve the health of forests, and avoid catastrophic fires and diseases. Collecting residues from within a forest, however, can be difficult, because efficient equipment has not been developed and most commercial logging operations are not set up to handle residues. Currently, the more efficient harvesting options chosen by large-scale logging operations are methods that harvest round wood and biomass simultaneously. Similar to one-pass corn and corn stover harvesters, these systems do not require major changes to the current operation and do not add extra steps to the harvest process.

Residues coming directly from the mill are advantageous, because they have lower moisture content and are in a more consistent form.

Residues cannot be collected from federal lands, old-growth forests, or imperiled forests. It is uncertain whether the current limited definition would be a barrier to the production of cellulosic biofuels, as feedstocks vary in their distribution and ownership among regions.

However, H.R. 2454 , the American Clean Energy and Security Act passed by the House of Representatives on June 26, 2009, would broaden the definition of renewable biomass to its farm bill definition, which allows renewable biomass to include that which is removed from federal lands. The Senate has yet to consider the bill. ", "To deal with the bulky nature of forest biomass, it must be condensed by chipping, grinding, or bundling. Chipping is the most efficient and least expensive method, but the knife blades can be damaged by dirt and other foreign material, which sometimes results in a preference for the grinding method.

Yields will vary by geographic region, soil characteristics, and water availability. For corn stover, a distinction must be made between what is available and what is removable. Available stover will be a function of the corn yield, while removable stover will be a function of available stover and the percentage of stover deemed appropriate for removal. A one-to-one ratio between corn stover and grain is usually assumed, which means there will be approximately 56 pounds of corn stover for every bushel of corn. Based on the grain yield, the available corn stover yield can be calculated. For example, assuming corn stover moisture content of 15%, grain yields of 125, 150, and 175 bushels per acre will result in 2.9, 3.5, and 4.1 dry tons of corn stover available per acre, respectively. Corn stover moisture content can be estimated as a function of the grain moisture and the number of days after grain maturity. After initial maturity, grain moisture may be around 40% and stover moisture may be as high as 75%. However, 80 days after maturity is reached, grain moisture and stover moisture can both converge to around 10%. Once mature, the stover moisture will decline at a faster rate than the grain moisture. While the one-to-one stover to grain ratio is quite common, grain moisture above 18% may result in 0.8-to-one being a more realistic ratio for calculating the available corn stover yield. Regardless of the stover-to-grain ratio, available corn stover will be a function of corn yield, and removable corn stover will be a function of the removal rate. Both corn yield and the appropriate removal rate will vary from field to field, which makes predicting the removable corn stover yield difficult. Overall, areas where grain yields are high will also have high residue yields, but the amount that is ultimately removed and used will depend on the ability of the producer to harvest or collect residues and how much can be removed while still maintaining the integrity and quality of the soil.

There is also the chance that seeds may remain dormant and do not grow after planting. This will require the grasses to be planted again, which doubles the establishment costs and delays the first harvest and the eventual peak yield.

Depending on the amount of stover removed after harvest, additional nutrients will need to be added before planting the following year.

The Eidman and Petrolia studies do not include nitrogen costs in nutrient replacement, because they assume a corn-soybean rotation. The Brechbill and Tyner study assumes bales of stover will be stored along the edge of the field until needed by the plant, while the Eidman and Petrolia studies assume that bales are transported to a regional storage facility and sometimes even stored under roof. The additional transportation and the construction of a storage facility serve to increase per-ton costs. The Eidman and Petrolia studies also allow for the possibility of densification just before the stover is transported to the plant. This serves to increase the density of the stover and reduce transportation costs by allowing more to be loaded onto each truck. The Brechbill and Tyner study did not consider this and assumed that stover would be hauled to the plant in bale form. Finally, Brechbill and Tyner provide a payment to the producer that is 15% of the cost of production. In the case of corn stover, this is approximately $5 per dry ton.

Because trucks become physically full when hauling biomass before reaching their weight limits, more truckloads would be required for cellulosic biofuel production relative to corn-based ethanol, thus making the per-unit cost much higher for cellulosic feedstocks then for corn. In addition, the greater number of trucks required to transport cellulosic feedstocks might also impose a heavy burden on rural transportation infrastructure. Processing biomass before it goes to the plant will make it denser and less costly to transport by allowing more biomass per load (especially in the case of round bales), and it will be easier to handle once it arrives at the plant. However, densification costs have been estimated at about $23 per dry ton, which may outweigh any savings related to transportation, especially if densification cannot take place immediately after harvest. Densification at the storage facility would require the biomass to be transported as bales from the field and then stored until densification could take place. ", "Low energy density also means that a large volume of biomass would be needed by a plant to meet demand. For example, a 50 million gallon per year cellulosic ethanol plant would need a 90-feet-high pile of corn stover covering 100 acres of land in order to stay operational for a year.

However, the year-round harvest required to use the stump as storage may be difficult should weather or equipment failures delay any regularly scheduled harvests. In contrast, corn stover should be harvested within three weeks after corn is harvested and before any snow might cover the field, which gives it a harvest window of about five weeks to three months, depending on the location. This may require additional equipment and labor so as to not interfere with the corn harvest. Perennial grasses, on the other hand, can have harvest windows of up to 8 months depending on location. Miscanthus must be harvested after the first frost in order to take advantage of nitrogen retention through the root system.", "Because corn stover harvest is concentrated during one part of the year, long-term storage will be needed to hold the corn stover until the plant is ready to use it (keeping in mind that biofuels plants are designed to run year-round). For plants that can eventually use multiple feedstocks, they will be able to use corn stover around the time it is harvested, followed by feedstocks that become available at other times of the year.

However, with the harvest of agricultural residues and perennial grasses being somewhat dependent on timing in the season, harvest cannot coincide with demand for biomass, which will require transportation and delivery to be tailored to the needs of the plant. ", "Between harvest and delivery, on-site storage of the biomass will be necessary. Storage conditions will vary from producer to producer and from region to region depending on weather conditions. While being stored, especially in outdoor condition, biomass can lose dry matter. Avoiding dry matter loss while storing biomass outside will depend on humidity and precipitation levels. Individual producers will likely be expected to store their own biomass until the plant needs it, which could be several months after it is harvested. With no central storage facility and producers not likely to have storage specifically to keep the feedstock until the plant needs it, biomass may be stored outside on the ground. ", "For biomass that is baled, the packaging method, whether it is with twine, net wrap, or plastic wrap, can affect the amount of dry matter loss. Ideally, corn stover bales should at least be stored on a site with good drainage, a concrete or gravel surface, and under cover or inside if not wrapped with plastic. Depending on the conditions, and on assumptions regarding dry matter loss, where biomass is stored, and the form in which it is stored, storage costs will vary. A study focused on corn stover found that storage adds between $7 and $13 per dry ton. ", "For baled biomass, the choice between round bales and square bales depends on several conditions. One study found that round bales require less expensive equipment and a lower power tractor. They can be left in the field after harvest and brought to the storage facility later. Their round tops allow water to run off, which helps decrease dry matter loss. Round bales can be stored up to six months in satellite storage locations with less than 5% loss. Cost of storage is $2 per ton for round bales compared to $8 per ton for square bales. In contrast, another study found that using rectangular bales will reduce harvest and storage costs as the rectangular baler is able to bale more per hour that a round baler. However, rectangular bales have increased dry matter losses compared to round bales, so that the optimal solution may be a combination of different harvest and storage techniques. Table 14 shows estimated dry matter loss for switchgrass based on the type of bale, how it is covered, and the length of time it is stored. Each type of bale was stored on well-drained ground, gravel, and wooden pallets. Overall, it is suggested that for biomass processed immediately after harvest, rectangular bales should be used, while for biomass that must be stored for more than three months, round bales with tarps should be used.", "Research is being conducted to develop storage systems that keep the biomass wet while it is in storage. Biomass is mixed with additional water and made into large piles. Depending on the size of the pile, dry matter loss could be less than 5%. Advantages of a system like this include storing a given amount of biomass in a smaller area, softening biomass so as to weaken the lignin structure, and reduced risks of fire. It may also be more energy-efficient to add water than to remove it.

Currently, enzymatic hydrolysis may be the better economic choice for commercialization relative to acid hydrolysis. Compared to acid hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis is faster, more efficient, results in better yields, and uses less chemical input. Using enzymes in the hydrolysis of starch only requires one family of enzymes or cellulases. However, lignocellulosic biomass requires different cellulases to address the multiple parts of the plant.

From the beginning, ethanol blending has been subsidized in the form of a tax credit at a rate of between 40 and 60 cents per gallon. Other supportive policies have been added in recent years, but the blending tax credit has been paramount from the beginning. ", "Over the period 1983 to 2003, the price of oil averaged about $20 per barrel. When coupled with the blending tax credit and mandates for the use of oxygenates (including ethanol) in reformulated gasoline following the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, $20 oil was enough to promote slow, but steady growth of the U.S. corn ethanol industry. Over this period, the price of ethanol varied but generally was equal to the gasoline price plus the government subsidy ( Figure 11 ). That is, pricing was on a pure volumetric basis. Ethanol had value both as an oxygenate and for its higher octane level. Then in 2004 the price of oil began its move up, and the combination of a fixed subsidy keyed to $20 oil and much higher oil prices caused a boom in the corn ethanol industry. With high oil prices and substantial fixed subsidies, the ethanol industry enjoyed large profits and significant investment in new plants through 2007. The price relationship between ethanol and gasoline also became much more volatile as the quantity of ethanol on the market increased and other factors (such as the widespread phase out by May 2006 of MTBE, a major oxygenate competitor) came into play.

Corn is the single largest cost component in ethanol production accounting for nearly 66% of input costs. Over two billion gallons of production capacity was shut down. Then even after corn prices fell, capacity remained down because the industry had reached the effective blend wall by mid-2009. The blend wall refers to the maximum quantity that can be blended given the 10% blending rate (more on this topic below). With excess supply on the market, the price of ethanol was ultimately forced down to the break-even price with corn. Conditions improved in late 2009 and early 2010 as more ethanol could be blended in winter months. However, in the spring of 2010, the industry returned to effectively operating at the blend wall. So long as the blending wall remains binding, this situation will persist.", "The future of cellulosic biofuels and the potential to be profitable will depend a great deal on cost reductions in feedstock production and conversion technology, as discussed in the previous section.

DOE and EPA are conducting tests to see whether higher blends will be compatible with current vehicles that run on conventional gasoline. There is concern that newer vehicles with warranties may see those warranties voided if higher blends are used. In 2010, Underwriter's Laboratories (UL) certified that current gasoline dispensing equipment can handle blends containing up to 15% ethanol. However, UL also said that E15 would not be suitable because, if one assumes that E10 may have some 15% ethanol, then some E15 will almost certainly have higher than 15% ethanol which may prove harmful to existing distribution infrastructure.", "In March 2009, Growth Energy, representing ethanol producers, applied for a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency to increase the blending rate from 10% to 15%. On October\u00a013, 2010, EPA issued a partial waiver for gasoline that contains up to a 15% ethanol blend (E15) for use in model year 2007 or newer light-duty motor vehicles (i.e., passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and sport utility vehicles). A decision on the use of E15 in model year 2001 to 2006 vehicles will be made after EPA receives the results of additional DOE testing, possibly as early as November 2010. However, EPA also announced that no waiver would be granted for E15 use in model year 2001 and older light-duty motor vehicles, as well as in any motorcycles, heavy duty vehicles, or non-road engines. In addition to the EPA waiver announcement, numerous other changes have to occur before gas stations will begin selling E15 including many approvals by states and significant infrastructure changes (e.g., labeling of pumps, storage tanks, etc.). As a result, the vehicle limitation to newer models, coupled with infrastructure issues, are likely to limit rapid expansion of blending rates. ", "Discussions of the blend wall have applied largely to the already established corn ethanol industry. However, with the eventual onset of commercial cellulosic biofuel production and a Renewable Fuel Standard that will require biofuels made from feedstocks other than corn, the issue of the blend wall and the current 10% blending rate may serve to hinder or even stop the development of the cellulosic biofuels industry before it gets started. With mandated biofuels amounts higher than what can possibly be blended, the RFS may need to be capped and revised from its legislated levels. ", "In effect, the blend wall is a constraint on the amount of ethanol that can be absorbed by the market. The presence of the blend wall serves to make the demand curve vertical, such that the same quantity of ethanol is demanded regardless of the price, once the blend wall quantity is achieved. The blend wall limits demand of ethanol to an amount that is less than the equilibrium amount (where ethanol supply equals unconstrained ethanol demand). This creates a market with reduced ethanol demand, excess ethanol supply, and an artificially low ethanol price and explains why some of the U.S. corn-based ethanol capacity was shut down in 2008 and 2009, and even through 2010. ", " Figure 13 shows the effect on the ethanol market of a blend wall. The fixed subsidy is also shown through the shift to the right of the demand curve. With a subsidy, more ethanol will be demanded at any given price. In Figure 13 , the intersection between the supply curve and the demand curve with the subsidy indicates the quantity and price (P*) that would result without the blend wall. However, when the blend wall is in effect, the demand curve becomes vertical once that quantity (Q BW ) is reached. This demand curve with the blend wall is the bold line in Figure 13 . The outcome will then be the intersection between the supply curve and the demand curve with the blend wall. Relative to the case where the blend wall is not in effect, the amount of ethanol consumed will decrease to the blend wall (Q BW ) and the ethanol price (P BW ) will also decrease.", "If EPA determines to maintain the blend level at 10%, it will not be possible for cellulose ethanol to become established. Corn ethanol will be less expensive under most foreseeable conditions, so there would not be investment in cellulose ethanol even with the cellulose-based RFS. The perceived uncertainty would be too large to elicit industry investment. However, cellulosic-based biofuels produced via thermochemical conversion (e.g., bio-butanol) could be developed because they are not affected by the blend wall. These synthetic petroleum products can be used by existing petroleum-based distribution and storage infrastructure and the current fleet of U.S. vehicles. ", "However, even if the blending limit is increased to 15%, there still may not be room for much cellulose ethanol. From the description of the RFS below, one can see that in 2022 the corn (or conventional) component is 15 billion gallons, and the other \"advanced biofuels\" part is 4 billion. Sugarcane ethanol is included in the other advanced category. So corn plus sugarcane ethanol could sum to as much as 19 billion gallons. As noted above, 19 billion gallons is the effective blend wall at 15% blending. Since corn and sugarcane ethanol are likely to always be less expensive to produce than cellulosic ethanol, they could crowd out cellulosic ethanol even at the 15% blending level. Again, synthetic hydrocarbons produced via the thermochemical pathway would not be affected by the blend wall."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Renewable Fuel Standard", "paragraphs": ["The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was first introduced as a part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ). It required that 4 billion gallons of renewable fuels be used starting in 2006, increasing to a 7.5-billion-gallon requirement in 2012. The original RFS was never binding, meaning that the market always produced a quantity larger than the level of the mandate. The RFS was increased dramatically in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P.L. 110-140 ). In 2008, 9 billion gallons of renewable fuels were required, and this requirement increases to 36 billion in 2022. There are also requirements as to what fraction of the total mandate must come from various types of fuels. Figure 14 outlines the timing and break down of the requirements for the RFS. ", "The primary feature of the updated RFS is that it limits the amount of biofuels that can be produced from corn and still qualify under the RFS, and requires greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions relative to emissions from conventional gasoline for RFS-qualifying biofuels. From 2010 until 2015, the corn-based biofuels cap only increases slightly under the RFS, and eventually levels off in 2015 at 15 billion gallons. Any production of corn-based biofuels beyond this level will not count towards the mandate. For any corn-based ethanol from new refineries to count, it must reduce GHG emissions by 20% compared to conventional gasoline. However, all plants in production or under construction as of December 2007 are grandfathered\u2014and that is most, if not all, of the eventual 15-billion-gallons corn-starch RFS. ", "In its final RFS ruling in 2010, EPA determined that corn-based ethanol from new plants meets the 20% GHG reduction criterion. The remaining fuels to meet the mandate must come from advanced biofuels that may be from either cellulosic or non-cellulosic sources. Advanced biofuels must be produced from a feedstock other than corn and achieve a 50% reduction in GHG emissions compared to conventional gasoline. Cellulosic advanced biofuels must be produced from any cellulose, hemicelluloses, or lignin from biomass and achieve a 60% reduction in GHG emissions compared to conventional gasoline. The emission reduction requirements may be reduced by 10% by the U.S. EPA should the initial reduction requirement not be feasible. However, in its final 2010 ruling, EPA determined that all the biofuels it evaluated meet the GHG thresholds. Imported ethanol produced from sugarcane in Brazil, which is subject to approximately a $0.59 per gallon tariff (including a $0.54 most-favored nation duty and a 2.5% value-added tariff), may also be used for the other advanced biofuels category.", "The RFS can be either non-binding or binding relative to the amount of biofuel that the market would otherwise demand. However, the two possible RFS scenarios generate very different market effects. The presence of the RFS will cause some portion of the demand curve to become vertical (as shown by the bold line in the following figures), and the effect of the RFS on the quantity and price will depend on how the RFS quantity compares to the quantity that would otherwise be demanded by the market. A non-binding RFS ( Figure 15 ) will not affect the quantity or price, because the amount required by the RFS is below the market equilibrium. That is, the market is producing and consuming more ethanol than the RFS requires. However, a binding RFS ( Figure 16 ) will have an effect on the quantity and price. When the RFS is binding, the market equilibrium quantity will be less than the RFS requires. Therefore, the RFS will cause the quantity of ethanol consumed and the ethanol price to increase.", "The government mandate on the use of biofuels creates demand and is intended to encourage investment in improved technology and new plants. Supporters of the RFS contend that the policy helps to reduce investment risk by guaranteeing demand over the years that the RFS is in place, increases energy security, reduces dependence on imported oil, and offers environmental benefits by requiring the use of renewable resources for energy production. Critics of the RFS view the policy as potentially hindering the development of other alternative energy technologies since it strictly promotes renewable fuels, while a technology neutral policy such as a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax would promote the development of multiple renewable energy technologies.", "The RFS as it stands is based on renewable fuel use at specific levels rather than renewable fuel use as a share of overall fuel use. Therefore, improvements in fuel efficiency that have been mandated by the federal government may make meeting the RFS more of a challenge. With improved fuel efficiency, less fuel is necessary to travel a given distance. The Energy Information Administration forecasts U.S. motor gasoline consumption to fall from about 138 billion gallons in 2009 to 122 billion in 2022. Therefore the 36 billion gallon RFS will rise from a 26% share to a 30% share of gasoline consumption on a volumetric basis. ", "In its final RFS ruling in 2010, the EPA effectively converted the RFS from a volumetric basis to an energy basis. EPA interpreted the RFS as 36 billion gallons of ethanol equivalent by 2022. A gallon of bio-gasoline, with 50% more energy than ethanol counts as 1.5 gallons of ethanol equivalent. The EU 2020 target is energy equivalent as well. That is, 20% of the energy content of liquid fuels must be renewable.

The biofuels tax credits have been available even during periods of extreme profitability such as occurred during 2006 and 2007. The high federal costs associated with the tax credits, coupled with the outlook for rapid growth in the cost of the fixed subsidy, have generated some interest among economists and federal budget watchdogs in favor of substituting a variable subsidy in place of the fixed subsidy as a means of lowering government costs while maintaining support for the biofuels industry.", "Unlike a fixed subsidy which remains constant in spite of market conditions, a variable subsidy adjusts its value depending on the current price of a barrel of oil. At high oil prices, above a certain threshold level, no subsidy is available, but as oil prices fall to the threshold level and then below, the variable subsidy kicks in and increases in value. Therefore, the subsidy amount paid is not constant as it is with a fixed subsidy. ", "In other words, a variable subsidy is designed to take into consideration the linkage between the ethanol industry's profitability and petroleum prices. In the absence of a blend wall, profitability of biofuel production will depend largely on the price of gasoline (which is highly correlated with oil prices), the primary commodity with which biofuels will compete. When oil and gasoline prices are high, biofuels are able to compete and remain profitable, while low oil prices make it difficult for biofuels to compete. Fixed subsidies ignore these differences. Fixed subsidies simply add to a plant's profitability, regardless of whether or not the plant would be profitable without the subsidy. In contrast, variable subsidies change as oil prices change. A variable subsidy can reduce overall government costs since large subsidy amounts will not be paid all the time, but only when the oil price warrants in order for biofuels to be competitive. ", "Variable subsidies could be linked to either oil or gasoline prices, but it is expected that the difference between the two would be minimal considering the strong statistical relationship between oil and gasoline prices. In designing a variable subsidy, an oil price where subsidies start must be chosen. This is often referred to as a trigger price or a cut off price. The rate of change must also be determined, such that for every dollar that the oil price falls below the cut off oil price, the subsidy will increase by the rate of change. Variable subsidies can be calculated given the average oil price on a monthly or quarterly basis. Generally, the variable subsidy would provide a safety net for biofuels producers when oil prices are low and allows the market to drive biofuels production without government intervention when oil prices are high. A recent analysis of the variable subsidy with respect to corn-based ethanol production found that the variable subsidy provides a net present value (NPV) for the producer that is similar to that with the fixed subsidy, but that the variable subsidy could decrease risk and the probability of a loss on investment.

In the near term volumetric pricing might work for the low level blends such as E10 or E15.

Thus, if profits for the various processing technologies are negative under a fixed subsidy across several potential oil price forecasts, then it is likely that the technology will not be profitable with a variable subsidy either.
