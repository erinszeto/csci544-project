Title II contains appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Title III funds agencies in other departments, such as the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture and the Indian Health Service in the Department of Health and Human Services; arts and cultural agencies, such as the Smithsonian Institution; and various other entities.

It first compares FY2014 enacted appropriations with FY2013 enacted appropriations. It next compares the FY2014 enacted appropriations with those requested by the President; recommended by the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies; and proposed by the leaders of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. Finally, the report compares FY2014 appropriations with FY2012 appropriations. Comparisons generally are at the agency level. ", "Appropriations are complex. For example, the budget requests for some agencies are large, numbering several hundred pages and containing numerous funding, programmatic, and legislative changes for congressional consideration. Further, appropriations laws provide funds for numerous accounts, activities, and subactivities, and the accompanying explanatory statements provide additional directives and other important information. This report does not provide account- and subaccount-level information, or information on budgetary reorganizations or legislative changes proposed or enacted.

Further, no interim continuing resolution had been enacted to provide appropriations for the projects and activities covered by the 12 appropriations bills. As a result, a funding gap and partial government shutdown began on October 1, 2013, and lasted 16 days until the enactment of a short-term continuing resolution (CR) on October 17, 2013 ( P.L. 113-46 ). The CR included appropriations for continuing projects and activities funded in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations law for FY2013, at the FY2013 post-sequestration, post-rescission levels. The law provided exceptions for Wildland Fire Management of the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service, under specified terms and conditions. It provided continuing appropriations for FY2014 through January 15, 2014. P.L. 113-73 extended continuing appropriations for FY2014 through January 18, 2014.", "During the funding gap, agencies generally were prohibited by the Antideficiency Act from spending funds in advance of or in excess of appropriations. Exceptions in the law allow some agency functions to continue, for instance, for \"emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" Under guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget, agencies in the Interior bill developed plans that generally summarized agency activities that would cease and agency activities that would continue during a lapse in appropriations for FY2014. These plans also typically identified the number of employees expected to be retained and the number expected to be furloughed. For instance, an overview plan for DOI issued in advance of the lapse in appropriations had estimated that of 72,562 employees in pay status, 58,765 employees would be furloughed in the event of a lapse in appropriations. The plan further summarized that: ", "All areas of the National Park and National Wildlife Refuge Systems would be closed and public access would be restricted. The Bureau of Land Management would terminate all nonemergency activities on the public lands. The scientific work of the U.S. Geological Survey would be halted or conducted in a custodial manner. Only those activities needed to respond to emergency situations would be conducted by the Office of Surface Mining. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement would continue to ensure the safety of drilling and production operations and issue drilling and other offshore permits, however renewable activities and five year plan work would be terminated. Most activities at Bureau of Indian Affairs agency, regional and headquarters offices would be suspended. Activities to continue required payments to beneficiaries would continue. The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians would maintain minimum operations necessary to issue checks to beneficiaries. ", "Additional details for each DOI agency were included in agency-specific plans. The cessation or curtailment of some activities and services during the funding gap, such as the closure of national park units, was controversial among some Members of Congress and segments of the public.

For about 20 agencies and other entities typically funded in Title III of the bill, the appropriation was $11.44 billion, or 38.0% of the total. ", "Appropriations enacted for agencies vary widely for a number of reasons, relating to the number, breadth, and complexity of agency responsibilities; alternative sources of funding (e.g., mandatory appropriations); and Administration and congressional priorities, among other factors. Thus while the FY2014 appropriations covered approximately 30 agencies, funding for a small subset accounted for most of the total. For example, the appropriations for three agencies\u2014EPA, Forest Service, and Indian Health Service\u2014were about three-fifths (60.1%) of the total enacted. Further, more than three-quarters (77.0%) of the total appropriation was for these three agencies and two others\u2014National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs. ", "For DOI agencies, the FY2014 appropriations ranged from $69.0 million for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to $2.56 billion for the National Park Service.

Nearly half (48.6%) of the $10.47 billion for DOI agencies was for two agencies\u2014the National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.", "For Related Agencies in Title III, the appropriations showed even more variation. They ranged from $1.0 million for the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission to $5.48 billion for the Forest Service. In addition to the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service received more than $4 billion.

For instance, the total appropriation decreased by $217.8 million (2.0%) for all DOI agencies, decreased by $278.4 million (3.3%) for EPA, and increased by $926.8 million (8.8%) for all Related Agencies in Title III. ", "The overall decrease in appropriations for FY2014 for DOI agencies can be attributed primarily to reductions for the National Park Service and DOI Departmental Offices. The reduction for the NPS was $213.4 million (7.7%) and for Departmental Offices was $315.9 million (33.7%). In both cases, the FY2013 appropriation included relatively large supplemental appropriations for disaster relief, as shown in Table 1 . Despite the decrease for DOI agencies collectively, most DOI agencies received increased appropriations for FY2014. The Bureau of Indian Affairs received the largest dollar increase ($142.2 million, 6.0%). ", "The overall decrease in appropriations for EPA reflected various increases and decreases for agency accounts, programs, and activities. The biggest dollar decrease was for the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account, in large part because the FY2013 appropriation included supplemental appropriations for disaster relief. STAG grants include Clean Water State Revolving Fund capitalization grants and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund capitalization grants, among other state and tribal grants. Clean Water State Revolving Funds support municipal wastewater infrastructure projects, such as constructing or upgrading sewage treatment plants needed to comply with the Clean Water Act. Drinking Water State Revolving Funds support drinking water infrastructure projects to facilitate compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act and to meet the act's health goals. The largest dollar increase in FY2014 appropriations for EPA accounts was for the Environmental Programs and Management account. ", "The FY2014 appropriation was an increase for nearly all agencies in Title III. However, most of the overall increase was due to augmented appropriations for the Forest Service (of $554.9 million, 11.3%) and the Indian Health Service (of $303.7 million, 7.4%). The increase for the Forest Service was primarily for suppressing wildland fires. The additional funding for the Indian Health Service was for clinical services and contract support costs, among other programs.

The President did not seek funding for National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs, which had been funded in previous years, and sought amounts ranging from $2.4 million for the Commission of Fine Arts to $4.84 billion for the Forest Service. In addition to the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service would have received more than $4 billion under the President's proposal.

The appropriation for Title III agencies was $494.8 million (4.5%) above the request, with higher appropriations for the Forest Service ($638.2 million higher, 13.2%) being the biggest factor. This was in large part because the Forest Service appropriation included $600.0 million in additional funds for suppressing wildland fires (provided in P.L. 113-46 ).
