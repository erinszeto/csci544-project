Subsequently, Congress plays an oversight role as the U.S. Department of Agriculture promulgates rules, releases guidance, and otherwise implements the legislation. This report features a summary of the legislative history of P.L. 111-296 as well as a section-by-section summary of what was contained within the law. For a brief overview of this periodic reauthorization, see CRS In Focus IF10266, An Introduction to Child Nutrition Reauthorization, by [author name scrubbed].", "A comprehensive congressional review (\"reauthorization\") of the primary laws governing child nutrition and WIC programs (the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act) had been scheduled for 2009 (the last reauthorization was in 2004). Congress did not meet the September 30, 2009, deadline for comprehensive reauthorization. Instead, a one-year extension (through September 30, 2010) was included in the FY2010 Agriculture Department appropriations measure to give Congress time to consider a full reauthorization bill. The delay in child nutrition/WIC reauthorization was primarily due to a lack of agreement on how to fund any new child nutrition initiatives subject to congressional \"pay-go\" rules. The Administration had proposed spending $10 billion over the next 10 years on expanding child nutrition efforts to \"end childhood hunger by 2015,\" but did not offer specific policy changes or spending/revenue offsets. In 2010, Congress moved to begin the process of enacting the most sweeping changes in child nutrition and WIC programs since the 1970s.", "In May 2010, the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee reported the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (S. 3307; S.Rept. 111-178). It legislated substantial changes in the child nutrition and WIC programs (most importantly, increasing federal financing for school lunches) that were estimated to cost just about $4.5 billion over 10 years. It also included spending reductions in other programs that offset this cost. Most significantly, it (1) reduced payments under the Agriculture Department's Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) and (2) included a restructuring of, and long-term cut in spending for, the nutrition education component of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program). On August 5, 2010, the Senate approved an amended version of S. 3307. It differed from the committee-reported version of the bill in that it replaced savings from the EQIP offset with spending reductions achieved by reducing future benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program) and dropped authority for the Agriculture Department to bar certain foods from the WIC program.", "In July 2010, the House Education and Labor Committee approved the Improving Nutrition for America's Children Act (H.R. 5504, as extensively amended in committee). This bill included provisions that were much the same as the Senate initiative, but the anticipated cost (more than $7 billion over 10 years) would have been substantially larger because of provisions expanding child nutrition efforts well beyond those in the Senate's bill and only relatively minimal offsets.", "After lengthy internal debates over the cost of any child nutrition/WIC reauthorization initiative and how to pay for it, the House approved the Senate's bill on December 2, 2010, and the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 was enacted on December 13, 2010 (P.L. 111-296)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Child nutrition programs (like school meal programs, after-school meal/snack programs, and those serving children in child care settings) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (the WIC program) were scheduled for a comprehensive review (\"reauthorization\") in 2009. However, because of concerns over the cost of any renewal of expiring child nutrition and WIC program authorities and of new proposals that went beyond current law (and how to pay for these new initiatives), Congress delayed action on a comprehensive bill and enacted a one-year extension (through September 30, 2010) of expiring authorities as part of the FY2010 appropriations law for the Agriculture Department. ", "The Administration proposed spending $10 billion over the next 10 years in an effort to \"end childhood hunger by 2015,\" but did not advance specific program changes or ways to offset any new costs. After more than a year of debate, Congress responded with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-296 ; enacted December 13, 2010). While P.L. 111-296 includes the most extensive changes in child nutrition/WIC programs since the 1970s, it requires much less new spending than the Administration called for and includes a relatively controversial provision reducing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the food stamp program) benefits as one of its offsetting savings. P.L. 111-296 effectively adopts the reauthorization bill passed by the Senate ( S. 3307 ), not the more expansive (and expensive) version put forward in the House. A section-by-section summary of the law can be found in \" Summary of 's Provisions,\" below.", "Prior to P.L. 111-296 , child nutrition and WIC programs were last amended in a substantial way by the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-265 ); these revisions are covered in CRS Report RL33299, Child Nutrition and WIC Legislation in the 108 th and 109 th Congresses , by [author name scrubbed].

The most recent legislation", "increases funding for school lunches and links this new money to schools meeting updated nutrition standards; provides for gradually increasing prices for school lunches served to paying (non-poor) students; increases access to free school meals by (1) expanding automatic (direct) certification of those receiving public assistance benefits, and (2) giving schools new options to offer free meals to all students; requires updated school meal nutrition standards and professional standards for school meal providers; broadens coverage of and support for local school \"wellness policies\"; establishes nutrition standards for foods sold in competition with school meals (e.g., a la carte foods and those sold from vending machines); encourages \"farm-to-school\" and other initiatives to combat childhood obesity; expands support for food service through summer programs and after-school and outside-of-school programs; adds to food safety requirements for foods served on school campuses and foods provided by the Agriculture Department; improves food procurement practices used by schools; increases WIC program support for breastfeeding; establishes a time frame for introducing electronic benefit transfer systems to the WIC program; improves schools' accountability for proper program operations; introduces new rules for nutrition standards and heightened physical activity in child care settings; and supports and finances state and local initiatives to end childhood hunger."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Issues", "paragraphs": ["With a few exceptions (noted below), there was little controversy over the substance of the Senate and House policy provisions carrying out the themes listed above. The single, overwhelming issue in the child nutrition/WIC reauthorization debate was the costs associated with the proposed revisions (and how to offset them).", "The bill reported by the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee (with costs of just under $5 billion over 10 years) included four offsets. There was no opposition to the two smallest offsets\u2014changes in how to count \"bonus\" commodities in meeting minimum requirements for commodity aid to schools and additional independent review of eligibility for free and reduced-price school meals. Together, they accounted for about one-fifth of the new spending in the Senate's measure. However, the two larger offsets were controversial. One would have substantially reduced payments for the Agriculture Department's Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) and the other would have, over the long term, effectively cut spending for the nutrition education component of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program). Critics argued that these two efforts deserve the support they get; supporters saw few other offsets to use under House/Senate \"pay-go\" rules.", "Largely in response to criticism of the EQIP offset from the agricultural community and others, the child nutrition/WIC reauthorization bill passed by the Senate on August 5, 2010, and the final version of the new child nutrition reauthorization law replaces it with a provision that reduces future SNAP/food stamp benefits by terminating an across-the-board benefit increase legislated in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ) for November 2013. This offset, in turn, was controversial among advocates for food assistance programs, who saw it as simply transferring SNAP/food stamp funding meant for low-income households to pay for other nutrition programs primarily affecting the same households\u2014not new spending on food assistance. ", "The House Education and Labor Committee's version of child nutrition/WIC reauthorization ( H.R. 5504 ) had significantly higher costs than the Senate's bill (and very small offsets). As a result, progress on reauthorization legislation was stalled until agreement could be reached on how to finance any initiative and, in the end, the House accepted the Senate's approach.", "In addition to cost/offset issues, the 111 th Congress also debated and the law in part addressed three major policy questions:", "To what degree should the federal government step in with rules governing the types of \"competitive foods\" served outside the school meal programs (e.g., a la carte items and foods sold from vending machines)? While both the Senate and House bills (and P.L. 111-296 ) require the establishment of federal rules for these foods, there are those who argue that the decision is better left to states and schools. Should there be federal rules effectively requiring minimum prices for school lunches served to non-poor children ? Both the Senate and House bills (and P.L. 111-296 ) envision a gradual increase in these prices. This is based on Agriculture Department studies indicating that federal school meal payments may, to an extent, \"cross-subsidize\" the price of food served to non-poor children and items offered outside the school meal programs (for example, \"paid\" meals served to non-poor children often are priced below the full federal subsidy for a free meal). In effect, supporters were concerned that federal dollars intended for services to poor children are being \"diverted\" to aid in paying for meals for those who could afford to pay more. On the other hand, opponents contended that the current system brings higher participation among non-poor children (and bigger revenues for school food service authorities) that allows authorities to serve better meals; they are concerned that higher prices would be charged to \"non-poor\" children whose family income is just above the cutoff for free and reduced price meals (i.e., the near poor), and they oppose placing federal rules on local schools' meal pricing decisions. Should there be rules governing when the WIC program will pay for foods (like infant formula) where new ingredients have been added that purport to increase their nutritional value ? The bill reported by the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee would have given the Agriculture Department authority to bar foods where increased costs outweighed any increased nutritional value; the House bill would have taken a somewhat different approach and called for a review of the benefits of any new or emerging ingredients. WIC program advocates argued that, at a minimum, the House provisions should be adopted. Others contended that giving the department either the Senate or House versions of authority over the ingredient content of WIC foods would have granted it too much power over innovation in and upgrading of WIC foods (e.g., WIC purchases make up a very large portion of the infant formula market) and might produce a \"two-tier\" system whereby WIC parents would not be provided the same types of foods that non-WIC parents can purchase with their own money. In the end, P.L. 111-296 contains no authority for review or disapproval of WIC food items.

These costs were offset by savings expected from four provisions in the bill (see below) that are anticipated to generate total spending reductions that effectively met or exceeded costs.", "On July 15, 2010, the House Education and Labor Committee approved an extensively amended version of H.R. 5504 , the Improving Nutrition for America's Children Act. The CBO estimated (as of August 25, 2010) that the bill would engender new spending of $7.78 billion/$7.58 billion (mandatory budget authority/outlays) over 10 years (FY2011-FY2020) and $2.6 billion/$2.5 billion (mandatory budget authority/outlays) over 5 years (FY2011-FY2015)\u2014significantly higher than the Senate's comparable measure.", "Unlike the Senate bill, only two relatively small offsetting savings were provided. The House offsets (also included in the Senate-approved measure, see below) included a \"bonus\" commodity offset (saving $500 million over 5 years and $1 billion over 10 years) and a provision calling for independent review of eligibility applications for free and reduced-price school meals (saving an estimated $63 million/$62 million [budget authority/outlays]) over 10 years and $26 million/$25 million (budget authority/outlays) over 5 years.", "As a result, the House Committee's bill had an estimated cost (not covered by budgetary offsets) of $6.72 billion/$6.52 billion (mandatory budget authority/outlays) over 10 years (FY2011-FY2020) and $2.08 billion/$1.96 billion (mandatory budget authority/outlays) over 5 years (FY2011-FY2015).", "On August 5, 2010, the Senate approved an amended version of S. 3307 . Differing from the committee-reported bill, the Senate-passed bill dropped reductions in EQIP payments (see following note) and replaced them with a roughly equivalent dollar offset (in Section 442) accomplished by reducing future benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program). This reduction (which became part of P.L. 111-296 ) is scheduled for November 2013 and terminates an across-the-board increase in SNAP/food stamp benefits enacted as part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ). It is expected to result in monthly benefit reductions averaging some $10-$15 per person.

It would have substantially reduced annual mandatory funding for the EQIP for total savings of $2.87 billion/$2.2 billion (budget authority/outlays) over 10 years and $1.35 billion/$0.75 billion (budget authority/outlays) over 5 years. In committee consideration, the makeup of the package of savings, particularly the change proposed for the EQIP, was the major point of contention.", "A second revision producing savings was made to the law governing the nutrition education component of SNAP. It is expected to cut mandatory spending by $1.3 billion (budget authority and outlays) over 10 years and $250 million (budget authority and outlays) over 5 years. Section 241 of P.L. 111-296 establishes a new grant program for nutrition education and obesity prevention, replacing the current program under which state spending (both cash and in-kind) on nutrition education for SNAP recipients is matched by the federal government as part of their SNAP administrative costs (the federal share is 50%). P.L. 111-296 provides $375 million for grants in FY2011 (approximately the value of the current federal share) and adjusts that amount for inflation in future years. These funds are to be distributed by formula to the states and there would no longer be a requirement for state matching funds. States can use the money to provide nutrition education and operate obesity prevention programs for SNAP recipients and other low-income individuals.", "Extension of the Agriculture Department's authority to count certain \"bonus\" (surplus) commodities toward meeting a minimum threshold for commodity support of child nutrition programs (in Section 401 of P.L. 111-296 ) is estimated to produce savings of $1 billion (budget authority and outlays) over 10 years and $500 million (budget authority and outlays) over 5 years.

Section 101 provides funding ($12 million) for \"performance awards\" for states demonstrating outstanding or substantially improved performance in direct certification activities. It also requires \"continuous improvement plans\" for states failing to meet goals set for increasing direct certification. Section 103 aims to extend the reach of direct certification activities by establishing a demonstration project in a number of states to directly certify most children in Medicaid households as eligible for free school meals and funding a study of the effects of doing so.", "Section 102 places into law a provision (similar to current regulations) making foster children categorically (automatically) eligible for free school meals. ", "Section 104 gives Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) two new options to offer free meals to all schoolchildren . Under prior law, schools with high proportions of low-income children can choose to offer free meals to all children; these provisions of law are generally called \"Provision 2 and Provision 3.\" Schools taking these options must, however, take applications in a \"base\" year and use the results of those approved applications to determine the proportion of meals/students that would otherwise be served free or at a reduced price, thereby establishing the amount of their federal school meal subsidies for the next four years. In effect, schools taking advantage of these provisions save the administrative cost of annually determining eligibility for free and reduced-price meals and counting them separately, but must cover the extra costs associated with losing charges received from paying students. P.L. 111-296 adds two more choices for schools wishing to serve free meals to all students; in both cases, taking of applications would not be necessary and schools would (as under current law) be required to find funding for any costs above those covered by federal subsidies. Under a \"direct certification\" option (\"universal meal service in high poverty areas\") , schools with relatively large proportions of students directly certified as eligible for free school meals because they are public assistance (e.g., SNAP-food stamp/Medicaid) recipients could choose to receive federal school meal subsidies derived from the proportion of students directly certified. Under a \"survey\" option (\"universal meal service through Census data\") , the Agriculture Department would be permitted to approve the use of Census and other socioeconomic surveys and data sources to approximate the makeup of students and replace the collection of household applications to determine the proportion of children eligible for free and reduced-price meals.
