This year also will be marked with historical events, including the 15th anniversary of the United States granting Vietnam permanent normal trade relations (PNTR), the February signing of the TPP, and President Obama's first official visit to Vietnam in May.", "According to U.S. trade statistics, bilateral trade has grown from about $220 million in 1994 to $45.1 billion in 2015, transforming Vietnam into the 13th-largest source for U.S. imports and 37th-largest destination for U.S. exports. Vietnam is the second-largest source of U.S. clothing imports (after China), and a major source for electrical machinery, footwear, and furniture. Much of this rapid growth in bilateral trade can be attributed to U.S. extension of normal trade relations (NTR) status to Vietnam in 2001. Another major contributing factor is over 20 years of rapid economic growth in Vietnam, ushered in by a 1986 shift to a more market-oriented economic system.", "Vietnam's incentive to join the TPP largely is contingent on greater market access in the United States, particularly for agricultural goods, aquacultural goods, clothing, and footwear. For the United States, Vietnam offers a significant market for U.S. exports, but some parties are concerned about Vietnam's protection of workers' rights, protection of intellectual property rights, and potential unfair competition from state-owned or state-controlled enterprises. Vietnam is also a party to negotiations to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a pan-Asian regional trade association that currently does not include the United States. It is uncertain how RCEP would affect Vietnam's interest and commitment to TPP, if both regional trade agreements are finalized. Congress would have to consider implementing legislation for the United States to comply with the TPP.", "The growth in bilateral trade has not been without accompanying issues and problems. Vietnam would like the United States officially to recognize it as a market economy and to further relax U.S. restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam. In addition, the two nations have disagreed over U.S. treatment of the import of catfish-like fish known as basa, swai, or tra, from Vietnam. In 2008, the 110th Congress passed legislation that transferred the regulation of catfish from the Food and Drug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which many analysts contend maintain stricter inspection standards than the FDA. The Vietnamese government strongly protested the law as a protectionist measure. The Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79) confirmed the transfer of inspection to the USDA, and explicitly included basa, swai, and tra as catfish. In November 2015, the USDA released final regulations for the import of catfish that went into effect in March 2016. While Vietnam continues to object to the regulatory change, it is making efforts to comply with the new U.S. inspection regime.", "The 114th Congress may play an important role in one or more of these issues, as have past Congresses. The Human Rights Act of 2016 (S. 2632) opposes the \"further easing of the prohibition on the sale of lethal military equipment to the Government of Vietnam\" unless certain human rights conditions improve. The House report accompanying the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (H.R. 1890), cites a perceived lack of a \"mechanism to ensure compliance by TPP parties\" to international standards for labor laws and practices, and in particular Vietnam. Vietnam's compliance with a bilateral trade and labor relations side agreement to the TPP may factor in congressional consideration of the larger TPP agreement. This report will be updated as circumstances require."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, economic and trade relations between the United States and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) remained virtually frozen, in part a legacy of the Vietnam War. On May 2, 1975, after North Vietnam defeated U.S. ally the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), President Gerald R. Ford extended President Richard M. Nixon's 1964 trade embargo on North Vietnam to cov er the reunified nation. Under the Ford embargo, bilateral trade and financial transactions were prohibited. ", "Economic and trade relations between the two nations began to thaw during the Clinton Administration, building on joint efforts during the Reagan and George H. W. Bush Administrations to resolve a sensitive issue in the United States\u2014recovering the remains of U.S. military personnel declared \"missing in action\" (MIA) during the Vietnam War. The shift in U.S. policy also was spurred by Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia. President Bill Clinton ordered an end to the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam on February 3, 1994. On July 11, 1995, the United States and Vietnam restored diplomatic relations. Two years later, President Bill Clinton appointed the first U.S. ambassador to Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War. ", "Bilateral relations also improved in part due to Vietnam's 1986 decision to shift from a Soviet-style central planned economy to a form of market socialism. The new economic policy, known as Doi Moi (\"change and newness\"), ushered in a period of nearly 30 years of rapid growth in Vietnam. Since 2000, Vietnam's real GDP growth has averaged over 6% per year, second only to China. Much of that growth has been generated by foreign investment in Vietnam's manufacturing sector, particularly its clothing industry. ", "The United States and Vietnam signed a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) on July 13, 2000, which went into force on December 10, 2001. As part of the BTA, the United States extended to Vietnam conditional most favored nation (MFN) trade status, now known as normal trade relations (NTR). Economic and trade relations further improved when the United States granted Vietnam permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status on December 29, 2006, as part of Vietnam's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Over the last five fiscal years, Congress has appropriated over $10 million each year to support Vietnam's economic reforms. In addition, the two nations have set up a ministerial-level Trade and Investment Agreement (TIFA) Council to discuss issues related to the implementation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and WTO agreements, as well as trade and investment policies in general. ", "U.S. and Vietnamese official trade data are comparatively close and reflect a similar pattern in the growth of bilateral trade (see Figure 1 ). For the first few years following the end of the U.S. embargo in 1994, trade between the two nations grew slowly, principally because of Vietnam's lack of NTR. However, following the granting of conditional NTR in December 2001, trade flows between the United States and Vietnam grew quickly. Merchandise trade nearly doubled between 2001 and 2002, regardless of which nation's figures one uses. Bilateral trade rose again in 2007, following the United States granting PNTR status to Vietnam. U.S. imports from Vietnam slid 4.7% in 2009 because of the U.S. economic recession, but have rebounded sharply since 2010. ", "Both nations are parties to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a regional trade agreement awaiting approval of implementing legislation by the respective legislatures of both nations. For its part, Vietnam also has indicated a desire to foster closer trade relations by applying for acceptance into the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and negotiating a bilateral investment treaty (BIT), but both those initiatives have receded in light of the TPP agreement. The United States also has expressed an interest in closer economic relations, including the possible elimination of restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam, but has previously told the Vietnamese government that it needs to make certain changes in the legal, regulatory, and operating environment of its economy to conclude either the BIT agreement or to qualify for the GSP program. ", "The growth in bilateral trade also has created sources of trade friction. A rapid increase in Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States led to the implementation of a controversial monitoring program from 2007 to 2009. The growth in Vietnam's catfish exports (known as basa , swai , and tra ) also has generated tensions between the two nations. Other economic issues have had an indirect effect on bilateral relations, such as the United States' designation of Vietnam as a \"non-market economy,\" and allegations of inadequate intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in Vietnam.

The U.S. announcement of interest in joining the renamed Trans-Pacific Partnership was quickly followed by similar expressions of interest by Australia, Malaysia, Peru, and Vietnam. The nine countries formally agreed to accept Mexico and Canada into the ongoing negotiations on June 18 and 19, 2012, respectively. Japan was accepted into the negotiations on April 21, 2013. The 12 nations signed the agreement on February 4, 2016.", "Vietnam's membership in the TPP could complicate the congressional support for the trade agreement. Whereas the other parties involved in the negotiations are generally viewed as having comparatively open trade policies, Vietnam remains a mixed economy with considerable government intervention. Backers of Vietnam's participation in the negotiations maintain that it would further open a sizeable market to U.S. exports and investments, and could accelerate economic reforms in Vietnam. Opponents cite Vietnam's human rights record, including with respect to workers' rights, and alleged unfair government support for certain industries as reasons for not entering into a trade agreement with Vietnam.

", "The United States, in turn, pressed Vietnam to undertake the necessary economic and regulatory reforms necessary to fulfill its obligations under the proposed TPP agreement. The United States stated that it was particularly concerned about Vietnam's ability to achieve the necessary TPP standards for such topics as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, workers' rights, IPR enforcement, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).", "Another complicating factor during the negotiations was Vietnam's negotiations with 15 other nations to form another regional trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), that does not include the United States. RCEP negotiations formally began in November 2012, and are scheduled to be concluded by the end of 2016. It is uncertain how RCEP would affect Vietnam's interest and commitment to TPP, if both regional trade agreements are finalized. ", "When the TPP negotiations were concluded in October 2015, Vietnam's government-run media lauded the agreement for the increased trade and foreign investment it will bring to the nation. Those press accounts stressed that the TPP would provide duty-free market access to the United States for Vietnam's clothing, footwear, and textile exporters, as well as attract foreign investors from Japan and the United States to set up more manufacturing facilities in Vietnam. The government-run press downplayed concerns about potential adverse effects on Vietnam's agricultural sector, possibly higher pharmaceutical prices, and required changes in Vietnam's labor laws and regulations. The TPP agreement was also viewed as another step in the normalization of relations with the United States.

The market access provisions provide for the gradual elimination of tariffs on most goods, but both nations secured safeguard measures for selected goods of domestic importance. The agreement's textile and apparel provisions utilize the \"yarn forward\" approach preferred by the U.S. government, but also allow for an extensive \"short supply list\" that will likely qualify a significant amount of Vietnamese exports to enter the United States for the TPP's preferential tariff rates. On workers' rights, the two nations signed a separate \"United States-Vietnam Plan for the Enhancement of Trade and Labour Relations\" in which Vietnam commits to comply with International Labour Organization (ILO) standards and requires that the Vietnamese government \"ensure that its laws and regulations permit workers, without distinction, employed by an enterprise form a grassroots labour union of their own choosing without prior authorization.\" Both governments also open up much of government procurement to foreign suppliers, but with limits on certain goods and services considered of national security interest. On intellectual property (IP) rights, the TPP agreement commits both nations to protect and enforce IP rights, including agreed upon \"geographical indicators,\" and obligates Vietnam to recognize IP rights for biologics. The agreement's chapter on State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) forbids, with some specific exceptions, all TPP members from providing \"non-commercial assistance\" to its SOEs, and forbids its SOEs from discriminating against foreign firms.

Each nation has included a tariff elimination schedule for the phased out reduction in tariffs, which can span up to 20 years. The United States stipulated that it would establish tariff rate quotas (TRQs) for sugar (including imports from Vietnam), certain dairy products, and beef from Japan. The United States also reserved the right to impose agricultural safeguard measures for certain dairy products, but none of them applied to Vietnamese goods. Vietnam established TRQs for used engines, unmanufactured tobacco, and tobacco refuse. ", "The United States and Vietnam also exchanged letters with regard to U.S. inspection requirements for \" Siluriformes , including pangasius , tra , and basa \"\u2014which are catfish-like fish\u2014pursuant of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-246 ) and the Agricultural Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-79 ). Vietnam has asserted that these laws constitute a form of protectionism for U.S. catfish producers (see \" Catfish \" below). The letters recognize the importance of pangasius , tra , and basa to Vietnamese farmers, and commit the two countries to consult with each other following the release of final U.S. regulations governing the inspection of Siluriformes . The United States also promises to consider a \"transitional period for the implementation of the final rule,\" and \"subject to the availability of appropriated funds, work with Viet Nam and other interested parties, to identify and provide technical assistance\" for compliance with the final rule.

Similarly, the U.S. textile and apparel sectors were split on the treatment of their products in the TPP. In the negotiations, the U.S. Trade Representative supported a \"yarn-forward\" rule of origin, as had been done in previous U.S. trade agreements; the Vietnamese negotiators and U.S. apparel companies argued for a less restrictive \"cut and sew\" rule of origin. The TPP agreement has a separate chapter (Chapter 4) on textiles and apparel that adopts a \"yarn-forward\" rule of origin approach, but also provides for an extensive list of fibers, yarns, and fabrics deemed to be in \"short supply.\" These materials that can be sourced outside of the TPP member nations and still qualify for duty-free treatment. ", "The short supply list includes 187 items that some observers think is sufficiently extensive and could allow a significant share of Vietnamese apparel to qualify for duty-free treatment. Other analysts, however, are less certain that Vietnam's clothing and textile industry will significantly benefit from the TPP provisions. In particular, the \"yarn-forward\" rule of origin will present a challenge to Vietnamese apparel manufacturers who currently source the majority of their fabrics and textiles from China, a non-TPP nation. Vietnam's domestic textile industry currently lacks the capacity and expertise to supply the apparel industry with the necessary materials, but investors from China, South Korea, and Taiwan reportedly are building weaving and dyeing factories in Vietnam to comply with the \"yarn forward\" rule of the TPP.

While they generally recognize that Vietnam has made improvements in its labor laws since the start of the century, they see ongoing problems with local government enforcement and business compliance. The State Department's 2014 human rights report on Vietnam singled out problems with suppression of independent labor unions, failure to enforce laws governing the right to organize, forced or compulsory labor, child labor, and unacceptable working conditions. ", "Workers in Vietnam have the legal right to collective bargaining. At present, all labor unions in Vietnam must be a member of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL). The VGCL is supposed to organize a union within six months of the establishment of any new business, regardless of its ownership\u2014state, foreign, or private. ", "Vietnamese workers are not legally allowed to form unions independent from the VGCL, and efforts to organize independent unions in Vietnam reportedly have been thwarted by government suppression, including the arrest and imprisonment of union leaders. In addition, workers are prohibited from forming industry-wide or trade unions that represent workers in different enterprises. ", "Some analysts have argued that restrictions of the right of association in Vietnam have impeded the improvement of labor rights. Other observers, however, counter that since the launch of doi moi , there has been progress on worker rights despite the restrictions on their independent right to organize. These observers point out that hundreds of unaffiliated (and therefore unofficial) \"labor associations\" have sprouted without significant repression, that the VGCL has evolved into a more aggressive advocate for workers, and in many recent cases, Vietnamese workers have gone on strike reportedly because they felt that they were not well-represented by the official union. In 2009, Human Rights Watch raised concern about the ability of Vietnamese workers to call an official strike, especially at state-owned enterprises (SOEs). According to the State Department's most recent human rights report for Vietnam, none of the 262 reported strikes between January and November 2015 \"followed the authorized conciliation and arbitration process\" required by Vietnam's labor laws, and were therefore, technically illegal. ", "Vietnamese workers did experience a few improvements in 2014 and 2015. In April 2014, the VGCL formed the Committee of Labor Relations to improve relations between local unions and their workers, improve relations between workers and managers, and avoid labor disputes. In addition, the chairman of VGCL is allegedly pushing for a higher minimum wage than the one being proposed by the Vietnamese government. Also, a week-long strike in Ho Chi Minh City in April 2015 reportedly pressured the Vietnamese government to amend a new social insurance law that would have limited lump sum payments to workers when they leave their jobs. ", "Between 2005 and 2008, the reported number of factory worker strikes in Vietnam increased from 147 to 762. Virtually all these strikes were illegal, or wildcat strikes, organized by workers without the support or assistance of the local union. The reported number of strikes declined in 2009 to 216, but then quickly rose to 981 in 2011. ", "After the rise in wildcat strikes, the Vietnamese government appeared tacitly to accept that enforcement of its labor laws have been problematic. Vietnam's official news agencies\u2014 Thanhnien News , Vietnam Net, and Voice of Vietnam News\u2014ran a series of reports in 2008 and 2009 describing problems with Vietnam's protection of workers' rights, the flaws of the VGCL, and efforts to improve working conditions in Vietnam. The humanitarian aid agency of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which has worked closely with the VGCL on workers' education, wrote in a letter to Human Rights Watch, \"Our experience in workers' education in Vietnam also leads us to believe that the government, far from trying to lower workers' conditions or repress workers, is sensitive to the needs of women and men workers.\" ", "Since then, the Vietnamese government has worked with various international organizations to improve its labor laws, regulations and enforcement. Vietnam's Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) and the VGCL worked with the International Labor Organization (ILO) to finalize a new Labour Code and Trade Union Law. In June 2012, Vietnam's National Assembly approved the new law, which took effect on May 1, 2013. The ILO and MOLISA are also working with Spain's Agency for International Development Cooperation on a program to eliminate child labor in Vietnam. In addition, the United Nations provided $2 million for a program to help the VGCL improve its grassroots relations.", "Vietnamese workers continue to face constraints on their right of association, their ability to form unions of their choice, and their ability to address grievances over their working conditions. Labor organizers, such as Do Thi Minh Hanh, Doan Huy Chuong, and Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung, have been arrested and jailed for attempting to organize independent labor unions. In January 2015, the Vietnamese government reportedly issued new guidelines that establish procedures for settling wildcat strikes, but are seen as cumbersome and potentially costly for the striking workers.
