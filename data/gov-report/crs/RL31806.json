For operations and maintenance, thePresident proposed a decrease of 9% for FY2004 while the House approved anincrease of 8%, and the Senate supported a 5% increase. The final FY2004 level was$391.5 million, a 7% increase. For infrastructure improvements in the system, theAdministration requested $53.4 million but the House, the Senate, and the conferencerejected the proposal.", "Spending for the NWRS is under the \"Refuges and Wildlife\" budget activity, which includes programs which are not directly tied to the NWRS: recovery of theSalton Sea (in California), management of migratory birds throughout the countryand in cooperation with other nations, and law enforcement operations around thecountry.

The National Wildlife Refuge Fund (also called the Refuge Revenue Sharing Fund)compensates counties for the presence of the non-taxable federal lands of the NWRS. A portion of the fund is supported by the permanent appropriation of receipts fromvarious activities carried out on the NWRS. However, these receipts are notsufficient for full funding of authorized amounts. Congress generally makes up someof the difference in annual appropriations. The Administration requested $14.4million for FY2004, up slightly from FY2003, and the FY2004 enacted level was$14.2 million. When combined with the estimated receipts, this appropriation levelwould cover 49% of the authorized full payment. ", "Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF).

The Appropriations Committees have expressed concern thatthe IIM lawsuit was jeopardizing DOI trust reform implementation and have requiredreports from DOI on the costs and benefits of historical accounting methods,including statistical sampling. Congress also, in the FY2003 Interior appropriationsact, required a summary for Congress of a full historical accounting performed forfive of the plaintiffs, capped the compensation of two court-appointed officialsmonitoring trust reform, and authorized the Interior Secretary to help employees payfor legal costs related to the IIM suit.

According to the House Committee, it indicated a very low error rate in theaccounts' transactions. In its initial reduction of the amount for FY2004 historicalaccounting, the Senate Appropriations Committee noted that the funding should beadequate for a statistical sampling model (part of DOI's proposed methodology) andthat the reduction was not an endorsement of the plaintiffs' accounting model. ForFY2004, Congress retained the provisions capping the court officials' compensationand assisting federal employees in paying legal bills related to the IIM litigation.", "The court's decision on historical accounting was delivered on September 25, 2003.

The Interior Departmentestimated that the court's choice for historical accounting would cost $6-12 billion.", "The FY2004 Interior appropriations conference report added a controversial new provision aimed at the court's September 25 decision. The provision directed thatno statute or trust law principle should be construed to require the InteriorDepartment to conduct the historical accounting until either Congress has delineatedthe department's specific historical accounting obligations or December 31, 2004,whichever is earlier.

The purpose of the SPR is to provide an emergency source of crude oilwhich may be tapped in the event of a presidential finding that an interruption in oilsupply, or an interruption threatening adverse economic effects, warrants a drawdownfrom the Reserve. Volatility in oil prices since the spring of 1999 prompted calls fromtime-to-time for drawdown of the Reserve, but both the Clinton and BushAdministrations did not think circumstances warranted it.", "In mid-November 2001, President Bush ordered that the SPR be filled to capacity (700 million barrels) using royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. This is oil turned over to thefederal government as payment for production from federal leases. Acquiring oil forthe SPR by RIK avoids the necessity for Congress to make outlays to finance directpurchase of oil; however, it also means a loss of revenues to the Treasury in so far asthe royalties are paid in wet barrels rather than in cash. Deliveries of RIK oil began inthe spring of 2002. The fill rate has varied depending upon geopolitical and marketconditions. Deliveries scheduled for late 2002 and the first months of 2003 weredelayed due to tightness in world oil markets. With the end of the military phase of thewar with Iraq, deliveries of RIK oil to the SPR ramped up during the spring andexceeded 200,000 barrels per day during the summer.

(10) The average annual federal costfor restoration activities in Southern Florida in the next 10 years is expected to beapproximately $286 million/year. (11) For FY2004,the Administration requested$311.0 million for restoration efforts in the Everglades, $46.9 million above theFY2003 enacted level of $264.1 million. (12) Ofthis total, $48.0 million was requestedfor the implementation of CERP. ", "FY2004 Appropriations to DOI. With regard to DOI for FY2004, $69.1 million was appropriated for CERP andnon-CERP activities related to restoration in the South Florida ecosystem. This was$43.2 million below the requested level of $112.3 million. Of the total appropriated,the NPS was appropriated $44.3 million for construction and research activities, $42.0 million below the request for $86.4 million. The FWS received $16.3 millionfor refuges, ecological services, and other activitie, an increase of $3.4 million overits request for $12.9 million. The USGS received $7.8 million for research, planning,and the Critical Ecosystem Studies Initiative, a decrease of $0.8 million from itsrequest of $8.6 million. Lastly, the BIA received $0.5 million for water projects onSeminole and Miccosukee Tribal lands, $0.1 million over its request of $0.4 million. For conducting activities authorized by CERP, DOI received $8.8 million. See Table20 below. ", " Table 20.

The CollierResources Company has mineral rights and has reached an agreement in principle tosell them to the DOI. (13) Forty million dollarswould cover a portion of the cost of themineral rights, estimated at $120 million. Appropriators, however, did not includethis funding in the FY2004 appropriations because the agreement had not beenauthorized and a recent DOI inquiry has been initiated. (14)", "The FY2004 law: 1) exempted funds appropriated for the implementation of the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 ( P.L. 101-229 ), and2) funds appropriated to Florida for acquiring lands for Everglades restoration froma prohibition on using DOI appropriations for filing declarations of takings orcondemnations without the approval of the Appropriations Committees. Arestoration project authorized by P.L. 101-229 , the Modified Water DeliveriesProject, is expected to use condemnation if required land is owned by unwillingsellers.", "Transfer of Funds. The FY2004 law contained provisions that directed the funds to be transferred among restorationactivities in the Everglades. The Secretary of the Interior was authorized to use prioryear unobligated funds for acquiring lands in the Everglades watershed to transfer$5.0 million to the FWS for monitoring water quality, eradicating invasive plants,and bolstering the recovery of endangered species. Further, the Secretary of theInterior was authorized to transfer necessary funds (from the same accounts) to theU.S. Army Corps of Engineers to implement additional water quality improvementtechnologies for portions of the Everglades ecosystem that affect the LNWR. Thisassistance is expected to help the state of Florida meet its water quality standards. The Secretary also was authorized to use any remaining funds from the accountsdescribed above to fund Everglades restoration activities on DOI lands, subject to theapproval of a reprogramming request by the House and Senate Committees onAppropriations. These provisions may have originated from the House Committeereport for FY2004, which stated that the State of Florida may not view the acquisitionof land for the implementation of CERP as its highest priority. ", "Concerns Over Phosphorus Mitigation in the Everglades. Several concerns regarding restoration efforts in theEverglades were presented in the House Committee report on Interior appropriations. One concern was over a Florida State Law (Chapter 2003-12, enacted on May 20,2003) that amended the Everglades Forever Act of 1994 (Florida Statutes \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd373.4592)by authorizing a new plan to mitigate phosphorus pollution in the Everglades. Phosphorus is one of the primary water pollutants in the Everglades and a primarycause for ecosystem alteration in the Everglades. Some critics argue that this newlaw extends previously established phosphorus mitigation deadlines for theEverglades, and may compromise efforts to restore the Everglades, as well asjeopardize federal appropriations for CERP. Proponents of the law argue that thenew plan represents a realistic strategy for curbing phosphorus. A subsequent lawof the Florida State Legislature (May 27, 2003, S 00054-A) attempted to addresssome of these concerns. Some Members of Congress reacted to these new lawsunfavorably and wrote letters expressing their disapproval. (15) Their concerns alsowere reflected in conditions that were included in the FY2004 Interior appropriationsconference agreement.", "Specifically, several provisions that condition funds for restoration based on the achievement of water quality standards were included in the FY2004 law. Funds forthe Modified Water Deliveries Project will be provided unless administrators of fourfederal departments/agencies (Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of the Army,Administrator of the EPA, and the Attorney General) jointly file a report annuallyuntil 2006 indicating that water entering the A.R.M. Loxahatchee National WildlifeRefuge and Everglades National Park meet state water quality standards, and theHouse and Senate Committees on Appropriations respond in writing disapprovingthe further expenditure of funds. Similar conditions also are present in the House-and Senate-passed versions of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations.

The Bush Administration is considering privatizing numerousand diverse government jobs, under its \"competitive sourcing\" initiative firstoutlined in 2001. The goal is to save money through competition betweengovernment and private businesses in areas where private businesses might providebetter commercial services, for instance, law enforcement and maintenance. Underthe \"outsourcing\" plan, as it is commonly known, agencies are to submit some oftheir jobs to competition with the private sector. The plan has been controversial,with concerns as to whether it would save the government money and whether theprivate sector could provide the same quality of service in certain areas. Thecompetitive sourcing initiative was considered during the Interior appropriationsprocess as well during the appropriations process for other departments and agencies,and also is being examined by authorizing committees.", "For agencies funded by the Interior appropriations bill, concern has centered on the National Park Service and the Forest Service. According to one Park Servicesource, more than 11,000 of the Park Service's 19,000 jobs were judged to be not\"inherently governmental\" and are therefore being considered under the initiative,with 1,708 possibly outsourced. (16) The ForestService was reported to be consideringa plan that would allow the private sector to compete for more than a quarter of itsapproximately 40,000 jobs. (17)", "The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concern that the agencies are spending significant sums on outsourcing, although the Administrationdid not request or receive funds for this purpose. In particular, there was concern thatthe Forest Service was reprogramming money without approval. In its report, theHouse Committee on Appropriations expressed concern about the \"massive scale,seemingly arbitrary targets, and considerable costs associated with this initiative\"( H.Rept. 108-195 , p.9). ", "The House and Senate included language on outsourcing in their Interior appropriations bills. The House-passed bill sought to bar agencies from using fundsin the bill to begin new outsourcing studies. The President threatened to veto the billif this language was included. The Senate rejected a floor amendment that, like theHouse-passed language, would have prohibited funds in the bill from being used toinitiate competitive sourcing studies. Instead, the Senate adopted an amendment torequire the Secretary of the Interior to report annually to Congress on outsourcing. Among other issues, the reports were to address the numbers of outsourcingcompetitions announced and completed; the costs, savings, and improvements inservices that result from contracting out; and the number of federal employeesimpacted by outsourcing. ", "The final language enacted for FY2004 outlined spending limits for outsourcing studies of agencies during FY2004. Specifically, it limited Forest Service spendingon outsourcing studies to no more than $5.0 million. DOI was capped at $2.5 millionand DOE was limited to $0.5 million unless Congress approves the reprogrammingof additional funds under revised reprogramming guidelines printed in the jointexplanatory statement of the conference report. For outsourcing studies involvingmore than 10 federal employees, a contracted function must be less costly to thegovernment by 10% or $10.0 million, whichever is lower.", "The FY2004 law also required the DOI agencies and DOE programs funded by the bill, as well as the Forest Service, to report annually to Congress on theiroutsourcing activities. As had been recommended by the Senate, the reports are tocontain detailed information including the numbers of outsourcing competitionsannounced and completed; the costs, savings, and improvements in services thatresult from contracting out; and the number of federal employees impacted byoutsourcing. For FY2004, the agencies are to submit a detailed competitive sourcingproposal to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees within 60 days ofenactment of the bill. Beginning in FY2005, the agencies are required to specify intheir annual budget requests the level of funding requested for outsourcing studies. In adopting the outsourcing language, conferees expressed support for the\"underlying principle\" of the Administration's outsourcing initiative, but concern thatthe effort was being conducted too fast for its costs and implications to be understoodand \"in violation\" of guidelines on reprogramming funds. ", "Klamath River Basin. TheFY2004 law did not contain a provision prohibiting Interior Department funding ofthe Klamath Fishery Management Council. Such a provision had been included inthe House Committee reported and House-passed bills, but no similar provision wasincluded by the Senate. In addition, a House floor amendment to prohibit farmersfrom planting certain crops on new leases in two Klamath Basin national wildliferefuges was defeated. The House provisions sparked considerable controversyamong interested parties. They relate to an on-going conflict in the Klamath RiverBasin over water allocations for farmers in the Klamath River Project area in theUpper Basin and water needed to avoid harm to three federally listed fish species. The Bureau of Reclamation (Department of the Interior) is currently operating theKlamath Project under a one-year operations plan announced in April 2003 while itcontinues to work on completing a 10-year operations plan. The FWS and NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries completed consultationon a 2002 10-year plan on May 31, 2002; however, the Bureau rejected the FWS andNational Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)/NOAA Fisheries biological opinions onits 10-year operating plan and stated that it would comply for the immediate futurebut also requested new consultation.

On July 17, 2003,the House rejected an amendment to restrict the use of funds by the Forest Serviceor BLM to administer any action related to bear baiting, except to prevent thepractice. No other action was taken on the issue in the remainder of the FY2004appropriations process. Bear baiting is a hunting practice involving the intentionalfeeding of bears for the purpose of enticing bears to a particular area to be hunted. A significant factor cited by opponents of the amendment was the generalpre-eminence of states in controlling wildlife within their boundaries, andpreservation of their major role in wildlife management on federal lands. Certainprocedural questions relating to hearings on H.R. 1472 , a bill related toending bear baiting on federal lands, also were raised by Members who objected tothe hearing process. Amendment proponents argued that the practice is cruel andunsportsmanlike, and that banning bear baiting appeared to have little effect on bearpopulations in states that had disallowed it.", " Table 21.
