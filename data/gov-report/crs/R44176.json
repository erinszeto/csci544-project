The Airline Deregulation Act authorized CAB to require carriers to continue providing scheduled service at eligible communities after deregulation, with subsidies if necessary.

At that time, there were 746 eligible communities, including 237 in Alaska and 9 in Hawaii. According to a DOT estimate, nearly 300 of these 746 communities received subsidized service under EAS at some point between 1979 and 2016.

Certain features of the program may have contributed to the challenge of controlling costs: ", "Few carriers may bid for any particular EAS contract. Although in some instances two or three carriers may offer proposals in response to an RFP, in some cases there is only one proposal with no competing bid, providing little incentive for the carrier to minimize its subsidy request. Subsidy cost is not among the four major factors DOT is required by statute to consider when evaluating bids. DOT is required by statute to consider the views of the community when selecting a carrier to provide subsidized service. If more than one carrier is proposing to offer service, local officials are under no obligation to favor the proposal that entails the lowest cost to the federal government. The law does not limit a community's subsidized flights to a single route. More than 30 of the 174 EAS communities had subsidized flights to more than one hub airport in FY2018. Although eligibility for EAS service, except in Alaska and Hawaii, depends in part on an airport's distance from the nearest large or medium hub airport, the law does not specify that the EAS-subsidized flights must serve that hub. In an unknown number of cases, subsidized flights link EAS communities with more distant airports rather than with the nearest hub, perhaps at greater cost to the government. For technical reasons or because of its own operational needs, a carrier may utilize a plane for an EAS flight that is larger than necessary for the traffic on the route, in curring high per-passenger costs. DOT estimates that 20% to 25% of EAS communities are served by aircraft that are larger than passenger numbers might require. According to 2014 testimony by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), EAS flights, on average, had 49% of their seats filled with paying passengers in 2013, versus an average of 83% for all domestic flights. Costs per passenger may be high because air carriers may lack an incentive to maximize the number of passengers on a flight. Once a carrier and DOT have agreed on the subsidy amount for a flight, the carrier is free to set fares as it desires. The carrier may find it more profitable to charge high fares to relatively few passengers than to maximize the passenger load with lower fares.

This was caused by the uncertainty of Lancaster's eligibility during the multiple short-term extensions of EAS authority before the passage of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which made DOT unable to go through the regular request-for-proposal process. After Lancaster's eligibility was confirmed in the FAA Reauthorization Act, DOT issued a request for proposals with local cost sharing. A one-year cost-share agreement for Kamuela was reached among DOT, the County of Hawaii, and the selected air carrier, with the County of Hawaii paying 5% of the subsidy cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Community and Regional Choice Pilot Programs", "paragraphs": ["Section 405 of Vision 100\u2014Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act directed DOT to establish certain Community and Regional Choice Programs to provide communities with alternatives to traditional EAS service. In the following year, 2004, DOT established two pilot programs: the Alternate Essential Air Service Pilot Program (Alternate EAS) and the Community Flexibility Pilot Program. All communities receiving subsidized EAS at the time of application can participate.", "Alternate EAS (AEAS) allows communities to forgo subsidized EAS for a prescribed amount of time in exchange for a grant to spend on options that may better suit their transportation needs. These options include more frequent air service with smaller aircraft, on-demand air taxi service, scheduled or on-demand surface transportation, or purchasing an aircraft. The maximum grant amount may not exceed the annual EAS subsidy at the time of application to the program. Participating communities still need to meet the statutory eligibility criteria for EAS. Currently, AEAS has seven participants: Beckley, WV; Crescent City, CA; Macon, GA; Manistee/Ludington, MI; Page, AZ; Parkersburg, WV/Marietta, OH; and Tupelo, MS. All are using the proceeds to secure public charter service.", "The Community Flexibility Pilot Program allows as many as 10 communities that are receiving subsidized EAS to forgo EAS for 10 years in exchange for a grant equal to no more than two years' EAS subsidy. The grant can be used for a wide range of airport projects. Currently, Visalia, CA, which entered the program in March 2017, is the only participating community. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues and Options", "paragraphs": ["The rate of increase in EAS spending remains a central issue of concern to Congress. However, program spending should be examined in conjunction with the number of communities served. According to a GAO report, 95 communities received subsidized EAS service in 1995 and 150 in 2008. In 2018, this number was 174 (see Appendix A ).", "Nevertheless, the growth rate of average subsidy per EAS community over the years has been significant. The average annual EAS subsidy in non-Alaska communities rose from $1 million per community in FY2002 to $2.6 million in FY2018.", "In addition to multiple contributing factors previously discussed, government regulations may affect the provision of air service to small communities. For example, a 2013 FAA pilot qualification rule increased the qualification requirements for airline pilots. Many pilots working for regional airlines did not meet the new minimum qualifications. The rules appear to have forced small carriers to raise salaries in order to attract qualified pilots, potentially raising EAS subsidy costs as well. ", "In a 2009 report, GAO offered a number of options for modifying the EAS program:", "limiting program eligibility to communities participating as of a specified date; allowing carriers more flexibility on type of aircraft and/or service frequency; awarding long-term EAS agreements and incorporating financial incentives; allowing renegotiation of EAS agreements; consolidating EAS flights at regional airports; and focusing EAS service on the most remote communities.", "The first three options were adopted and included in federal laws. GAO also suggested that a multimodal approach to provide financial assistance could potentially be more responsive to communities' needs. It reiterated this recommendation in its 2014 report, suggesting that multimodal solutions, such as bus service to large airports or air taxi service to connect communities, could be more cost-effective than the current EAS program. ", "Despite the changes that have been made to limit communities' eligibility for EAS and to permit the use of smaller aircraft, it appears that eligible communities, air carriers, and DOT may lack incentives to minimize program expenditures. The changes adopted in recent years, including in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, have not proven effective in controlling program costs, in part because communities that fail to meet certain eligibility requirements almost always are granted waivers upon request. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 provides that certain eligibility requirements will not apply to a number of these communities as long as they meet certain criteria.", "Appendix A.
