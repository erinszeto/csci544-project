This report compares major provisions in House-passed H.R. 3221 and Senate-passed H.R. 6. Key legislative challenges remain. First, there are significant differences between the two bills. Second, because the House and Senate have passed different measures, further action will be required in at least one chamber before a conference committee could be arranged. Third, concerns about certain oil and natural gas provisions, and the lack of measures to support increased oil and gas production, have led the Administration to threaten to veto each bill. Highlights of major provisions include:", "Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). The Senate bill would set a modified standard that starts at 8.5 billion gallons in 2008 and rises to 36 billion gallons by 2022. The House bill has no RFS provision. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE). The Senate bill would set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks by model year 2020. The House bill has no CAFE provision. Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS). The House bill would set a minimum standard that would start at 2.75% in 2010 and rise steadily to a peak of 15% in 2020. The Senate bill has no RPS provision. Offshore Oil and Gas Royalties. The House bill would establish royalties, or alternative payments, for certain federal leases established in 1998 and 1999. The Senate bill has no provision. Repeal of Oil and Gas Tax Incentives. The House bill would obtain tax revenue offsets by reducing subsidies for oil and natural gas production. The Senate bill has no provision. Renewable Energy Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC). The House bill would extend the PTC for four years, and expand it to include some additional resources. The Senate bill has no provision. Other Tax Incentives. The House bill would extend several investment tax credits covering solar energy and energy efficiency in residential and commercial sectors. The Senate bill has no provision. Energy Efficiency Equipment Standards. Key differences involve standards for residential refrigerators, freezers, refrigerator-freezers, metal halide lamps, and commercial walk-in coolers and freezers. Loan Guarantees. The House bill would give new loan authority to a wider variety of projects.

Further action will be needed on at least one of the two bills in at least one of the two chambers. For example, one option could be that the Senate takes up H.R. 3221 , amends it however it wishes, and then pass the bill as the Senate version of H.R. 3221 .

In a June 12, 2007, Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 6 , the Administration expressed several points of opposition to the Senate bill. Its primary concerns involved issues related to oil and natural gas. The Administration stated that the bill \"does nothing to increase domestic supplies of oil and natural gas.\" Moreover, it threatened to veto the bill if it retained a price gouging provision, which it feels would lead to problematic gasoline price controls. Another veto threat was focused on the proposal to subject foreign oil cartels to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. Additional concerns were identified. One concern focused on the explicit 35 mpg fuel economy target in the CAFE provision and the proposal to set standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. For the RFS provision, the Administration strongly urged expansion to include fossil-based alternative fuels. Regarding loan guarantees, the Administration stated opposition to loosening of controls over program size and \"special\" treatment that would allow guarantees for biofuels projects to be increased to from 80% to cover up to 100% of project costs.", "In an August 3, 2007, Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2776 and H.R. 3221 , the Administration expressed several points of opposition to the House bill. Its primary concerns were focused on oil and natural gas. It stated that because the two bills \"would lead to less domestic oil and gas production, higher energy costs, and higher taxes, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto these bills.\" Other concerns included the proposed repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for the oil and gas industry, the application of royalty requirements for certain offshore oil and gas leases issued in 1998 and 1999, increased authorization for clean renewable energy bonds, and expansion of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Informal House-Senate Negotiations", "paragraphs": ["After the House completed action on H.R. 3221 , informal bipartisan negotiations over the omnibus energy bills began between the House and Senate.

In November 2007, EIA issued a report on the impacts of the RPS and oil and gas provisions in H.R. 3221 . On December 1, 2007, the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources stated that the House Leadership's intent to include an RPS led him to cease negotiations. Further, on December 3, 2007, the White House announced that it may veto the negotiated bill, if it includes an RPS, oil tax increases, and certain other provisions. On December 4, 2007, United Press International reported that, in a press conference, DOE Secretary Bodman warned against the inclusion of \"a narrow, one-size-fits-all renewable portfolio standard,\" and said \"taxes should not be raised or tax breaks reversed for the oil and gas sector.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparing the House and Senate Bills", "paragraphs": ["This report compares the major provisions of the House-passed version of H.R. 3221 and the Senate-passed version of H.R. 6 .
