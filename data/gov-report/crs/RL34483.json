The law represents a compromise between provisions that were included in two bills introduced in the 110th Congress: H.R. 5524 and S. 2982.

Unlike prior law, P.L. 110-378 enables HHS to reallot any unused BCP funds from one state to other states and permits youth to remain in BCP and TLP shelters for a longer period. Another change made by the law requires HHS to regularly submit a report to Congress that describes the incidence and prevalence of runaway and homeless youth. The law also directs the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on the process by which HHS awards BCP, TLP, and SOP grants.", "The provisions of P.L. 110-378 reflect issues raised by policymakers and advocates about RHYA during the reauthorization process. One issue was the amount of funding allocated to grantees under the three direct-service programs. Grantees expressed the concern that although Congress has periodically increased funding authorization for these programs, funding for individual grantees has remained relatively stable over time.

Witnesses described \"disconnected youth\" as those youth who have weak social networks of family, friends, and communities that can provide assistance such as employment connections, health insurance coverage, housing, tuition and other financial assistance, and emotional support. They also discussed measurable characteristics to indicate whether youth are disconnected, such as the lack of high school or college attendance coupled with not having a job over a specific period of time (e.g., one year).", "Runaway and homeless youth are vulnerable to becoming disconnected because of separation from their families, absence from school, and non-participation in the economy. Family conflict\u2014rooted in abuse and neglect, school problems, and drug and alcohol abuse\u2014can compel youth to leave home. Family disconnectedness is also evident among many runaway and homeless youth involved in the foster care system. These youth are brought to the attention of child welfare services because of incidents of abuse and neglect. Further, youth \"aging out\" of the foster care system experience homelessness at a greater rate than their counterparts in the general population due, in part, to family disconnectedness. Some gay and lesbian youth also experience family disassociation when they come out about their sexuality.", "Some runaway and homeless youth spend time out of school while they are away from a permanent home. The FY2007 NEO-RHYMIS survey indicated that about 20% of youth were not attending school regularly before entering the Basic Center Program. Of youth in the Transitional Living Program, 21% had dropped out of school. Some homeless youth face barriers to attending school because of transportation problems and the absence of parents and guardians who can provide records and permission for youth to participate in school activities. Finally, some runaway and homeless youth are removed from the formal economy and resort to illegal activity, including stealing and selling drugs in exchange for cash. Other such youth are too young to work legally or experience mental health and other challenges that make working difficult.", "The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 seeks to fund research projects that focus on connecting youth to work and school. The act amends RHYA to require HHS to give priority to research, evaluation, demonstration, and service projects that increase access to education and career pathways for runaway and homeless youth. These projects must be intended to help decrease high school dropout rates, increase rates of attaining a secondary school diploma or its equivalent, or increase placement and retention in postsecondary education or advanced workforce training programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
