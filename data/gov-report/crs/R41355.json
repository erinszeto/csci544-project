The ESEA was initially enacted in 1965 (P.L. 89-10), and was most recently amended and reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB; P.L. 107-110 ), which authorized virtually all ESEA programs through FY2008.", "The Blueprint indicates that it builds on reforms already being implemented, which are being supported through funding initiatives included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ). The ARRA created three sources of federal funding that have, in part, shaped ED's Blueprint for reauthorization: the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, the Race to the Top Program (RTTT), and the Investing in Innovation Fund (i3). The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund provided funding to states when many were experiencing budgetary shortfalls to help increase state support for elementary and secondary education and public institutions of higher education (IHEs). From the $53.6 billion made available under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, $5 billion was reserved for the Secretary of Education to implement three competitive grant programs: RTTT, the RTTT Assessment Program, and i3. These programs are particularly relevant to some of the priorities identified in the Blueprint .", "The Blueprint outlines five key priorities: ", "1. College- and Career-Ready Students includes a focus on improving standards for all students, supporting the development of better assessments, and providing students with a well-rounded education. 2. Great Teachers and Leaders in Every School focuses on effective teachers and principals, the distribution of effective teachers and leaders, and teacher and leader preparation and recruitment. 3. Equity and Opportunity for All Students includes a focus on rigorous and fair accountability, meeting the needs of diverse learners, and resource equity. 4. Raise the Bar and Reward Excellence focuses on achieving these goals through continuing RTTT, supporting public school choice, and promoting a \"culture of career readiness and success.\" 5. Promote Innovation and Continuous Improvement includes a focus on \"fostering innovation and accelerating success,\" supporting local innovations, and supporting student success. ", "These five priorities and their associated foci are discussed in greater detail in the Blueprint . However, within the Blueprint , the topics highlighted under each of the priorities are not consistently discussed in the same order as the priorities, nor are they consistently discussed under broad headings that necessarily match the priorities under which they are initially discussed. Thus, Table A-1 in this report provides a crosswalk between ED's priorities that are briefly discussed at the beginning of the Blueprint and a more detailed discussion of the specific elements of ED's reauthorization proposal.", "It is often the case that when Administrations release an overview document outlining plans for reauthorizing major legislation, the approach is thematic in nature. The Blueprint is a document that generally addresses themes and priorities, and details associated with the design of new strategies, programs, and provisions are provided in varying levels of depth, and sometimes not at all. The Blueprint has received considerable attention and some regard it as a starting point for ESEA reauthorization discussions. This report has been prepared in response to considerable congressional demand for a document that helps map the proposals in the Blueprint against the ESEA. In preparing this document, we have relied heavily on the Blueprint itself, and in some instances have drawn on other sources, such as the Administration's FY2011 budget proposal when it explicitly elaborates on proposals in the Blueprint . ", "Throughout this report, we have attempted to identify where the Blueprint offers precise proposals, and where a general direction is suggested. Under the latter scenario, there may be instances where we believe a direction is implied when it is not. That said, we have attempted to be thorough and to carefully describe the basis for our depictions of Administration proposals. This document reflects our attempt to more directly map themes introduced in the Blueprint against current law, and since the alignment is not perfect, the exercise requires some judgment. ", "As has been noted, this report principally examines ED's ESEA reauthorization proposal and, where appropriate, draws comparisons between the proposal and current law. The report is organized around the broad themes presented in the Blueprint , beginning with College- and Career-Ready Students and ending with Additional Cross-Cutting Priorities. The majority of the headings included in the report reflect those used in the Blueprint . Headings that appear in italics are CRS headings that have been included to either help frame the overall discussion of a broad theme or clarify whether provisions being discussed are based on current law or the Blueprint . Wherever possible, comparisons between the proposal and the ESEA are drawn for elements included in the Blueprint . Some sections of the Blueprint did not provide sufficient detail to make relevant comparisons to current policy in the ESEA. The comparative discussions covering the individual elements of the proposal, therefore, differ substantially in length and detail depending on the extent to which ED provided detail in the Blueprint . In some instances, other relevant sources, such as the FY2011 budget request, were used to provide additional information and analysis of a particular part of the Blueprint proposal. For some elements of the proposal, however, there was little that could be said beyond restating what was included in the Blueprint or budget request. ", "The examination of the Blueprint is followed by several appendix tables. There has been some demand for a concise side-by-side comparison of key provisions of the Blueprint to current law. Table A-2 provides a summary of similarities and differences of key provisions; however, it does not include the same level of detail as the discussion in the text and does not discuss every section of the Blueprint . To demonstrate how the provisions included in the Blueprint could affect line-item appropriations for ESEA, Table A-3 examines the consolidation of programs proposed by the Administration's FY2011 budget request and the Blueprint to identify which programs would be consolidated; the program type (e.g., formula or competitive grants) for current and proposed programs; the FY2010 funding level for the program; and the proposed funding levels for FY2011. As a companion to Table A-3 , Table A-4 examines funding for ESEA programs that would not have been subject to consolidation under the FY2011 budget request, including the types of grants awarded under each program. Finally, Table A-5 lists ESEA programs that were slated for elimination under the Administration's FY2011 budget request.

Standards, Assessments, and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Over the last decade, more attention has been focused on strategies that emphasize accountability in elementary and secondary education. These strategies generally require the following components: (1) the development of academic standards that aim to provide a clear and consistent understanding of what students are expected to learn across grades and subject areas; (2) the adoption of \"standards-based instruction\" that is aligned to the academic standards; and (3) the use of test-based accountability to measure students' progress toward meeting the academic standards. Under accountability systems, schools are typically rewarded for their success in boosting student achievement or face consequences for failing to do so.", "With the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act, new provisions regarding standards, assessments, and accountability were incorporated into the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. These provisions built upon those already included in the ESEA, focusing specifically on holding schools, local educational agencies (LEAs), and states accountable for the academic achievement of all students. The NCLB required all states to develop an accountability system featuring state-developed content and performance standards and assessments for reading/language arts (hereafter referred to as language arts) and mathematics in grades 3 through 8 and for one grade in grades 10 through 12. The NCLB required states to establish benchmarks for the percentage of students who will score at the proficient level in language arts and mathematics based on the ultimate goal of having all students reaching the proficient level (as defined by the state) in language arts and mathematics by the end of the 2013-2014 school year. Each year, schools and LEAs are held accountable for student proficiency on the required assessments, student participation in the required assessments, and student performance on one additional academic indicator. How well a school or LEA does with respect to these requirements determines whether a school or LEA makes adequate yearly progress (AYP). Schools and LEAs that fail to make AYP are subject to a series of outcome accountability requirements, including corrective action and restructuring.", "Under the Blueprint , many of the current requirements regarding standards, assessments, and accountability would be altered. Most notably, the Administration has indicated that it would eliminate the concept of AYP, require standards to be developed in language arts and mathematics for grades 3 through 12, alter assessment requirements, and modify the actions required when students in a school or LEA do not meet their performance targets. In addition, the Administration would eliminate the goal of all students reaching the proficient level in language arts and mathematics by the end of the 2013-2014 school year, replacing it with the goal of all students being college- and career-ready by 2020.

It also notes that Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization must \"follow the lead of the nation's governors\" to focus on state-developed, college- and career-ready standards and related assessments. Finally, this section of the Blueprint discusses rewarding schools making significant progress, bringing change to low-performing schools, and addressing \"persistent gaps\" in student academic achievement and graduation rates.

Prior to enactment of the NCLB, the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (IASA; P.L. 103-382 ) required states to adopt standards and assessments in the subjects of language arts and mathematics at three grade levels\u2014at least once in each of the grade ranges of 3-5, 6-9, and 10-12. States that wanted to remain eligible for Title I-A grants were required to develop or adopt curriculum content standards, as well as academic achievement standards and assessments tied to the standards. These requirements were retained and expanded under the NCLB.", "Under the NCLB, states were also required to develop and adopt standards and assessments in the subjects of mathematics and language arts in each of grades 3-8 by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. In addition, states were required to adopt standards in science (at three grade levels) by the end of the 2005-2006 school year and adopt corresponding assessments by the end of the 2007-2008 school year. States were also required to establish achievement standards that include at least three performance levels for all students\u2014advanced, proficient, and partially proficient (or basic). State assessments aligned with the standards are used to determine students' performance levels.", "Blueprint . Under the Blueprint , states would be required to adopt state-developed standards in language arts and mathematics that build across grade levels to ensure that students graduate from high school college- and career-ready. According to ED, states would be required to adopt standards for grades 3-12 for language arts and mathematics. As discussed previously, under current law states were required to adopt standards for grades 3-8 and for at least one grade in grades 10-12. States would now also be required to adopt assessments aligned with these standards (see subsequent discussion under \" Assessing Achievement \"). In addition, according to ED the high school assessment would now have to be used to determine whether students were college- and career-ready, as opposed to assessing a student's language arts or mathematics proficiency at a specific grade level.", "States would have two options for developing these new standards. States could upgrade their existing standards and have them certified by a four-year public university system to ensure that if a student completes the required standards, the student would not need remedial coursework upon admittance into the public university system. The second option would be to work with other states to create state-developed \"common standards\" that build toward college- and career-readiness. Regardless of how they are developed, the new standards would have to be based on evidence indicating what skills and knowledge are required at each grade level, so that students would be on track to graduate from high school college- and career-ready. While the Blueprint indicates that being prepared to do college-level work without remediation would define being college-ready, it does not provide a similar indication of what would constitute being career-ready or how standards for career-readiness would be established.", "With respect to the option of adopting state-developed common standards, there is a grassroots effort currently being led by the National Governor's Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers to develop common standards for language arts and mathematics in grades K-12 that build toward college- and career-readiness. The initiative, commonly known as the Common Core State Standards Initiative, is supported by 48 states and the District of Columbia. Once the final version is released in 2010, it will be up to the states to decide whether they want to adopt and implement the standards. It is possible that not all 48 states and the District of Columbia will choose to adopt the standards, even though they participated in the development process and provided feedback on the standards. For example, education leaders in Massachusetts and Minnesota have expressed concerns that the standards developed through the Common Core Initiative will not be as high as the standards currently used in each of their respective states. In addition, states adopting the standards are required to adopt all of them, but they may add an additional 15% to the standards to reflect state priorities and interests. Thus, the standards may not be 100% \"common,\" even among the states that adopt them. While the federal government has not been involved with the Common Core Initiative, it has been supportive of the effort. Presumably, the work of the Common Core Initiative is what ED envisions many states adopting in order to be in compliance with the proposed Title I-A accountability requirements.", "In addition to having standards and assessments for language arts and mathematics, states would be required to continue implementing statewide science standards and aligned assessments in specific grade spans. Under the provisions included in the Blueprint , states would be permitted to include the science assessment and other statewide assessments in the accountability system. While current law allows states to administer statewide assessments in subjects other than language arts and mathematics, neither these assessments nor the science assessment have been included in the accountability system required under Title I-A for determining adequate yearly progress (AYP). As ED proposes the elimination of AYP, it appears that ED would allow states to develop new academic accountability systems that include more subjects than language arts and mathematics provided that student performance evaluated using statewide assessments for any subjects included in the accountability system.", "Current Law . Under current law, states are required to develop and adopt statewide English language proficiency standards based on the domains of speaking, listening, reading, and writing for English language learners (ELLs) that are aligned with the achievement of state academic content and student academic achievement standards required under Title I-A. ", "Blueprint . The Blueprint would require states to develop and adopt statewide English language proficiency standards that are aligned with the new college- and career-readiness standards states would be required to develop so that they \"reflect the academic language necessary to master the state's content standards.\" Other issues related to ELLs are discussed in a later section, \" Meeting the Needs of English Learners and Other Diverse Learners .\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rigorous and Fair Accountability and Support at Every Level", "paragraphs": ["Current Law . The NCLB strengthened the accountability provisions of the ESEA, Title I-A over what was required under the IASA by requiring states to demonstrate in their state plans that they have a single, statewide accountability system applicable to all elementary and secondary schools and LEAs in the state. Each state's accountability system is required to be based on the academic assessments and other academic indicators it uses to measure academic progress. LEAs are required to annually review the status of each public school in making AYP toward state standards of academic achievement; and state education agencies (SEAs) are required to annually review the status of each LEA in making AYP.", "Under the ESEA, AYP is defined primarily on the basis of multiple aggregations of student scores on state assessments of academic achievement. State AYP standards must also include at least one additional academic indicator. In the case of high schools, this additional indicator must be the graduation rate; for elementary and middle schools, the attendance rate is often used as the additional indicator. The additional indicators may not be employed in a way that would reduce the number of schools or LEAs identified as failing to meet AYP standards.", "AYP calculations must be disaggregated\u2014that is, determined separately for several demographic groups as well as for an \"all students\" group. The specified groups include economically disadvantaged students, limited English proficient (LEP) students, students with disabilities, and students in major racial and ethnic groups. However, student groups need not be considered if their number is so small that results would not be statistically significant or the identities of students might be divulged (i.e., there is a minimum group size before disaggregation occurs). In order to make AYP, at least 95% of students overall and 95% of each demographic group must participate in assessments. Schools or LEAs meet AYP standards only if they meet the required threshold levels of performance on assessments, other academic indicators, and test participation with respect to all of the designated student groups that meet the minimum group size criterion selected by the state.", "Each year, states and LEAs are required to prepare and disseminate report cards containing academic achievement and other data. States are also required to prepare annual reports for submission to the Secretary. The Secretary, in turn, is required to compile national and state-level data for presentation in annual reports to Congress. While AYP determinations must be made with respect to every public school and LEA in a state that receives Title I-A funds, states vary in the extent to which they apply sanctions to non-Title I-A schools or LEAs.", "Blueprint . ED has publicly stated that it would no longer use the current outcome accountability system based on AYP to determine which schools and LEAs were low-performing. Under the Blueprint , states would be required to ensure that their statewide accountability systems reward schools and LEAs for growth and success. These systems would be required to include \"rigorous interventions\" for the lowest-performing schools and LEAs. Unlike the current accountability requirements under the ESEA, strategies for improving and supporting most schools would be determined at the local level. More specific requirements related to rewarding schools and intervening in low-performing schools are discussed in the next section.", "The Blueprint would require states to have data systems that could collect data needed to determine the progress being made by schools and LEAs in preparing students to be \"college- and career-ready.\" States and LEAs would also be required to make available to the public data on student performance and growth in language arts and mathematics, and student achievement in science; and at the state's discretion, it could make public academic achievement and growth data for other subjects included in the state's accountability system. At the high school level, the public data must also include data on graduation rates, college enrollment rates, and students' need for remediation upon college enrollment. Under current law, data are only required to be collected on graduation rates, and these data must be made public by subgroup. The Blueprint would require that all of the aforementioned data be disaggregated by race, gender, ethnicity, disability status, English learner status, and family income. As previously discussed, under the ESEA, AYP data must be disaggregated by each of these categories except gender for accountability purposes, assuming a minimum group size is met. However, on state (and LEA) report cards, data must also be disaggregated by gender for reporting purposes only. Thus, the gender subgroup could be a new accountability subgroup for which schools and LEAs might be required to take steps to improve performance if gaps exist between male and female students.", "Under the Blueprint , states and LEAs would also be required to collect additional information about \"teaching and learning conditions,\" including data on school climate such as attendance rates for students, teachers, and the school leader; disciplinary incidents; or data generated through student, parent, or staff surveys. While some of these data may currently be reported by some states and LEAs, other data may not be reported regularly. Based on details provided on teachers (see subsequent discussion on teachers), teacher survey data on working conditions and teacher and principal attendance data would have to be published at least once every two years.

It is unclear who would establish the performance targets, the extent to which achievement and growth gains would need to be demonstrated from year to year, and whether targets would be established by working backward from having 100% of all students college- and career-ready or on track to be college- and career-ready by 2020. In addition, it is also unclear what states, LEAs, and schools would be held accountable for in the interim as they develop the college- and career-ready standards and related assessments that would be used for determining whether all students were on track for the 2020 goal.

Under current law, the primary basic structure for AYP under the NCLB is now specified in the authorizing statute as a \"group status model.\" Under the \"group status model,\" a \"uniform bar\" approach is employed: states set a threshold percentage of students at proficient or advanced levels of performance each year that is applicable to all student subgroups of sufficient size to be considered in AYP determinations. The threshold levels of achievement are to be set separately for language arts and mathematics, and may be set separately for each level of K-12 education (i.e., elementary, middle, and high schools).", "In determining whether scores for a group of students are at the required level, the averaging of scores over two to three years is allowed. In addition, the NCLB statute includes an alternative safe harbor provision, under which a school that does not meet the standard AYP requirements may still be deemed as having met AYP if there is a 10% reduction, compared to the previous year, in the number of students in each of the student groups failing to reach the standard requirement, and those groups also make progress on at least one other academic indicator included in the state's AYP standards. This alternative provision adds \"successive group improvement\" as a secondary type of AYP model under the NCLB.", "A third basic type of AYP model, not explicitly mentioned in the NCLB statute, is the individual/cohort growth model. The key characteristic of this model is a focus on the rate of change over time in the level of achievement among cohorts of the same students. Growth models are longitudinal, based on the tracking of the same students as they progress through their K-12 education careers. Although the progress of students is tracked individually, results are typically aggregated when used for accountability purposes. In general, growth models give credit for meeting steps along the way to proficiency in ways that a status model typically does not (e.g., moving from the below-basic level to the basic level).", "In November 2005, the Secretary announced a growth model pilot program under which up to 10 states would be allowed to use growth models to make AYP determinations. In December 2007, the cap on the number of states that could participate in the growth model pilot was lifted by the Secretary. In October 2008, ED issued regulations allowing a state to request authority from the Secretary to incorporate measures of student growth into its definition of AYP. Related non-regulatory guidance released by ED in January 2009 provides detailed discussion of the information and evidence a state needs to provide when requesting the authority to use growth models in its AYP determinations. As of 2010, 15 states included growth models in their definition of AYP. ", "Blueprint . The Blueprint emphasizes that performance would not be judged only on absolute performance and proficiency, and that individual student growth and school progress over time would be taken into account in evaluating performance. Thus, it appears that states, LEAs, and schools would be expected to use growth models in evaluating performance. In order to use growth models, states, LEAs, and schools would need to be able to track student performance over time.

States may also give awards to LEAs that have exceeded their AYP requirements for two or more consecutive years. Under Academic Achievement Award Programs, states may recognize and provide financial awards to teachers or principals in schools that have significantly closed the academic achievement gap or have made AYP for two consecutive years.

If a school does not make AYP for a third year after being identified for school improvement, by the end of the school year the LEA must begin to plan for restructuring while continuing to implement the requirements of corrective action. Restructuring of the school must involve implementation of one of five alternative governance structure options: reopening the school as a charter school, replacing most or all of the school staff, contracting with an education management organization to operate the school, turning the school over to the SEA, or implementing any other \"major restructuring\" of the school's governance structure.

These schools would be identified based on student academic achievement, student growth, and graduation rates. As discussed in greater detail in a subsequent section (see \" School Turnaround Grants \"), ED is currently requiring states to identify the lowest-performing 5% of schools for purposes of the School Improvement Grant (SIG) program.

This could include enrollment in charter schools. Transformation model: This model requires an LEA to implement several strategies. For example, the LEA must implement strategies to increase teacher and school leader effectiveness, including replacing the principal and using teacher and school leader evaluation systems that take student growth into account as a significant factor. It must also implement a research-based instructional program and continuously use data to differentiate instruction to meet the needs of individual students.

Criticism of the use of current Title II-A funds rests on research that calls into question the impact of class-size reduction and the effectiveness of traditional professional development for improving teaching and learning. Specifically, class-size reduction has been shown to have an impact only with very large reductions in class size (larger than is typically the case under the current program). Although most teachers (92%) receive professional development, less than half (43%) receive more than 16 hours of training in their content area each year and a little over half (59%) found such training to be useful in the classroom.
