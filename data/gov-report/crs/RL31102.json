{"id": "RL31102", "title": "Student Loan Repayment for Federal\u00a0Employees", "released_date": "2007-04-06T00:00:00", "summary": ["Under a law enacted in 1990 (P.L. 101-510) and amended in 2000 (P.L. 106-398) and 2003 (P.L. 108-123 and P.L. 108-136), federal agencies may repay portions of the student loans of highly qualified General Schedule (GS) and non-GS (including Foreign Service) employees they seek to recruit and retain. Eligible employees must sign at least a three-year service agreement to remain with their agencies. In return, these employees may receive loan repayments of up to $10,000 per year and up to $60,000 in total from an agency. Various student loans specified in law and authorized by the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Public Health Service Act may be repaid. Concerns about the attractiveness of government service to, and the large amount of student loan indebtedness of, new graduates along with the possibility of a significant number of retirements from the federal government in the next several years underlie student loan repayment programs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published final regulations to implement the original law on January 11, 2001, and final regulations to implement the amendments to the law on July 31, 2001, and April 20, 2004. Executive branch agencies are considering and implementing student loan repayment programs. OPM reported to Congress in May 2006 that 28 executive branch agencies made repayments to 4,171 employees at a cost of some $26.664 million in FY2005. The number of recipients increased by 55.6% and the cost of repayments increased by 77.4% from FY2004 to FY2005.", "In the legislative branch, the Government Accountability Office (GAO, formerly the General Accounting Office), the Government Printing Office (GPO), and the Library of Congress also have authority under the laws stated above to establish student loan repayment programs. Enacted in the 107th Congress, P.L. 107-68 authorized the Senate and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to institute programs, and P.L. 107-117 authorized the U.S. Capitol Police to establish one. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (P.L. 108-7), enacted in the 108th Congress, the House of Representatives has authority to establish a program for its employees, and additional authority was granted to the U.S. Capitol Police to establish a program and to provide tuition reimbursement for employees' ongoing career development education. To date, the Senate, the House, the U.S. Capitol Police, CBO, GAO, GPO, and the Library (not including the Congressional Research Service) have implemented repayment programs.", "In both the executive and legislative branches, questions of how to fund the programs, what the required period of service should be, the criteria for repayment eligibility, and the kinds of program data to be collected will likely continue to be considered as repayment programs are implemented. OPM published proposed changes to the regulations governing repayments in the Federal Register on January 9, 2007. S. 1047, to exempt repayments from income tax, is pending in the Senate.

In April 1989, after an 18-month study, the commission issued its report on rebuilding the federal civil service. Formed in response to \"concern[s] that the federal workforce may be ill-prepared to serve the nation in the 21 st century,\" the commission dedicated itself to \"placing high on the national agenda the need to strengthen the effectiveness of the career services in government.\" A commission task force on recruitment and retention found that inadequate compensation and the unattractiveness of government employment to recent college graduates were among the reasons for the federal government's serious problems in recruiting and retaining a quality workforce.", "At the time that student loan repayments were authorized by Congress, the issues of the attractiveness of government service to and the large amount of student loan indebtedness of new graduates were of particular interest. More recently, the possibility of a significant number of retirements from the federal government in the next several years has joined these issues as a reason underlying student loan repayment programs in the federal government.

In remarks during the hearing, Representative Ford described H.R. 2544 as a \"sort of a GI bill for civil servants.\" OPM Director Constance Newman stated that the agency had \"not given enough consideration to how much this approach would cost or to whether the benefits would justify the cost.\" She also expressed several concerns about the student loan repayment provisions in H.R. 2544 . Those concerns related to:", "not wanting to induce people to work for the government just long enough to qualify for loan repayment and then move elsewhere; consideration of the equity of a recruitment incentive that would have no value for those who have already paid their own way through college; the essential need to limit the coverage to occupations where there is difficulty in\u00a0recruiting or retaining employees with critical skills (identified as scientists and engineers); the need to examine carefully the administrative feasibility of agencies making loan repayments; the lack of a provision on a central regulatory authority to ensure uniformity among the agencies; the inappropriateness of not having an employee repay any loan payments made by the agency if he or she fails to complete the service requirement; and the lack of a limit on how large a repayment commitment could be made.", "The latter three concerns were addressed by provisions that were included in the bill when it was reported to the House. Asked about the appropriateness of a three-year service requirement, Mrs. Newman stated that \"three is probably a fairly standard time,\" but:", "The concern is that we have some assurance that the kinds of people, if you go with this type of approach, actually have an intent to participate in public service, and that they aren't just using this as a vehicle to repay their loans. And whether or not a three year limitation provides enough assurance that you get at least some benefit from having participated in this, I don't know.", "L. Bruce Laingen, executive director of the National Commission on the Public Service, viewed the legislation as a step in \"enriching the talent pool\" of government and as \"a practical way to get young people started on their careers.\" According to Laingen, \"entry level payment in Government is increasingly noncompetitive with the private sector\" and \"combined with slow procedures by Government in hiring on the one hand and students loans to repay on the other, often makes Government even for those who actually seek Government service an unattractive career choice.\"", "Another witness, Consumer Bankers Association special counsel John Dean, noted the significant student loan indebtedness of students with advanced degrees:", "An individual facing this repayment burden may and frequently does feel obliged to seek employment with an employer able to provide the highest level of compensation possible and, in most cases, that is not the Federal Government.", "In order to encourage extended government service, Dean suggested that larger repayments be made for longer years of service. His concerns about the legislation related to the following:", "the need for close examination of existing program regulations to assure that borrower records are appropriately documented, especially for cases where limitations on the maximum repayment amount provided under the program result in a residual amount still owed by the individual student loan borrower; making sure that when a federal check comes in for a student loan it is applied to the correct loan; ensuring that, if the check is for an amount that is less than the amount due on the loan, a note in the computer file will indicate that a second check will be coming, so that an insufficient notice payment will not follow receipt of the first check from the federal government; identifying who will be held accountable for delinquency on the loans if there is a paperwork error and the federal government payment arrives late; and the possibility of precipitating employee delinquency or default on a loan if he or she no longer qualifies for loan repayment because of performance reasons or separation from government service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "House Bill Reported", "paragraphs": ["On February 7, 1990, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service reported the bill to the House, but no further action occurred.

The bill also provided that \"[i]n selecting employees to receive [student loan repayment] benefits ... an agency shall, consistent with the merit system principles set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 2301(b), take into consideration the need to maintain a balanced workforce in which women and members of racial and ethnic minority groups are appropriately represented in Government service.\" Additionally, H.R. 2544 authorized OPM to \"prescribe regulations containing such standards and requirements as [it] considers necessary to provide for reasonable uniformity among programs.\"", "Discussing the need for the legislation, the committee cited the findings of the Volcker Commission, as well as reports published by the Merit Systems Protection Board in May 1988 and the Office of Personnel Management in June 1988, on the federal government's difficulties in recruiting and retaining highly qualified professional, technical, or administrative personnel. According to these reports, pay rates significantly less than those offered by the private sector, a negative image of public service, and lack of information about careers in government were among the reasons inhibiting the federal government from attracting and keeping skilled individuals. The committee report stated that the \"new authority is an attempt to bolster efforts to recruit top-flight candidates for employment with the federal government\" and noted that \"the repayment program would be used as a recruiting tool to attract individuals with critical skills necessary for the agency.\" It acknowledged criticisms that these repayment provisions could \"result in disparate treatment of equally qualified candidates solely on the basis of their form of indebtedness.\" The report expressed the \"committee's opinion that remedies for an otherwise gravely lacking Federal compensation system must be sought wherever the Federal Government can exert unique pressure.\"", "With regard to limitations on the size of the repayments, the committee stated its intent to \"strike a balance\" between the \"extremely high loan indebtedness\" of many college graduates and \"the limited resources available to Federal agencies for new initiatives in programs and employee benefits.\" Further, the committee noted that the loan repayment was \"to apply to indebtedness outstanding at the time an employee enter[ed] into an agreement.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBO Cost Estimate", "paragraphs": ["The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the cost of the student loan repayment program in 1991 would be between $2 and $3 million, with the potential to increase to $10 to $15 million by 1995.

Thus, employees who either have no student loans or who have already repaid their loans would, in essence, be compensated at a lower rate than other employees simply because they do not have a particular form of debt. This type of inequity could have a demoralizing effect on the federal employees not participating in the repayment program ... and create retention problems.... The Federal government should not be in a position of \"rewarding\" students who finance their education through Federal student loans, and penalizing students who chose work or savings to finance their postsecondary education.", "[Create a situation in which] it could be very difficult to regulate effectively the very broad, subjective authority of an agency head to waive a right of recovery against an employee if it would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest.", "DoJ also declined to support student loan repayment. The agency's concerns were that the program would not \"provide a reliable incentive for recruitment and retention because its usefulness depends upon the nature of an individual's indebtedness and thus varies from candidate to candidate.\" Additionally, Justice believed that the program", "would require the Department to treat otherwise similarly situated candidates different solely\u00a0because of their indebtedness or the form of their indebtedness.... Students who worked to pay their tuition would not qualify for benefits nor would those whose parents saved or borrowed to pay for the student's education.
