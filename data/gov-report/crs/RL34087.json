To address disaster housing issues, Congress could opt to consider questions such as the following: how have disaster housing needs traditionally been addressed under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288, as amended)? How did FEMA's approach during Hurricane Katrina differ from previous disasters and why? Should FEMA have pursued expanded authorities at the start of the disaster? Should housing vouchers have been used earlier and tailored to the disaster event? With a substantial amount of available funding provided by Congress, but without requesting expanded authority, FEMA found its sole option was to use traditional disaster housing practices. Those practices, successful for disasters of a historically familiar size, were hard-pressed to meet the unprecedented demands of the Katrina catastrophic disaster.", "There are potential events (New Madrid earthquake or other large natural or terrorist events) that could conceivably produce many of the same challenges presented by the Gulf Coast hurricane season of 2005. Those challenges include large, displaced populations spread across the nation and separated families unable to return because of the loss of not only their homes but also their places of employment. Federal disaster housing policy may remain an issue in the 110th Congress, because, as Hurricane Katrina illustrated, the continued existence of communities after a catastrophic event involves extensive federal assistance issues.", "In the past, FEMA's approaches have turned on practical and theoretical considerations. Practical considerations include the agency's ability to house families and individuals within a short time frame and in proximity to the original disaster, and in the case of Hurricane Katrina, to make contact with the hundreds of thousands of applicants who registered for assistance. Some of the theoretical policy considerations include questions of equity, self-reliance, federalism, and the duration of federal assistance. Those considerations have led to process questions concerning program stewardship and the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse of federal resources.", "The Post-Katrina Act, enacted in October of 2006 (P.L. 109-295), includes changes in FEMA housing policy that provide the President with greater flexibility for meeting the challenges of disasters on a large scale. Also, Public Law 110-28 has eased the cost-share burden for some housing costs and other disaster relief programs. Future debate on the housing issue will also be informed by the report on the National Disaster Housing Strategy (as directed in P.L. 109-295). This Strategy was due to Congress in 2007, but a draft was not provided until late July of 2008. Following a 60-day comment period, a final National Disaster Housing Strategy is scheduled to be presented to Congress.", "This report will be updated as warranted by events."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal involvement in disaster housing can be traced back at least as far as the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927. At that time, federal assistance was indirect, supporting the American National Red Cross (ANRC), championing ANRC fund-raising and donations to support the Red Cross housing/sheltering mission, and generally coordinating assistance.", "In 1951 President Truman built on the ANRC partnership in Executive Order 10221, which delegated the overall responsibility for federal supplemental disaster assistance to the Housing and Home Finance Administration (HHFA). Just over two decades later, President Nixon assigned the emergency housing responsibility to HHFA's successor organization, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Administration officials created HUD's Federal Disaster Assistance Administration (FDAA) to carry out temporary housing and other disaster response and recovery programs. The FDAA was one of the legacy components subsequently absorbed into FEMA in 1979 under Reorganization Plan Number 3. The federal government's temporary disaster housing mission (an integral part of its overall authorities for disaster response and recovery) has remained at FEMA for more than a quarter of a century. On March 1, 2003 FEMA became a part of the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with the Homeland Security Act.", "The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-288 , as amended) authorizes the President to provide temporary housing and other disaster response and recovery activities. Through executive orders this authority has been delegated to FEMA, and other federal departments or agencies as assigned by FEMA. This act authorized discrete programs, including the Individual and Households Program (IHP), along with a variety of programs intended to address the unmet needs resulting from a major disaster of families, individuals, and state and local governments.", "Assessing the performance of government at every level to respond to disaster victims who need housing assistance involves consideration of the continuum of options available to FEMA in its sheltering and housing mission. FEMA traditionally uses two separate Stafford Act authorities to carry out this mission\u2014Section 403 authorities for emergency sheltering and Section 408 for temporary housing. Distinct units within FEMA implement these housing authorities. The 403 provisions are administered by the Public Assistance (Infrastructure) Branch in the Disaster Assistance Directorate (formerly Recovery Division), while the 408 provisions are under the purview of the Individual Assistance Branch within that same directorate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stafford Act Section 403", "paragraphs": ["Section 403 provides for general federal assistance to meet immediate threats to life and property. This aid may include medicine, food and other consumables, and work and services performed on public or private land. It is the work and services category that is further defined to include debris removal, search and rescue services, emergency medical services, emergency mass care, and emergency shelter. The assistance provided by states and/or FEMA immediately following a disaster is usually referred to as \"emergency shelter.\" Emergency sheltering can take a variety of forms, some of which were adapted to meet the special needs following Hurricane Katrina."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Traditional Stafford Act Sheltering/Housing", "paragraphs": ["This type of 403 assistance can take the form of mass shelters (such as those run by the Red Cross and designated by local governments), cruise ships (used for the first time after Hurricane Katrina), emergency group sites (using manufactured housing), rental assistance, and other supporting services paid for by state governments and reimbursed by FEMA. While elements of 403 are occasionally employed for disaster response, the sheltering provision is rarely used on a vast scale. The emergency aid in Section 403 is generally cost-shared, like other elements of the Stafford Act, on a 75% federal share, 25% state share. Since 403 is emergency sheltering, this program is used to house victims immediately and does not include a test for eligibility before shelter is provided, unlike Section 408. Help under Section 403 generally is short term in nature and is provided in facilities close to the disaster area.", "The Katrina Experience . Due to the unusually severe, widespread destruction, and dispersal of victims caused by Hurricane Katrina, Section 403 shelters were funded throughout the nation. Accordingly, FEMA issued disaster-specific guidance and other supporting documents delineating section 403 eligibility for the multitude of states involved in this unique catastrophic event. Though 403 sheltering aid is intended to be limited term help, after Katrina those limits were stretched due to the magnitude of the event. That stretching also included a 100% federal share for the emergency sheltering costs for all states hosting FEMA evacuees for up to 12 months, though shorter leases were encouraged."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Traditional Mass Shelters", "paragraphs": ["In 2006 FEMA and the ANRC entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that specifically references their coordination of emergency mass care. They formerly also had been the two parties charged with the responsibility for carrying out Emergency Support Function (ESF) #6 - Mass Care, in the National Response Plan (NRP). The NRP was the federal government's overall framework to allocate resources and coordinate the federal response following a major disaster event. Under the new National Response Framework, ESF #6 has expanded to include housing and human services. Due to that expansion, DHS/FEMA is now the lead for the function. But regardless of that framework, the great majority of the hundreds of shelters used following Katrina (and most disasters) were managed by the ANRC. In addition, many other independent shelters were and continue to be run by state and local governments and non-governmental organizations.", "The Katrina Experience . The shared responsibility in the NRP for mass care was a change from the past operational practices under the Federal Response Plan (FRP), which identified the Red Cross as the sole lead for the function. Shared responsibilities had begun prior to Katrina, but this disaster was the most strenuous test of this new arrangement. In the context of the Hurricane Katrina experience, the quantity and quality of the available emergency shelter space has been questioned by various reports, including the House Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina Report, which noted that \"State and local governments made inappropriate selections of shelters of last resort. The lack of a regional database of shelters contributed to an inefficient and ineffective evacuation and sheltering process.\" The committee also acknowledged the difficulty of the task. The report noted that some experts believed that the shelter system eventually built up over the opening weeks of the Katrina disaster, with the inherent coordination that was necessary, was similar to \"opening a Fortune 500 company in a couple days' time.\"", "FEMA provided to the states and their shelter partners disaster-specific- guidance that listed, in great detail, the costs that would be eligible for reimbursement. Despite the guidelines, the ANRC and others involved in sheltering still coped with significant questions raised by the scope of the event. Emergency shelters are dependent not only on adequate space but also on many other logistical concerns including health and safety, the ability to serve special needs populations, and the availability of trained volunteers to staff these facilities. In the case of Hurricane Katrina, the size and scope of this disaster was truly unprecedented in comparison to other large events; as such, the disaster strained the traditional shelter system.", "As noted above, emergency shelters funded under Section 403 authority are intended to be temporary housing solutions. The decision by the Administration to accelerate the closing of the emergency shelters and move disaster victims to more suitable housing situations by October 15, 2005, about six weeks after the hurricane, meant that many families and individuals had to quickly find housing alternatives. At its peak, the post-Katrina mass shelter network provided shelter for over 273,000 evacuees. Although charting such an ambitious goal did speed up the emptying of the shelters, it also meant that alternative forms of housing were needed prior to the registration of evacuees with FEMA, and before any individuals and/or families could be presented with other options for their long term housing goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cruise Ships", "paragraphs": ["The use of cruise ships as emergency shelters had reportedly been considered by FEMA officials as early as 1989 (following a disaster in the U.S. Virgin Islands). However, this form of shelter had never actually been employed. For island disasters, and in coastal areas in particular, cruise ships were considered to be a strategically valuable form of shelter that could be brought rapidly to remote locations. Despite arguments for their use, however, no such contracts had previously been let prior to Katrina.", "The Katrina Experience . Given the challenges posed by Katrina, FEMA chose to use the cruise ship alternative and asked the Navy to charter these ships. The ships' most useful capabilities were to house both victims and relief workers in private rooms in close proximity to the disaster area, and to have on-site feeding facilities. The ships offered the possibility that some of the victims of the disaster could be a part of the rebuilding process by giving them access to the area where the work was being conducted. For a catastrophic disaster, this is a serious concern, particularly when a large work force is arriving in an area that has had a mass evacuation coupled with the destruction of rental units. Although housing shared by victims and workers arguably has benefits, some disadvantages were identified. For example, at a House Financial Services hearing on Katrina housing, one Member of Congress noted that the large FEMA contingent of workers in the area actually used a significant part of the remaining resources (both hotels and other housing) and suggested that FEMA staff were, in fact, in competition with local disaster victims wishing to return to the area.", "During their use the ships housed over 8,000 people and served over two million meals to Katrina victims and workers helping in the recovery. While meeting emergency needs, critics questioned the cost of housing victims on the ships. Some doubted the efficacy of the plan, the location of some ships, the cost and length of the contract, and the process used to arrive at the agreement. As one story noted: \"The six month contract\u2014staunchly defended by Carnival but castigated by politicians from both parties\u2014has come to exemplify the cost of haste that followed Katrina's strike and FEMA's lack of preparation.\"", "While the cruise ships attracted considerable media attention, one step taken in this process may warrant further consideration. The care of children in this situation is of interest, particularly since it served as a harbinger of what would become a very significant issue with regard to FEMA's management of its large mobile home and trailer parks. On one of the Carnival ships, the Holiday , the organization Save The Children (best known for its work overseas) joined with Carnival and other corporate givers to set up a child-care center. As summarized by the organization: \"Save the Children worked with a local licensed child-care provider to turn the Holiday ship's 'Doc Holiday Lounge' into a child-care center that served about 70 children each day. Child care services were difficult to find as families sought to recover.\" The same perceived needs would surface as areas of contention at FEMA's emergency trailer parks that were established on the Gulf Coast when FEMA child care services or other amenities were eligible expenses for the management of the trailer parks. Similar concerns have long been a part of temporary housing operations, but the scale of the post-Katrina disaster environment brought greater scrutiny to the issues of supportive services for large temporary housing sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Traditional Hotels and Motels", "paragraphs": ["The local chapters of the ANRC routinely provide brief hotel or motel stays as a form of emergency housing around the nation on a daily basis for disaster victims, including the victims of fires or other local emergencies. The local ANRC chapters are frequently reimbursed by FEMA for this work in presidentially declared disasters of a much smaller scale than Katrina. This form of assistance is referred to in regulations as \"reasonable, short-term housing expenses.\" However, because the practice of providing transient accommodations involves working with much smaller numbers of victims, the length of stay is usually brief, and the task of finding more suitable accommodations not as daunting as the Katrina experience.", "The Katrina Experience . Hotels and motels were used around the country both by self-evacuated families and individuals and by disaster evacuees who were moved out of shelters and into these establishments by the ANRC and FEMA. Hotels and motels in the disaster area were also used to house relief workers.", "Much of the work of placing victims in these facilities was managed by a contractor, Corporate Lodging Consultants (CLC), that worked originally for the Red Cross and then FEMA. CLC engaged the hotels and motels to track occupancy and managed the payments to the participating facilities.", "Many residents in harm's way had \"self-evacuated\" to hotels and motels outside of the immediate area as the storm approached. However, the majority in these establishments were families and individuals who moved from mass shelters to the hotels and motels to meet the October 15, 2005 deadline. This resulted in an extraordinarily high combined population in these commercial facilities. The peak was reached in late October of 2005 when 85,000 households were housed across the country in hotels and motels in 48 states.", "Due to the unique circumstances created by Hurricane Katrina, a traditionally short-term solution for small emergencies became a national program of unprecedented size. This greatly expanded program provided some privacy for families that had been spent a significant period of time in mass shelters. The hotel/motel option gave displaced victims a chance to be in a room with their own private space and a discrete address. However, the deadline for the movement out of shelters left little or no time for establishing protocols for lodging costs or exploring alternative housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Traditional Apartment Rentals by States", "paragraphs": ["No evidence or data exist of a previous use of state contracting for apartments for disaster victims under Section 403. The states traditionally are engaged in Section 403 work through the debris removal program, congregate sheltering, and some other distinct missions such as search and rescue work or the provision of temporary school facilities. The FEMA housing mission is, in part, carried out in cooperation with the states. But that cooperation generally entails state assistance only in locating temporary housing sites and in the administration of the Other Needs Assistance (ONA) program. ONA funds are used for furniture and clothing and other related needs, a use that works in tandem with the Section 408 housing program (discussed below).", "The Katrina Experience . Following the evacuation of Katrina victims (both self-evacuated and those transported by FEMA) to many states, some of those states: rented apartments for the evacuees; provided other necessary support such as furnishings, food, transportation, and limited medical assistance; and made the rent payments that were subsequently reimbursed by FEMA under Section 403. There were, at the peak of this operation, approximately 67,000 apartment leases in 32 states. While the original instructions by FEMA offered to reimburse leases of up to 12 months, states were encouraged to engage in shorter leases if possible.", "States were solicited by FEMA to accept evacuees. They were asked to provide information to FEMA on the number of evacuees they could accommodate, the date they could begin receiving them, and the location of the receiving point. The potential hosting states were promised full reimbursement of their disaster related costs, with the general instruction to treat the Hurricane Katrina evacuees as they would disaster victims within their own state borders."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The Transition to Section 408", "paragraphs": ["Due to the damage to permanent housing stock (both private homes and rental properties) by Hurricane Katrina, the transition from shorter-term Section 403 sheltering/housing to traditional, longer-term Section 408 temporary housing assistance was a difficult one. Normally, FEMA works with a relatively small population, which traditionally makes this \"crosswalk\" easier; however, that was not the case for this event. FEMA had to contact all recipients of 403 assistance in order to establish their eligibility for longer-term aid under Section 408. That contact also had to include an explanation of the process as well as available housing options, the location of some housing resources, and the time-tables involved. Disaster victims also had to be assured that the next form of housing assistance was available for those deemed eligible. Accordingly, checks for rental assistance, or a unit of manufactured housing, had to be available before the applicants were moved from their current residences.", "Eligibility for Section 408 assistance is based on several conditions, including a finding by FEMA that:", "the applicant's primary residence is unlivable; the applicant is experiencing financial hardship and; there are other related difficulties in the aftermath of a declared disaster event.", "Eligibility determinations are routinely made in most disaster situations by staff at FEMA's National Process Service Centers (NPSCs). At the NPSCs, staff take registrations (both telephonically and on-line) working in concert with FEMA's on-site staff based at the Joint Field Offices (JFOs) in or near the affected area, and with FEMA's contracted housing inspectors.", "A major challenge to this traditional approach rested in the sheer number of victims involved in the Katrina disaster; thousands of evacuees were placed in hotel/motel rooms in 48 states as well as in state-rented apartments in 32 states. The wide dispersal of victims compounded the transition process. This outreach mission was especially difficult to accomplish within shifting deadlines established by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA. Due to the extent of the devastation in the affected area, housing inspections could not always be conducted within the usual time frames; such inspections are generally critical to eligibility decisions. In addition, FEMA had to cobble together a series of outreach teams to spread out among the diaspora of disaster victims. These teams consisted of personnel from the Corporate Lodging Consultant (CLC) contractors, FEMA Community Relations staff, and available staff from the respective FEMA regional offices. The resources of these groups were already greatly taxed by their own disaster assignments.", "DHS/FEMA had been contacted as early as September 6, 2005, by the Refugee Council USA with a proposed plan to reach out (through the Refugee Council's local affiliate network) and provide case management services to the displaced residents from the Gulf Coast. The Council had developed the plan in conjunction with the White House Homeland Security Council and the Office of Faith-Based Initiatives and its traditional partners in refugee assistance at the Department of State and the Department of Health and Human Services. Subsequent discussions raised questions about the authority of FEMA to carry out such a program as well as the potential cost. The plan was not adopted.", "Two competing imperatives faced FEMA: provide safe housing for disaster victims and remain responsible stewards of federal funds. The goal of transferring applicants from hotels, motels, and state-leased apartments to apartments paid with Section 408 rental assistance and manufactured housing was intended to address both goals, but some maintain that efforts to achieve both ends resulted in a disruptive and complicated process. It was within this environment of shifting deadlines and lingering questions of applicant eligibility that reports of waste, fraud, and abuse within the program surfaced. The situation led to litigation that continues to embroil FEMA, applicants, and public interest groups.", "As of the end of 2006, approximately 40,000 households had been moved from 403 to 408 funding\u2014either through CLC payments to landlords out of 408 funds or from 408 payments made to applicants to continue apartment rentals. FEMA's presumption for this situation is that those households previously in 403 apartments and qualified for, but not receiving, 408 payments represent people no longer in need of FEMA assistance or those whose landlords did not make contact with CLC to maintain the arrangement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stafford Act Section 408", "paragraphs": ["Stafford Act Section 408 housing is administered through the Individual and Households Program (IHP), which consists of temporary housing and Other Needs Assistance (ONA).

Direct housing assistance\u2014that is, aid associated with mobile homes and travel trailers, is not deducted from that amount due to difficulties in precisely calculating the amount of assistance involved.

It also includes repair assistance to make a dwelling habitable, and grants to contribute toward replacement housing for an applicant whose home has been destroyed by a disaster event.", "The Katrina Experience . One of the greatest challenges in the post-Katrina environment was the dearth of available rental property in the damaged area. As with private homes, many rental units also sustained major damage or were destroyed. In recognition of the difficulties inherent in this problem, Congress enacted a provision in the post-Katrina Reform Act that would \"provide for the repair and improvement of multi-family rental properties in disaster areas to increase the rental stock available to disaster victims in the immediate area.\"", "Another Section 408 issue that emerged was FEMA's definition of Fair Market Rent (FMR). FEMA uses the FMR set by HUD for a metropolitan area, which includes the cost of utilities. FEMA, however, pursuant to the Stafford Act, has determined that the amount of financial assistance available is based on \"the fair market rent for the accommodation provided plus the cost of any transportation, utility hook-ups, or unit installation not provided directly by the President.\" FEMA has traditionally interpreted the utility language to mean that hook-ups are the only utility costs eligible for assistance. As a result of this difference, which was also noted in ongoing litigation, Congress amended the Stafford Act to qualify utility costs as eligible expenses.", "Existing federal policy, notably the Stafford Act and its administration by FEMA, bases federal aid on the assumption that a household in need of temporary housing assistance will not have permanently lost employment or its principal means of support, let alone be displaced to another state. FEMA also presumes, based on typical program performance, that the Section 408 assistance provided will be relatively short in duration, generally much less than the 18 months of eligible help. Certainly, many disasters are far more localized within states and communities. With a localized event, the difference in employment is the commuting distance from a temporary housing location rather than the retention of the job itself.", "The challenge of continuing employment is one fundamental difference between most disaster declarations and an event such as Hurricane Katrina. This unique circumstance of sudden joblessness on a large scale underlines the difficulties in applying the Section 408 authority to catastrophic major disasters of this breadth, magnitude, and duration. In essence, Hurricane Katrina exceeded all previous experience and also the perceived reach of statutory authority.", "An additional consideration in the post-Katrina environment was the demographic profile of affected residents. As one report noted: \"Hurricane Katrina disproportionately impacted communities where the poor and minorities, mostly African-Americans, resided. The three states where communities were damaged or flooded by the hurricane rank among the poorest in the nation.\" This meant more renters were affected, and many victims had little means of support. These victims were sent far from home taking few or no resources with them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Traditional Housing Repair and Replacement", "paragraphs": ["When Hurricane Katrina struck, the housing repair element of Section 408 assistance authorized up to $5,000 in repairs to primary residences so that victims could make their homes habitable.

Mobile homes are larger and are generally used to house applicants who are unable to obtain rental housing in the area. Additionally, they are intended to meet longer-term disaster housing needs. Travel trailers are smaller units that are usually parked adjacent to the home so that the individual or family can continue repairs while the home itself cannot be occupied and not have to pay for the space to park the trailer. The units are also placed on existing commercial lots and in parks created by FEMA for that purpose. The travel trailers \"have been used principally for shorter-term housing needs\" following disaster events.", "Travel trailers, unlike mobile homes, are not classified as housing or dwellings. Instead they are considered transportation since they are often moved from site to site for recreational purposes. HUD has not established standards for trailers as it has for mobile homes which are considered housing and are \"designed to be used as a dwelling.\" The distinction between housing and transportation also becomes important when considering FEMA's own regulations which do not permit the placement of mobile homes within flood plains as temporary housing unless they are elevated above the base flood elevation. This allows trailers to be placed in flood plain areas on a temporary basis, particularly in group sites, while mobile homes may not.", "While manufactured housing is a form of temporary housing, it sometimes gains permanence for the households occupying these units. This is based on a part of the Stafford Act which provides that a unit \"may be sold directly to the individual or household who is occupying the unit if the individual or household lacks permanent housing.\" This is usually the case for applicants without other housing options.", "The Katrina Experience . Congressional testimony by a FEMA official noted that approximately 80% of manufactured dwellings were situated on private lots on the Gulf Coast. This points to the large number of homes with major damage following the hurricanes of 2005.

But a catastrophic disaster such as Katrina removes many options. It not only spreads disaster victims across the nation but also makes home repair work difficult and slow at best. Additionally, a disaster of this magnitude wipes out most available rental housing in the affected area. With all of those factors considered, manufactured housing became the primary means of providing temporary housing in Gulf Coast communities for an extended period of time.", "This form of housing also drew the media's attention due to a large number of units awaiting occupancy that have been stored in Hope, Arkansas.

FEMA is also paying to store and maintain manufactured homes at 13 staging areas. The estimated expense to maintain these Emergency Housing sites is $36 million.", "Complaints regarding the safety of the units cropped up early in the recovery period. As early as late November of 2005, just three months after Katrina had made landfall, media accounts were highlighting formaldehyde issues prominently among a listing of the environmental problems resulting from the storms:", "Burning storm debris, more diesel exhaust, runaway mold and fumes from glue and plywood in new trailers are irritating people's lungs and nasal passages. ... Dave Farragut of DeLisle got one of the first new trailers from FEMA. The first couple of days the smell from the trailer made his eyes burn. When his girlfriend moved in a few days later, she also got sick at first.", "On July 19, 2007, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on the formaldehyde issue. Witnesses at the hearing included residents who had reported health problems due to their stay in the manufactured housing provided by FEMA.

As the Oversight Committee's Supplemental Memo explained:", "In March 2006, news articles reported high levels of formaldehyde in FEMA trailers. FEMA field staff urged immediate action, saying \"This needs to be fixed today,\" \"we need to take a proactive approach,\" and there is an \"immediate need\" for a plan of action. FEMA testing of a trailer occupied by a pregnant mother and her infant in April 2006\u2014apparently the only occupied FEMA trailer ever tested by FEMA\u2014showed formaldehyde levels that were 75 times higher than the maximum workplace exposure level recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.", "Despite the evidence of a formaldehyde problem in FEMA trailers, FEMA officials in headquarters, acting on the advice of FEMA lawyers, refused to test occupied FEMA trailers. One FEMA attorney explained: \"Do not initiate any testing until we give the OK. ... Once you get results and should they indicate some problem, the clock is running on our duty to respond to them.\"", "FEMA Administrator David Paulison, the government witness at this hearing. In his testimony, Mr. Paulison assured the Committee that an investigation was underway in June, 2007, one month prior to the hearing, on the formaldehyde matter. The group involved in the inquiry had a large cast of federal players including the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Public Health Service, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), DHS' own Office of Health Affairs, and some industry representatives as well. Administrator Paulison added that \"Together, we are beginning both short and long-term investigations. In fact, FEMA and CDC are scheduled to begin phase one of a study in the Gulf Coast within the next few weeks.\"", "While not stipulating what phase one would represent, the actual testing of trailer units by the CDC did not begin for another five months, starting on December 21, 2007. This delay was described by some as symptomatic of a longer delay in recognizing the need for testing and of seeking to influence its results. As one press account noted:", "The revelations come nearly two years after early tests showed high levels of the toxic gas in trailers and a month after a congressional committee accused FEMA of pressuring the CDC to downplay health risks attached to the trailers due to liability concerns. FEMA and CDC officials have denied the allegations.", "\"FEMA has acted throughout this not out of concern for the health of the people who lived in the trailers but out of concern for public embarrassment and legal liability,\" said Rep. Brad Miller, D-N.C., of the House Committee on Science and Technology, which launched an investigation.", "The test results announced by CDC found \"higher than typical indoor exposure levels of formaldehyde\" in the travel trailers and mobile homes that have been serving as temporary housing for thousands of disaster victims. In reaction to the CDC results, FEMA announced a number of steps to accelerate the relocation of disaster victims from the manufactured housing and into rental units, hotel and motel rooms or other alternative housing. FEMA pledged to provide food assistance, furniture for residents moving into unfurnished apartments, care for pets that may not be permitted in hotels and motels, and assistance in the actual move from a manufactured home to a safer residence.", "However, also in reaction to the CDC findings, a master complaint was filed based on the health risk represented by the formaldehyde findings. The clients \"allege they were adversely affected by high formaldehyde levels in trailers supplied by the Federal Emergency Management Agency\". In addition to FEMA, the complaint also targets dozens of manufacturers. This action continues the trail of litigation in the housing arena since the hurricane struck in 2005.", "In light of the information now available, FEMA has made a decision to no longer use travel trailers.

It also stands in a long line of changing deadlines and directions regarding housing assistance over the extended disaster recovery period. A particular dilemma in implementing this plan has been the relative paucity of rental units available in the immediate disaster area. Also, since the great majority of remaining travel trailer units are on private lots where owners are slowly repairing their homes, there may be additional logistical challenges for the government and decisions for families and individuals. In testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, DHS Secretary Chertoff summed up the situation:", "Now I recognize the reality is there's not a lot of housing in the area, and that may mean for some people they will have to move some distance away. That's been, frankly, one of the reasons why I think some people have been reluctant to move out of trailers. But from any number of standpoints, whether it be formaldehyde or just the fact that these trailers are not designed as permanent residences, I think that people would be much better served if they bit the bullet and moved out.

Geo-spatial mapping consists of overflights of an area that can produce maps that identify the average depth of water in a specific geographic area. From these maps FEMA can then project likely damage in that area. This form of verification was fast and practical but could not offer the same detail as on-site inspection, particularly for personal losses. Another key issue realized from Katrina is that the viability of neighborhoods cannot be determined. Even though on-site inspection reports are issued for each individual dwelling, the reports do not ordinarily provide, nor is it their assigned mission to provide, a picture or an assessment of neighborhood-wide conditions.

This report was due 270 days after enactment, which would have placed its due date in July of 2007. In testimony to Congress, FEMA Deputy Administrator Harvey Johnson had pledged to deliver the strategy report in April of 2008. A draft report was submitted to Congress on July 21, 2008. On July 24, 2008 FEMA began a 60-day public comment period on the strategy.", "The strategy, as released, defers most decisions and approaches to implementation, to a \"National Disaster Housing Task Force\" that would lead both planning and implementation efforts.

Less discussion is directed in the strategy to the federal role in catastrophic events. While the draft document amply described current practices, particularly the roles of the other actors, the federal role is only briefly referenced. Since it was a catastrophic event that was the basis for the request for this strategy, as well as its overall context, it should more directly address how the strategy would address a catastrophic event.

Two of these actions are the establishment of the Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP), which transferred management of long-term rental housing to HUD, and FEMA's recent announced reversal, in the housing strategy, of its previous decision to no longer use travel trailers, due to safety concerns, as a disaster housing option . The strategy in fact calls for their use when no options remain and any units must meet HUD standards. Actions such as these may be a component of a comprehensive disaster housing strategy, along with other elements such as \"Katrina Cottages,\" mobile homes and their management, the congressional authorization for \"semi-permanent housing\" in P.L. 109-295 , and the overarching themes of equity and choice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Group Site Location", "paragraphs": ["The reluctance of parishes near to but outside of the disaster area to host manufactured housing sites became a major impediment to development of a coherent housing plan following Katrina's impact.

The state believed such help would encourage the outer parishes to accept a significant number of mobile homes or travel trailers in their jurisdictions by helping them defer increased costs to the community caused by the new temporary sites. There is no record of FEMA responding officially to that overall proposal, but some examples of previous actions arguably indicate FEMA had given some support to the concept. Early in the disaster FEMA had set up temporary laundry facilities for one trailer park. During the hurricanes of 2004 in Florida, FEMA had helped a sewer district expand its capacity following the establishment of a trailer park within that jurisdiction. In each case, these actions had been ad hoc decisions made by the leadership in the field, not reflecting official policy.", "Later, in early November 2005, FEMA housing staff in Louisiana created their own version of a \"supporting services\" listing, to encourage more local support for the trailer parks.

Its officials read that mandate very narrowly\u2014they will supply housing, and little else, for as long as 18 months while people get back on their feet. ...

Entergy is a private utility company that had been New Orleans' last Fortune 500 company but found itself in precarious financial straits following the devastating event. The lag time on utility restoration became yet another \"chicken and egg\" situation. Which would come first: the arrival of housing units or the utilities to support them? A similar question arose regarding neighborhood schools: should the schools be repaired, or should the students be present first? The inertia that resulted from these sticking points has been a common factor for post-Katrina communities. Local leadership and community-based decision making organizations arguably are equipped to set the priorities that could resolve these issues. FEMA's local partnerships, particularly the interaction of a Federal Coordinating Officer and staff with experience in similar situations, can be useful. Their cooperation with local leadership can contribute to a more effective transition for the community.", "Issues also arise as to where temporary manufactured housing should be sited. FEMA's regulations prohibit the placement of mobile homes in flood plains to avert similar disasters in the future. This has discouraged the placement of housing needed by Katrina victims. FEMA has, however, permitted the use of travel trailers (rather than mobile homes) in such vulnerable areas under the assumption that they can be moved out of harm's way more rapidly. This assumption is questionable when large numbers of travel trailers are being used in a concentrated area and FEMA requires that contractors strap down all of the manufactured housing installed on the Gulf Coast. The increased safety created by tying down the mobile homes restricts mobility. This is a dilemma without a simple answer since it involves the pursuit of two goals potentially in conflict\u2014the need to provide housing in proximity to the disaster-stricken area and the assurance that safe temporary housing will be placed in secure, disaster resistant areas.", "The high levels of formaldehyde in travel trailers and mobile homes revealed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) serves to underline the importance of health and safety concerns when establishing temporary housing for disaster victims. FEMA has indicated it may continue to employ mobile homes that are subject to HUD and industry standards for their safety but will no longer use travel trailers since similar standards do not exist. The commitment of DHS/FEMA to no longer use one type of temporary unit is arguably understandable given the recent experience. But some may question what the alternative form of housing will be since the travel trailers were such a commonly used resource in previous FEMA recovery operations.", "An additional topic of interest is the influence of FEMA's temporary housing program and policies on eventual resettlement and rebuilding decisions at the state and local levels. Some of the FEMA recovery program elements fall outside the defined temporary housing arena but have a direct impact on rebuilding and other related developments within the disaster area. This includes elements such as transportation costs for victims to return to their homes, the establishment and locations of group temporary housing sites, and the progress of infrastructure repair and mitigation projects and the support they could provide for neighborhood redevelopment.", "FEMA involvement in community rebuilding is considerable, but local decision making is also important to accelerate the work. FEMA actions are dependent on choices and priorities established by the state and local governments, in terms of both infrastructure repair and the priority given to debris removal and mitigation projects. Conversely, when fundamental decisions, like those concerning cost-share waivers are delayed, very little can proceed at the local level.

One concern was that those receiving 403 assistance would have all of their 408 accounts remaining (referencing the $28,200 maximum available under the Individual and Households Program), while those who had successfully registered and received help through more traditional FEMA processes were already drawing down from the total Section 408 amount available to them and their families. Given the unprecedented size of this disaster, the 403 solution bought necessary time while the 408 processing went on. However, as a result, some were arguably penalized for their prompt application for Section 408 aid.", "Efforts to address the equity problems in the delivery of FEMA disaster housing may consider the exclusion of initial housing costs under Section 408 from the legislative caps (see Options section of this report). Under this arrangement, all applicants would begin with the same amount of available resources within their IHP accounts.

How much choice should be involved when the government is providing a direct benefit to the disaster victim? In the case of Katrina disaster victims in Louisiana, FEMA estimates it will eventually expend more than $10 billion to provide human services (housing, crisis counseling, disaster unemployment assistance) to that population. Given such expenditures, government officials may be expected to make choices that combine sound stewardship of funds with efficient management.", "Conversely, the misfortune of a natural or man-made disaster can determine a family's housing choices and actual housing location for an extended period of time. But the housing aid offered has a couple of imperatives that may not be complimentary. A key question is whether the goal of the housing mission in the Stafford Act is to place families as close to their original residences as possible or to house as many people as economically as possible? In a catastrophic situation involving thousands of evacuees, the idea of choice may be temporarily exchanged for an immediate response, with different results. As the Director of the Natural Hazards Research and Application Center observed:", "Worse yet, instead of having their needs addressed in a timely manner, those stranded in New Orleans after Katrina were not so much assisted as they were policed. Literally treated like criminals, they were confined to shelters under strict control. Later, they were transported, again under the control of law enforcement agencies and the military, to over forty states around the country, without even having the opportunity to choose where they would be sent.", "The use of housing vouchers does not necessarily enable a victim to return to an area with very few remaining rental units available, nor can vouchers accommodate the desire of a displaced person for a rapid return. But the vouchers can provide a greater degree of choice, as a Heritage Foundation housing expert explained:", "Obviously, giving evacuees access to housing vouchers that can be used in any metropolitan area in the nation will increase the likelihood that many will choose not to return. With vouchers, they will have access to better housing than they had in the slums of New Orleans and will have the choice to remain in communities where they can improve their standard of living and quality of life.", "After the Katrina disaster, FEMA generally provided the initial form of assistance it would normally provide in most disasters: rental assistance in the form of a check (or an Electronic Fund Transfer) equal to a couple of months rent for the area where the applicant was located. This provision of cash assistance provides flexibility to victims to use the funds to meet their housing needs and, if funds remain, to meet other disaster-related needs.", "Housing vouchers issued by HUD can provide both choice and mobility. Also, given the nature of the vouchers being issued by housing authorities that establish relationships with landlords, the vouchers offer more controls and accountability. But in the case of Katrina, HUD vouchers were never used apart from the assistance given to some households that previously received HUD aid. In the area of choice, the distinction between cash and vouchers becomes more complicated. A cash grant provides the ultimate discretion to a disaster victim on its use, with reporting of those uses trailing months behind. A voucher also gives the victim wide latitude, but is more directed toward housing resources. Additionally, the relationship with the issuing authority (e.g. a local public housing authority) offers the potential of additional help for consultation on housing issues.", "Most localized disasters do not involve the problems of applicants being displaced vast distances from their homes, jobs, and schools. The evacuation after Katrina had to be carried out rapidly, since there were no housing resources in the flooded city. The speed of the evacuation appeared to make choice a moot point. Could the evacuation have been organized to a point where evacuees could have chosen a destination?

The committee also noted that most temporary housing in the early 1990s had been provided through home repairs and rental assistance. This was partly due to the Northridge earthquake experience (at the time FEMA's costliest disaster), where repair and rental assistance, due to the area affected, were more useful options for temporary housing than was manufactured housing. This recommendation was adopted; the sites were closed, and the GSA auctioned off and/or dispersed the remaining units. As a consequence, since stand-by contracts were not in place, FEMA officials had to make fast and expensive decisions to purchase thousands of housing units.", "Another unanticipated consequence occurred with the reduction of home repair grants from $10,000 or more to $5,000, the elimination of the Mortgage and Rental Assistance Program (MRA) discussed later in this report, and the elimination of the option for households who failed to qualify for SBA loans to return to FEMA for additional help with home repairs.

For the Northridge earthquake, applicants could obtain a maximum of $10,000.\" But at times, the amount was more than that.

However, the cap on home repairs was in place during Katrina and for a year after that event. Given the smaller amount available for home repairs, as well as the devastation of the Katrina event that made repairs more costly and time-consuming, manufactured housing became the only alternative based on the time pressure associated with Katrina.", "The priority use of manufactured housing may not have been a preferred option, but it was one that, if coupled with a drastically diminished rental inventory in a disaster area (e.g., Katrina, unlike Northridge), provided housing opportunities as other possible housing avenues were decreasing.

The plan proposed that communities provide sites for a temporary housing solution for disaster victims that would offer the amenities and support services that could lead to a transition back to their home communities. The plan also included the framework for that same transitional community to become a permanent housing addition to its host area. Though FEMA/DHS leadership did not act on the strategy, the Director of the Office of Recovery and Renewal for the State of Mississippi also noted the \"transitional communities\" concept as a promising avenue to explore as a means to \"supplementing housing needs.\" Opponents of the concept might contend that communities unwilling to accept temporary manufactured housing would be much less likely to consider a semi-permanent housing development.", "Although the notion of transitional communities was not accepted in the early days of post-Katrina recovery, subsequent congressional action on \"Katrina Cottages\" and the concept of alternative housing indicates a policy shift in viewing some temporary housing as a prelude to semi-permanent or permanent housing.

While this argument may be difficult to sustain, some might attempt to do so. Some states may point to their own limitations (legal and budgetary) as an argument for waivers of cost-shares and regulations in non-catastrophic events. The Stafford Act already provides the President with the discretionary authority to make judgments on when an event is beyond the capabilities of the state and local governments.

The time-span of such a sheltering/housing program could be shifted to nine or 12 months, depending on the federal and state governments' ability to make contact with victims and provide them resources for alternative forms of housing.

This would not be an inexpensive alternative, since it would likely be in addition to current Section 8 vouchers and would not supplant those vouchers. Past experience indicates, however, that it is difficult to impose such a time cap on housing vouchers. But the same concerns with costs exist regarding current FEMA temporary housing practices. The FEMA temporary housing program has been extended for long periods, and the cost of setting up manufactured housing sites is high and the process complicated for local governments.", "The HUD approach has the benefit of tapping existing resources (local public housing authorities) that can provide case management or other services and also linking some victims with longer-term housing aid that they may require.

While such an approach makes sense for large events spread out over many states and localities, some may contend that using the same approach on smaller disasters may be problematic. In those instances, the management of housing resources would be falling on the locality with the fewest resources and to the entity (a unit of local government) that may, itself, be a disaster victim.

Since the Administration did not request expanded authorities, the traditional FEMA housing programs for much smaller disasters became the default action plan of the federal government for the largest natural disaster event in U.S. history. It can be argued that parts of this plan worked very well, such as the rental housing provided by hosting states. However, other parts, such as the dependence on mobile homes and travel trailers, appear not as suitable to either the magnitude or location of this catastrophic event.", "What should disaster temporary housing be? Is it mainly a home-repair option or a rental-assistance option (either with cash assistance or a voucher), or should manufactured housing be presented as the only option? FEMA itself has had a shifting emphasis over the years, much of it driven by the nature and location of individual large disasters, which in turn has moved its policies and vehicles for providing temporary housing on a large scale. That shifting emphasis is reflected in the temporary housing response to Katrina. With the discovery of unsafe levels of formaldehyde in trailers, FEMA may be shifting its approach once again. A more definitive approach might be helpful to FEMA, its state partners, and the disaster victims; flexibility, however, might also be needed.", "Despite the very real problems encountered by victims, their communities and their host communities, thousands of families and individuals have received a significant amount of supplemental aid from the government for housing.

There have been many challenges along the way, perhaps most importantly, the difficulty in communicating complicated housing policy decisions to a vast and dispersed population.", "Many of the staff involved, both in the governmental and non-governmental sectors, at all levels, provided assistance through the temporary housing programs and administrative channels that existed. Those programs were severely challenged by a disaster of unprecedented size, compounded by unique problems of devastation and mass evacuations. New partnerships were established and a significant level of federal resources were provided, if not always judiciously employed. Programs that can work well for a \"garden variety\" disaster may not be appropriate for a catastrophic event. Assumptions based on the average can be overwhelmed by the exceptional. For an event such as Katrina, new approaches were apparently considered but often rejected in favor of the familiar. This is understandable given the propensity to avoid establishing precedent based on an outlier event, and the body of law and regulations and policies supporting current housing practices. However, effective leadership, and carefully drawn legislation, can help to distinguish between the extraordinary and the common events and respond appropriately.", "Even now, long after Katrina's landfall in August of 2005, Congress continues to debate long-term recovery roles among federal agencies and state governments that are still uncertain but clearly consequential.

The cooperation between FEMA and HUD has been inconsistent throughout the process. As a result, Congress eventually transferred the funding to HUD for this purpose. It was at this point that HUD renamed the program the Disaster Voucher Program (DVP replacing KDHAP). Regardless of the acronym employed, the HUD-assisted program appears to have reached its targeted population. Further cooperation and information sharing between FEMA and HUD (and other federal agencies) might contribute to applicants being aware of all housing options and also lessen each program's susceptibility to fraud.", "There have been frequent references to HUD Section 8 housing vouchers as a solution for the Katrina evacuees. The response to the Northridge earthquake in 2004 is usually listed as a prime example of the efficiency of this approach. FEMA provided over $140 million in immediate housing help in the form of funds for applicants to rent alternative living spaces (three months to homeowners and two months to renters) to more than 47,000 households. One consideration is whether such vouchers should be limited as disaster housing assistance is (generally 18 months), or if they should continue to be renewed in the manner of regular Section 8 vouchers.", "For the Katrina disaster, unlike some other disasters, HUD's help was focused on assisting its own population of clients that had been displaced by the disaster.
