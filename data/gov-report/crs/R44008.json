Results have generally shown that quality early childhood care and education help improve outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged students. The effectiveness of ECE programs is usually measured by assessing children's cognitive functioning, school readiness, and/or social behavior.", "In addition, there is a growing body of research exploring the cost-effectiveness of investments in high quality preschool. The National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) estimated the average lifetime benefits of universally available preschool for all three- and four-year-olds to be considerably larger than the costs for two years of prekindergarten. NIEER based its estimates on data from studies of two high quality preschool programs serving low-income children\u2014the Chicago Child Parent Center (CCPC) and the Perry Preschool program. These studies both found that for every dollar invested, the lifetime return on investment equaled seven dollars. Follow-up of the children who participated in the CCPC at age 20 found they were less likely to be held back in school, to have needed remedial help, or to have been arrested. The follow-up study of the Perry Preschool participants found similar benefits. At age 27, Perry Preschool participants had higher monthly earnings and a higher level of schooling, as well as fewer arrests, than the children who did not take part in the program. ", "Currently, access to high-quality preschool programs varies throughout the United States. Nationally, in school year (SY) 2014-2015, 42 states and Washington, DC, supported one or more state-funded preschool program, although the percentage of three- and four-year-olds served, and the number of hours provided by these programs, varied considerably. In SY2014-2015, approximately 29% of four-year-olds and 5% of three-year-olds were enrolled in state-funded preschool nationally. One group that has established benchmarks for use in assessing program quality, NIEER, found that only six states met all 10 of their benchmarks for quality in SY2014-2015. Nationally, less than 4% of the children served in state-funded preschool in SY2014-2015 were enrolled in programs meeting all 10 of the NIEER benchmarks for quality.", "It is difficult to provide a clear picture of preschool programs in this country. There is no formal, federally mandated system of preschool, and states and localities make their own decisions about whether or not to offer such programs. In the absence of a cohesive public preschool system, a fragmented landscape of private and public providers has emerged, with funding coming from a combination of private, state, local, and federal sources, and with program eligibility and quality varying widely.

One billion dollars a year in mandatory funding for FY2010-FY2017 was proposed for the program. Subsequently, some provisions from SAFRA, but not Early Learning Challenge Grants, were incorporated into Title II Part A of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA, P.L. 111-152 ). ", "However, Early Learning Challenge Grants were funded through the Race to the Top program included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). ARRA provided a total of $4.35 billion in FY2009 funding for the RTT program. ELC did not receive funding in FY2009, and no funding was provided for any RTT program in FY2010. Nonetheless, ELC was subsequently provided RTT funding through appropriations measures in FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013; and the program became known as Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC) grants.

In the RTT-ELC grant program, QRIS are referred to as TQRIS to emphasize the tiered aspect of a Quality Rating and Improvement System. TQRISs are often compared to market-based approaches like star ratings for restaurants or hotels. A typical tiered TQRIS might display programs' ratings (e.g., from one to five stars) based on a number of factors such as child/staff ratios, staff experience, and state or national accreditation, allowing consumers to easily compare early learning programs in their area. The TQRIS used by RTT-ELC recipient states is required to be tiered, allowing consumers to determine the number of quality indicators an early learning program has met based on their tier level. ", "The first two RTT-ELC competitions included five proposed priorities: one absolute priority, two competitive preference priorities, and two invitational priorities. These priorities are listed in Table 2 . The third competition added a competitive preference priority, for a total of six priorities. In order to receive RTT-ELC funding, a state must address in its application the absolute priority of promoting school readiness for children with high needs. Competitive preference priorities allow a state to receive extra points if it addresses the priority. States may address invitational priorities, but do not receive extra points for doing so. If a state chooses to address an invitational priority and wins RTT-ELC funding, it may use funds from the grant for the priority. ", "Before issuing applications for the first Phase of the RTT-ELC competition, ED issued draft requirements, priorities, selection criteria, and definitions in the Federal Register , and received nearly 350 comments on them. In response to the many comments, several changes were made to the Phase 1 RTT-ELC priorities when the Phase 1 application was released. For example, the draft executive summary of the RTT-ELC competition listed two proposed absolute priorities, but neither was used in its entirety in the Phase 1 priorities. Only one element of the proposed absolute priorities\u2014the concept of promoting school readiness\u2014was included in the Phase 1 absolute priorities. Other elements of the proposed absolute priorities were incorporated into the two competitive preference priorities issued in the Phase 1 competition. The two proposed invitational priorities were unchanged from the draft in the final RTT-ELC application. The proposed and final RTT-ELC funding priorities for each phase of the RTT-ELC competition are displayed in Table 2 . ", "For the third round of the RTT-ELC grant competition, some language changes were made to existing criteria and some new provisions were added. Changes included a request for states to report data disaggregated by race and ethnicity on the program participation of children with high needs, and a revision of the Program Standards to require that strategies for engaging families be culturally and linguistically responsive and help families support their children's development and learning. In addition, new language was added to indicate that Kindergarten Entry Assessments were not to be used as the sole measure for deciding to fire staff or to hold a student back (i.e., high stakes decisions). Invitational priority 4 from Phases 1 and 2, on preschool through third grade approaches to sustain early learning, was elevated to a competitive priority. A state could earn up to 10 points for this competitive priority. In order to meet this priority states were required to address preschool through third grade quality, alignment, and continuity of teaching and learning.
