Some of these individuals, including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, were identified in four or more of the reports. Similarly, some of the security units, in particular Infantry Division 33 and Infantry Division 99, were cited by six or more of the reports. The reports suggest that the commission of human rights abuses by Burma's security forces is pervasive, systematic, and endemic. CRS did not independently verify the credibility of these reports.", "The Trump Administration has labeled the alleged human rights violations as \"ethnic cleansing\" and has imposed \"limited targeted sanctions\" on five Burmese military officers and two military units it considers responsible for serious human rights violations against the Rohingya in Burma's Rakhine State.

The 116th Congress appropriated $3.75 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) for the documentation of human rights violations against Rohingya and others in Burma. Congress has also placed restrictions and requirements on relations with Burma in previous appropriations legislation to address human rights issues.", "Many of the reports advocate for some form of accountability for the reported human rights violations, including by calling for the U.N. Security Council to refer the alleged human rights violations in Burma to the International Criminal Court (ICC) or an ad hoc international criminal tribunal for investigation and possible prosecution. China and possibly Russia are likely to oppose an ICC referral, and recent statements by President Trump and National Security Advisor John Bolton suggest the United States may also oppose such a referral. The ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber had previously ruled that the ICC's Prosecutor can begin a preliminary investigation of the war crime of forced deportation of the country's Rohingya ethnic minority into neighboring Bangladesh.", "In the interim, the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (UNFFM) has recommended that an independent international mechanism (IIM) be established to collect and preserve evidence of alleged acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed in Burma since 2011.

Between 1990 and 2008, Congress passed legislation imposing various sanctions on Burma in part due to the serious human rights violations committed by and/or authorized by the Tatmadaw. Such allegations of intentional, pervasive, and systematic abuses arose again following the forced displacement of over 700,000 Rohingya from Burma's Rakhine State in late 2017, as well as the Tatmadaw's renewed offensive against ethnic armed groups in Kachin, Karen, and Shan States (see map in the Appendix ). ", "The Trump Administration has described that Tatmadaw's assault on the Rohingya as \"ethnic cleansing\" and has applied \"limited targeted sanctions\" on five Tatmadaw officers and two military units.
