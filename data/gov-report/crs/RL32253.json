In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (SBJPA), P.L. 104-188 , Congress amended the statute to add the physical requirement.

Prior to a Supreme Court decision in 2005 (discussed below), it was unclear whether this amount was included in the recipient's income when it was received as part of an award in a non-personal injury or non-physical personal injury case with a contingency fee agreement. Courts generally required it be included in the recipient's income. This approach was consistent with three fundamental tax principles: (1) payments are included in income unless specifically excluded by statute, (2) a taxpayer may not avoid taxation by assigning income to another party, and (3) a taxpayer receives a taxable benefit when another party pays his or her debt.", "However, some courts allowed the amount to be excluded from the recipient's income. This position had several bases: (1) the attorney's right to the income under state lien law, (2) the recognition that contingency fee agreements are not made with a tax-avoidance purpose and that inclusion of the fees in the client's income results in the amount being subject to double taxation, and (3) equitable reasons due to the fact that the recipient may not be able to fully deduct the legal expenses, as explained below.", "In 2005, the Supreme Court resolved the conflict by holding that the recipient is required to include the amount representing attorneys' fees in income. The Court appeared to answer the question with relative ease based on settled law. It began by stating that in situations involving anticipatory assignment of income, like contingency fee agreements, the test for determining if the assignor received the income for tax purpose is if he or she retains control over the income-generating asset. The Court then reasoned that because the cause of action resulting from the injury is the income-generating asset and the injured party retains control over it throughout the litigation, the injured party receives all of the award for purposes of taxation. The Court rejected the argument that the attorney had an ownership interest in the asset because he or she also contributed an income-generating asset (i.e., effort and expertise) or was granted it under state lien law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deductibility", "paragraphs": ["A plaintiff with a claim of non-personal injury or non-physical personal injury may be able to deduct the legal expenses incurred in the suit.
