For example, under NAFTA's \"yarn-forward\" rule of origin, textiles and apparel benefit from tariff-free treatment in all three countries if the production of yarn, fabric, and apparel, with some exceptions, is done within North America.", "The United States maintains a bilateral trade surplus in yarns and fabrics with its NAFTA partners. In 2016, the United States had a $4.1 billion surplus in yarns and fabrics and a positive balance of around $720 million in made-up textile products (such as home textiles and furnishings) with Canada and Mexico. U.S. exports of yarns and fabrics shipped to Mexico and Canada were valued at close to $6 billion last year. In apparel, the United States had a trade surplus with Canada of $1.4 billion and a trade deficit with Mexico of $2.7 billion in 2016.", "On May 18, 2017, the Trump Administration notified Congress of its intent to renegotiate the agreement.

Also germane to textiles and apparel are several other renegotiating objectives, such as enhancing customs enforcement to prevent unlawful transshipment of these goods from outside the region and ensuring that requirements for use of domestic textiles and apparel in U.S. government purchases primarily benefit producers located in the United States.", "NAFTA renegotiation started in August 2017. There is widespread support for continuation of the agreement among U.S. textile and apparel producers, although there are significant differences of opinion with respect to certain provisions. In particular, U.S. textile manufacturers generally favor eliminating all exceptions to NAFTA's yarn-forward rule, whereas U.S. retailers and apparel groups oppose tightening the rule.", "If the United States were to exit NAFTA, imports of textiles from Mexico and Canada would face U.S. tariffs as high as 20%, and imports of apparel would have tariff rates of up to 32%. U.S. exports of textiles and apparel could face higher tariff rates entering Canada and Mexico.

U.S.-headquartered apparel firms commonly contract directly with apparel sourcing companies, which in turn portion out the production work to independent manufacturers.

According to one estimate, automotive manufacturers in the United States used about 330 million square yards of fabric in 2015 for headliners, fabric seats, airbags, seat belts, door panels, engine filters, and trunk liners. One change in NAFTA proposed by the United States would require motor vehicles to have 85% North American content and 50% U.S. content to qualify for tariff-free treatment.

It began to trend down in 2000: by the end of 2007, production was 39% lower than at its peak a decade earlier. At the end of 2016, the output of U.S. textile mills was 29% less than in 2007 and about 60% less than in 1997. The number of textile mills has fallen by half since 1997. The number of employees has declined by three-quarters over the same period as the surviving mills have invested heavily in technology to reduce operating costs.

Textile production requires sizable capital investment; weaving mills can cost an estimated $12 million to $25 million and spinning mills $50 million to $70 million. Among all U.S. manufacturing industries, textiles rank near the top in productivity increases, which can be attributed both to automation and to the closure of less efficient mills.

In the United States, apparel production has dwindled because many manufacturers no longer physically sew U.S.-produced apparel and other fashion products that directly compete with low-value imports, especially low-cost \"fast-fashion\" garments. Apparel production in the United States is largely focused on high-quality niche products and the military market, which is statutorily required to purchase U.S.-produced garments and textiles. As a result of more and more apparel production moving to lower-wage countries, including Mexico, apparel manufacturing employment in the United States has shrunk every year since 1990. NAFTA likely accounts for the loss of some of these jobs, but there is little evidence that NAFTA was the decisive factor, given that the major growth in apparel manufacturing for the U.S. market has occurred in Asian countries that receive no preferences under NAFTA. ", "According to a study by researchers at Duke University, the U.S. apparel industry has retained the more skilled, higher-paying jobs such as those involving the design, branding, and marketing of products, with lower-skilled apparel production having moved offshore.

"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. textile industry wants the NAFTA renegotiation to address certain exemptions granted to Canada and Mexico under the Kissell Amendment (6 U.S.C. \u00a7453b), a Buy American-type law that requires 100% U.S. content for textile and apparel purchases by the Department of Homeland Security, with limited exceptions. The Kissell Amendment treats manufacturers in Mexico, Canada, and Chile as \"American\" sources, thus opening U.S. government procurement to imported goods from these countries. Another priority for the textile industry in the NAFTA renegotiation is to avoid any future change to government procurement rules that could undermine the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C. \u00a72533a), a 100% domestic-in-origin requirement for textile and apparel items purchased by U.S. national security agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customs Enforcement and Trade Facilitation", "paragraphs": ["Customs enforcement is particularly important to the industry, as textile and apparel trade accounts for approximately 40% of all U.S. duty revenue and involves 20% of all U.S. importers. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, more than $21.1 billion of entered textiles and wearing apparel claim preferential tariff treatment, placing textiles and apparel at a high risk for noncompliance. This makes the issue of transshipment of special relevance to the U.S. textile and apparel industry because of concerns that major textile- and apparel-producing countries such as China are shipping products through countries that have free-trade agreements with the United States, including the NAFTA countries. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["As the NAFTA renegotiations progress, there are at least three possible outcomes: (1) no change to the textile and apparel provisions in NAFTA; (2) adjustments to NAFTA, such as changes to rules of origin; or (3) full U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA. Over the long run, global textile and apparel supply chains would adjust to a modified NAFTA or to its elimination, but it is unclear how long that may take. ", "Under a withdrawal scenario, some analysts believe U.S. textile manufacturers could see a reduction in net income by as much as 1 percentage point if the result is less demand for U.S.-made yarns and fabrics within the NAFTA region. According to one textile and apparel industry expert, ending NAFTA would likely result in U.S. apparel brands and retailers importing more garments from other suppliers, such as China and Vietnam. Moreover, U.S. textile manufacturers could lose export sales to Mexico, the United States' single largest export market. It is possible that Asian textile and apparel suppliers would benefit the most from NAFTA's dismantlement by taking market share from Mexico. Whatever the outcome of the NAFTA renegotiation, in the medium and long run, the profitability of the North American textile and apparel industry will likely depend less on NAFTA preferences such as yarn forward and more on the capacity of producers in the region to innovate to remain globally competitive. ", "Another matter worth considering is that although the United States withdrew from the proposed TPP in January 2017, the 11 remaining TPP countries are continuing to pursue a TPP-type trade deal. If negotiations among the TPP-11 move forward, this could affect the supply chains established under NAFTA, although the implications are unknown because no specific proposals for a possible TPP-11 agreement have been tabled to date. If the TPP-11 countries strike a trade deal, one possible effect is that the amount of textiles and apparel sourced from the newly established TPP region would increase. Canada and Mexico are both parties to the TPP talks, and a TPP-11 agreement could result in them importing more textile and apparel products from other TPP countries, including Vietnam. This could ultimately be a disadvantage for U.S.-based producers. How the inclusion of Canada and Mexico in a fresh TPP arrangement would affect their participation in NAFTA is unknown.", "It may take a couple of years to know exactly what changes the NAFTA renegotiation will bring, and how they will affect the existing textile and apparel regional supply chain. President Trump currently has Trade Promotion Authority until July 1, 2018, allowing him to negotiate trade agreements that Congress must approve or reject without amendment. This authority expires on July 1, 2018, but current law allows it to be extended through July 1, 2021.", "Appendix A. Textile Industry Overview", "Appendix B. Top 10 States in Textile Employment", "Appendix C. Selected Apparel and Textile Duties", "Appendix D. Selected Textile and Apparel Industry Comments on NAFTA Negotiating Objectives", "Links to several statements by industry representatives for U.S. fiber and textile manufacturers, U.S. fashion brands, and U.S. apparel retailers are listed here. These statements reflect a consensus from all stages of the textile and apparel supply chain that NAFTA should continue because it helps maintain both sectors' overall competitiveness. Without NAFTA, according to these statements, current textile and apparel production and jobs could be shifted to other regions of the world, especially low-cost markets in Asia. The comments also suggest a few general recommendations for other policy issues of interest, including matters related to improving intellectual property rights to combat counterfeit goods, preventing restrictions on e-commerce and digital trade, improving regulatory cooperation, and updating NAFTA's labor provisions."], "subsections": []}]}}
