There are currently two initiatives to change the operation of the civil works (andmilitary programs) of the Army Corps of Engineers: the government-wide President'sManagement Agenda (PMA) and an Army initiative referred to as the Third Wave. Neither initiative specifically targets the Corps, but both encompass the Corpsactivities. ", "The PMA was undertaken by the Bush Administration as part of a movement toward more \"entrepreneurial government;\" one of the five components of the PMAis a competitive sourcing initiative. The PMA directed executive agencies tocompetitively source commercial activities in order to produce quality services at areasonable cost through efficient and effective competition between public andprivate sources. The Administration mandated for FY2002 and FY2003 thecompetition of 5% and 10%, respectively, of the commercial positions at agencies,including the Corps.", "The Army's Third Wave initiative is broader than the PMA. The Third Wave is searching for ways to not only improve the Army's operations but also focus itsenergies on its core war-fighting competencies. Under the Third Wave, the Army isreviewing all its commands, including the Corps, to identify how to focus theagency's activities. The Third Wave reviews all positions and functions (i.e., entireareas of responsibilities and missions, such as wetlands regulation) that are not partof the Army's core competencies. Options that can be considered under the ThirdWave for non-core functions and positions include competitive sourcing, transfer ofresponsibilities to other agencies, and divestiture. A significant portion of the Corps'workforce is included in the current early phase of the Third Wave because much ofthe work performed by the Corps is not considered as essential to the Army'swar-fighting competencies.

During the 107th Congress, the Corps came undercriticism for the way it evaluates and undertakes projects. Although the issuereceived media attention, it was not directly addressed in consideration of FY2003appropriations. Legislation proposing changes to the project development andauthorization process was introduced in the 107th Congress ( e.g. , see H.R. 1310 and S. 1987 ); however, no action was taken. ", "Some have called for major agency \"reforms\"; others have called for review of Corps programs and policies. The 106th Congress, in passing the Water ResourcesDevelopment Act of 2000 (WRDA, P.L. 106-541 , Section 216) directed the Corpsto contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study the feasibility ofestablishing an independent review panel for Corps studies. Its July 2002 report recommended that large-scale Corps projects be independently reviewed by expertsoutside the agency. In response to the criticism, the Corps initiated during FY2002an additional internal staff review of project justifications by the office of theAssistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.", "In reporting the FY2002 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bills, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees acknowledged criticism of theCorps; however, both committees generally supported the Corps' efforts to deal withsuch criticisms. Neither committee addressed reform issues in reporting the bills forFY2003. These issues might be addressed during consideration of a biennialauthorization bill for the Corps, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA).The WRDA expected in 2002 did not pass; a WRDA in 2003 is anticipated. (Formore information, see CRS Report RL30928, Army Corps of Engineers: ReformIssues for the 107th Congress. )", "P.L. 108-7 did not address Corps reform directly; however, it did change authorizations for some activities criticized by those supporting reforms. Forexample, the authorization for municipal water infrastructure projects in rural Nevadawas increased from $25 million to $100 million, and a $25 million authorization forIdaho was added. Municipal infrastructure is an area that has historically been theresponsibility of local government, with the federal government providing directedgrants and low-interest loans. Prior to 1992, the Corps' involvement in municipalinfrastructure was limited to water supply from Corps' reservoirs and was paid forby local project sponsors. The increase in authorizations for municipal infrastructure has drawn criticism not only from taxpayer groups and fiscal conservatives but alsofrom beneficiaries of projects in the Corps' traditional missions who are concernedabout dilution of the agency's efforts and funding. ", "Missouri River Water Flows. The current drought in the Missouri River basin has contributed to the ongoing debate onthe operations of the basin's dams. Operations of the mainstem dams of the MissouriRiver are managed under a Master Manual and annual operating plans. In lateJanuary 2003, the Corps published the 2002-2003 Operating Plan. Nonetheless, theflow regime that will be implemented during the nesting season for threatened andendangered species, and during the navigation season that begins April 1, has yet tobe finalized. The Corps has proposed two options: a steady flow release and a flowto meet navigation targets. The Fish and Wildlife Service has expressed concernswith both the regimes. The Corps and the FWS have renewed consultation on the2002-2003 Operating Plan.", "The revision of the Master Manual continues to be a contentions issue. The Master Manual has been in a revision process for 14 years. The Master Manualguides the operation of the Missouri River's dams. The timing of water releasesaffects competing uses of the river such as barge traffic, threatened and endangeredspecies protection, and upstream recreation. In February 2003, a coalition of 10national and regional conservation organizations filed a suit against the Corps andFWS due to the adverse impacts of current operations on threatened and endangeredspecies. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.", "The Corps and FWS reinitiated formal consultation on the operation of the Missouri River mainstem dam system in December 2002. The reconsultation wasinitiated to review the information that the Corps presented in its SupplementalBiological Assessment for the Master Manual, published in January 2003. In thisdocument, the Corps challenged the recommended flow regime presented by theFWS in its November 2000 biological opinion. The FWS had recommended alteringdam operations to provide higher springtime water releases to benefit the pallidsturgeon. This change was believed by some to also benefit other threatened andendangered species negatively affected by dam operations. In the SupplementalBiological Opinion, the Corps concluded that the changes proposed by FWS are notwarranted at this time and that a research, monitoring, and evaluation program of thepallid sturgeon is needed. ", "Missouri River management issues have been taken up in appropriations legislation in recent years. After extended debate in both the House and the Senate,Section 116 of the final Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill forFY2002 included Senate language that prohibited the use of funds \"to accelerate theschedule to finalize the Record of Decision for the revision of the Missouri RiverMaster Water Control Manual and any associated changes to the Missouri RiverAnnual Operating Plan.\" The amended provision also directed the Corps to considerviews of other federal and non-federal agencies and individuals \"to ensure that othercongressionally authorized purposes are maintained\" in addition to endangeredspecies protection. The provision represented a temporary compromise of an ongoingissue that had led President Clinton to veto the Energy and Water Developmentappropriations bill for FY2001.", "Neither the House nor the Senate Appropriations Committee FY2003 reports mentioned Missouri River operations. Senator Bond offered an amendment to theInterior portion of the Stevens Amendment that would have restricted the use offunds by the FWS to require a steady release flow and to prevent the Corps fromrelocating bird nests along its banks. On the Senate floor, the amendment (SA186)was modified to a Sense of the Congress provision that encouraged agreement on aflow regime for 2003 among the Member States and Tribes of the Missouri RiverBasin Association. (The language in the Congressional Record for January 23, 2003,on page S1428 was confusing because the Sense of the Congress language appearsalongside part of the FWS language that was expected to be removed. On January28, the Senate by unanimous consent further modified the amendment to contain onlythe Sense of the Congress language.) During conference, Bond tried again to includelanguage restricting FWS actions. The final bill included neither the FWS restrictionsnor the Sense of the Congress.", "Everglades. Implementation of a Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized in 2002 byTitle VI of WRDA. CERP is one of many efforts to restore the Central and SouthernFlorida ecosystem. The annual Energy and Water Development Appropriations billprovides funding for the Corps' participation in these efforts. Funding for theparticipation of the DOI agencies, such as the National Park Service and Fish andWildlife Service, is part of the annual Department of the Interior and RelatedAgencies Appropriations bill.", "The President's request for FY2003 included a total of $151 million for Corps' construction projects in the region. The FY2003 request for the Kissimmee Riverrestoration and the Everglades and South Florida ecosystem restoration was $23.7million and $19.5 million, respectively. For these two projects, the House and SenateAppropriations Committees, and the final bill, P. L. 108-7, provided the samefunding level as requested. For the Central and Southern Florida project, theAdministration requested $108 million (which included $37 million for CERPactivities). The final appropriations bill funded that project at $90 million. TheSenate and Stevens reports explained that the reduction resulted from questionsraised about the implementation of the project, specifically that it was too heavilyweighted in favor of commercial development of water supplies.", "The final omnibus appropriations bill included language in the Department of the Interior portion that not only funded Everglades restoration activities performedby Interior agencies but also authorized the Corps to implement a controversial planknow as Alternative 6D. This plan is being undertaken as part of the Modified WaterDelivery Project. This project seeks to improve water deliveries to EvergladesNational Park and, to the extent possible, restore the natural hydrological conditionswithin the park. Implementation of the Modified Water Delivery Project will increasethe flooding risk for an area known as the 8.5 Square Mile Area.

DOE reports that all responseactions were complete at 75 sites as of the end of FY2002 at a cost of over $60billion, and that cleanup is expected to be complete at two additional sites by the endof FY2003. However, the sites that have been cleaned up are relatively small and areamong the least hazardous, and the sites where cleanup remains underway containsome of the most severely contaminated areas. DOE has estimated that cleanup atthe remaining sites may take 70 years to complete, and that total cleanup costs mayreach $220 billion if changes to the program are not made. DOE contends that thesecosts could be reduced by $50 billion to $100 billion through the use of risk-basedapproaches to accelerate cleanup schedules. However, DOE's past implementationof risk-based approaches has been criticized as ineffective, and questions have beenraised as to how these goals would be accomplished without weakeningenvironmental standards.", "Five accounts within the annual appropriations bill for Energy and Water Development have traditionally funded DOE's Environmental Management Program. The Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Account fundscleanup and waste management activities at nuclear weapons sites where all responseactions are projected to continue beyond 2006. The Defense Facilities ClosureProjects Account supports cleanup and waste management activities at nuclearweapons sites where all response actions are scheduled to be complete by the end of2006. The Defense Environmental Management Privatization Account funds cleanupand waste management projects at nuclear weapons sites that are performed under\"privatization\" contracts. This contracting approach relies on the private sector toconstruct and operate facilities or conduct cleanup actions on a fixed-price,fee-for-service basis. The Non-Defense Environmental Management Account fundscleanup and waste management activities at civilian nuclear energy research anddevelopment sites. Lastly, the Uranium Facilities Maintenance and RemediationAccount funds the cleanup of uranium and thorium processing sites.", "For FY2003, DOE initially requested a total of $6.7 billion for the above accounts, approximately the same amount as enacted for FY2002. However, $800million of the initial request would have been allocated to a new EnvironmentalManagement Cleanup Reform Account, which would have funded efforts to reducerisk, decrease cleanup costs, and accelerate cleanup schedules. The Administrationbudgeted the majority of the funding for this new account by decreasing support forsites funded under the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste ManagementAccount. Under this approach, funding would have been restored at these sites onlyif compliance agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and thestates were re-negotiated to accelerate cleanup schedules. DOE has long argued thatmany of the requirements under its existing compliance agreements are too costly,ineffective, and unnecessarily time-consuming, and that its agreements need to bere-examined to explore ways to increase the pace of cleanup and reduce costs. Concerns were raised as to whether EPA and the states might agree to weakercleanup standards rather than face the possibility of the loss of funds, which mayhave prevented sites from fulfilling existing agreements.", "To date, DOE has signed letters of intent with EPA and the states to accelerate cleanup at the following sites: the Hanford site in Washington, the Oak Ridge site inTennessee, the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, theNevada Test Site, the Savannah River site in South Carolina, the Pantex site inTexas, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratoriesin New Mexico. On August 2, 2002, the President submitted a budget amendmentto request an additional $300 million in FY2003 to fulfill these new agreements,increasing the request for a new Environmental Management Cleanup ReformAccount to $1.1 billion, and the overall request for the Environmental ManagementProgram to $7.0 billion.", "During the 107th Congress, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on DOE's cleanupreform initiative on July 19, 2002. Jesse Roberson, Assistant Secretary forEnvironmental Management, testified that the objective of the cleanup reforminitiative is to identify and implement more risk-oriented and efficient cleanupapproaches, and that the intent is not to weaken any of DOE's complianceagreements. The General Accounting Office (GAO) testified on the status ofcompliance agreements with EPA and the states at each nuclear waste cleanup site,and indicated that DOE faces challenges in developing and implementing arisk-based method to prioritize cleanup activities due to failed attempts to do so inthe past. GAO also indicated that DOE's reform initiative in some cases couldinvolve \"potential changes in technology or approach that would result in leavingmore of the waste on site than currently planned and thus could significantly reducecleanup costs. In other cases, it could allocate funding using a greater emphasis onrisk reduction, which could shift funding among sites.\" Representatives from thestates of Washington, Idaho, and Tennessee indicated that the letters of intent tore-negotiate cleanup agreements in their states would not result in weakened cleanupstandards, but would provide a framework for cooperation among the partiesinvolved to establish new cleanup goals.", "As signed by the President, the FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations resolution does not allocate any funding to the proposed Environmental Management CleanupReform Account. Instead, the resolution increased funding for the existing DefenseEnvironmental Restoration and Waste Management Account by $926 million abovethe Administration's request of $4.54 billion in order to honor the letters of intent toaccelerate cleanup that DOE had already signed. The increase will be allocatedaccording to the existing structure of site categories within the account. During theappropriations debate, concerns were expressed about providing an unallocated sumfor the reform account due to uncertainties as to how DOE would have divided theamount among various sites. Section 315 of the final bill indicates that none of thefunding for environmental management activities may be obligated at individual sitesthat would be in excess of the amount obligated in FY2002 or requested for FY2003,whichever is greater, unless a performance management plan has been completed forthat site that is consistent with the intent of DOE's environmental management andcleanup reform initiative.", "The level of funding to appropriate for FY2003 for the four other accounts was less controversial. Overall, P.L. 108-7 appropriated nearly $7.0 billion for all fivedefense and non-defense accounts that support DOE's Environmental ManagementProgram. This amount is approximately the same as the Administration's request of$7.0 billion, and is about $290 million more than the enacted FY2002 funding levelof $6.7 billion.", "Civilian Nuclear Waste. The Bush Administration sought $524.7 million for the DOE civilian waste disposalprogram for FY2003, a 40% boost over FY2002.

DOE expects to submit the10,000-page application to NRC in late 2004. The additional funds are also neededfor detailed repository design work, repository performance studies, andtransportation planning, according to DOE. With sufficient funding, according toprogram officials, DOE can begin receiving waste at the site by 2010.", "The House Appropriations Committee recommended the full Administration request, citing enactment of the Yucca Mountain approval resolution discussedbelow. However, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended cutting therequest to $336 million, nearly 10% below the FY2002 level.

Following the recommendation of Energy Secretary Abraham, President Bush onFebruary 15, 2002, recommended to Congress that DOE submit an application toNRC to construct the Yucca Mountain repository. Nevada Governor Guinn thenexercised his right under NWPA to submit a \"notice of disapproval\" (or \"state veto\")to Congress. Under NWPA, the state disapproval blocks the Yucca Mountain siteunless a congressional approval resolution is signed into law within 90 days ofcontinuous session. The approval resolution was signed July 23, 2000( H.J.Res. 87 , P.L. 107-200 ), allowing the Yucca Mountain project toproceed to the licensing phase.", "Funding for the nuclear waste program comes from two sources. Under the FY2003 budget request, $209.7 million was to be provided from the Nuclear WasteFund, which consists of fees paid by nuclear utilities, and $315 million from thedefense nuclear waste disposal account, which pays for disposing of high-level wastefrom the nuclear weapons program in the planned civilian repository. The omnibusbill, P.L. 108-7 , provides $145 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund and $315million from the defense account.", "The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is 12 years later than the Nuclear Waste Policy Act deadline of January 31, 1998, for DOE to begin takingwaste from nuclear plant sites. Nuclear utilities and state utility regulators, upsetover DOE's failure to meet the 1998 disposal deadline, have won two federal courtdecisions upholding the Department's obligation to meet the deadline and tocompensate utilities for any resulting damages. Utilities have also won several casesin the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, although specific damages have not yet beendetermined.", "Power Marketing Administrations. DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) developed out of theconstruction of dams and multi-purpose water projects during the 1930s that areoperated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Theoriginal intention behind many of these projects was conservation and managementof water resources, including irrigation, flood control, recreation and other objectives. However, many of these facilities generated electricity for project needs. The PMAswere established to market the excess power; they are the Bonneville PowerAdministration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), SouthwesternPower Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).", "The power is sold at wholesale to electric utilities and federal agencies \"at the lowest possible rates ... consistent with sound business practice,\" and priority onPMA power is extended to \"preference customers,\" which include municipal utilities,co-ops and other \"public\" bodies. The PMAs do not own the generating facilities,but they generally do own transmission facilities, except for Southeastern. ThePMAs are responsible for covering their expenses and repaying debt and the federalinvestment in the generating facilities.", "The 104th Congress debated sale of the PMAs and did, in 1995, authorize divestiture of one PMA, the Alaska Power Administration. There has been no pressto dispose of the remaining PMAs, and none seems likely given the broaderuncertainties governing electric utility restructuring.", "The Administration's request for SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA for FY2003 was $197.4 million, a reduction from the FY2002 appropriation of $207.3 million. TheSenate Committee on Appropriations recommended $203.5 million, which includedan additional $6.1 million, added to the budget for the Western PowerAdministration, which would be transferred to the Utah Reclamation Mitigation andConservation Commission.

For FY2003, BPA intended to borrow $630.8 million, to be used for transmission systemconstruction, system replacement, energy resources, fish and wildlife, and capitalequipment programs. BPA had requested an additional $2 billion in permanentborrowing authority in the FY2002 budget \"to address critical infrastructure needs,\"but Congress did not support the request.

The nuclear power industry had long contended that the feestructure required nuclear reactor owners to pay for a number of NRC programs, suchas foreign nuclear safety efforts, from which they did not directly benefit. To accountfor that concern, the FY2001 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill included an NRCproposal to phase down the agency's fee recovery to 90% during the subsequent 5years - two percentage points per year.
