The program provides grants to states and territories to enable them to coordinate programs, develop systems, and provide a broad range of direct health services. In addition to block grants to states, the MCH Services Block Grant includes a set-aside for Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS), and another set-aside for the Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) program. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the block grant. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau of HRSA also receives funding for other maternal and child health programs authorized under both Title V of the Social Security Act and the Public Health Service Act, including maternal and infant home visiting and autism services.", "The MCH Services Block Grant received an appropriation of $638.2 million in FY2016. Of that amount, an estimated $550.8 million was for block grants to states (86%), $77.1 million was for SPRANS (12%), and $10.3 million was for CISS (2%). The President's budget requested the same amount for the program in FY2017. Funding for the MCH Services Block Grant is discretionary and subject to the annual appropriations process. Full-year appropriations for FY2017 have yet to be enacted.", "Title V programs, including the MCH Services Block Grant, serve women and children who are covered by public and private insurance, as well as those who have no insurance coverage. MCH Services Block Grant funds are distributed for the purpose of funding core public health services provided by maternal and child health agencies. These core services are often divided into four categories: infrastructure-building, population-based, enabling, and direct health care. A wide array of programs is supported in each of these categories, including newborn screening, health services for children with special health care needs, and immunization programs. Another main objective of the MCH Services Block Grant is to increase pediatric workforce capacity, and to link low-income children and families to other services and programs, such as Medicaid.", "To receive MCH Services Block Grant funds, states are required to (1) conduct a needs assessment every five years; (2) provide an annual report, including program participation data, state maternal and child health measures, and state pediatric and family workforce measures; and (3) ensure that an independent audit is performed every two years. HRSA, in turn, must report to Congress on the activities carried out under the SPRANS and CISS programs, in addition to providing a summary of state reports on block grant activities.", "This report provides MCH Services Block Grant background and funding information. It also includes selected program participation data. Selected maternal and child health indicators are presented to provide readers with context on issues that Congress has sought to address through MCH Services Block Grant funding. Although improvement in these measures is an objective of Title V funding, it is important to note that Title V funding is only one component affecting these measures.

These include the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Services Block Grant; the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; and other funding related to abstinence education, postpartum depression, and personal responsibility education programs. This report focuses on the MCH Services Block Grant, which receives the largest single appropriation under Title V. The MCH Services Block Grant is administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ", "Title V was enacted by Congress in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act (SSA, P.L. 74-271) to promote and support the health of mothers and children. Two grant programs were established under the original Title V of the SSA, to enable states (1) to improve maternal and child health services, especially those in low-income and rural areas, and (2) to extend and improve services for crippled children. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA, P.L. 99-272 ) replaced the term \"crippled\" with the term \"children with special health care needs.\" Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) are defined by HRSA as \"those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally.\"", "Over time, additional programs targeting children with special health care needs and low-income women and children were added to the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the SSA, including certain services for children with disabilities who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI, formerly \u00a71615 [c] of the SSA); lead-based paint poisoning prevention programs (formerly \u00a7316 of the PHSA); genetic disease programs (formerly \u00a71101 of the PHSA); sudden infant death syndrome programs (formerly \u00a71121 of the PHSA); hemophilia treatment centers (formerly \u00a71131 of the PHSA); and adolescent pregnancy grants ( P.L. 95-626 ).", "Title V was converted to the MCH Services Block Grant in 1981 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA). OBRA 1981 consolidated the existing categorical programs listed above into a single block grant. The consolidated block grant was intended to give the states more flexibility in determining how to use federal funds to address maternal and child health needs. It required that each state receive, at a minimum, the combined funding of the programs that were consolidated under OBRA 1981. Additional changes were made to the block grant under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989; these changes increased the authorization of appropriations, called for greater accountability, and created stricter rules for application and reporting requirements for the states, including the addition of a statewide needs assessment requirement. ", "The MCH Services Block Grant currently has three components: block grants to states, a set-aside for Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS), and another set-aside for the Community-Integrated Services Systems (CISS) program. The MCH Services Block Grant was appropriated $638.2 million in funding for FY2016.

Beyond these broad requirements, states determine the actual services provided under the block grant. Services funded by the block grant may include prenatal care, well-child care, dental care, immunization, family planning, and vision and hearing screening services. They may also include inpatient services for children with special health care needs, screening services for lead-based poisoning, and counseling services for parents of sudden infant death syndrome victims. Block grant funding is also used to support school-based health centers. ", "Title V programs, including the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, serve women and children who are covered by public and private insurance, as well as those who have no insurance coverage. For the purposes of allocating block grant funds for this program, low-income mothers and children are defined as those with family income below 100% of federal poverty guidelines. However, due to the broad reach of Title V programs and services, this definition is used only in the allocation formula, and not as a criterion for receiving Title V-funded services.

These core services are often presented as a four-level pyramid. The four levels of services are infrastructure building, population-based, enabling, and direct health care, as illustrated in Figure 1 . Infrastructure building services, which are at the base of the pyramid, are foundation-building activities that provide for the development and maintenance of health services systems. Infrastructure building services increase a health system capacity by supporting training and other workforce development activities, coordinating health care systems and data system architecture, providing funding for applied research, and developing guidelines. Population-based services promote core public health functions such as universal screening, health promotion, and disease prevention campaigns. Population-based services include newborn screening, lead screening, immunization, oral health, and injury prevention. Enabling services provide access to services for vulnerable populations, including those with special health care needs. Enabling services are services that facilitate access to care, such as case management, transportation, purchase of insurance, and coordination with other programs. Direct health care services provided under Title V are intended to fill the gaps in primary and preventive health care that are not otherwise available through other funding sources or providers, such as private insurance, Medicaid, or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). ", "In FY2015, the largest category of expenditures nationwide under the block grant was direct health care services for low-income mothers and children and children with special health care needs (63.3%), followed by enabling services (18.7%), population-based services (10.5%), and infrastructure (7.6%). Although the expenditures nationwide are inverse to their location in the MCH pyramid, the distribution of funds between service categories varies widely by state and depends on the needs of each state's population. Additionally, direct health care services may cost more per person served than other services. Distribution of funds depends on the needs of the states' populations, and the gaps left by other health and social service programs that are identified by the states.

States may not use the block grant funds to provide cash payments to recipients of health services, or for the purchase of land, facilities, or major medical equipment. Further, states may not use funds to satisfy any requirement for the expenditure of federal funds, and may not transfer block grant funds to any other program.

State block grant administrators must also coordinate with other related programs, including the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); related education programs; and other health, developmental disability, and family planning programs. ", "Coordination varies among states and jurisdictions. Most state MCH and Medicaid agencies have created interagency agreements that outline the expected areas and levels of coordination between the programs. HRSA's analysis showed a wide variety in the scope and level of formality among interagency agreements. Most states specify the services provided by each agency under the agreement. Commonly, the Title V agency contracts with health providers to provide the services, and the agency administering the state's Medicaid program assumes the responsibility for reimbursement of those services, when possible. States may also include coordination with other services, such as WIC, under the agreement. HRSA's 2008 analysis recommended specific components for interagency agreements and provided a model interagency agreement.

", "CDC's National Center for Health Statistics has published the most recently available single-year linked birth and death certificate information on IMR. Comparing data from both HRSA and CDC, the data show similar variability in rates by state and region. IMR is generally higher in the South and Midwest, and lower in other regions. Of the 50 states, Mississippi had the highest IMR (9.97 per 1,000 live births) and New Hampshire had the lowest (3.95 per 1,000 live births) in 2008.", "A number of health and social factors affect IMR. Risk factors for infant mortality, including higher rates of teenage births, prematurity, and inadequate prenatal care in the first trimester, disproportionately affect low-income families. Thus, the infant mortality rate is generally higher among Medicaid-eligible populations. HRSA data show that, in addition to the state-by-state differences in infant mortality noted above, the disparity in infant mortality between women enrolled in Medicaid and those who are not also varies widely by state. According to 2012 data reported to HRSA by South Dakota, the infant mortality rate for women enrolled in Medicaid was 10.3 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 7.7 per 1,000 for those not in the Medicaid program.

This combination of approaches provides flexibility to states in achieving maternal and child health goals, while allowing both Congress and HRSA to maintain a degree of control in guiding national initiatives. The issues related to the MCH Services Block Grant span the intersection of clinical health services, prevention, and public health, and include optimizing the balance of federal and state resources to achieve the program's objectives, and ensuring program effectiveness and accountability. ", "According to HRSA, the MCH Services Block Grant provided services to over 34 million children in FY2013. Of those children, nearly 15 million had Medicaid or CHIP coverage. Changes to public and private insurance markets under the ACA may affect the number of pregnant women and children served by the block grant, because of expanded Medicaid eligibility, coverage of preventive care without cost-sharing, and provisions for coverage of individuals with preexisting conditions. Some policymakers contend that during this time of transition, the MCH formula block grant and its discretionary grants are integral to assuring the continuity of care and to reducing coverage gaps created by shifts in the insurance eligibility status of individuals. In addition, states may argue that block grant funds can and should be redirected to meet other maternal and child health goals, and not decreased, if Medicaid and CHIP coverage expands to those who currently receive block grant-funded services. ", "One general concern with block grants may be that federal funds are being used to address state-specific issues and are not held accountable to national concerns. Congress has addressed the issue of national concerns with MCH Services Block Grant by requiring the SPRANS set-aside. However, states may be best suited to use block grant funds in situations where there is wide variability in burden and cost, as shown by data collected by both HRSA and CDC. Filling in the gaps left by Medicaid and CHIP is one such area, due to variable enrollment eligibility among the states. ", "As mentioned earlier, the indicators discussed in this report are referred to as outcome measures and performance indicators by HRSA, and improvement in these measures is an objective of Title V funding. However, it is important to note that Title V funding is only one component affecting these measures. Other federal and state programs and policies, including Medicaid and WIC, as well as complex societal issues, also affect the health and well-being of low-income children and their families. ", "Progress toward national health objectives, such as reduction of the infant mortality rate, has shown past improvement but has stagnated in recent years. Due to the flexibility of funding, varying circumstances in states, and other societal issues, it is impossible to globally track the direct impact of maternal and child health block grant funds on national health indicators such as IMR. Congress and the executive branch cannot direct states to specifically target one data point, such as IMR, with block grant funding, but may use other approaches. As an alternative to block grant funding, programs such as the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program and Strong Start and targeted national public health initiatives such as CDC's Safe Motherhood and Infant Health program have been promoted by policymakers as direct approaches to improving this particular health objective. Healthy Start, a national program that targets the infant mortality rate in selected communities, has been successful in targeted communities. ", "Some have argued that the decentralized nature of block grants makes it difficult to measure program performance and accountability and to hold state and local governments accountable for their decisions. In addition, the quality of services provided under block grant funding is not currently tracked.
