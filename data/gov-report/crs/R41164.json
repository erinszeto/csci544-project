Based on the agencies' experiences with the first round, and drawing on public comments collected from a November 16, 2009, Joint Request for Information (RFI), both NTIA and RUS streamlined the application process and made significant changes to how the second round of BTOP and BIP would be structured and conducted. Highlights included the following:", "Unlike the first round, each agency had its own separate NOFA, and applicants had the option of applying to either BTOP or BIP, but not to both. NTIA/BTOP primarily focused on middle mile broadband infrastructure projects, while RUS/BIP focused primarily on last mile projects. BTOP reoriented its infrastructure program towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure (CCI) grants, which support middle mile projects serving anchor institutions such as community colleges, libraries, hospitals, universities, and public safety institutions. BIP eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" project category, and offered a standard grant/loan combination (75% grant/25% loan) for all last mile and middle mile projects (unless waivers were sought). The first round requirement that eligible infrastructure projects must cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was eliminated. In the second round, BIP projects were required to cover an area that is at least 75% rural and that does not have High Speed Access broadband service at the rate of 5 Mbps (upstream and downstream combined) in at least 50% of its area. Eligible BTOP projects required only an applicant that is an eligible entity, a fully completed application, and a nonfederal match of 20% or more. However, during the application evaluation, factors such as unserved and underserved areas, remoteness, and delivered speed were considered. BIP added three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance.
