Together, these areas are known informally as \"metropolitan areas\" and officially as \"core-based statistical areas\" (CBSAs); \"core\" refers to a large population concentration that is socially and economically integrated with surrounding territory. Also announced were the standards for delineating New England city and town areas (NECTAs), which are conceptually similar to CBSAs. The 2010 standards supersede those for designating metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas in the decade 2000 to 2010. The terms \"core-based statistical area\" and \"micropolitan\" first were used in the 2000 standards. The current standards have changed only slightly from the previous decade's. Changes include reference to \"delineating,\" instead of \"defining,\" CBSAs and NECTAs; a lower threshold for the automatic combination of two CBSAs; and no further provision for local opinion to influence whether some areas will combine or what titles combined areas will receive.", "CBSAs consist of whole counties and county-equivalents in the United States and Puerto Rico. Each CBSA must contain at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more people (for a metropolitan statistical area) or at least one urban cluster of 10,000 to 49,999 people (for a micropolitan statistical area). CBSAs have one or more principal cities and central counties. Outlying counties are included in CBSAs on the basis of employment and commuting data. Counties that do not qualify for inclusion in CBSAs are classified as \"outside core-based statistical areas.\" The criteria for designating NECTAs closely resemble the CBSA criteria, and NECTAs are either metropolitan or micropolitan, but they are based on cities and towns rather than counties.", "On February 28, 2013, OMB issued the actual lists of CBSAs\u2014the titles of the areas, with their principal city and county components. NECTAs and their components were listed, too. The lists were derived by applying the OMB standards to population data from the 2010 census, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce), as well as employment and commuting data from the Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) estimates for 2006 through 2010. After 2013, updated data are to be used for any changes in the lists.", "In principle, metropolitan area delineations are to be used solely for descriptive, statistical purposes. In practice, however, they can have a use unintended by OMB, in formulas for allocating certain federal grant program funds. For this reason, among other reasons, CBSAs can attract congressional attention because they can be important to congressional constituents.", "No straightforward procedure exists for calculating the exact amount of money distributed through all federal grant programs whose funding formulas incorporate metropolitan area designations, or for determining how changes in these designations might affect the total funding allocated to a specific jurisdiction. Even identifying comprehensively which programs use metropolitan area designations would require reviewing the statutes, regulations, and formulas associated with all programs. If such identification were feasible, it would be only the beginning of any attempt to determine whether inclusion in, or exclusion from, a particular metropolitan area or its components translates directly into an increase or decrease in the money a particular jurisdiction might receive from all federal grant programs whose funding formulas rely on these designations.

Thus, variables like the territory encompassed in an area, the territory excluded, and the area's title can generate interest among diverse constituents, including state and local officials, business groups, and nonprofit organizations. This interest can be heightened insofar as the standards are used in a particular way unintended by OMB, in formulas for allocating certain federal grant program funds.

According to OMB, the standards originated because of the realization, during the 1940s, that \"the value of metropolitan data produced by Federal agencies would be greatly enhanced if agencies used a single set of geographic delineations for the Nation's largest centers of population and activity.\" At the time, agencies were designating \"a variety of statistical geographic areas at the metropolitan level ... using different criteria applied to different geographic units.\" The result was that \"one agency's statistics were not directly comparable with another agency's statistics for any given area.\"", "The U.S. Bureau of the Budget, predecessor to the Office of Management and Budget, \"led the effort to develop what were then called 'standard metropolitan areas' in time for their use in 1950 census publications. Since then, comparable data products for metropolitan areas have been available.\" The first such areas were designated in 1949. The standards were revised in 1958, 1971, 1975, 1980, 1990, and 2000, as well as in 2010. The Bureau of the Budget became OMB in 1970. Responsibility for the standards passed to OMB, where it has remained except from 1977 to 1981, when it rested with the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards in the U.S. Department of Commerce.", "Since the start of the metropolitan areas program, the standards for designating these areas have been reviewed \"and, if warranted, revised ... in the years preceding their application to new decennial census data.\" Examination of the standards for 2000 to 2010 (the 2000 standards), to determine what, if any, revisions of them should occur before the 2010 census, began in 2008, when OMB \"charged the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area Standards Review Committee\" with this task. The Commerce Department's Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau), which, among its other responsibilities as the nation's foremost statistical agency, conducts the decennial census, chaired the committee and \"provided research support.\" Other representatives from the federal statistical system were the Bureau of Economic Analysis (in the Commerce Department), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (in the U.S. Department of Labor), the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (in the U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT), the Economic Research Service (in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA), and the National Center for Health Statistics (in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS).

The terms \"core-based statistical area\" and \"micropolitan\" first were used in the 2000 standards. As OMB explained, the \"general concept of a metropolitan statistical area is that of an area containing a large population nucleus [core] and adjacent communities that have a high degree of integration with that nucleus. The concept of a micropolitan statistical area closely parallels that of the metropolitan statistical area, but a micropolitan statistical area features a smaller nucleus.\" The Federal Register notice also presented the 2010 standards for delineating New England city and town areas (NECTAs), which are conceptually similar to CBSAs. ", "The new standards, superseding those for 2000 to 2010, differ only slightly from the previous decade's and incorporate the changes recommended by the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area Standards Review Committee. One recommendation was that OMB characterize the 2010 standards as being used to \"delineate\" rather than, as in the past, \"define\" the \"boundaries or geographic makeup of an area.\" OMB accepted the change because, in its words, the term \"define\" was not \"intuitive\" to those unfamiliar with the metropolitan areas program and \"occasionally ... caused misunderstandings.\" Other changes are noted below, in the detailed discussion of the 2010 standards.", "Although OMB declared the notice \"effective immediately,\" it did not issue lists showing the actual delineations of CBSAs under the 2010 standards\u2014the titles of the areas, together with their principal city and county components\u2014until February 28, 2013. Newly delineated NECTAs and their components were issued then, too. Producing these lists involved applying the 2010 standards to population data from the 2010 census, as well as employment and commuting data from the Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) estimates for 2006 through 2010.
