Proposed Section 2430, on the other hand, does not mention coercion and permits prosecution when the persuasion, inducement or enticement occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce. Subsection 2422(b) features a jurisdictional element somewhere between the two (i.e., persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion, transmitted using the mail or some facility of interstate or foreign commerce), but it only applies when a child under 18 years of age is so persuaded, induced , enticed, or coerced or when there is an attempt to do so. As a consequence, proposed Section 2430 would prohibit persuasion, inducement or enticement of an adult to engage in a commercial sex act when it would affect interstate commerce.

However, the elements of proposed Section 2429 limit the circumstances under which the offense can be committed overseas, because it outlaws misconduct only when committed within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States or in or affecting the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States.
