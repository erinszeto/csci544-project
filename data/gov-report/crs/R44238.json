As provided in Section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-344 , as amended; referred to below as the Budget Act), the purpose of the reconciliation process is to allow Congress to use an expedited procedure when considering legislation that would bring existing spending, revenue, and debt-limit laws into compliance with current fiscal priorities established in the annual budget resolution. ", "In adopting a budget resolution, Congress is agreeing upon budgetary goals for the upcoming fiscal year (as well as for a period of at least four additional out-years). In some cases, to achieve these goals, Congress must enact legislation that alters current revenue, direct spending, or debt-limit laws. In these situations, Congress seeks to reconcile existing law with current priorities. Since the first use of the reconciliation process in 1980, this expedited procedure has been used to pass 23 reconciliation bills."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reconciliation Instructions and Committee Action", "paragraphs": ["If Congress intends to use the reconciliation process, reconciliation directives (also referred to as reconciliation instructions) must be included in the annual budget resolution. These directives trigger the second stage of the process by instructing individual committees to develop and report legislation that would change laws within their respective jurisdictions related to direct spending, revenue, or the debt limit.", "When a committee is instructed to submit legislation reducing the deficit by a specific amount, that amount is considered a minimum, meaning a committee may report greater net savings. Although there is no procedural mechanism to ensure that legislation submitted by a committee in response to reconciliation instructions will be in compliance with the instructed levels, if a committee does not report legislation\u2014or if such legislation is not in compliance with the reconciliation instructions\u2014procedures are available that would allow either chamber to move forward with reconciliation legislation. In either situation, legislative language that falls within the noncompliant committee's jurisdiction can be added to a reconciliation bill during floor consideration that would bring the bill into compliance with its reconciliation instructions. These methods vary by chamber.", "In developing legislation in response to reconciliation instructions, the policy choices made remain the prerogative of the committee. In some instances, reconciliation directives have been couched in terms of particular options or assumptions regarding how an instructed committee might be expected to achieve its reconciliation target, but such language has not been considered binding on committees and would not be enforceable through points of order.", "Once a specified committee develops legislation, the reconciliation directive may further direct the committee to report the legislation for consideration in the respective chamber or to submit the legislation to the Budget Committee to be included in an omnibus reconciliation measure. Under Section 310(b)(2) of the Budget Act, the Budget Committee is required to mark up and report such omnibus legislation \"without any substantive revision.\" Reported reconciliation legislation is eligible to be considered under expedited procedures in both the House and the Senate. As with all legislation, any differences in the reconciliation legislation passed by the two chambers must be resolved before the bill can be sent to the President for approval or veto.", "Although reconciliation instructions may include target dates, there is no requirement that the Budget Committee\u2014in either chamber\u2014wait for all committees to submit legislative language. Nor is there a requirement for the Budget Committee to report an omnibus reconciliation bill on a specific date. The late response of one or more committees would not cause the bill to lose its privileged status as a reconciliation bill.

", "Individuals and employers that do not comply with the mandates are required to pay penalties, and if the mandates are repealed, the federal government is expected to lose revenue in the form of forgone tax receipts. However, the loss of revenue would not be great as the savings that would be incurred by repealing the mandates, particularly the individual mandate. Eliminating the individual mandate would reduce the number of individuals with coverage (see the text box for more details). This would mean fewer individuals who receive federally subsidized coverage, whether under Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or by receiving federal financial assistance through a health insurance exchange, resulting in budgetary savings for the federal government.", "The individual mandate is often described as working in conjunction with certain ACA market reforms, including guaranteed issue and renewability, nondiscrimination based on health status, coverage of preexisting health conditions, and rating restrictions. These reforms require insurers to accept all applicants and restrict insurers' ability to vary premiums based on an applicant's health status and other characteristics. The individual mandate works in tandem with these reforms by encouraging healthy individuals to participate in the market so that insurers' risk pools are not entirely composed of individuals who are at high risk of using health care services.", "The House reconciliation bill would repeal the individual mandate and the penalty, but it would not modify or repeal any of the ACA market reforms. The concern of many is that this scenario could lead to adverse selection, in which individuals who need health care services purchase coverage and stay in the risk pool while those who do not have the same desire for coverage leave the pool and stop paying premiums. Because health insurance premiums are based on estimated costs for covering a risk pool, this situation could cause the cost of coverage to rise for the remaining participants, thus making coverage even less attractive to those who do not perceive a need for coverage. This pattern could lead to an increasingly expensive risk pool. ", "This concern is particularly salient with respect to the non-group (i.e., individual) market. The ACA market reforms, along with the financial assistance available through the health insurance exchanges, have increased access to non-group coverage. Premiums for non-group coverage would likely increase if the individual mandate were repealed, but accessibility to the non-group market remained the same. CBO and JCT estimate that if the mandate were repealed, premiums for policies sold in the non-group market would increase by about 20% in years after 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employer Mandate", "paragraphs": ["The bill would repeal the ACA's employer shared responsibility provisions (i.e., employer mandate).

Thus, employers no longer would be exposed to a potential tax penalty for not offering affordable and adequate health coverage.", "According to CBO and JCT, elimination of the employer mandate would result in a loss of revenue to the federal government\u2014$166.9 billion over the 2016-2025 period. This revenue loss is partially obscured in the CBO and JCT estimate of the budgetary effect of repealing both the employer mandate and the individual mandate where a net budgetary savings is reported (see Table 1 ). The net budgetary savings is largely the result of repealing the individual mandate, as discussed in the \" Individual Mandate \" section of this report.", "Additionally, CBO and JCT estimate that some employers that are projected to offer health insurance to their employees under current law would no longer do so if the employer mandate were repealed. However, in their projections they estimate that the reduction in offers of employment-based coverage would be mitigated by many employers continuing to offer coverage in order to attract the best available workers at the lowest cost.

As shown in Table 1 , eliminating the tax would result in a loss of revenue to the federal government. CBO and JCT indicate that the loss of revenue is the result of foregone tax receipts as well as less shifting to lower-cost coverage to avoid the tax. ", "The idea that the Cadillac tax would incentivize employers to shift employees into or encourage employees to have lower-cost health coverage is part of the expectation that the tax would help curtail the growth in health care costs. According to a CRS analysis, the tax could, under certain assumptions, lead to an overall decline in national health expenditures of 0.6%-0.9% in 2018 and 2.5%-3.6% in 2024. In other words, the tax could result in a gross reduction in national health expenditures of $7.6-$11.0 billion in 2018 and $41.0-$60.3 billion by 2024.

In contrast, other analysis has found that the tax likely will be passed on to consumers\u2014who are relatively insensitive to price\u2014in the form of higher prices and that the effects of the tax on the share of workers employed in the industry likely will be small. ", "CRS analysis of Census Bureau and JCT data found that roughly half of U.S. medical device production is expected to be exempt from the tax because of the statutory exemptions (e.g., eyeglasses, hearing aids, and contact lenses), the \"retail exemption\" outlined in regulations, or the exemption for exported devices. ", "Although the medical device tax does not meet typical justifications for selective excise taxes, the tax could arguably be better understood within the larger context of financing health reform. Generally, selective excise taxes are justified because a particular behavior causes negative spillover effects to society or because users of a public good or service receive some sort of private benefit. It appears that some justifications for the medical device excise tax could be provided based on traditional economic principles, but the justifications, in most cases, are weak. The device tax could be better understood to meet revenue needs, alongside other ACA taxes and fees on health insurers and pharmaceutical companies that potentially stand to benefit as more people enroll in health insurance as a result of the ACA's reforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Auto-enrollment Requirement", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 3762 would repeal the ACA's requirement that employers with more than 200 full-time employees automatically enroll new employees in coverage and continue coverage for current employees.

It does not receive a direct annual appropriation of any kind.", "CBO estimates that PPFA and its affiliated health clinics receive approximately $450 million annually in federal funds, of which an estimated $390 million is from the Medicaid program. CBO notes that the effect of the one-year federal funding prohibition would be uncertain and that this uncertainty applies to both federal spending and the potential effects on Medicaid beneficiary access to care. According to CBO's analysis, some Medicaid beneficiaries would still use a PPFA affiliate for services, in which case the affiliate would have to use nonfederal funds to provide services. In other cases, the Medicaid beneficiary would access an alternative provider that could be reimbursed with federal Medicaid funds. Finally, some Medicaid beneficiaries could go without services, including preventive screenings and contraceptive services, which could increase costs in the future. ", "The effects of the one-year federal funding prohibition on the operations of PPFA are also uncertain because federal funding is not the entity's sole funding source.

Much of the legislation to ban federal funding for PPFA and its affiliates that was introduced prior to the reconciliation bill included language that would maintain federal funding overall for reproductive health services (and other types of services that PPFA provides). Similar to what was included in these bills, H.R. 3762 would redirect funds to other facilities, such as health centers, on the assumption that these facilities could maintain services for Medicaid beneficiaries who otherwise would have sought services at a PPFA affiliate. CBO estimates of these other bills cast doubt on this assumption as they find reduced access in both the short and longer term and increased federal spending over a 10-year period, mainly because pregnancies were not averted."], "subsections": []}]}}
