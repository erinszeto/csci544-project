The Board works to ensure, for example, that federal agencies avoid taking arbitrary action against employees, exhibiting favoritism, or engaging in reprisals against whistleblowers. The MSPB also aims to promote an effective federal workforce free of certain types of discrimination and other prohibited personnel practices. While the Board mainly carries out its mission through adjudication of federal employment-related disputes, it also performs specified oversight functions related to federal employment, including conducting special studies of the civil service and other executive branch merit systems.", "Established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the MSPB consists of three Board members, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Not more than two Board members may be adherents of the same political party. The term of office of each Board member is seven years, and terms are nonrenewable. Board members may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. The Board operates concurrently with the Office of Special Counsel, an independent, prosecutorial federal agency. The Special Counsel receives and investigates complaints related to certain kinds of federal agency misconduct and may petition the Board for corrective action.", "The MSPB operates like a tribunal and maintains procedures for conducting hearings, examining evidence, and rendering decisions. Most cases the Board reviews are federal employee appeals of adverse actions, including those related to removal or suspension of employment. When the MSPB determines that a federal employee has been subject to an improper adverse action, the Board can issue orders that compel agencies to reverse these actions and, depending upon the particular agency action in question, may order relief, including reinstatement, backpay, and attorney's fees.", "The Board also maintains original jurisdiction over certain types of cases in which it hears and decides the case initially rather than reviews an agency decision. For example, the MSPB may adjudicate cases brought by the Office of Special Counsel related to a prohibited personnel practice. The Special Counsel may, among other things, petition the Board for a stay of an adverse employment action in relation to this practice. Some of the Board's adjudicatory functions, including appeals of adverse action decisions, typically are carried out by \"administrative judges\" employed by the Board, while administrative law judges (ALJs) may examine matters coming under the Board's original jurisdiction.", "Federal employees or applicants for employment who are adversely affected by a final order or decision of the MSPB may obtain judicial review. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) is generally the proper judicial forum for these cases. Federal law compels the Federal Circuit to examine these cases under a standard of review that is deferential to the MSPB's determination. Consequently, the Federal Circuit typically upholds Board decisions. But a special jurisdictional rule exists for so-called \"mixed cases\" involving an alleged violation of federal antidiscrimination laws in connection with an improper adverse personnel action. Following the MSPB's decision in a mixed case, affected employees may seek judicial review in federal district court rather than the Federal Circuit. District court review is generally preferable for the petitioning federal employee, as district courts typically review these discrimination-related claims under a de novo standard (i.e., affording no deference to the determination of the MSPB).", "Since March 2019, the Board has lacked sitting members. Lack of a quorum prevents the Board from performing some of its review functions, including issuing final decisions in cases when an initial decision issued by an administrative judge has been appealed to the full Board.

Under the \"spoils system\" that existed in the first century of the Republic, \"federal employees came and went, depending upon party service and changing administrations, rather than meritorious performance.\" In response to the \"strong discontent with the corruption and inefficiency of the patronage system of public employment,\" Congress passed the Civil Service Act of 1883, also known as the Pendleton Act, which generally created a merit-based system for hiring federal employees. More specifically, the Act established a Civil Service Commission (CSC) authorized to aid the President in preparing suitable civil service rules for open, competitive examinations of applicants for federal employment. Over the next few decades, Congress enacted additional measures addressing issues such as merit hiring, due process rights, and appeals of agency adverse personnel actions, and the CSC played an increasingly larger role in implementing these requirements.", "Even so, some Members of Congress and others expressed concerns with the regulatory structure of the civil service system. One central criticism of this structure involved the CSC and its simultaneous handling of managerial and adjudicatory matters. A 1978 Senate committee report described the issue: ", "At the present time the Civil Service Commission has a variety of functions . . . The CSC must now simultaneously serve as a management agent for a President elected through a partisan political process as well as the protection of the merit system from partisan abuse. The Commission serves, too, as the provider of services to agency management in implementing personnel programs, while maintaining sufficient neutrality to adjudicate disputes between agency managers and their employees. As a result, the Commission's performance of its conflicting functions has suffered. Expected to be all things to all parties\u2014Presidential counsellor, merit \"watchdog,\" employee protector, and agency advisory\u2014the Commission has become progressively less credible in all of its roles.", "In response to these and other issues, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), the most comprehensive reform of the civil service system since the Pendleton Act and the current legal framework governing the federal civilian workforce. As part of this reform, and in conjunction with an earlier reorganization plan developed by President Carter, the CSRA split the functions of the Commission between two separate new agencies, OPM and the MSPB. In general, the CSRA charged OPM with conducting personnel management functions formerly performed by the CSC, such as providing training and productivity programs, examining for civil service positions, classifying positions, and administering pay and benefits. The MSPB retained the CSC's hearing, adjudication, and appeals functions, as well as authority to enforce agency compliance with its decisions.

In Kaplan v. Conyers , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) interpreted the holding in Egan expansively.

While the Board acknowledged that the management of the federal workforce and the maintenance of discipline among its members are not among its functions, it maintained that it did have the authority to mitigate a penalty when it determines that the penalty is clearly excessive, disproportionate to the sustained charges, or arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Noting that this authority had previously been vested in the CSC and was not altered by the CSRA, the Board identified factors that are relevant for consideration when evaluating the appropriateness of a penalty. These factors include the nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relationship to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, and the employee's past disciplinary record.

The court observed that chapter 43 prescribes certain standards that do not apply to actions involving misconduct, such as a lighter burden of proof to sustain agency action.

According to a 2019 MSPB report, over the past few years, the Federal Circuit has affirmed Board decisions in 93 to 96 percent of the cases it reviewed.", "Courts have also acknowledged that the CSRA, as amended, provides the Federal Circuit with exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of MSPB final decisions. However, one central exception to this exclusivity, found under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702, is for so-called \"mixed cases\" involving allegations of federal antidiscrimination laws in connection with an improper adverse personnel action. Following the MSPB's decision in a mixed case, affected employees may seek judicial review in federal district court, rather than the Federal Circuit. District court review may be preferable for the petitioning federal employee, as district courts generally review these discrimination-related claims under a de novo standard (i.e., affording no deference to the determination of the MSPB). ", "While this special jurisdictional rule for mixed cases may appear straightforward, courts have grappled with its application in a variety of circumstances. Two recent Supreme Court decisions, Kloeckner v. Solis and Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board , illustrate some of the issues that courts have confronted with respect to the judicial review of MSPB decisions involving mixed cases. The Court in Kloeckner considered the proper judicial forum when the Board dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds. Although the Federal Circuit generally held that the appropriate forum for review was the district court if the MSPB dismissed a mixed case on the merits, other courts reached varying conclusions with respect to cases dismissed by the MSPB for procedural reasons. In Kloeckner , a former Labor Department employee filed a discrimination claim with the agency, and the employee was subsequently terminated from her position. The employee filed her case with the MSPB, but the Board dismissed her claim as untimely. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Kagan, the Supreme Court examined the statutory language in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702 and held that when the MSPB decides a mixed case, the proper forum for review is the district court, irrespective of whether the MSPB dismissed the case on the merits or procedural grounds.", "The Court in Perry also explored the judicial review of mixed case appeals, particularly in situations where the MSPB dismissed a case for lack of Board jurisdiction. Traditionally, lower courts had commonly held that the Federal Circuit, and not a district court, was the appropriate court to hear these types of cases. In Perry , a U.S. Census Bureau employee received notice that he would be removed from his position for poor attendance. After the employee and the agency reached a settlement involving suspension from service and early retirement, the employee appealed to the MSPB. The MSPB found that the employee's separation from service was voluntary, and, therefore, not an issue that the Board had jurisdiction to examine. The employee appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit), but the court transferred the case to the Federal Circuit. ", "In a 6-2 decision penned by Justice Ginsburg, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the D.C. Circuit. Similar to Kloeckner , the Court's opinion hinged on its interpretation of the statutory language in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702, under which district court review of a mixed case applies only when an employee \"(A) has been affected by an action which the employee . . . may appeal to the [MSPB] and \"(B) alleges . . . discrimination.\" While the federal government had argued for purposes of this section that a case constitutes a mixed case only if the employee \"may appeal to the Board,\" the Court rejected this argument. Instead, the Court declared that under this language, what matters is not what the MSPB determined about its ability to hear an appeal, but rather \"the nature of an employee's claim that he had been \"'affected by an action [appealable] to the [MSPB]'\" (in this case, suspension and removal).", "The Court also relied on its decision in Kloe c kner and found that when it comes to mixed cases, there was nothing in the statutory language that demonstrated Congress's intent to treat jurisdictional dismissals differently from other types of MSPB dismissals. Accordingly, the Kloe c kner and Perry decisions both arguably demonstrate that despite MSPB's grounds for dismissing a mixed case, if an employee (or a former employee) \"complains of serious adverse action prompted . . . by the employing agency's violation of federal antidiscrimination laws,\" the appropriate forum for judicial review is the district court.", "In recent years, Congress has passed legislation that, for some types of cases, expressly extends judicial review of MSPB decisions beyond the Federal Circuit. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 addressed MSPB appeal rights for Veterans Affairs Department employees who have been suspended, demoted, or removed from federal service for performance or misconduct. Among other things, the act specifies that employees may appeal a decision of the MSPB to the Federal Circuit or any court of appeals of competent jurisdiction. Additionally, in 2018, Congress passed the All Circuit Review Act, which extends judicial review of MSPB decisions in certain whistleblower and other retaliation cases not only to the Federal Circuit, but also to federal circuit court of appeals. This act is a permanent extension of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, as amended, which provided for this expanded jurisdiction for a period that terminated on November 26, 2017. According to the Office of Special Counsel, the new Act will, among other things, promote more \"robust implementation of whistleblower protection laws.\" The Special Counsel further maintained that given the number of district and appellate courts that will now be hearing these cases, \"[d]iffering interpretations may result in 'circuit splits,' which make it more likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will take up questions that arise regarding how these important laws are applied.
