Many analysts attribute this to changed attitudes about fertility and marriage. They find that many adult women and teenage girls no longer feel obliged to marry before, or as a consequence of, having children. With respect to men, it appears that one result of the so-called sexual revolution is that many men now believe that women can and should control their fertility via contraception or abortion and have become less willing to marry the women they impregnate.", "Factors that are associated with the unprecedented level of nonmarital childbearing include an increase in the median age of first marriage (i.e., marriage postponement), decreased childbearing of married couples, increased marital dissolution, an increase in the number of cohabiting couples, increased sexual activity outside of marriage, participation in risky behaviors that often lead to sex, improper use of contraceptive methods, and lack of marriageable partners.", "This report analyzes the trends in nonmarital childbearing, discusses some of the characteristics of unwed mothers, addresses some issues involving the fathers of children born outside of marriage, covers many of the reasons for nonmarital childbearing, examines the impact of nonmarital births on families and on the nation, and presents the public policy interventions that have been used to prevent nonmarital births or ameliorate some of the negative financial consequences that are sometimes associated with nonmarital childbearing.

Many analysts attribute this to changed attitudes about fertility and marriage. They find that many adult women and teenage girls no longer feel obliged to marry before, or as a consequence of, having children. During the 66-year period from 1940 to 2006, the percentage of births to unmarried women increased by a multiple of nine, from 3.8% in 1940 to 38.5% in 2006. This represented about 1.6 million children in 2006.", "\"Nonmarital births\" can be first births, second births, or higher-order births; they can precede a marriage or occur to a woman who has never married. \"Nonmarital births\" can occur to divorced or widowed women. Moreover, a woman with several children may have had one or more births within marriage and one or more births outside of marriage. Many of the children born outside of marriage are raised by a single parent (who may or may not have a \"significant other\").", "Parents and family life are the foundation that influences a child's well-being throughout the child's development and into adulthood. The family also is the economic unit that obtains and manages the resources that meet a child's basic needs while also playing an instrumental role in stimulating the child's cognitive, social, and emotional development. Children born outside of marriage often are raised solely by their mothers, but sometimes live in other types of family situations. Some are raised solely by their fathers, some are raised by both biological parents who are not married to each other (i.e., cohabiting). Others may be raised by a mother who is living with a male partner. Still others may be living with a mother who is divorced from someone other than their father. Additionally, some may be living with a mother whose husband died (i.e., the mother is a widow but the child was not fathered by the deceased husband).", "Although most children who grow up in mother-only families, father-only families, step-parent families, or families in which the mother is cohabiting with a male partner become well-adjusted, productive adults, a large body of research indicates that children who grow up with only one biological parent in the home are more likely to be financially worse off and have worse socioeconomic outcomes (even after income differences are taken into account) compared to children who grow up with both biological parents in the home. To emphasize, this research indicates that all family situations in which both biological parents are not living together (regardless of whether the mother is divorced, separated, widowed, or was never married) are more likely to result in less favorable outcomes for children than a family situation in which the child is living in a household with both biological parents. It is also noteworthy that some researchers conclude that even among children living with both biological parents, living with married parents generally results in better outcomes for children than living with cohabiting parents mainly because marriage is a more stable and longer lasting situation than cohabitation.", "The federal concern about nonmarital childbearing centers on its costs via claims on public assistance. These federal costs primarily reflect the fact that many of these \"nonmarital children\" are raised in single-parent families that are financially disadvantaged. Federal concern also arises because of the aforementioned research indicating that children living in single-parent families are more likely to face negative outcomes (financially, socially, and emotionally) than children who grow up with both of their biological parents in the home.

This section presents some of the major findings of the report.", "After stabilizing in the 1990s, nonmarital births are again increasing. In 2006, 38.5% of all births were nonmarital births. This surpasses the percentage in 1960 that prompted some policymakers to claim that the black family was disintegrating because a large share of nonmarital births were to black women. In 2006, 70.7% of African American births were nonmarital births compared with 64.6% of American Indian births, 49.9% of Hispanic births, 26.6% of white births, and 16.3% of Asian births. Nonmarital births can be first births, second births, or higher-order births; they can precede a marriage or occur to a woman who has never married. Nonmarital births can occur to divorced or widowed women. Moreover, a woman with several children may have had one or more births within marriage and one or more births outside of marriage. After declining for 14 straight years, all teen births increased in 2006. Contrary to public perception, women in their early twenties, not teens, have the highest percentage of births outside of marriage. In 2005, women ages 20 through 24 accounted for 38% of the 1.5 million nonmarital births. The comparable statistic for females under age 20 was 23%. However, many women who have nonmarital births in their twenties were also teen moms. Births to teenagers are an important component of nonmarital births because more than 80% of births to teenagers are nonmarital births. Although women have been postponing marriage, women of all ages do not view marriage as a requirement for sexual activity. With the longer time span between the onset of sexual activity and marriage, the trend of high numbers of nonmarital births may/could continue. Although nonmarital births are increasing, many more children than in previous decades live with both biological parents in cohabiting situations for some period of time. According to analysts, marriage is considered a better option for children than cohabitation because marriage is more stable (i.e., lasts longer) than cohabiting situations. Growing up in a single-parent family is one of many factors that put children at risk of less favorable outcomes. The economic, social, psychological, and emotional costs associated with children with absent noncustodial parents are significant. Nevertheless, most children who grow up in single-parent families become productive adults. Children living in a single-parent home are more likely to do poorly in school, have emotional and behavioral problems, become teenage parents, and have poverty-level income (as children and adults) compared to children living with married biological parents. In 2007, 67.8% of the 73.7 million U.S. children (under age 18) lived with both of their married parents, 2.9% lived with both parents who were not married, 17.9% lived with their mother, and 2.6% lived with their father. The advent of multiple relationships that produce children adds complexity to the problem. These relationships, often referred to as multiple partner fertility (i.e., when mothers and fathers have had children with more than one partner), generally complicate the family situation of children. Compared to women without nonmarital children, women with children who were born outside of marriage are less like to marry; if they do marry, their spouses are more likely to be economically disadvantaged. Demographically, without nonmarital births, the U.S. would be far below population replacement levels. Having the birth rate reach the replacement rate is generally considered desirable by demographers and sociologists because it means a country is producing enough young people to replace and support aging workers without population growth being so high that it taxes national resources. Nonmarital births are expected to increase over time because of a projected population shift toward more minorities. The Census Bureau projects that by 2050, 54% of the U.S. population will consist of minority groups (i.e., Hispanics, blacks, Indians, and Asians). Minorities, now roughly one-third of the U.S. population, are expected to become the majority in 2042, with the nation projected to be 54% minority in 2050. By 2023, minorities will represent more than half of all children. The Hispanic population is projected to nearly triple, and its share of the nation's total population is projected to double, from 15% to 30%. Thus, nearly one in three U.S. residents will be Hispanic. In 2005, 48% of Hispanic births were nonmarital births."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trends in Nonmarital Births: 1940-2006", "paragraphs": ["In this report, births to unmarried women are termed nonmarital births.

Whereas, in 2005, 83% of the 414,593 babies born to teens (ages 15 to 19) were born to unwed teens. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that marriage in the teen years, which was not uncommon in the 1950s, has become quite rare.

As a result, many men have become less willing to marry the women they impregnate.", "There are myriad reasons why so many children live in homes without their fathers. Some reasons are related to choices people make about fertility, marriage, and cohabitation. But others are the result of unexpected events, such as illness, or incarceration. Some noncustodial fathers are active in the lives of their children, whereas others are either unable or unwilling to be involved in their children's lives. Whatever the reason, a father's absence from the home results in social, psychological, emotional, and financial costs to children and economic costs to the nation. A 2008 report maintains that the federal government spends about $99.8 billion per year in providing financial and other support (via fourteen federal social welfare programs) to father-absent families.", "This section of the report discusses the race and ethnicity of fathers to children born outside of marriage, age of fathers, and the importance of establishing paternity for children born outside of marriage.

Once paternity is established legally (through a legal proceeding, an administrative process, or voluntary acknowledgment), a child gains legal rights and privileges. Among these may be rights to inheritance, rights to the father's medical and life insurance benefits, and to social security and possibly veterans' benefits. It also may be important for the health of the child for doctors to have knowledge of the father's medical history.

The poorest demographic group in the U.S. consists of children in single-parent families. Paternity establishment generally is seen as a means to promote the social goals of (1) providing for the basic financial support of all minor children regardless of the marital status of their parents, (2) ensuring equity in assessing parental liability for the financial support of their children, and (3) promoting responsibility for the consequences of one's actions.", "Many observers maintain that the social, psychological, emotional, and financial benefits of having one's father legally identified are irrefutable.

In effect, although some women may have sexual relations with certain men, it does not mean that they consider those men to be viable marriage partners.

The AFL program authorizes grants for three types of demonstrations: (1) projects that provide \"care\" services only (i.e., health, education, and social services to pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, their infant, families, and male partners); (2) projects that provide \"prevention\" services only (i.e., services to promote abstinence from premarital sexual relations for pre-teens, teens, and their families); and (3) projects that provide a combination of care and prevention services.

In 2005, almost 20% of the women ages 40 and older who gave birth had a child born outside of marriage. For women ages 20 through 24, the percentage was almost 60%. These figures reflect the new paradigm of women in all age groups, not just teenagers, having children outside of marriage. Some observers and analysts assert that new strategies that account for this new paradigm must be developed to significantly reduce nonmarital births. Others argue that the nation must decide whether to try to change the fertility behavior of women in their thirties and forties.

Moreover, national data from the 2002 panel of the National Survey of Family Growth indicate that 14% of white men, 32% of black men, and 15% of Hispanic men had children with more than one woman.

For example, children with the same mother and different fathers may potentially face less desirable outcomes if their mother marries the biological father of their half-brothers or half-sisters.", "The advantages married couples and their children have over those in other living arrangements led the Bush Administration and Congress to propose marriage promotion initiatives.

Both the healthy marriage programs and the responsible fatherhood programs were funded by the same legislation (i.e., P.L. 109-171 under the auspices of the TANF block grant program). The rationale for implementing these two approaches in a complementary manner was to promote the best interest of children.", "Although there was some animosity between proponents of healthy marriage programs and proponents of responsible fatherhood programs when they were debated during the period from 2001 through 2005, there is a growing consensus that the two programs can be implemented in a complementary manner to promote the best interest of children. Some of the impact analysis on the two programs, based on scientifically designed evaluations with experimental and control groups, is to be completed during the next Congress. This may help the 111 th Congress and the new Administration to determine whether or not they need to shift priorities between the programs, redistribute funding, or make other changes that will improve the effectiveness of both programs.", "Similarly, there is now some discussion about a middle ground between abstinence education and comprehensive sex education. Some call this approach abstinence-plus. Under the abstinence-plus education approach, participants are given a hierarchy of safe-sex strategies. At the top of the hierarchy is the promotion of sexual abstinence as the safest route to pregnancy prevention and HIV and STD prevention. Recognizing that some participants will not be abstinent, the abstinence-plus approach encourages individuals to use condoms and to adopt other safer-sex strategies. Proponents of the abstinence-plus approach contend that it does not encourage teens or young adults to have more sex, it just encourages them to do so safely if they do have sex. Some policymakers maintain that this middle ground approach accepts the reality that sexual activity among older teens and young adults is an entrenched by-product of today's society. They argue that it is not bad policy but rather good planning to educate persons who thought they would remain abstinent until marriage, but do not, with the appropriate information regarding contraceptive methods. They contend that an abstinence-plus education approach is in the best interest of young people and in the best interest of the nation.", "As mentioned earlier, no federal funding is specifically earmarked for comprehensive sex education. Some observers contend that the debate over abstinence-only education versus comprehensive sex education will likely continue for several more years. They surmise that the issue of which approach is more appropriate and more effective for adolescents and older teens may receive renewed attention by the 111 th Congress and the new Administration. They also note that the abstinence-plus approach may be further scrutinized within the context of the debate on abstinence-only versus comprehensive sex education."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
