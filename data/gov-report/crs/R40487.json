Natural gas continues to be a major fuel supply for the United States, supplying about 24% of total energy in 2008.", "The year began with a relatively tight demand/supply balance, and this generated upward spot price movement. For the 2007-2008 heating season, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a price increase of more than 30% (beginning to end of season). The key \"benchmark\" price for the United States, the Henry Hub spot price, generally rose through the first half of 2008 to a peak of $13.32 per million British thermal units (Btu) on July 3, 2008. By the end of 2008, the Henry Hub spot price had decreased 56% to $5.83 per million Btu, lower than the $7.83 per million Btu price on January 2, 2008.", "Closer to consumers, the EIA average citygate price increased 47% from January to $12.08 per million Btu in July and then decreased to $7.94 per million Btu as of December, a 2% drop from the start of 2008. Residential consumers saw a 68% increase through July and then a decline that had December 5% above January's average price.", "The supply outlook for the lower-48 states began a potentially important change in 2008. Onshore production in Texas and the Rocky Mountain region increased by 15%, especially because of the production of unconventional natural gas (e.g., deep shale gas).", "Noteworthy events in 2008:", "The national natural gas market experienced an unusual price pattern in the first half of the year, with EIA reporting average citygate (delivery area) prices lower than Henry Hub (supply area) spot prices. The normal pattern is the prices in delivery areas, which include transportation costs, are higher than supply area prices. Lower-48 onshore natural gas production increased 10% to reach more than 20.5 trillion cubic feet, a level not achieved since 1974. This production, along with other factors such as the weakened economy, appears to have prevented the 350 Bcf of lost gas production due to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico from increasing prices. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports decreased 54% from the record level in 2007. Average use was less than 10% of reported capacity at operational LNG import facilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved another 2 Bcf per day of new import facilities in 2008. Gas for power use decreased 2.4% from 2007 and electric power remained the largest end use category for natural gas consumption for a second year.", "Going forward, current economic turbulence may contribute to natural gas market challenges, in terms of investment or attempts at market mischief. Vigilance in market oversight could grow in importance."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Natural gas markets in North America had a tumultuous year in 2008. This contrasted with the relative stability of 2007. In early 2008, the market tightened and prices moved up. In the summer, supply area spot prices went much higher than in the past, then decreased through the rest of the year to end lower than at the start of the year.", "This report examines current conditions and trends in the U.S. natural gas markets. Key market elements examined include prices, consumption, production, imports, and infrastructure. Expectations about the future, as reflected in recent official forecasts, are also incorporated here.", "Natural gas remains an important and environmentally attractive energy source for the United States and supplied approximately 24% of total U.S. energy in 2008. Domestic supply has recently increased significantly. New developments in Alaska increase the likelihood that a pipeline from the North Slope will proceed, although uncertainty remains regarding this undertaking. The natural gas industry continues to attract capital for new pipeline and storage infrastructure to link shifting loads and supply sources.", "In 2008, liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports decreased 54% from the record levels of 2007, decreasing already low utilization factors at import facilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved two more major import terminals in 2008.", "Given the generally adequate functioning of natural gas markets, congressional attention may address development of new supply sources (such as deep shale gas), unexpected price volatility or behavior, or import and other supply issues. In the longer term, industry pressure for increased access to public lands for exploration and production may continue as a policy concern.", "This report reviews key factors likely to affect market outcomes. These factors include weather, the economy, oil prices, and infrastructure development. Table A -1 to Table A -6 (in Appendix A ) present selected highlight statistics that illustrate current market status.", "Briefly, important developments in natural gas markets during 2008 include the following:", "Domestic natural gas production increased to 20.5 trillion cubic feet, the most since 1974. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike reduced Gulf of Mexico production but did not affect market prices significantly. There was an unusual price pattern in the first half of 2008, with citygate (delivered) prices lower than Henry Hub spot prices. Citygate prices have seldom exceeded Henry Hub prices. The natural gas spot price at Henry Hub peaked on July 3, 2008, at $13.32 per million Btu and declined to under $6 by end of year. During the 2007-2008 heating season (October to March), average wellhead prices increased more than 30%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Natural gas for power has reduced seasonal variation in use because gas-for-power peaks in summer, versus the total natural gas use peak in winter. The power generation sector used more natural gas than any other sector in 2008 and 2007. Storage levels towards the end of the 2007-2008 heating season dropped below five year averages. In the first storage report after the 2007-2008 heating season, working gas storage was at 1,234 billion cubic feet (Bcf) \u2013 the lowest level since April 30, 2004. However, as of December 2008, working gas storage was at 2,840 Bcf. LNG imports in 2008 dropped 54% from the 2007 record level of 77.1 billion cubic feet. The future outlook is uncertain. FERC approved 2 import facilities in 2008, with an import capacity increase of 2 billion cubic feet per day. Natural gas infrastructure development continued to advance, with more pipeline and storage projects successfully completed in 2007 and more underway in 2008. Industrial gas use had some growth in 2008, continuing increases since 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Unlike the global oil market, natural gas markets remain generally regional, with global trade in LNG growing. For the most part, North America has a continent-wide market that is integrated through a pipeline network that connects the lower-48 states, the most populous provinces of Canada, and parts of Mexico. Prices throughout this integrated market are influenced by demand (which may be influenced by weather, economic conditions, alternative fuel prices, and other factors), supply, and the capacity available to link supply sources and demand loads (transmission and distribution systems).", "The U.S. natural gas market is the major component of the North American natural gas market. It accounts for about 81% of North American consumption and about 70% of North American supply.", "The key price point in North America is Henry Hub. Henry Hub is a major pipeline hub near Erath, Louisiana, that is used as the designated pricing and delivery point for the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) gas futures contracts and other transactions. The price difference between other locations and Henry Hub is called the \"basis differential.\" When there is spare capacity available to move natural gas from Henry Hub, or the Gulf of Mexico region in general, to the relevant price point area, the basis differential tends to be low, approximating the costs of fuel used to move the gas to the location. When capacity availability is tight, basis differentials can grow because the driving force can become the value of the natural gas at the delivery point, rather than the cost of getting the natural gas to that point.", "Natural gas prices also incorporate costs for distributing the gas from the wholesale marketplace to retail customers. These rates are generally determined by state regulators and involve both (1) the approval of costs and rates of return and (2) the allocation of costs among customer classes (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial firm, industrial interruptible).", "Although the North American natural gas market remains a distinct regional market, it is connecting to a global gas marketplace through international LNG trade.

From there, the gas generally moves to markets to the north (e.g. Chicago), to the east (e.g. New York), or around the Gulf (e.g. Florida). This transmission to market generally leads to a transport cost add-on and a higher price at the delivery point.", "Since the Henry Hub spot price was first reported in 1993 until 2008, this price has exceeded the EIA citygate (delivered price) in only eleven months (see Figure A -1 in Appendix A ). In the first half of 2008, the Henry Hub spot price exceeded the EIA reported citygate price in three consecutive months (April, May, and June).", "The spot price at Henry Hub appears to have increased quickly in the first half of 2008, and this price at Henry Hub (a supply area price benchmark) actually exceeded the EIA estimated average citygate (the \"delivery points\" in consumption areas) price. CRS has found no discussion of this price anomaly in market monitoring documents from that period. One possible explanation for this anomaly is that the citygate price includes multi-month contracted-for supplies that would include natural gas from earlier months when prices were lower than the current spot price.

Nevertheless, new U.S. LNG infrastructure went into service in 2008 and still more received approvals from FERC. To compete effectively for supply in the global LNG market, natural gas prices at the U.S. delivery points would have to increase to attract LNG deliveries. Location of import facilities is an important factor in the value of landed LNG. The United States appears more likely to be receiver-of-last-resort for LNG shipments in the near-to-mid term than to outbid Europeans, given the recent interruptions in Russian supplies. On the other hand, lack of storage in Europe and Asia may lead to continued U.S. receipts of LNG, even at relatively low prices, because new LNG export facilities serving the Atlantic Basin are expected to reach completion soon.", "EIA forecasts an increase of less than 20 Bcf of LNG for 2009 to 369 Bcf.

Interestingly, some continue to call for more storage because of the growing consumption of natural gas, thinking that higher consumption levels require more storage volume. The decrease in the seasonal swing, however, through a decrease in the high month volume and an increase in the low month volume, means that less storage may be capable of serving the annual seasonal cycling needs of the U.S. markets. Those trading natural gas may want additional storage for arbitrage uses, but the fundamental needs related to system reliability may decrease somewhat with a decrease in the difference between minimum and maximum consumption rates.", "The secondary peak in gas for power was less in 2008 than in the previous years.

Historically, when natural gas prices in the northeast market area reached a price at which a significant industrial or utility load could save fuel costs by switching to a petroleum alternative, the users would switch fuel. This would limit the price to this alternative. There was a time when almost 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas load could switch.
