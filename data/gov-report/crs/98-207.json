Many of the large waste management projectsincluded in the separate privatization fundingrequest would also continue operating after 2006.", "The accelerated cleanup plan has drawn opposition from some environmental groups because of concerns that its focus on 2006 might result in insufficientcleanups. In the program's FY1999 budget justification, DOE maintained that the requested funding would besufficient to meet environmental requirements atmost sites, although it added, \"At some sites, there is a small gap between compliance requirements and availablefunding. EM therefore is striving for additionalefficiencies and other measures to close this gap.\"", "Two-thirds of the EM privatization funding request would go for Phase 1 of the Hanford Tank Waste Remediation System, consisting of a pilot vitrification plantthat would turn liquid high-level waste into radioactive glass logs for eventual disposal. Other major privatizedprojects include a project to treat \"mixed\"radioactive and hazardous waste at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, and wastetreatment, storage, and disposal facilities at OakRidge, Tennessee.", "The EM privatization effort is intended to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting a portion of project risks from the federalgovernment to contractors. Profits to contractors would depend on their success in meeting project schedules andholding down costs; potentially, profits could besubstantially higher than under traditional DOE contracting arrangements.", "In a typical non-privatized DOE project, a contractor would be hired to build and operate a facility with government funds. DOE would approve and pay all thecontractor's costs, and then award the contractor a profit based on performance. Under the privatization initiative,a contractor would be expected to raise almostall funding for necessary facilities and equipment for a project. The contractor would recover that investment andearn a profit by charging previously negotiatedfees to DOE for providing services under the contract, such as solidification of radioactive waste. The contractorcould earn higher profits by reducing costs, butthe contractor could lose money if project costs were higher than expected or the required services were notdelivered.", "DOE requested more than $1 billion last year for privatized projects, but Congress provided only $200 million. The strong congressional resistance to the requeststemmed largely from concerns about providing such a large amount of up-front funding for contracts that had notyet been fully negotiated in many cases. Thecontracts are to spell out such crucial details as how much risk for project cost overruns and other problems thatDOE would continue to bear.", "In response to such criticism, DOE promised in the FY1999 budget justification to submit proposed privatization contracts to Congress for review at least 30 daysbefore they are signed. Contract information submitted for such reviews is to include anticipated costs and fees,performance specifications, activities to becarried out, project schedules, goods or services to be delivered, and estimated cost savings. DOE also promisedto establish its own review teams to examinerequests for proposals and contracts for privatization projects, to procure and disseminate independent cost-savingsestimates, to increase training for DOEoversight of privatized contracts, and to assure that contractors hire sufficiently experienced personnel. Nevertheless, the conferees cut the DOE privatizationrequest by more than half.", "Civilian Nuclear Waste Disposal.

The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act( P.L. 105-277 ) added $525 million for DOE's \"other defense activities\" to address the issue of uranium andplutonium from excess Russian nuclear weapons. Theuranium is to be purchased for DOE stockpiles, while the plutonium funding would help pay for facilities in Russiato begin converting plutonium componentsfrom warheads into fuel for nuclear reactors.", "The bill provides $325 million for purchasing natural uranium that is associated with ongoing purchases of highly enriched uranium (HEU) from Russianwarheads. Under the HEU agreement, the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC) buys the enriched Russian uraniumand gives back an equivalent amount ofnatural (unenriched) uranium, which the Russians can then sell.

The Administrationproposed a reprogramming of FY1997 fundsappropriated to the Corps of Engineers to jointly study with TVA how the agency's assets and functions should bereassigned to the Corps and other appropriateagencies.", "Chairman Crowell's proposal not only stirred up considerable controversy, it also exposed the existence of TVA itself to challenge. While representatives fromthe Tennessee Valley region are averse to any risk to non-power programs, the Chairman's proposal to shednon-power programs, TVA opponents have argued,would be an abrogation of TVA's mission. If the mission is no longer appropriate, the argument extends, neitheris the agency.", "The unintended consequence of Chairman Crowell's proposal was that the conferees on the FY1998 Energy and Water Appropriations recommended anappropriation of $70 million for FY1998, but stipulated that TVA would thereafter absorb the entire cost of theseprograms through \"internally generated revenuesand savings.\" Despite the language in the conference report, and pending further consideration of the future of TVAand its non-power programs, theAdministration requested $77 million for TVA non-power programs for FY1999. ", "The Senate funded TVA at $70 million while the House bill provided no funding. The conferees adhered to the House position and, in addition, provided nofunding for Land Between the Lakes. Additionally, the conferees required that if, in the absence of an appropriation,TVA deemed a rate increase necessary tofund these programs, a report would have to be submitted to Congress assessing whether transferring stewardshipof facilities along the Tennessee River to theArmy Corps of Engineers would alleviate or eliminate the need for a rate increase. The conferees further requiredthat this report be submitted 6 months beforethe rate increase would go into effect.", "The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriation Act ( P.L. 105-277 ) restored $50 million to TVA non-power programs. In addition, the Act includes a debt-refinancing planthat would enable TVA to prepay its obligations to the Federal financing Bank without penalty, estimated to savethe agency $100 million in interest paymentsduring each of the next 10 years.", "The consequences of this turnaround for TVA when the 106th Congress considers electricity deregulation legislation are difficult to predict. TVA's critics maycontinue to urge that TVA be extensively reorganized as part of any deregulation package. On the other hand,supporters suggest that if TVA takes full advantageof the opportunity to reduce its debt and operates more efficiently, the agency may come under less intense pressurein the next Congress.", "Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The conference agreement gives the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)$470 million for FY 1999, about $20 million below the budget request. Major activities conducted by NRC includeregulation of commercial nuclear reactors,licensing of nuclear waste facilities, and oversight of nuclear materials users. The funding also includes about $5million for the NRC inspector general's office.", "The Senate voted to appropriate $466 million to NRC -- $2 million below the FY1998 level. The Senate Energy and Water Development Subcommittee wouldhave reduced the funding by $90 million, a cutback that would have eliminated 700 of NRC's approximately 3,000employees over the next two years. Althoughthe full Committee reversed that cut, its report strongly criticized NRC for allegedly failing to overhaul its regulatorysystem in line with improvements in nuclearindustry safety. The Committee contended, among other problems, that NRC's regional offices were inconsistentwith one another, that NRC was inappropriatelyinterfering with nuclear plant management, and that numerous NRC review processes were outdated andunnecessary.", "Slightly lower funding, $463 million, was supported by the House, whose report contained similar criticisms to those of the Senate panel. The House declareditself \"strongly supportive\" of the Administration's plans for NRC to eventually take over safety regulation of majorDOE nuclear facilities, which currently areregulated by DOE itself. The conferees gave NRC $3.2 million for regulatory reviews of DOE facilities. BothHouse and Senate also provided $4.8 million forthe NRC inspector general's office.", "To ensure that NRC's budget would continue to be mostly offset by fees on nuclear power plants and other licensed entities, the conferees included a one-yearextension of the agency's current fee-collection authority. As in the past, DOE would reimburse NRC for oversightof DOE's high-level nuclear waste disposalprogram."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "For Additional Reading", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CRS Issue Briefs", "paragraphs": ["CRS Issue Brief IB92059.
