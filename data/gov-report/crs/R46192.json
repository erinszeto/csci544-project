Two Class VI wells, both in Illinois, are currently permitted by EPA in the United States. No state has issued a permit for a Class VI well. CO 2 injection for EOR is conducted using Class II wells (associated with oil and gas production). SDWA also authorizes states to administer UIC programs in lieu of EPA, known as primacy .

The goal of geologic sequestration of CO 2 is to trap or transform CO 2 emitted from stationary anthropogenic sources permanently underground and ultimately reduce emissions of GHGs from these sources into the atmosphere. CO 2 for sequestration is first captured from a large stationary source, such as a coal-fired power plant or chemical production facility. Although CO 2 is initially captured as a gas, it is compressed into a supercritical fluid\u00e2\u0080\u0094a relatively dense fluid intermediate to a gas and a liquid\u00e2\u0080\u0094before injection and remains in that state due to high pressures in the underground formation. The CO 2 is injected through specially designed wells into geologic formations, typically a half a mile or more below the Earth's surface. These formations include, for example, large deep saline reservoirs (underground basins containing salty fluids) and oil and gas reservoirs no longer in production.

Enhanced recovery is also used occasionally in natural gas development. EOR can significantly increase the amount of oil or gas produced from a reservoir. CO 2 is the most common injection agent used in EOR projects.", "CO 2 injected for EOR most commonly comes from natural sources, such as underground CO 2 reservoirs, but some is also captured from anthropogenic sources, such as natural gas production, ammonia production, and coal gasification facilities. In many cases, the CO 2 is transferred from the source to the injection site by pipeline. The CO 2 is typically injected into depleted oil or gas reservoirs using the existing well infrastructure from the original production process. The injected CO 2 travels through the pore spaces of the formation, where it combines with residual oil. The mixture is then pumped to the surface, where the CO 2 is separated from other fluids, recompressed, and reinjected. Through repeated EOR cycles, CO 2 is gradually stored in the reservoir. NETL reports that generally, between 30% and 40% of the CO 2 is stored in each injection cycle, depending on the reservoir characteristics, through what it terms \"incidental storage.\" This portion of the CO 2 \"will be contained indefinitely within the reservoir,\" according to NETL.

", "For groundwater-related risks, EPA has noted that expansion of CO 2 -EOR and associated CO 2 storage could increase the risk of endangerment to USDWs due to increased injection zone pressures and the large number of wells in oil and gas fields that could serve as leakage pathways. Injected CO 2 could also force brine from the target formation into USDWs, which could affect drinking water. To address potential releases or leakage that could endanger USDWs, in the Class VI rule, EPA included monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specific to CO 2 injection. Class VI construction and testing requirements, which are generally more stringent than Class II requirements for EOR, are also intended to prevent USDW endangerment.", "Regarding other types of risk from improperly managed projects, EPA identified risks to air quality, human health, and ecosystems as potential concerns not addressed by SDWA authorities. In its 2010 report, the Task Force concluded that SDWA's limited application to only those groundwater formations that meet the specific statutory definition of USDWs may \"require clarification to support actions to address or remedy ecological or non-drinking water human health impacts arising from the injection and sequestration of CO 2 .\" The Task Force also stated that an accidental large release could result in risks to surface water, local ecology, and human health. (See text box Human Health and Environmental Considerations of CO 2 and Geologic Sequestration .)", "An additional concern with injection and sequestration of CO 2 is the increased potential for earthquakes associated with deep-well injection. Earthquakes induced by CO 2 injection could fracture the rocks in the reservoir or, more importantly, the caprock above the reservoir. Class VI well regulations require that information on earthquake-related history be included in the permit application and that owners or operators not exceed injection pressure that would induce seismicity or initiate fractures.", "NETL and other stakeholders offer other perspectives on potential health and environmental risks. Regarding the risks of CO 2 leakage, NETL outlines several case studies on leakage related to underground carbon storage in a 2019 report. The report states that use of EOR in the United States \"has demonstrated that large volumes of gas can be stored safely underground and over long timeframes when the appropriate best-practices are implemented.\" According to the report, \"Despite over 40 years of operating CO 2 EOR projects, leakage events have rarely been reported,\" although the authors also note that \"there has been no official mechanism for reporting leaks of CO 2 until recently.\" Other stakeholders have also commented that, even given potential health and environmental risks, the benefits of CO 2 sequestration in reducing GHG emissions as part of climate change mitigation efforts outweigh such risks.

In its report, the Task Force also identified that \"the existing Federal framework largely does not provide for a release or transfer of liability from the owner/operator to other persons\" and noted that some stakeholders view these issues as a barrier to future CCS project deployment. Specific policy questions regarding property rights include who owns and controls the subsurface formations (known as the pore space) targeted for CO 2 sequestration, if and how such property can be transferred or aggregated, and how underground reservoirs that cross state and tribal boundaries should be regulated. State laws and contractual property arrangements, similar to those established for oil and gas development, may address some of these questions, but some analysts identify the need for more clarity. ", "Issues of financial liability and long-term stewardship of injection sites and storage reservoirs also remain largely unresolved. Analysts have raised questions such as (1) who is responsible for the site and reservoir after the 50-year mandated post-injection site care period, (2) what is the role of the federal or state government in assisting site developers and operators with managing the risks associated with sequestration activities, and (3) whether the federal government should be involved in taking on some or all financial responsibility during the life-cycle of sequestration projects. Large-scale commercial geologic sequestration projects would likely require unique liability and stewardship structures that address issues such as the particular characteristics of CO 2 , the entire life-cycle of sequestration projects\u00e2\u0080\u0094from site selection to periods beyond site closure\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the geologic time frame (hundreds or thousands of years) over which sequestration occurs.

Recently, Public Service Company of New Mexico reportedly estimated that retrofitting a 500-megawatt coal-fired power plant with CCS technology could cost between $5 billion and $6 billion. The company reportedly stated that its evaluations showed that it would be more cost effective to switch to another source of energy (such as renewable energy) rather than continue to use coal with the addition of CCS.", "Examples of completed commercial-scale CCS operations and associated costs are limited, causing some uncertainty regarding future investments and the scale of project deployment in the coming decades. In a 2019 report, NETL indicated that \"the potential costs of commercial-scale CCS are still not fully understood, particularly from a fully integrated (capture, transportation, and storage) perspective.\" Costs could vary greatly due to a variety of site-specific factors. The type of capture technology is the largest component of costs, possibly accounting for as much as 80% of the total. The variations in the geology of storage formations also make predicting future geologic sequestration costs particularly difficult.", "Projects that inject some or all the CO 2 for EOR (with incidental carbon storage) involve different cost implications and economic factors from projects injecting solely for permanent CO 2 sequestration. These factors could influence future deployment of these types of projects, as facility owners and operators may consider cost implications when deciding whether to invest in EOR or when deciding between investing projects for EOR or permanent geologic sequestration. EOR operations typically use the existing injection infrastructure in place from earlier oil and gas production activities. Thus, the well exploration and construction costs are \"sunk costs.\" Unlike geologic sequestration projects, these expenses may not be included in total project cost calculations, resulting in comparatively lower costs for injecting and storing the CO 2 . In addition, for EOR projects, overall project costs could be influenced by revenue for the owner or operator from additional oil and gas production. EOR project costs may also be subject to variability and uncertainty, however. NETL notes that the price of oil and the cost and availability of CO 2 are key drivers in the economics of CO 2 EOR.", "Federal tax credits for carbon storage, available since 2009 for both EOR and geologic sequestration, may also play a role in underground injection and storage of CO 2 project costs and investment decisions .

", "In contrast, other stakeholders have argued that CO 2 sequestration could create a disincentive to reduce fossil-fuel-based power plant emissions or shift to renewable energy sources. In particular, some stakeholders note that injecting CO 2 for EOR may actually increase net GHG emissions, as it produces additional oil and gas to be burned as fuel.

For EOR, only the CO 2 that is used as tertiary injectant and remains in the reservoir qualifies for the tax credit. CO 2 recaptured or recycled does not qualify. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA) amended Section 45Q to increase the amount of these tax credits from $22.66 to $50 per ton over time for sequestered CO 2 and from $12.83 to $35 per ton over time for CO 2 used in EOR. The BBA also removed a 75-million-ton cap on total qualified CO 2 captured or injected but required the relevant taxpayer to claim the credit over a 12-year period after operations begin. Additionally, eligible facilities must be operating or must begin construction before 2024. The U.S. Department of the Treasury is currently considering comments on proposed implementing regulations for the BBA tax credit provision and has not released a final rule. In response to the 2019 Internal Revenue Service notice requesting comments on carbon credits for future regulations and guidance, some oil and gas industry commenters expressed concerns with Treasury's proposed approach to measuring \"secure geological storage\" and other requirements, which they assert would impact their ability to plan and invest in CCS projects.", "In the meantime, the tax credit as authorized in the BBA is available to qualified entities.
