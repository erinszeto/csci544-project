DOD currently operates a number of legacy electronic health record (EHR) systems. Each system has separate capabilities and functions as a result of new or changing requirements over the past five decades. The primary legacy systems include the Composite Health Care System (CHCS), Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA), Essentris, and the Corporate Dental System. DOD also still uses paper medical records that are later scanned and digitally archived. Currently, only certain components of DOD's health records are accessible to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).", "In the early 1990s, concern grew about deficient interoperability between DOD and VA. This led to recommendations by various commissions on military and veterans health care calling for greater coordination and data sharing efforts between the two departments. Between 1998 and 2008, DOD and VA developed several capabilities to exchange patient health information across each department's EHR systems. However, Congress did not view these systems as an adequately integrated approach. This led to several congressional mandates being issued between 2008 and 2014, including for the development of an interoperable EHR (including a deadline to implement such system), for certain capability requirements, and for the creation of an interagency program office. After several strategy changes to meet Congress's mandates, DOD opted to acquire a commercial-off-the-shelf EHR product to replace its legacy EHR systems. The new system would be called MHS Genesis.", "In July 2015, DOD awarded the MHS Genesis contract to Leidos Partnership for Defense Health (LPDH). The contract includes a potential 10-year ordering period and an initial total award ceiling of $4.3 billion. DOD selected several MTFs in Washington to serve as Initial Operational Capability (IOC) sites and began fielding MHS Genesis in 2017. The designated IOC sites included: Madigan Army Medical Center, Fairchild Air Force Base, Naval Hospital Bremerton, and Naval Health Clinic Oak Harbor. The purpose of fielding MHS Genesis at the IOC sites before full deployment was to observe, evaluate, and document lessons-learned on whether the new EHR was usable, interoperable, secure, and stable.", "During initial deployment, DOD evaluators and IOC site personnel identified numerous functional and technical challenges. In particular, the Defense Department's Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation found that MHS Genesis was \"not yet effective or operationally suitable.\" Technical challenges included cybersecurity vulnerabilities, network latency, and delayed equipment upgrades and operational testing. Functional challenges included lengthy issue resolution processes, inadequate staff training, and capability gaps and limitations. DOD acknowledged these issues, implemented follow-on testing ongoing corrective actions, and revised its training approach for future fielding.", "DOD plans to implement MHS Genesis at all military treatment facilities (MTFs) in 23 waves through 2024.
