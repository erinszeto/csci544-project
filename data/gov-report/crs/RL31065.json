The House version of the 2014 farm bill (H.R. 2642) proposes to eliminate the permanent authorization for many of these programs. Some programs provide technical assistance\u2014information, advice, and aid on specific projects. Other programs provide financial assistance, usually through grants (with or without matching contributions from recipients) or cost-sharing (typically though state agencies, with varying levels of contributions from recipients). Many programs provide both.", "Most of the programs provide assistance to state partner agencies. The state agencies can use the assistance on state forestlands or to assist local governments or private landowners. How the states use the funds is largely at the discretion of the states, within the authorization of each program; however, the 2008 farm bill added national priorities for state assistance and state-wide assessments and strategies to focus state efforts on achieving the national priorities. Funds are appropriated for planning and implementing forestry and related land management practices\u2014site preparation for reforestation, tree planting, thinning, pruning, fertilizing, prescribed burning, restoring watersheds, improving wildlife habitats, and other activities. Other programs provide support for protecting forestlands from wildfires, insects and diseases, and from clearing forests for non-forest uses (such as growing crops or building houses). Two programs are designed specifically to assist landowners to recover or restore forests following catastrophic events, such as wildfires. In addition, International Forestry is often included as a forestry assistance program, because it provides technical forestry help and because it has often been funded out of FS appropriations for forestry assistance programs. Finally, states are authorized to request consolidated payments, for flexibility in program administration, and several coordinating or advisory groups exist to coordinate programs or for specific purposes under one or more programs.", "Overall funding for forestry assistance programs in FY2013 was $354 million. After a high of $429 million in FY2010, funding has decreased for three successive years. Funding for the forest management assistance programs\u2014forest stewardship and urban and community forestry\u2014has remained relatively constant over the past five years.

Initial forestry assistance efforts began with the creation of the USDA Division of Forestry in 1881 (to complement forestry research begun with funding in 1876). Forestry assistance and research programs grew slowly, and in 1901 the Division was upgraded to the USDA Bureau of Forestry. In 1905, the USDA Bureau merged with the Interior Department's Division of Forestry (which administered the forest reserves, later renamed national forests) and became the USDA Forest Service (FS). Forestry assistance, the primary mission of the State and Private Forestry (S&PF) branch, together with forestry research and management of the National Forest System, comprise the three primary FS missions.", "Authority for the forestry assistance programs was reestablished and coordinated in the Clarke-McNary Act of 1924. This law guided these programs for more than half a century, until it was revised in the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (CFAA). The CFAA has been amended several times, including in the four most recent farm bills. The Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990\u2014the 1990 farm bill \u2014added and rewrote several of the CFAA sections. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996\u2014the 1996 farm bill \u2014made a few additions and modifications to the CFAA (as amended). The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002\u2014the 2002 farm bill \u2014replaced two CFAA provisions (as amended) with a new provision, and created another new program. Finally, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008\u2014the 2008 farm bill \u2014established national priorities and a process for states to address them, while adding and modifying other programs.", "There are currently more than a dozen forestry assistance programs, as shown in Table 1 . The programs are primarily administered by the FS, with permanently authorized funding but without specified funding levels. No forestry assistance programs have mandatory spending; all require annual funding, and all are funded in the annual Interior appropriations acts. Table 1 identifies the U.S. Code citation, the authorized duration and level of funding, and FY2013 post-sequester funding for each program. The FY2013 funding includes appropriations to the FS S&PF account and transfers from Wildland Fire Management account. Note that some programs are combined for funding purposes. Programs are listed in decreasing order of FY2013 appropriations.", "Many of the forestry assistance programs provide different types of aid to the states for undertaking forestry practices to improve timber productivity or to enhance other resource values. These are shown in Table 2 as forest management programs . For the first time since at least 1978, no federal forestry program exists to provide direct cost-sharing for forestry practices on private lands. However, the 2008 farm bill expanded the definition of authorized conservation practices for agricultural conservation programs generally to include forestry practices, and thus financial assistance to private forest landowners may be feasible through the conservation programs.", "Some programs provide assistance for protecting forestlands from wildfire, insects, diseases, and for preventing conversion of forests to non-forest uses (e.g., agriculture, residences). Table 2 shows these as forest protection programs . Forest health and community fire protection activities can be applied on private lands with the cooperation of the landowner. Most other forest protection programs provide financial and/or technical assistance to government or quasi-government entities\u2014states, local governments, communities, volunteer fire departments, and Indian tribes. The Community Forestry and Open Space Conservation program also allows grants to nonprofit organizations. ", "Two forest recovery and restoration programs provide funding directly to private landowners in response to disasters. The Emergency Reforestation Program was created in 1990, and has not been funded since 1993. The Emergency Forest Restoration Program was created in the 2008 farm bill as an amendment to an existing agricultural conservation program to assist landowners in recovering from natural disasters. ", "In addition, International Forestry has been included in this report, because (a) it provides technical assistance to other nations on forestry matters, and (b) it has often been funded out of S&PF appropriations.", " Table 2 also shows the type of assistance available under each program. Some programs provide only technical assistance, which can range from relevant existing information to advice and aid on specific projects. Other programs provide financial assistance. Typically these programs are grants (with or without contributions from recipients) or cost-sharing (with varying levels of matching contributions from recipients), although two programs have other \"financial\" provisions: (1) Forest Health Protection funds FS activities to survey and to control insects or diseases on state or private lands (with the consent and cooperation of the landowner); and (2) Forest Legacy includes federal purchase of lands or easements as well as grants to states.

Several programs provide financial and/or technical assistance through the states for planning and implementing forest management practices (e.g., tree planting, site preparation for reforestation, thinning, pruning, fertilizing, prescribed burning, and other activities) and sometimes practices to enhance other resources (e.g., restoring watersheds, improving wildlife habitat, and other activities). Some programs have been combined through the appropriations process. ", "Additional programs provide financial and technical support for protecting nonfederal forests from wildfire, insects, diseases, and clearing for non-forest uses. These programs cover many continuing threats to forests, although global climate change could exacerbate the effects of these threats. Furthermore, for the Forest Health program, more funds are used to protect federal lands than cooperative lands. Forest Legacy can help prevent forest clearing. The Community Fire Protection program can assist communities to prepare for wildfires, while the two emergency programs can help landowners restore forests after the disaster. These programs, as well as many of the forest management programs noted above, can help to protect and restore state and private forestlands from catastrophic wildfires and other damaging agents. ", "Appropriations for forestry assistance programs have fluctuated greatly since FY2000. In response to the severe wildfires in the summer of 2000, funding more than doubled from $213.3 million in FY2000 to a peak of $493.8 million the next year in FY2001. However, since FY2008, overall forestry assistance funding has averaged around $367 million, with $354 million appropriated in FY2013 post-sequester funds. Most forestry assistance programs, with the exception of the Forest Stewardship and International Forestry programs, were reduced in FY2013 appropriations for the third year in a row. ", "The largest sustained levels of funding have been for the forest protection programs\u2014forest health (for insect and disease identification and control), wildfire assistance, and forest legacy (for easements to prevent forest clearing). However, funding for all of those programs has been declining since FY2010. In particular, funding for rural fire protection is 30% below FY2010 levels, despite the severe wildfire seasons of 2011 and 2012. In comparison, forest management assistance funding has remained relatively constant. Both the Forest Stewardship and Urban and Community Forestry programs have received appropriations around $30 million since FY2009. ", "In total, these forestry assistance programs make up less than 10% of the Forest Service's total $4.9 billion in discretionary appropriations. Overall Forest Service funding has also been declining, although at a slower rate than the decline in forestry assistance funds. However, the number, extent, and severity of wildfires continue to exceed historical levels, as does the reported incidence of forest insect and disease infestations on both federal and nonfederal forests. Some may argue that both federal and nonfederal forest owners are thus facing increasing management challenges with decreasing dollars, while others may argue that decreased funding fosters innovative and cost-effective management solutions.
