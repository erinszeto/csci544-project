Whereas the general fundcontribution for FY2002 was on the low side historically, the Administration wastrying to return to a higher contribution level. In this effort they were successful,with both the House and the Senate agreeing ultimately on $3.4 billion. For FY2004the House Appropriations Committee initially suggested that $1.5 billion be providedfrom the general funds. During Floor debate the bill was amended to raise the generalfund contribution to approximately $3.5 billion. The Senate bill provided generalfunds at the $1.5 billion level. The FY2004 Act differs from both, however, andraises the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion. Historically, this funding splithas been an important part of the annual FAA budget debate.

President Bush signed the measureinto law the next day ( P.L. 108-199 ).", "Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The federal government levies individual and corporate income taxes, socialinsurance taxes, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties, and miscellaneoustaxes and fees. The federal agency responsible for administering all these taxes andfees, except customs duties, is the IRS. In discharging that duty, the IRS receives andprocesses tax returns and other related documents, processes payments and refunds,enforces compliance through audits and other methods, collects delinquent taxes, andprovides a variety of services to taxpayers to help them understand their rights andresponsibilities and resolve problems. In FY2002, the most recent year for whichdata are available, the IRS collected $2,017 billion before refunds, the largestcomponent of which was individual income tax revenue of $1,038 billion.", "The Bush Administration asked Congress for $10.436 billion to fund IRS operations in FY2004. This amount was 6.1% greater than the $9.834 billion enactedfor FY2003 and 5.2% greater than the amount requested by the Administration forFY2003. Of the requested budget for FY2004, $4.135 billion was to be used forprocessing, assistance, and management; $4.086 billion for tax law enforcement;$1.709 billion for information systems; $500 million for the business systemsmodernization program (BSM); $251 million for a program aimed at curbing fraudand abuse in claims for the earned income tax credit (EITC) known as the EarnedIncome Tax Credit Compliance Initiative; and $35 million to administer the healthinsurance tax credit. Two proposed enforcement initiatives for FY2004 arousedconcern or outright opposition among some Members of Congress. One wouldallocate $100 million to a pilot program to require that some taxpayers certify theresidency status of the qualifying child before filing a claim for the EITC. Under thesecond proposal, the IRS would spend $2 million to hire private collection agents tocollect overdue or unpaid taxes.", "The proposed budget placed a high priority on improving compliance with tax laws. It would set aside $133 million for a new program aimed at curbing fivesources of tax evasion: (1) the promotion of abusive tax schemes; (2) the misuse oftrusts and offshore accounts to hide or illegally lower taxable income; (3) the use ofabusive corporate tax avoidance schemes; (4) the under-reporting of income byupper-income individuals; and (5) the failure of employers to file employment taxreturns and pay substantial amounts of employment taxes in a timely manner. TheAdministration contended that such a program to curb tax evasion would lead to a72% increase in the number of audits of tax returns for high-income individuals andbusinesses. Nonetheless, some expressed concern that the Administration's proposedfunding for IRS operations fell short of what would be needed to enable the IRS toenforce the tax laws adequately. (17)", "A key player in the annual appropriations process for the IRS is the IRS Oversight Board, which originated with the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of1998. Under the Act, the Board is required to review the annual IRS budget requestprepared by the IRS Commissioner and submit its recommendations to the Secretaryof the Treasury. The President in turn is required to submit the Board's budgetrecommendations to Congress along with his own budget request for the IRS. ", "For FY2004, the Board recommended that the IRS be given a budget of $10.724 billion, or $287 million more that the amount requested by the BushAdministration. (18) It also recommended that theIRS hire an additional 2,120 full-timeemployees in FY2004, compared to the 238 additional full-time employees includedin the Administration's request. The Board's budget recommendations wereintended to accomplish three goals. One was to achieve a real growth rate of 2% inthe next five years for the purpose of channeling adequate resources into efforts tomonitor and enforce compliance with tax laws. The second goal was to provide moreresources for the BSM, which the Board views as essential to the transformation ofthe IRS into an efficient, fair, customer-friendly collector of revenue and enforcer oftax laws. The third goal was to restore funds for customer service and tax lawenforcement that were diverted in recent years to cover unanticipated expenses, suchas unfunded increases in annual pay raises for federal civilian employees. Nearly85% of the difference between the Administration's budget request for FY2004 andthe Board's recommended budget was due to funding for two accounts: processing,assistance, and management; and business systems modernization.", "On July 24, 2003, the House Committee on Appropriations passed by voice vote a measure ( H.R. 2989 ) providing appropriations for the IRS in FY2004. It funded the agency at a level of $10.352 billion, or $517 million more than theamount enacted for FY2003 but $85 million less than the amount requested by theBush Administration. More specifically, the measure provided $4.038 billion forprocessing, assistance, and management; $4.221 billion for tax law enforcement;$1.629 billion for information systems; $429 million for BSM; and $35 million foradministering the health insurance tax credit.", "The lower level of funding approved by the Committee, relative to the Administration's budget request, was spread over three appropriations accounts: processing, assistance, and management (-$36.9 million); tax law enforcement (-$6.4million); and information systems (-$41.3 million). Among the IRS programs andinitiatives receiving favorable comment in the Committee's report ( H.Rept. 108-243 )were low-income taxpayer clinics (which would receive $8 million in funding), thetax counseling program for elderly taxpayers (which would receive $4.25 million infunding), the emerging partnership between the IRS and suppliers of tax-returnsoftware in implementing the Free-File Alliance, a controversial pilot program forpre-certifying persons eligible for the earned income tax credit (which would receive$100 million in funding), and a controversial proposal to hire private collectionagencies to collect overdue or unpaid taxes.", "The House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2989 on September 9, 2003. Its version endorsed the recommended funding levels for IRS accounts inFY2004 approved by the Appropriations Committee. Under an amendment adoptedby the House during floor debate on the measure, none of the funds appropriated inthe measure could be used to help overturn a federal judge's recent ruling that IBM'scash balance pension plan violates a federal law barring age discrimination. Thesponsors of the amendment wanted to prevent the IRS from making final proposedregulations it issued in December 2002 on the application of age-discrimination rulesto the conversion of traditional pension plans to cash balance plans it issued inDecember 2002. They feared that such a step would strengthen IBM's hand if it wereto appeal the judge's ruling.", "On September 4, 2002, the Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approved a measure ( S. 1589 ) providing $10.276 billion in funding forIRS operations in FY2004. This amount was $296 million more than the amountenacted in FY2003 but $160 million less than the amount requested by theAdministration and $76 million less than the amount approved by the House. ", "More specifically, S. 1589 recommended spending $4.048 billion on processing, assistance and management (or $26 million below theAdministration's request but $10 million above the amount in H.R. 2989 ); $4.173 billion on tax law enforcement (or $196 million above theAdministration's request but $48 million below the amount in H.R. 2989 ); $1.591 billion on information systems (or $79 million below theAdministration's request and $38 million below the amount in H.R. 2989 ); $429 million for BSM (or the same amount requested by the Administrationand contained in H.R. 2989 ); and $35 million to administer the healthinsurance tax credit (or the same amount requested by the Administration andcontained in H.R. 2989 ). ", "The Committee report ( S.Rept. 108-146 ) on the bill praised two IRS programs: the Tax Counseling Program for the Elderly and Low-Income Taxpayer Clinics. Itrecommended that the former be funded at a level of $3.9 million and the latter at alevel of $7.0 million in FY2004. In addition, the report recommended that the IRSmanage its earned income tax compliance initiative as part of its budget for tax lawenforcement, and that the IRS \"realign development activities funded under theInformation Systems account so that they are managed and integrated formally intoBusiness Systems Modernization activity.\" It was unclear from the report how theCommittee viewed recent controversial proposals to pre-certify the eligibility ofcertain taxpayers for the earned income tax credit and to hire private collection agentsto collect unpaid or overdue taxes.", "On October 23, 2003, the Senate substituted the language of S. 1589 as an amendment to the House-passed version of H.R. 2989 andpassed the measure by a vote of 93 to 1. It made no changes in the level of fundingin FY2004 for IRS operations approved by the Appropriations Committee. But theSenate did approve by voice vote two amendments that related to the IRS. Onewould prevent the Treasury Department from using any of the appropriated funds toimplement a recently issued IRS final regulation making it easier for companies toconvert from traditional pension plans to a cash balance plan. The secondamendment would require the IRS to undertake a comprehensive study of itsproposed pilot program to pre-certify the eligibility of thousands of taxpayers for theEITC. Among other things, the study would examine the time and cost to programparticipants and the administrative cost to the IRS, and the number of participantswho are denied certification because they are deemed ineligible or failed to completethe required documents.", "The version of H.R. 2989 passed by the House gave the IRS about $76 million more in funding for FY2004 than the Senate-passed version. Thedifference was distributed among three accounts: processing, assistance, andmanagement (-$10 million); tax law enforcement (+$48 million); and informationsystems (+$38 million).", "Leaders of the House and Senate agreed to a conference to resolve the differences between the two versions of H.R. 2989 . Under a conferenceagreement reached on November 12, 2003, funding for the IRS in FY 2004 wouldtotal $10.245 billion, or $410 million more than the amount enacted for FY2003 but$192 million less than the amount requested by the Bush Administration, $107million less than the amount approved by the House, and $31 million less than theamount approved by the Senate. More specifically, the agreement provides $4.033billion for processing, assistance and management, of which $4.1 million must beused to fund the Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program and $7.5 million is to bemade available to fund grants for low-income taxpayer clinics; $4.196 billion for taxlaw enforcement; $1.591 billion for information systems; $390 million for BSM,none of which may be spent without the prior approval of the House and SenateAppropriations Committees; and $35 million to administer the health insurance taxcredit. Proposed funding for the BSM represented a reduction of $39 million in theamounts approved by the House and the Senate and could be construed as anexpression of congressional dissatisfaction with the results of the program so far anddistrust of the ability of IRS managers to remedy known problems with it. Theproblems reportedly include unanticipated cost increases, delays in the completionof crucial projects, and poor management. ", "In addition, the conference agreement on H.R. 2989 prohibited the IRS from using appropriated funds to issue final regulations lifting a 1999moratorium on the conversion of corporate pension plans from traditionaldefined-benefit plans to cash-balance plans. Cash-balance plans often result from theconversion of traditional defined-benefit pension plans to defined-contributionpension plans. Instead, the agreement required the agency to present to Congresswithin six months of its enactment proposed legislation that would \"providetransition relief for older and longer-service participants affected by conversions oftheir employers' traditional pension plans to cash-balance pension plans.\" Theagreement also required the IRS to submit to Congress by June 30, 2005 a finalreport examining various aspects of any program established by the IRS to certify orpre-certify the eligibility of certain taxpayers for the EITC, including the costsincurred by affected taxpayers in participating in the program and the IRS inadministering the program.", "The conference agreement was incorporated into a consolidated appropriations measure ( H.R. 2673 ) covering seven separate appropriations bills.

For the last several years, Congress has limitedthe rates of adjustment, based on the rates of adjustment for the General Schedule(for FY2003: P.L. 108-7 , Division J, Section 613 and for FY2004: H.R. 2673 , Division F, Sections 613 and 640(b)). Part of the rationale for that decision isthat, in certain high cost areas, some FWS wages would exceed the salaries paid toGeneral Schedule supervisors. Wages in lower cost areas will be allowed to increaseaccording to the findings of the wage surveys but the high cost area wages will becapped.", "P.L. 107-117 extended the Monroney Amendment out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel.", "Senior Executive Service Salaries. Section 637 of the President's proposed General Provisions requested an amendmentto the statute governing the determination of salary levels for the Senior ExecutiveService. The provisions to change the system by eliminating the six-tier system, bychanging the salary setting authority from the President to the Office of PersonnelManagement, and by taking them out of the locality pay system and capping theirrates at Level II of the Executive Schedule, were enacted under the National DefenseAuthorization Act for 2004. (98) For January 2004the minimum rates of pay is$103,700 and the maximum for most is $145,600. Those in agencies withperformance appraisal systems certified by OPM, will be able to receive a maximumof $158,100, a salary equal to that of Members of Congress and U.S. District Courtjudges.

A $500 million fund would be set asidegovernment-wide to allow managers to reward top-performing individuals withpermanent increases in base pay.

There are no provisions in either the House-passed orSenate-reported versions which address the pay of Members of Congress, Judges, orother federal officials. If Congress is legislatively silent, the annual adjustment goesinto effect automatically. A pay adjustment of 2.2% is scheduled for the officials ofthe three branches effective January 2004. However, because the General Schedulebasic pay adjustment rate was 1.5% until passage of the Consolidated AppropriationsAct, 2004, the rate of pay adjustment for these federal officials was limited to 1.5%. The full adjustment of 2.2% will go into effect and will be retroactive. The Senate,on October 23, 2003, voted to table an amendment which would have denied the payincrease to Members and would not have affected the pay of other officials. (101)", "Under the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, as amended, pay adjustments for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, are also based on ECIcalculations, but for a different 12-month period. The ECI calculations dictate a payadjustment in January 2004 of 2.2%. However, the statute limits those adjustmentsto the rate of adjustment for base pay of the General Schedule. Therefore, since theGeneral Schedule base pay was adjusted at the rate of 1.5%, pending final action onthe Consolidated Appropriations bill, 1.5% was the temporary maximum rate ofadjustment in salaries of federal officials. Because the mechanism described aboveis automatic, no bill language is necessary to establish the pay adjustment. (102)", "Unlike that for Members of Congress and executive branch officials, the annual pay increase must be specifically authorized for judges. P.L. 108-167 (December 6,2003) was enacted for that purpose with regard to the January 2004 adjustment. Atno time, since the authorization was required, have the judges received loweradjustments than the other officials.", "President.

Since 1969, Presidents had been paid a salary of $200,000. No further action onpresidential pay is expected.

The costs ofadministration are covered by appropriation directly to the Labor Department.", "The Administration again proposed various changes in FECA that it broached in the 107th Congress. The aspect that would affect agency budgets government-wideis to charge administrative costs in the same manner as benefit costs, i.e. through theappropriation of each employing agency. The stated intention is to make each agencyexplicitly bear the full cost of their employees' claims, thus \"bolstering theirincentive to improve workplace safety.\" The administrative surcharge would bearound 3.5% of benefit costs (calculated from the Administration budget forFY2004, which contemplates $88 million in administrative costs to service $2,532million in program benefits). Most of the surcharge would be paid by the twoagencies that account for more than 60% of FECA claims: the U.S. Postal Serviceand the Defense Department. (However, the Postal Service already pays its sharepursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8147(c).)

(105) After H.R.2989 had been inserted into H.R. 2673 , the ConsolidatedAppropriations Act, 2004 (Division F), and the conference report had been prepared,but not yet filed, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) apparently wassuccessful in having some of the competitive sourcing provisions altered orremoved. (106)", "Competitive sourcing, which applies only to the commercial activities of federal executive agencies, is one of the components of the President's Management Agenda(PMA). Since February 2001, the OMB has implemented several initiatives designedto promote competitive sourcing, including revising OMB Circular A-76 (May 29,2003) and requiring agencies to submit inventories of their inherently governmentalactivities. Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for public-privatecompetitions.", "The enacted versions of the competitive sourcing provisions are found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673 ( P.L. 108-199 ), Division F, Title VI. Section647(a), which applies only to departments and agencies funded by the Departmentsof Transportation and Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill of2004, would place two conditions on competitions that involve more than 10 federalemployees. First, an agency would be required to develop a plan for a most efficientorganization (MEO), (107) which already isrequired by Circular A-76 for standardcompetitions, but is not required for streamlined competitions. (108) While thisrequirement might facilitate the preparation of an in-house (government) costestimate that is competitive, the time necessary to complete an MEO might make itdifficult for an agency to meet the circular's 90-day deadline (or 135 days if anextension is granted) for streamlined competitions. (109)", "Second, Section 647(a) also apparently would require consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions. Under Circular A-76, thedifferential is not used in streamlined competitions. (The conversion differential isthe lesser of $10 million or 10% of the personnel costs of the government's MEO. (110) ) However, since the circular may not have less stringent requirements than a law,Section 647(a) -- which has a requirement that is more stringent than the circular'sconcerning the application of the conversion differential to streamlined competitions -- apparently would take precedence. Section 647(a) would direct the competitivesourcing official (CSO) to consider how the conversion differential would affect thecontractor's cost. (111) Under Section 647(a)(2),this official would consider whether\"the cost of performance of the activity or function by a contract would be less costlyto the executive agency\" by $10 million, or 10% of the government's personnel costs,whichever is less. Left unstated is the criterion or standard against which the CSOshould compare the cost of contractor performance to determine if it is less costly tothe agency. Additionally, it remains to be seen whether, or how, a performancedecision, which involves completing the streamlined competition form, could takeinto account the conversion differential. (112) Could a CSO's consideration override aperformance decision?", "It seems that both the circular and Section 647(a) would apply to standard competitions. However, unlike the circumstances surrounding streamlinedcompetitions, the more stringent requirement for standard competitions is found inthe circular. Therefore, agencies would continue to add the conversion differentialto the cost of the non-incumbent's performance on the standard competition form,which is a requirement of Circular A-76. (113)", "Section 647(b) would require all executive agencies to submit annual reports toCongress on their competitive sourcing activities. The first report would be duewithin 120 days after enactment; the deadline for subsequent reports would beDecember 31 of each year. The reports would include the number of completedcompetitions and the number of announced, but not yet completed, competitions (andFTEs associated with each category); the cost of conducting competitions (includingcosts for contractors and consultants); estimated and actual savings; the projectednumber of FTEs scheduled to be competed in the next fiscal year; and a descriptionof the agency's competitive sourcing decision-making process. A reportingrequirement could aid congressional oversight of agency competitive sourcingactivities while facilitating the collection of useful information. Agency reportscould be used to inform OMB policy and guidance, and agency decisions. However,the absence of an established methodology for identifying, defining, and collectingthe required information might detract from its usefulness. Furthermore, fulfillingthis requirement possibly could add to the costs of competitive sourcing.", "Under Section 647(c), agency heads would not be required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation issued to an MEO to five years or less. (114) Apparently, as required by Circular A-76, MEOs would still be subject torecompetition, (115) but, as a result of theflexibility allowed by this provision,recompetitions might occur less frequently than would be the case otherwise. Thismodification could result in different treatment for government agencies and privatesector sources. Per Circular A-76, contractors who win public-private competitionsare subject to recompetition under the provisions of the Federal AcquisitionRegulation (FAR). (116) On the other hand,allowing agencies to write letters ofobligation with performance periods longer than five years could mitigate against anypotential recruitment or retention problems among federal government employees,and prospective employees, who are concerned about the possibility of relativelyfrequent recompetitions and the implications for their positions.", "Another competitive sourcing provision, Section 647(d), would permit agency heads to use appropriated funds, and any other funds made available to theiragencies, for monitoring the performance of an activity that had been subjected toa public-private competition. Depending upon what form monitoring might take, thisprovision could support oversight efforts and enhance agency decision-making byfunding the collection, recording, and analysis of information about agencycompetitions. Depending upon the extent, and associated costs, of such an initiative,however, agencies might be reluctant to expend funds on this type of activity.", "Section 647(e) states that any work converted to contractor performance could not be moved to a location outside the United States if the work had been previouslyperformed by federal government employees within the United States. Thisprovision possibly could affect the ability of some contractors to prepare competitivebids or proposals if, for example, labor costs in a given industry or sector are cheaperin other countries than in the United States. On the other hand, implementation ofthis provision could help to retain jobs for residents of the United States, while someemployers might benefit from keeping their workforce in relatively close proximityto their facilities in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cuba Sanctions", "paragraphs": [" (117)", "Both House- and Senate-approved versions of the FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, H.R. 2989, had nearlyidentical provisions that would have prevented funds from being used to administeror enforce restrictions on travel or travel-related transactions.
