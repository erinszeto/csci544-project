A data breach occurs when there is a loss or theft of, or other unauthorized access to, data containing sensitive personal information that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of data. Data breach notification laws typically cover \"personally identifiable information\" or \"individually identifiable information.\"", "No single federal law or regulation governs the security of all types of sensitive personal information. Determining which federal law, regulation, and guidance is applicable depends in part on the entity or sector that collected the information, and the type of information collected and regulated. Under federal law certain sectors are legally obligated to protect certain types of sensitive personal information. These obligations were created, in large part, when federal privacy legislation was enacted in the credit, financial services, health care, government, securities, and Internet sectors. Federal regulations were issued to require certain entities to implement information security programs and provide breach notice to affected persons.", "For example, there are federal information security requirements applicable to all federal government agencies (FISMA) and a federal information security law applicable to a sole federal department (Veterans Affairs). In the private sector, different laws apply to private sector entities engaged in different businesses.

Others believe the sectoral approach to the protection of personal information reflects not only variations in the types of information collected (e.g., government, private sector, health, financial, etc.), but also differences in the regulatory framework for particular sectors. Others advocate a national standard for entities that maintain personal information in order to harmonize legal obligations. Others distinguish between private data held by the government and private data held by others, and advocate a higher duty of care for governments with respect to sensitive personal information in the U.S. public sector and to data breaches.", "In the absence of a comprehensive federal data breach notification law, the majority of states have passed bills or introduced legislation to require businesses and/or government agencies to notify persons affected by breaches involving their sensitive personal information, and in some cases to implement information security programs to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of data. As of December 9, 2009, 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted legislation requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. Several states have reportedly considered legislation to hold retailers liable for third party companies' costs arising from data breaches (California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, and Wisconsin). Many states provide a safe harbor for an entity that is regulated by state or federal law and maintains procedures pursuant to such laws, rules, regulations, or guidelines. Reportedly 29 states impose similar duties for the public and private sectors, 14 states do not, and Oklahoma's law applies only to the public sector.

In 2007 the retailer TJX Companies revealed that 46.2 million credit and debit cards may have been compromised during the breach of its computer network by unauthorized individuals. In 2008 the Hannaford supermarket chain revealed that approximately 4 million debit and credit card numbers were compromised when Hannaford's computer systems were illegally accessed while the cards were being authorized for purchase. There were 1,800 reported cases of fraud connected to the computer intrusion.
