The act authorized spending on federal highway and public transportation programs, surface transportation safety and research, and some rail programs and activities through September 30, 2014. MAP-21 authorized roughly $105 billion for FY2013 and FY2014 combined. It also extended FY2012 surface transportation authorizations to the end of the fiscal year, raising the total authorization to approximately $118 billion.", "Most of the funding for surface transportation bills has been drawn from the highway trust fund (HTF) since its creation in 1956, but the HTF, which receives revenue mainly from federal motor fuel taxes, has, due to a sluggish economy and improvements in fuel efficiency, received revenue substantially below projections. For the past several years, HTF revenue has been insufficient to finance the government's surface transportation programs, leading Congress to delay reauthorization for 33 months following expiration of the last multi-year reauthorization. Although Congress was unable to agree on a long-term solution to the HTF revenue issue, MAP-21 did provide for the transfer of sufficient general fund revenues to the HTF to fund a two-year bill.", "MAP-21 made major changes in the programmatic structure for both highways and public transportation and included initiatives intended to increase program efficiency through performance-based planning and the streamlining of project development. Among its major provisions, MAP-21 included:", "for the federal-aid highway program, research, and education, authorizations for FY2013 of $40.96 billion and for FY2014 of $41.03 billion; for public transportation, authorizations for FY2013 of $10.58 billion and for FY2014 of $10.7 billion; for the Transportation Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (TIFIA), which provides credit assistance for surface transportation projects, a significant expansion that could provide credit support of up to $6.9 billion for FY2013 and $9.2 billion for FY2014; major program restructuring, which reduced the number of highway programs by two-thirds and consolidated public transportation programs as well; more distribution of funding via apportionment to the states and less discretionary funding via the Department of Transportation (DOT) to individual projects; no project earmarks; no equity program, instead basing the distribution of highway funding on the FY2012 distribution such that each state will likely receive as much federal highway funding as its highway users paid to the highway account of the HTF; and changes in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance process intended to accelerate project delivery."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "MAP-21: Overview", "paragraphs": ["Surface transportation authorization acts authorize spending on federal highway and public transportation programs, surface transportation safety and research, and some rail programs. The most recent multi-year authorization for federal surface transportation programs, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141 ), reauthorizes federal surface transportation programs and activities through September 30, 2014.", "MAP-21 authorizes roughly $105 billion for FY2013 and FY2014 combined. It also extended FY2012 surface transportation authorizations to the end of the fiscal year, raising the act's total authorization to approximately $118 billion.", "The comparatively short two-year authorization reflects the difficulty faced by Congress in funding surface transportation within a constrained budgetary environment. The highway trust fund (HTF) has provided most of the funding for surface transportation authorization bills since its creation in 1956. The HTF is supported mostly from taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, but a sluggish economy and improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency have reduced fuels tax revenues below projections. The taxes were last raised in 1993 and are fixed in terms of cents per gallon, so revenues do not rise along with motor fuel prices. Consequently, Congress faced a choice of cutting transportation spending, increasing motor fuels taxes, or providing general fund transfers to supplement the HTF revenues. In the end, Congress chose to transfer money from the general fund to the HTF to fund a two-year authorization.", "Congress also made major changes in the structure and formula of the highway and transit programs. The number of highway programs was reduced by roughly two-thirds. Mass transit programs were also reduced through consolidation. Although the eligibilities of many former programs were absorbed into new or modified programs under MAP-21, the changes have the potential to increase efficiency. The six large core programs under the previous authorization, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA; P.L. 109-59 ), were consolidated into five. The new National Highway Performance Program absorbed the Interstate Maintenance, National Highway System, and Federal-Aid Highway Bridges programs. Off-system highway bridges were included in the Surface Transportation Program. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program (CMAQ) and the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) were both retained, and the Recreational Trails, Safe Routes to Schools, Transportation Enhancements, and certain other eligibilities were combined into a new core program, Transportation Alternatives (TA). ", "Roughly 92% of the highway program funding under MAP-21 is distributed by formula and is under the control of the state departments of transportation. The number of discretionary programs, formerly under the control of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), has been reduced. In addition, MAP-21 is free of project earmarking. These changes continue a long-term shift away from detailed federal control of project decisions to a policy of limited federal oversight of project control exercised at the state and metropolitan levels.", "Unlike previous authorizations, MAP-21 does not use separate formulas to distribute funds for individual programs. Instead, it applies a broad initial calculation across virtually all the formula programs and then assigns a percentage of the available funding to each formula program. The initial calculation sets each state's apportionment share under most of the formula programs. In place of the old formula factors, such as, for example, lane miles on principal arterial routes, MAP-21 relies on a performance-based approach to rewarding progress toward national goals.", "MAP-21's use of the initial calculation eliminated the need for an equity bonus program to guarantee that each state would receive at least a proportion of its residents' payments into the HTF, as in SAFETEA. Instead, MAP-21 sets each state's share in the initial distribution for FY2013 and FY2014 based on the apportionment it received in FY2012, adjusted in FY2014 to assure that each state receives 95% or more of its highway tax contribution to the HTF. This adjustment may not be necessary, as all states have received more in apportionments and allocations than their tax payments to the HTF in every year since FY2007.", "MAP-21 also did not include the budgetary \"firewalls\" and spending guarantees that were maintained under both SAFETEA and its predecessor law, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century ( P.L. 105-178 ). These firewalls and spending guarantees made it difficult for surface transportation spending levels to be lowered during the annual appropriations process. Under MAP-21 the ability of the appropriators to lower authorized funding levels has been restored.", "During the MAP-21 debate Congress considered funding sources other than grants. The act provides for a major expansion of the Transportation Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (TIFIA) and some modest changes in federal tolling provisions. TIFIA is touted as allowing for the leveraging of almost ten times the amount authorized. Tolling changes reaffirm the support for value and congestion pricing and allow for tolling of new Interstate route construction. ", "Public transportation is provided with slight spending increases under MAP-21. Transit programs have undergone significant structural change. The new State of Good Repair Program replaces the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, and transit authorities are required to develop asset management systems. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program is funded at less than half the level of FY2012 and the funds are distributed by formula rather than being earmarked. ", "The federal program for freight transport proposed in the Senate surface transportation bill ( S. 1813 , 112 th Congress) was not included in MAP-21 as enacted. The act did retain many planning provisions related to identifying infrastructure components most critical to freight, including the designation of the \"primary freight network.\" ", "MAP-21 also seeks to accelerate transportation project delivery by altering the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance process and other environmental reviews. However, it is not certain that the enacted changes will speed project completion, and there is reason to think that some projects may face additional delay due to the new law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Surface Transportation Finance and the Highway Trust Fund", "paragraphs": ["The highway trust fund is financed from a number of sources including sales taxes on tires, trucks, buses, and trailers, as well as truck usage taxes. However, approximately 90% of trust fund revenue comes from excise taxes on motor fuels, 18.3 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon on diesel. The HTF consists of two separate accounts\u2014highway and mass transit. The highway account receives an allocation equivalent to 15.44 cents of the gasoline tax and the mass transit account receives the revenue generated by 2.86 cents of the tax. Because the fuel taxes are set in terms of cents per gallon, rather than as a percentage of the sale price, their revenues do not increase with inflation. The fuel tax rates were last raised in 1993.", "The period of sluggish economic performance that began in 2007 and improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency have reduced fuel tax revenue below the optimistic projections assumed in SAFETEA. The highway account has already required three transfers from the general fund totaling $29.7 billion, without which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) might not have been able to pay states for work they completed. The mass transit account received a $4.8 billion general fund transfer in FY2010. Both accounts were projected to have insufficient resources to fulfill MAP-21 funding levels without further general fund transfers.", "The finance provisions of MAP-21 met the need, providing general fund transfers of $6.2 billion and $12.6 billion for FY2013 and FY2014 respectively. $2.4 billion of the accrued balance of the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund was also transferred to the HTF for FY2012. According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, the highway account of the HTF will retain a prudent balance of $4.1 billion at the end of MAP-21 (i.e., FY2014). The mass transit account, however, is expected to have a balance of $0.5 billion, only half the amount considered prudent. ", "Projections indicate that HTF revenues will continue to be inadequate to support baseline spending on surface transportation programs after FY2014. This suggests that a reauthorization of MAP-21 would require an increase in the existing fuel taxes, continuing expenditures from the general fund, or reductions in the scope of the federal surface transportation program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25)", "paragraphs": ["The Budget Control Act requires sequestration of certain funding authorizations in the event a special joint committee of Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending reductions.

However, for FY2014, should any state receive less than 95 cents for every dollar contributed the highway account of the HTF the state's share is raised to that level.
