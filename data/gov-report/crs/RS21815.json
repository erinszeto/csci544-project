S.2290 was a revised version of S. 1125, 108thCongress, as reported by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary (S.Rept. 108-188). (1) A cloture vote failed on April 22, 2004, and S. 2290 was never votedon.", "S. 2290 would have created the Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation, within the Department of Labor,to award damages to asbestos claimants on a no-fault basis. Damages would have been paid by the Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution Fund, which would have been fundedby companies that have previously been sued for asbestos-relatedinjuries, and by insurers of such companies. Asbestos claims could no longer have been filed or pursued under statelaw, except for the enforcement of judgments no longer subject toany appeal or judicial review before the date of enactment of the bill.", "For background information on the history of asbestos litigation and on other proposals to address the situation,see CRS Report RL32286, Asbestos Litigation: Prospects for LegislativeResolution, by Edward Rappaport."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["RS21815 -- Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2004 (S. 2290, 108th Congress)", "Updated January 21, 2005"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Payment of Asbestos Injury Claims", "paragraphs": ["\"Any individual [or, if he is deceased, his personal representative] who has suffered from a[n eligible] disease or condition . . . may file a claim with the Office for an award with respectto such injury\" (\ufffd 113(a)). The claimant would have to \"prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he suffersfrom an eligible disease or condition\" (\ufffd 111(2)). He would not haveto prove that his injury \"resulted from the negligence or other fault of any person\" (\ufffd 112).", "The statute of limitations would be four years from the date the claimant first \"received a medical diagnosis of an eligible disease or condition,\" or \"discovered facts that would have leda reasonable person to obtain a medical diagnosis with respect to an eligible disease or condition\" (\ufffd 113(b)(1)). If,however, a claimant had filed a timely claim that was pending infederal or state court on the date of enactment of the bill, such claim would have to be dismissed, and the statuteof limitations to file a claim under the bill would be four years from thedate of enactment of the bill (\ufffd 113(b)(2)).", "\"Not later than 90 days after the filing of a claim, the Administrator shall provide to the claimant (and the claimant's representative) a proposed decision accepting or rejecting the claimin whole or in part and specifying the amount of the proposed award, if any\" (\ufffd 114(b)). Any claimant not satisfiedwith the proposed decision of the Administrator would be entitled, onwritten request made within 90 days, to a hearing or to a review of the written record, by a representative of theAdministrator\" (\ufffd 114(c)). After a hearing or review, or if no hearing orreview is requested within 90 days, the Administrator would issue a final decision (\ufffd 114(d)). A claimant wouldthen have 90 days to petition for judicial review of the final decision (\ufffd302(a)). Review would be by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the claimant resides at the time ofthe issuance of the final order (\ufffd 302(b)). The court would uphold thedecision unless it determined \"that the decision is not supported by substantial evidence, is contrary to law, or is notin accordance with procedure required by law\" (\ufffd 302(c)).", "The Administrator would \"establish a comprehensive asbestos claimant assistance program\" (\ufffd 104(a)), including a \"legal assistance program\" (\ufffd 104(d)). Attorneys could charge nomore than 2 percent of the amount of the award for filing an initial claim, and \"10 percent with respect to any claimunder appellate review\" (\ufffd 104(e)). The term \"appellate review\" isnot defined, so it is not clear whether it would include both the hearing or review by the representative of theAdministrator, and judicial review.", "The amount of an award under S. 2290 would be determined pursuant to the benefit table in section 131(b), which prescribes different amounts for different medicalconditions, and, in cases of lung cancer, different amounts for smokers, nonsmokers, and ex-smokers, as it definesthose terms.

S. 2290 provides explicitly that collateralsource compensation would not include workers' compensation orveterans benefits (\ufffd 134(b)), but it would apparently also not include any other compensation, such as disability orhealth insurance payments, or medicare or medicaid, that was not paidby \"a defendant or an insurer of that defendant, or compensation trust.\" A claimant, in other words, could receiveall these amounts in addition to his award from the Asbestos InjuryClaims Resolution Fund.", "Asbestos claimants would not receive lump-sum awards, but \"should receive the amount of the award through structured payments from the Fund, made over a period of three years, andin no event more than four years after the date of final adjudication of the claim\" (\ufffd 133(a)(1))."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding of Asbestos Injury Claims", "paragraphs": ["The Asbestos Resolution Claims Fund would be paid for by \"defendant participants\" and \"insurer participants.\" Defendant participants would apparently be companies that have beensued for injuries caused by exposure to asbestos, and insurer participants would be the insurers of suchcompanies.
