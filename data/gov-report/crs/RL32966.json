Its military contingent of 2,500 troops made it the third largest in themultinational stability force. On August 25, 2003, Poland assumed command of one of threemilitary sectors. At its peak, the command consisted of more than 9,000 troops, from Europe, Asia,and Latin America; the Polish-led division has also received intelligence, communications, andlogistics support from NATO. Because some countries have reduced or withdrawn their troops, totalstrength of the Polish-led contingent as of June 2005 was estimated at around 4,000.", "Several incidents related to Iraq captured the attention of Poles at home. In July 2004, agroup calling itself the Al Qaeda Organization in Europe posted on its website a warning that Polandand Bulgaria would suffer terrorist attacks similar to the March 2004 bombings in Madrid unlessthey pulled their troops out of Iraq. The Polish deputy defense minister said the government wouldnot cave in to such demands, but the Madrid bombings may have increased Poland's sense ofvulnerability to such attacks. In October, armed insurgents in Iraq kidnaped a Polish citizen; she wasreleased unharmed the following month. Finally, Poland has suffered several casualties in Iraq; todate, it has lost 17 military troops and 4 civilians, including a well-known television reporter. Over100 Poles have been wounded.

Later that month, shortly beforea parliamentary confidence vote, Defense Minister Szmajdzinski said that the Poland wanted to\"significantly reduce our presence\" after Iraq's January 2005 elections. In a series of subsequentpronouncements -- some contradictory -- government officials continued to affirm that their country'stroop levels would be reduced. Finally, in December, dates and numbers were provided: Polandwould withdraw up to 700 troops after the Iraqi elections, and that a decision on the remainder ofits contingent would be made after the vote. In early February, during a joint press conference withSecretary of State Rice, Polish Foreign Minister Rotfeld stated that the Iraqi elections had \"totallychanged our optics on Iraq.\" This new perspective does not appear to have affected the pulloutdecision, however; the government has since announced that as many as 300 additional troops wouldreturn to Poland by August, and that all Polish soldiers would exit Iraq when the UN multinationalforces mandate expires in December 2005. Warsaw will likely continue to support NATO trainingof the Iraq officer corps. (5) ", "Although the reaction to the March 11, 2004 Madrid bombing and the inmate mistreatmentat Abu Ghraib were the main reasons cited by the media for Poland's downsizing of its militarycontingent in Iraq, other factors also played a role. For example, the stabilization mission in Iraq hasbeen a difficult one for Poland in terms of both scope and location. Iraq has been the country'sbiggest combat deployment, and the country's climate has presented special challenges. In addition,the cost of the Iraq mission has been burdensome to Poland. In an April 2005 announcementdetailing further troop cutbacks, Defense Minister Szmajdzinski stated that the deployment had costPoland $210 million.

(7) ", "Iraq Reconstruction Contracts. In an October2004 interview, former Polish Foreign Minister Cimoszewicz was asked to comment on Poland'sexpectations of being awarded \"lucrative\" contracts to help rebuild Iraq; he replied that \"[i]t is truethat many Polish companies expected to become involved in the economic reconstruction of Iraq,and that has not happened.\" (8) The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) noted that \"Washington'sdecision to reward the biggest [Iraq reconstruction] contracts to a few US companies has stokedresentment in Poland.\" (9) U.S. officials were aware of this disappointment and tried to correct the situation. In December2004, for example, it was announced that Iraq had agreed to purchase military materiel from Poland,including helicopters and ground transportation vehicles, and in late January another Polish defensecompany landed a large contract. Other contracts reportedly were under negotiation. Someobservers suggest that perhaps Poland's expectations for offsetting contracts were too high.", "Military Aid. On defense-related assistance,Polish officials note that their army is still in transition, and that Iraq has put a severe strain on itsresources; Deputy Defense Minister Janus Zemke commented that \"[w]e simply will not be able tosqueeze more of our own budget for military procurement. At the same time, these huge outlays forIraq are delaying the final transformation of our armed forces. It is a fundamental problem.\" Polesalso have complained that their country received U.S. military aid packages similar in size tocountries that had sent far smaller contingents to Iraq. Some Polish policymakers hoped that theUnited States would help offset the steep costs by stepping up its military assistance to Warsaw. InFebruary 2005, President Bush pledged to seek $100 million in such aid to Poland. The funds weresubsequently requested, as part of a supplemental appropriations bill. Congress approved a $200million \"Solidarity Fund\" intended to help countries that had contributed troops to Iraq. However,because the contingency fund covers several countries, it is uncertain whether Poland will receivethe full amount that President Bush sought to provide. Poland will also likely receive $32 millionin regular military assistance requested by the Administration for FY2006. (10) ", "Visa Waiver. Finally, Warsaw has hoped for awaiver of the U.S. government requirement that Poles traveling to the United States for three monthsor less carry a visa; currently applicants pay a $100 non-refundable fee, and then submit to aninterview at a U.S. embassy or consulate. U.S. policy is grounded in the belief that if somecountries, including Poland, received a waiver of the visa requirement, too many of their citizenswould travel to the United States and remain illegally. Analysts note that Poland has failed to meetthe qualifications for the visa waiver program. The Polish government argues, however, that Polandis no longer under Communism, and is no longer desperately poor -- two major incentives in the pastto leave the country. They also point out that millions of illegal immigrants are already living in theUnited States. Polish leaders have raised the issue with their U.S. counterparts. At the conclusionof the latest Bush/Kwasniewski meeting, the two sides announced that they had agreed upon a\"roadmap\" of steps aimed at helping resolve the issue. Although details of the plan have not yet beenmade public, it would reportedly eliminate certain outdated information requirements. Also,Members of Congress have submitted legislation on this issue; in the 109th Congress, SenatorsSantorum and Mikulski introduced S. 635 , which would add Poland to the list of 27countries on the visa waiver program. Representative Jackson-Lee's bill, H.R. 634 ,would do the same thing, with certain conditions.

Once reliant upon sales to the Soviet bloc, Poland today sends itsexports overwhelmingly to countries belonging to the EU, which Poland, along with 9 other mostlyeastern European countries, joined on May 1, 2004.

Nonetheless, Poland is the largest food producer of the ten countries that recently joined the EU, andagriculture was a major sticking point in Warsaw's accession negotiations. Poland's farmers largelyopposed membership, fearing that competition with western European producers, who are moreefficient and receive higher subsidies, would drive many Poles out of business. These sentimentswere exploited by Andrzej Lepper, populist leader of the Self Defense party. Lepper sought to attractsupport by various -- often illegal -- means, including destroying railcar loads of imported grain,blockading highways, and occupying the agricultural ministry building.", "Despite their misgivings, nearly all Polish farmers applied for EU subsidies. After Polandbecame an EU member, agricultural exports and commodity prices rose steeply, and producers --including Mr. Lepper -- began to receive checks from Brussels. In addition, the EU has pledged tofund half of the cost of modernizing Polish farms.

According to this view, instances of corruption are being revealed in alltheir detail today, rather than being swept under the carpet, as they were in the past.

Butin spite of its poor recent showing in surveys that attempt to measure corruption andcompetitiveness, Poland has continued to attract foreign funding. To encourage continuedinvestment, Poland maintains a low corporate tax rate -- about one-half that of Germany.

Since beginning accession negotiations,Poland has sought to meet its NATO obligations. Between 1999 and 2002, the government spentaround 2.0% of GDP on defense, equal to or slightly above the non-U.S., alliance-wide average. ThePoles have also sought to comply with NATO's Prague Capabilities Commitment, the most recentof the alliance's initiatives to enable members collectively to respond better to out-of-area missions.

Poland criticized the conduct of Belarus' October 2004 parliamentary elections andreferendum permitting strongman Alexander Lukashenko to serve a third presidential term. Warsawalso urged Belarus \"to drop authoritarian practices that are inconsistent with the main Europeanvalues of all modern democratic countries.\" The official Belarusian press bureau accused the Polishmedia of \"tendentiousness\" in covering the October votes.

Key issues for Warsaw include border security and the statusof the ethnic Polish minority in Belarus. President Kwasniewski characterized Polish policy towardBelarus as one of \"determination and delicacy.\" (21) ", "Ukraine. Poland has for years encouraged Ukraineto integrate with the West and thereby wean itself from Russian influence. Poland played a key rolein helping defuse Ukraine's 2004 political crisis. On October 31, Ukraine held presidential elections,and a runoff vote was held on November 21. Giant protests erupted after it became clear that thevotes had been far from free and fair. Poland -- including the parliament, the government, andprivate citizens -- became involved at the outset. In October, the Sejm passed a measure urging theUkrainian government to \"respect democratic standards.\" (22) Later, thousands of Poles demonstrated throughout their countryin support of Ukraine's \"orange revolution.\" After the first runoff, former Ukrainian PresidentKuchma contacted Kwasniewski and asked him to help negotiate a peaceful settlement. Kwasniewski served as a mediator, along with Lithuanian President Vladas Adamkus and by JavierSolana, head of the EU foreign policy office.

During the current decade, Poland hasattempted to normalize its ties with Russia, which were strained after the expulsion in 2000 of nineRussian diplomats on charges of spying, among other issues. During his inaugural address inOctober 2001, Prime Minister Miller said that Poland would seek to carve out a role as the linkbetween the West and the countries of the former Soviet Union. The following month, PresidentKwasniewski indicated that Poland could act as a go-between for the West and Russia. (23) Poland has had severalconcerns with Russia over the past couple of years, however. First of all, it has had to contend withRussian resentment over its efforts to build ties with -- and inculcate democracy in -- Ukraine andBelarus. In addition, Russian President Putin was reportedly angry over the manner in which thePolish media covered the terrorist incident in Beslan, as well as the ongoing conflict in Chechnya. At the same time, Poland has tried to placate Russia for economic as well as geopolitical reasons:Russia is its chief supplier of oil and natural gas.

", "European Union. In May 2004, as noted above,Poland fulfilled a long-term foreign policy goal when it joined nine other countries in becoming amember of the European Union. Poland has reaped tangible economic benefits from membership,and has been an active political player in the EU. Warsaw was not reluctant to assert itself beforejoining the EU and will likely be even less hesitant to do so now that it is a member. On severalissues, Poland staked out positions intended to advance its interests and values: ", "EU Security Policy. Poland's initial skepticism aboutthe European Security and Defense Policy has changed to \"cautious enthusiasm,\" according to oneobserver. Poland supports the development of an EU military capability, but not at the cost ofweakening NATO. In a February 2005 interview, Defense Minister Szmajdzinski was insistent thatany EU defense structure should \"complement and not ... compete with NATO.\" This is in line withU.S. policy. Poland also announced that it would join the newly-created European military police,a 900-strong force intended for international deployment. (25) ", "Christian Heritage. Poland, joined by Italy and severalother mostly Roman Catholic countries, called for the preamble of the EU \"constitution\" to refer tothe Christian heritage shared by a majority of EU citizens. The measure was voted down by otherEU members, but Pope John Paul II lauded Poland for its efforts. Some observers have commentedthat, like the United States but unlike many of its more secular fellow European countries, Polandexhibits a relatively strong concern for religious values. (26) ", "Turkey. Despite its call for EU recognition ofEurope's Christian heritage, Poland has \"vigorously\" supported Turkey's ambition to join the EU. Former Polish Foreign Minister Cimoszewicz argued that Turkey should belong because it \"is proofthat the fundamental values of Western democracy can also be applied in Islamic countries.\" Analysts also argue that Poland's support is based on its belief that the inclusion of Turkey,traditionally a strong U.S. ally, would strengthen the transatlantic link. Finally, Warsaw reportedlybelieves that Turkish membership would improve the prospects of Ukraine being invited to join --a major Polish foreign policy goal. (27) ", "Taxes. Poland and other countries have objected toFrance's proposal to reduce EU structural funds to member states that maintain below-averagecorporate tax rates. Critics charge that the practice, known as \"fiscal dumping,\" is used to attractforeign investment; they argue that countries that maintain low tax rates should not be compensatedby EU subsidies. Poland opposes France and Germany's proposal for a minimum, EU-widecorporate income tax, noting that, for example, its value-added tax is relatively high. (28) ", "Bilateral Issues. Poland also has crossed swords withindividual players within the EU; over the past year, Warsaw has had differences with Germany,France, and Spain on both EU and other matters. Polish-German relations were strained in 2004 byissues that harked back to World War II. The contretemps began when a German group (thePrussian Claims Society) demanded that the Polish government make compensatory payments to thefamilies of ethnic Germans who had been expelled from Polish territory in 1945-46. The claimcaused an uproar in Poland, and some members of the Sejm called for Germany to pay reparationsfor Poland's World War II losses. In November, the two governments agreed to dismiss such claims. Poland also has dueled with France (its biggest foreign investor) over Iraq, tax policy, and EU votingrights, and with Spain over the distribution of EU structural funds.
