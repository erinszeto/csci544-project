Strengthen intellectual property rights protection by advancing the Intellectual Property Action Strategy. Smarter and More Secure Borders: Coordinate long-term infrastructure plans and take steps to reduce bottlenecks and congestion at major border crossings. Increase cooperation on the development and application of technology to make borders smarter and more secure so as to avoid unnecessary inspections and to strengthen trusted traveler and shipper programs. Increase cooperation to install advanced screening equipment at ports of entry to deter and detect smuggling of nuclear and radiological materials. Energy Security and Environmental Protection: Strengthen energy security and protect the environment by developing a framework for harmonization of energy efficiency standards and sharing technical information to improve the North American energy market. Exchange information and explore opportunities to further reduce barriers to expanding clean energy technologies. Work to improve North America's air quality and improve the safety of chemicals in the marketplace. Food and Product Safety: Increase cooperation and information sharing on the safety of food and products. Strengthen regulatory and inspection systems to protect consumers.

Working groups were established to address the security aspects of the SPP and are grouped by three broad themes: (1) external threats to North America, (2) streamlined and secured shared borders, and (3) prevention and response within North America. Ten individual security working groups have been established to address specific portions of the security agenda and include traveler security; cargo security; border facilitation; aviation security; maritime security; law enforcement; intelligence cooperation; bio-protection; protection, preparedness, and response; and science and technology. In the August 2007 joint statement, the three leaders highlighted several next steps to better secure North America, including, for example, reducing duplicate screening for baggage and cargo, pursuing innovative and interoperable law enforcement models to promote seamless operation at the border, improving and expanding existing law enforcement radio communications, identifying ways to further enhance the benefits of trusted traveler programs, and alleviating bottlenecks as the U.S.-Mexico border. The Ministerial Joint Statement issued in February of 2008, in advance of the leaders' meeting in New Orleans in April of 2008, stated that the leaders had reviewed the progress that had been achieved since the meeting in Montebello, and directed officials to \"strengthen cooperation protocols and create new mechanisms to secure our common borders while facilitating legitimate travel and trade in the North American region.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The SPP and Member Economies", "paragraphs": ["The SPP was not a trade agreement, nor a form of economic integration, and went only as far as leading to some measure of regulatory harmonization among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The SPP working groups did not contemplate further market integration in North America. Such a move would have required a government approval process within each of the three countries. In the United States, any agreement or efforts on the part of the SPP regarding further market integration would have required the approval of the U.S. Congress.", "Some proponents of economic integration in North America maintain that the emergence of China and India in the global marketplace may be putting North America at a competitive disadvantage with other countries and that NAFTA should go beyond a free trade agreement. These proponents have written policy papers proposing that the U.S. government consider the possibility of forming a \"NAFTA-Plus,\" a \"North American Union,\" or even a common currency called the \"Amero.\" Critics of this level of economic integration believe that NAFTA has already gone too far and that it has harmed the U.S. economy and undermined democratic control of domestic policy-making. Others suggested that the SPP may be more than an initiative to increase cooperation and that it could lead to the creation of a common market or economic union in North America. However, as previously noted, if the United States were to potentially consider the formation of a customs union or common market with its North American neighbors, it would require approval by the U.S. Congress.", "A free trade agreement (FTA), such as NAFTA, is the most common form of regional economic integration. Generally, in an FTA, member countries agree to eliminate tariffs and nontariff barriers on trade and investment within the specified free trade area. Under an FTA, each country maintains its own trade policies, including tariffs on trade outside the region.", "In addition to FTAs, other forms of economic integration are customs unions, common markets, and economic unions. Such agreements sometimes imply a greater loss of autonomy over the parties' commercial policies and require longer and more complex negotiations and implementation periods than FTAs. Customs unions are agreements in which members conduct free trade among themselves and maintain a common trade policy towards non-members. These agreements require the establishment of a common external tariff and harmonization of external trade policies. Common markets are those in which member countries go beyond a customs union by eliminating barriers to labor and capital flows across national borders within the market. The European Union is the most prominent example of a common market. In economic unions, member countries merge their economies even further than common markets by establishing a common currency, and therefore a unified monetary policy, along with other common economic institutions. The 12 members of the European Union that have adopted the euro as a common currency is the most significant example of a group of countries that has moved forward from a customs union to an economic union."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transportation Corridors", "paragraphs": ["One of the stated goals of the SPP was to improve the safety, security, and efficiency of the flow goods between the three countries. The majority of trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico is transported by land modes (truck, rail, and pipeline). U.S. freight trade with Canada and Mexico more than doubled in value between 1996 and 2007, growing from $419 billion in 1996 to $909 billion in 2007 . Trucks were the dominant mode for transporting goods between the United States and its NAFTA partners, accounting for 61% ($555 billion) of the value of total trade in 2007. This growth in the volume of freight placed an increasing burden on transportation systems, and particularly the road network. ", "Data however, was showing a decline in the volume of surface transportation trade between the United States and its NAFTA partners in 2008. For example, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) reported that the value of trade using surface transportation between the United States and Canada for November 2008 was $37.8 billion, which represented a 16.4% decline compared to November of 2007. Similarly, BTS reported that U.S.-Mexico surface transportation trade for November 2008 totaled $22.9 billion, representing a decline of 9% compared to November 2007. These measures combined indicated that surface transportation trade for November 2008 between the United States and its NAFTA partners declined 13.8% as compared to November 2007. ", "Some observers contended that the SPP would ultimately lead to a so-called \"NAFTA Superhighway\" that would link the United States, Canada, and Mexico with a 'super-corridor'. The federal government however, stated that there were no plans to build a \"NAFTA Superhighway,\" and that no super-corridor initiative of any sort was a part of the SPP. Further, no legal authority existed and no funds were appropriated to construct such a superhighway, nor were there any plans to seek such authority or funding.", "States regularly undertake highway construction and improvement projects, independently of any initiatives under the former SPP. As noted above, the nation's freight transportation system is being exposed to an increasing burden from cross-border trade. States and localities undertake highway projects to address the impacts of this increasing burden on the roadways, particularly in border states. Planning for these projects along the border often requires consultation with the neighboring NAFTA partners, as expansions of port access roads, additional lanes and bigger plazas, impact the flow of traffic through the port, and therefore the flow of traffic entering the neighboring country. Among other efforts, the SPP Transportation Working Group was involved in analyzing border trade and traffic flows to support border infrastructure planning and prioritization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cargo Security and Border Facilitation", "paragraphs": ["One of the central tensions in border management policy concerns how to design policies that facilitate the efficient entry of legitimate cargo while simultaneously ensuring that a sufficient level of security and scrutiny is applied to deny the entry of illegitimate cargo. Two of the ten SPP security working groups were devoted to cargo security and border facilitation. Since 9/11, the U.S. government had undertaken a number of initiatives aimed at improving cargo security and the facilitation of legitimate or low-risk cargo. Programs such as the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program (a joint U.S.-Canada, and U.S.-Mexico program), and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program (a public-private supply chain security initiative) are two well-known examples of post-9/11 initiatives that had sought to provide increased security while also providing expedited customs-clearance to pre-vetted shipments.", "One initiative that was considered under the SPP was known as pre-clearance, which has long been in place at airports, but which gas been difficult to implement at the land border. A related concept is known as reverse inspections which is essentially pre-clearance conducted on both sides of the border. Under the reverse inspection scenario, U.S. customs officials would be stationed in Canada to process and clear cargo en-route to the U.S. before the cargo reaches the U.S. border. Similarly, Canadian customs officials would be stationed in the U.S. to process cargo en-route to Canada from the United States. Proponents of reverse inspections maintain that this process offered increased security because it would allow U.S. customs officers the opportunity to intercept high-risk cargo before the truck reached the bridge or the booth on the U.S. side of the border. Critics of the reverse inspection proposal cited sovereignty issues as a primary obstacle, but there were a host of other issues including the different authorities held by each country's customs agencies, and a variety of different legal issues.", "Progress was made, under the U.S.-Canada Shared Border Accord and the SPP, towards developing a pilot program to test reverse inspections at two different land border ports along the U.S.-Canada border. The pilots had not gone forward as of May 2009 , and it is unclear whether or not the obstacles to reverse inspections can be overcome in the future."], "subsections": []}]}}
