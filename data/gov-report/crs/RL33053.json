Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to issue major disaster or emergency declarations in response to catastrophes in the United States that overwhelm state and local governments. Such declarations result in the distribution of a wide range of federal aid to individuals and families, certain nonprofit organizations, and public agencies. Congress appropriates money to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), through both annual appropriations and emergency supplemental appropriations, for disaster assistance authorized by the Stafford Act. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) administers most, but not all, of the authority the statute vests in the President.", "The most recent significant action concerning the statute occurred in the closing months of the 109th Congress as a result of the congressional investigation on the response to Hurricane Katrina (August 2005). Senators inserted Stafford Act amendments into the FY2007 DHS appropriations legislation (Title VI of P.L. 109-295). These amendments expanded FEMA's authority to expedite emergency assistance to stricken areas, imposed new planning and preparedness requirements on federal administrators, provided new authority to regional offices, and increased federal assistance to victims and communities. More recently, Congress included a provision in the FY2010 appropriations legislation (P.L. 111-83) that allows retired law judges to arbitrate conflicts concerning the recovery of public infrastructure in the Gulf Coast due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. While not an amendment to the Stafford Act, this provision affects the administration of the FEMA appeals process under which applications for Stafford assistance are reconsidered. The decisions made to date by the arbitration panels resulted in an Administration request for supplemental funding that resulted in P.L. 111-112, which added more than $5.5 billion to the Disaster Relief Fund.", "Previously introduced legislation during the 111th Congress would have amended the statute. Among the proposals, H.R. 3377, the Disaster Response, Recovery, and Mitigation Enhancement Act of 2009, would have authorized the Disaster Relief Fund, provided health benefits to temporary or intermittent federal employees who provide disaster assistance, authorized the National Urban Search and Rescue Response System, and requested FEMA to update standards for individual assistance disaster requests. Other bills sought to reauthorize a mortgage and rental assistance program terminated in 2000 (H.R. 888/S. 763), establish new eligibility criteria (H.R. 941, H.R. 1059, H.R. 1494, H.R. 2484, H.R. 4141, and S. 1069), and mandate establishment of a tracking and storage plan for housing units used by disaster survivors (H.R. 3437/S. 713)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of the Stafford Act", "paragraphs": ["The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to issue major disaster, emergency, and fire management declarations, which in turn enable federal agencies to provide assistance to state and local governments overwhelmed by catastrophes. The statute also authorizes the President to determine whether certain types of authorized assistance will be provided and the conditions under which the aid is distributed. ", "The Stafford Act comprises the following titles:", "Title I: findings, declarations, and definitions; Title II: preparedness and pre-disaster mitigation authority; Title III: administrative provisions; Title IV: major disaster assistance; Title V: emergency assistance; Title VI: emergency preparedness (previously the Civil Defense Act of 1950); Title VII: miscellaneous provisions.", "Titles IV and V identify the types of assistance that may be provided, and, in some circumstances, the limitations on the aid. Most of the presidential authority set out in Titles IV and V in the statute, with the exception of the authority to issue declarations, has been delegated to administration officials\u2014currently the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014through executive orders. Following the investigation into the response to Hurricane Katrina, Congress also authorized the Administrator to provide federal leadership before and after catastrophes, including \"assisting the President in carrying out the functions\" of the Stafford Act.", "Stafford Act definitions establish eligibility for assistance and the conditions that may be catalysts for presidential action. The definition of \"major disaster\" is relatively restrictive \u2500 \"any natural catastrophe\" including storms, earth movements and high water, and \"regardless of cause, any fire, flood or explosion.\" Presidents Bush and Obama issued 55 major disaster declarations in calendar year 2009. By comparison, the definition of \"emergency\" is broad, authorizing the President to determine \"any occasion or instance\" when federal aid is needed by state and local governments to save lives and property or to address the threat of a catastrophe. In calendar year 2009, President Bush issued one emergency declaration for the presidential inauguration in the District of Columbia; President Obama issued six others in the remainder of the year, five for winter storms and one for a refinery explosion in Puerto Rico. The statute also authorizes the President to provide fire suppression assistance to prevent a forest or grassland fire from becoming a major disaster. President Obama issued 48 fire management declarations in 2009; President Bush issued one before leaving office, for a yearly total of 49 such declarations.", "Stafford Act assistance funding derives from appropriations made to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), administered by DHS. Federal assistance supported by the DRF, and authorized in Title IV (for major disasters) or Title V (for emergencies) provides grants for mass care for disaster survivors, the restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities, amelioration of the impact of future disasters, clearance of debris, and aid for those with uninsured critical needs. The statute also authorizes loans to communities that suffer significant revenue losses as a result of major disasters. In addition, the statute authorizes unemployment assistance directly related to the event (administered by the Department of Labor) and allows federal agency heads to provide technical assistance, personnel, equipment and other resources to help state and local response and recovery efforts.", "While the President may exercise discretion under authority of the statute, that authority is circumscribed by the act's administrative provisions. Federal aid cannot duplicate that provided by other sources. Federal agency heads may waive administrative, but not statutory, requirements to expedite assistance. A federal coordinating officer, appointed by the President (or the designee), ensures that federal and non-federal assistance provided to major disaster or emergency areas is coordinated. Applicants for aid must purchase appropriate levels of insurance. Title III of the statute sets out these and other administrative requirements and limitations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The 1974 Disaster Relief Act, As Amended", "paragraphs": ["The Stafford Act consists of the text of the statute enacted by Congress in 1974 and that of a series of amendments approved over the past 35 years that have added administrative requirements, enhanced the types of assistance that may be provided, expanded eligibility to certain non-profit organizations, and coordinated Stafford assistance with other federal authorities. ", "The act maintains a two-part orientation first established in a 1950 statute (superseded by the 1974 legislation), as follows: (1) federal assistance supplements state and local relief and recovery efforts and, (2) is triggered only by a presidential declaration that is preceded by a gubernatorial request for assistance. ", "The scope of the statute has expanded considerably over the decades to provide a wide range of grants for the needs of individuals, families, certain community organizations, and state and local government operations. The congressional investigation initiated to address questions about the response to Hurricane Katrina, which struck in August 2005, culminated in enactment of amendments that established new levels of assistance, but perhaps more importantly, addressed administrative concerns. The following section highlights the more significant amendments adopted in 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The 2006 Amendments", "paragraphs": ["Through the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (Title VI, P.L. 109-295 ) and, to a lesser extent, the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2005, known as the SAFE Port Act ( P.L. 109-347 ), Congress expanded the authority of FEMA to provide assistance and imposed requirements on federal officials to ensure that effective pre-disaster preparation actions would be taken. Assistance for service animals and pets, pre-disaster authority, evacuation planning, and individual case management are some of the enhancements included in these amendments. While augmenting federal assistance authorities such as these, the amendments maintained state, local, and individual emergency management responsibility and accountability. In short, the Post-Katrina Act expanded the President's federal disaster assistance authority, but left the basic tenets of the Stafford Act (such as Presidential discretion, need for state requests, most restrictions on eligibility) unchanged.", "The changes to the Stafford Act enacted by Congress in 2006 may be summarized as follows:", "Expedited federal assistance. The President is now authorized to support precautionary evacuation measures, accelerate federal emergency response and recovery aid, and provide expedited federal assistance (coordinated with the state to the extent possible) in the absence of a specific request from state officials. Aid to individuals with special needs. Disabled individuals now receive federal housing assistance on sites that meet their needs, \"whenever practicable,\" with the inclusion in the Stafford Act of the definition of \"individual with a disability\" from the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. Also, durable medical equipment, such as that needed by the disabled, may be provided, and the FEMA Administrator must develop guidelines concerning the accommodation of individuals with disabilities with regard to emergency facilities and equipment. The amendments also prohibit discrimination toward the disabled, those with special needs, and those with limited proficiency in the English language. To assist the latter segment of disaster victims, the FEMA Administrator must ensure that information is made available to those with limited English proficiency, and must develop and maintain information on model language assistance as well as best practices for the state and local governments working with these individuals. Also, the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006 authorizes grants to states for the improvement of emergency shelters to accommodate pets and service animals. Expanded assistance to disaster victims. The President is authorized to provide transportation assistance to those displaced from their residences, including aid needed to move among alternative temporary shelters or to return to their original residence. The President may also provide case management services to state, local, or qualified private organizations that provide assistance to victims. Housing assistance. Seven provisions in the 2006 amendments expanded the scope of federal housing assistance to be made available to victims. First, in order to be considered eligible for housing assistance, victims of major disasters or emergencies who are disabled must be unable to access or inhabit their homes. Prior to enactment of the 2006 amendments the statute did not differentiate disabled access from that experienced by other disaster victims. Second, alternative housing sites provided to victims by the federal government must meet physical accessibility requirements. Third, the amendments eliminated the statutory ceilings on financial aid to be provided for housing repair and replacement, but did not eliminate the overall cap of $25,000 that may be provided to each individual or household under Section 408. Fourth, the amendments authorize the President to provide semi-permanent housing where no alternatives exist. Fifth, the statute includes as newly eligible housing-assistance costs both utility costs (excluding telephone service) and security deposits. Sixth, the disposal of temporary housing units (generally referred to as \"FEMA trailers\") is to be coordinated with the Department of the Interior or other federal agencies to facilitate the transfer of the units to tribal governments. Seventh, the amendments established a demonstration project, the Individuals and Households Pilot Program, to increase the use of existing rental housing to provide temporary housing for victims of major disasters. Through the pilot program, which expired December 31, 2008, the Administrator was to provide for the repair and improvement of multi-family rental properties in disaster areas to increase the rental stock available to disaster victims in the immediate area. Public assistance (PA) to state and local governments. State or local governments or eligible private nonprofit-facility owners may apply for federal assistance to build a new facility in a different location if all parties determine that a damaged facility should not be repaired or replaced. Such assistance, known as the \"in-lieu\" contribution (a grant made in-lieu of replacing or repairing a facility that existed before the disaster), has been authorized since 1974 and consists of PA grants based on the federal estimate of the cost of repair or replacement. The 2006 amendment in the SAFE Ports Act deleted the clause that authorized an in-lieu grant for 90% of the federal share of the estimate of repairing or replacing the facility solely in areas with unstable soil. Now all stricken state and local governments, not just those in areas marked by unstable soil, may apply for a 90% in-lieu grant. The SAFE Ports Act also authorized expedited payments for debris removal to state or local governments or to owners of qualified private nonprofit facilities. In addition, the SAFE Ports Act amended the Community Disaster Loan (CDL) provisions by authorizing loans to local governments (capped at $5 million) that, because of a major disaster, suffer significant losses in tax revenue. Another PA change required the President, through the FEMA Administrator, to conduct a pilot program of incentives for local and state government involvement in debris removal and the acceleration of repair work. Assistance to nonprofit organizations. Three significant changes were adopted regarding the federal aid provided to private nonprofit organizations affected by a major disaster. First, the statute authorizes the President, within stated constraints, to define facilities that provide \"essential services of a governmental nature to the general public.\" These provisions, similar to those in FEMA regulations, establish eligibility for museums, zoos, performing arts facilities, community arts centers, and other facilities that \"provide health and safety services of a governmental nature\" as long as they provide \"essential services of a governmental nature to the general public,\" as defined by the President. Third, the amendments added the word \"education\" to the listing in the section of the law that defines critical services. Through this change, private nonprofit education organizations may apply directly for a FEMA grant without having to apply for a Small Business Administration loan. Hazard mitigation. Section 404 of the Stafford Act authorizes the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) for grants to states in which major disasters have been declared. These funds must be used for activities that prevent future disasters or reduce their impact if they cannot be prevented. The Post-Katrina Act adjusted the percentage amounts for HMGP awards by establishing a scale that authorizes a higher percentage (15% of the total Stafford Act assistance in a state) for major disasters in which no more than $2 billion is provided, 10% for assistance that ranges from more than $2 billion to $10 billion, and 7.5% for major disasters that involve Stafford Act assistance of more than $10 billion to $35.3 billion. Administrative changes. The 2006 amendments authorize the President to appoint one Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) for a multi-state event, in addition to deputy FCO's as needed. Traditionally, one FCO has been named for each separate disaster declaration in each respective state. The statute also amends the Stafford Act by requiring that the President designate a Small State and Rural Advocate in FEMA to ensure that rural community needs are met in the declaration process and to help small states prepare declaration requests, among other duties. Other administrative changes concern the authority and capabilities of organizations charged with the response to the major disaster site. The amendments authorize the President to establish at least three national response teams and others as deemed necessary (including regional response teams), and require that FEMA team members possess essential capabilities, training skills, and equipment. In addition, the SAFE Ports Act amended the Stafford Act by adding a new definition, \"essential service providers,\" defined as persons affiliated with municipal governments or private entities who will help restore essential services to a stricken area. Such workers are not to be impeded when they seek access to a disaster site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Action in the 111th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Legislation introduced in the 111 th Congress could have expanded categories of federal assistance in the Stafford Act and, if enacted, make relatively minor adjustments to the statute. Selected examples of the legislation and summaries of the policy changes that would be incorporated into the statute are listed below:", "H.R. 888 and S. 763 : Temporary mortgage and rental assistance would be authorized for victims in areas included in a major disaster declaration. Congress previously authorized the assistance from 1974 until enactment of the 2000 amendments which vitiated the provision as part of the efforts by the 106 th Congress and the Clinton Administration to constrain federal emergency management costs. H.R. 941 and S. 1069 : H.R. 941 would designate owners or operators of a private or investor-owned electric utility company serving low-income households to be eligible for grants for the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. S. 1069 would do the same for owners or operators of investor owned energy facilities, under certain conditions. As explained later in this report (see \"Expanding Eligibility\" section) this issue has been debated in the past as certain utilities that provide public services have no recourse to Stafford assistance. H.R. 1239 : States could apply for grants to establish revolving loan funds to enable homeowners and businesses to undertake hazard mitigation activities. This legislation would amend the pre-disaster mitigation authority (Section 203 of the act). Experience gained under the mitigation efforts funded through a pilot program established through the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 for severe repetitive loss properties in flood plains may be applicable to congressional consideration of this proposal. S. 713 and H.R. 3437 : These two bills would modify existing disaster housing provisions. If enacted, H.R. 3437 would mandate that the FEMA Administrator develop lifecycle plans and tracking procedures for mobile housing units provided to individuals and households. Units found to be hazardous to the occupants' health would be repaired before being used for disaster-related housing needs. Similarly, but not as an amendment to the Stafford Act, S. 713 would mandate that the FEMA Administrator evaluate the existing stock of temporary housing units and plan for their disposition or storage. H.R. 3466 : The President would be authorized to consolidate funds for public infrastructure restoration for disasters involving \"extensive and widespread damage and destruction\" with no cost share required from state or local governments. S. 764 : The ceiling on the amount to be available for individual and household assistance for lower income residents in states with high costs of living would be increased to a base of $50,000, from $25,000, to be adjusted annual for inflation. H.R. 3377 : A number of changes would be made to the Stafford Act through this legislation. Funding would be authorized through FY2012 for the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program (described below in this report), the Administrator of FEMA would be required to modernize and modify the existing federal public warning and alert system, the Mortgage and Rental Assistance program would be reauthorized, temporary or intermittent employees who provide disaster assistance would be eligible for federal health benefits, the National Urban Search and Rescue Response system would be authorized, the Disaster Relief Fund would be authorized, and grants for hazard mitigation would be increased if states meet minimum building code standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enacted Legislation", "paragraphs": ["While no amendments to the Stafford Act were enacted in the 111 th Congress, two public laws should be noted for the measures they include that affect administration of the statute.

The statute does not define the term \"incident.\" According to regulations, upon receiving a gubernatorial request for such assistance, the FEMA Associate Director may determine that DOD aid is necessary to save lives and protect property.", "Second, the Stafford Act authorizes the President to provide fire management assistance in the form of grants, equipment, personnel, and supplies to supplement the resources of communities when fires on public property or on private forests or grasslands threaten destruction that might warrant a major disaster declaration. Implementation of this authority, which has been delegated to FEMA officials, requires that a gubernatorial request be submitted while an uncontrolled fire is burning. To be approved, state applications must demonstrate that either of the two cost thresholds established by FEMA through regulations has been reached. The thresholds involve calculations of the cost of an individual fire or those associated with all of the fires (declared and non-declared) in a state each calendar year. FEMA officials determine whether a fire management assistance declaration will be issued.", "Third, when a situation threatens human health and safety, and a disaster is imminent but not yet declared, the Secretary of DHS may pre-position employees and supplies. DHS monitors the status of the situation, communicates with state emergency officials on potential assistance requirements, deploys teams and resources to maximize the speed and effectiveness of the anticipated federal response and, when necessary, performs preparedness and preliminary damage assessment activities.

The factors considered to determine whether federal PA assistance is needed include an assessment of the per capita impact of the disaster within affected states; insurance coverage in force; the presence and impact of hazard mitigation measures; the cumulative impact of disasters over the previous year; and, whether federal aid authorized by statutes other than the Stafford Act would better meet the needs of stricken areas. Factors considered to determine whether federal IHP assistance is needed include concentration of damages; number of injuries, deaths, or the extent to which essential services are disrupted; the impact on special populations that require higher levels of assistance; the extent to which voluntary agencies are able to meet the needs of victims; insurance coverage; and, measurements of needs such as disaster housing needs approved, number of homes destroyed or damaged, financial assistance required, and others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emergency Declarations", "paragraphs": ["The declaration process for emergencies is similar to that used for major disasters, but the criteria (based on the definition of \"emergency\") are less specific.

For instance, under a major disaster declaration, local jurisdictions with large numbers of damaged or destroyed residences might be eligible for assistance under the Individual Assistance (IA) program, whereas those with severely damaged infrastructure but relatively few damaged homes might be eligible only for assistance under the PA program. Similarly, if a local government had extensive debris in public rights-of-way due to a disaster, but very little damage to public facilities, a determination might be made to provide assistance only for debris removal activities under the PA program.

The regulation vested final determinative authority with the majority of arbitration panel members. According to the statement accompanying the final rule, approximately 44 appeals were pending in Mississippi and Alabama (Hurricane Katrina), Texas (Hurricane Rita) and Louisiana (both hurricanes) when the agency published the regulation. Also, 2,188 projects were awaiting initial rulings and were estimated to be subject to the process. Accordingly, FEMA expected that 127 appeals would be forthcoming out of the 2,188 large projects eligible for the arbitration process The actual number of appeals submitted to arbitration, however, are far below the estimate. According to the former General Counsel for FEMA, \"More than a dozen applicants have elected arbitration ....\"", "At least three topics may be explored by Members of Congress if they elect to debate the need for a statutory change. ", "First, would an arbitration panel or other determinative party outside of FEMA be designated to participate in the appeals process, or should appeals continue to be heard and decided upon solely by FEMA administrators? It may be argued that only FEMA officials are most familiar with the details of public assistance grants, the application requirements, and comparable applications. The cost estimates, circumstances unique to that particular disaster (such as the availability of skilled contractors and material), need for modifying initial damage projections, and other factors arguably require considerable knowledge of the public assistance grant program. Others may contend that this familiarity of the process and ownership of required information complicates efforts by appellants to even determine whether they should seek arbitration or appeal a FEMA decision, and may not meet the statutory mandate that rules \"provide for the fair and impartial consideration of appeals under this section.\" For example, the quality of information available to appellants may be questioned, as summarized by the former FEMA General Counsel, \"The rules assume that an applicant has the information and documentation required to establish eligibility at the outset of the arbitration process.... In fact, FEMA frequently is the only party with information that allows applicants to understand and respond to the disallowance of cost in an appeal (or an arbitration). And FEMA's responsiveness to FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] requests is notoriously slow \u2500 generally requiring a number of months. One option that Members might consider involves enacting an amendment that would mandate that FEMA maintain and provide applicable information to the appellants within the time frame established for an applicant deciding to file an appeal. Another option would maintain the current appeals process but provide for a final determinative authority outside of FEMA, perhaps through the permanent establishment of an arbitration panel comparable to that established by the 111 th Congress, through the Federal Arbitration Association, or an arbitrator assigned to the matter through the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) Second, the arbitration panel established pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is solely authorized to consider appeals related to the Stafford Act public assistance program. As noted previously in this report, assistance is also provided to individuals and households for housing and uninsured needs, and the statute provides for appeal regulations that address decisions related to any assistance provided under the authority of Title IV. There is no provision for public review or consideration of the arbitration panel process. Congress might elect to consider whether the proceedings should remain closed. "], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
