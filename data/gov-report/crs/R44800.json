The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) administers vehicle safety laws and has issued dozens of safety standards, including regulations affecting windshield wipers, hood and door latches, tires, and airbags.", "NHTSA has estimated that between 1960 and 2012, federal motor vehicle safety standards saved more than 600,000 lives, and the risk of a fatality declined by 56%. Although dozens of technologies were made subject to federal standards in the decades after federal regulation began, a NHTSA study reported that more than half of the lives saved\u2014329,000\u2014were from use of seat belts. While the federal standard was helpful in reducing fatalities, the study found that the passage of state laws allowing police to issue tickets if a driver or passengers are not wearing seat belts caused the number of lives saved to climb from 800 per year to 6,000 per year.", "In addition to promulgating and enforcing vehicle safety standards, NHTSA investigates vehicle defects that affect safety and issues vehicle or parts recalls if safety defects are discovered. In recent years, the number of vehicle and parts recalls has risen significantly, from 16.3 million vehicles and parts in 2013 to 87.5 million in 2015. The rising number of recalls is due to stricter laws and reporting requirements, larger fines, delayed detection of vehicle problems by NHTSA, and several high-visibility cases, including General Motors' faulty ignition switch and Takata airbags.", "Recalls rarely obtain 100% completion rates, leaving many defective vehicles on the road long after a recall is initiated. A recent study by J.D. Power, a market research company, showed that between 2013 and 2015, recalls of fewer than 10,000 vehicles had a 67% completion rate, while recalls of more than a million vehicles had a completion rate of only 49%. The larger recalls are thought to result in fewer repaired vehicles because of the difficulty in finding and notifying larger numbers of owners, a lengthened repair period due to lack of an adequate supply of replacement parts, and the ability of manufacturers to use more personalized communications, such as telephone calls, in smaller recalls.", "Many emerging technologies, such as automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning, are expected to reduce vehicle injuries and deaths in the future. Over time, these separate technologies will be combined as vehicles are built with higher levels of automation. To deal with these rapid changes, NHTSA has broadened the agency's approach beyond the traditional rulemaking to include new means of interacting with manufacturers and other vehicle safety stakeholders, such as voluntary agreements to accelerate use of life-saving technologies.", "The 2015 Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act included significant vehicle safety provisions, including a new requirement that rental car fleets be covered by recalls, new methods for notifying consumers about recalls, larger penalties for violations, and a longer period for consumers to obtain remedies for defects.", "Congress remains interested in motor vehicle safety; proposed legislation calls for used vehicles to be subject to recalls, NHTSA to provide more public access to safety information, civil penalties to be increased, regional recalls to be terminated, and federal standards to be issued to secure electronic motor vehicle data from hackers."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In 1956, the year Congress authorized the Interstate Highway System, there were 37,965 fatalities on U.S. roads\u20146.05 fatalities for every 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The construction of limited-access highways spurred travel by automobile, leading to an increase in the number of fatal accidents. Congress responded with a series of laws that have helped reduce the fatality rate by 80% over the past six decades. By 2014, the United States recorded only 1.08 fatalities for every 100 million VMT, although the rate ticked up to 1.13 per 100 million VMT in 2015 ( Table 1 ), and again in the first 9 months of 2016, when fatalities rose to 1.15 per 100 million VMT.", "Development of new motor vehicle technologies, investments in building safer highways and educating motorists, and improving emergency medical services all have contributed to reduced fatality rates. Congress has played a significant role in improving highway safety by directing the federal government to impose and enforce safety standards for motor vehicles. This effort has been at times controversial, and several large recalls have raised questions about the effectiveness of federal motor vehicle regulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards", "paragraphs": ["In the early decades of the automobile, U.S. vehicles were lightly regulated by a combination of state and private-sector standards. National regulation was generally not seen as appropriate; in the early 1900s, according to two historians of auto safety, it was widely believed that \"the only useful and politically acceptable action Congress might take was to help the states and localities construct more and better roads.\" The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), a professional association founded in 1905, became the primary source of vehicle safety rules for many decades. State governments often used SAE recommendations to set their own standards for vehicle brakes, headlamps, and windshield wipers.", "At the same time, the rising number of highway deaths prompted a new interest in vehicle safety: between 1962 and 1964, Congress passed three safety bills into law, including a seat belt regulation. The new laws were only a precursor to broader federal regulation. Two publications also spurred interest in a greater federal role. Ralph Nader's 1965 book, Unsafe a t Any Speed: The Designed-in Dangers of the American Automobile , argued that cars were unnecessarily unsafe and that the auto industry should be regulated by a federal agency. Also influential was Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society , a National Academy of Sciences report that documented the impact of accidental injuries, including those by motor vehicles.", "Comprehensive vehicle safety legislation was passed in the form of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. As approved unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, the legislation had two parts:", "1. The Highway Safety Act of 1966 mandated that each state put in place a highway safety program in accordance with federal standards to improve driver performance, accident records systems, and traffic control. 2. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 directed the Secretary of Commerce (later changed to the Secretary of Transportation when that agency was established in 1967) to issue safety standards for all motor vehicles beginning in January 1967. A National Traffic Safety Agency was established to carry out the provisions of the new law; it was renamed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 1970.", "Since its establishment, NHTSA has issued dozens of safety standards, including regulations affecting windshield wipers, hood latches, tires, brakes, seat belts, and airbags. Proposing and finalizing a NHTSA safety regulation can take many years: all NHTSA regulations follow the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA), which ensures that proposed rulemaking is publicized in the Federal Register , comments are taken and considered, and agency decisions are clearly explained. Court review of standards is allowed, and revisions to federal regulations must also follow the APA. ", "NHTSA does not verify in advance that motor vehicles and parts comply with its standards. Instead, the law provides that \"[a] manufacturer or distributor of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment shall certify to the distributor or dealer at delivery that the vehicle or equipment complies with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under this chapter.... Certification of a vehicle must be shown by a label or tag permanently fixed to the vehicle....\"", "Manufacturers are responsible for testing their vehicles and are liable for recalls and penalties if they are later found not to meet NHTSA's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). After a new model goes on sale, NHTSA buys a sampling from dealers and tests the vehicles at its own facilities to determine whether they comply. If NHTSA determines there is noncompliance, it can encourage the manufacturer to recall the model to correct the problem, or it can order a recall.", "In addition to promulgating motor vehicle standards and addressing vehicle defects, NHTSA's mission also includes providing assistance to states on traffic safety issues, such as drunk driving and distracted driving, and maintaining a comprehensive database about motor vehicle crashes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Estimates of Effects of Federal Safety Standards", "paragraphs": ["A recent NHTSA study estimated that passenger vehicle safety technologies associated with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) have saved 613,501 lives between 1960 and 2012. The study evaluated the effects of 31 motor vehicle technologies mandated by NHTSA, including dual master cylinders and front disc brakes, electronic stability control, energy-absorbing steering assemblies, seat belts, door locks, airbags, and side door beams. It estimated that the risk of a fatality in 2012 was 56% lower than in 1960, based on evaluation of the effectiveness of specific technologies in reducing occupant fatalities. ", "The NHTSA report found seat belts, introduced in the late 1960s, to have been responsible for more than half of all the lives saved, 329,715, and that their effectiveness rose sharply after NHTSA required installation of combined lap and shoulder belts in place of simple lap belts in 1974. However, the study also highlighted the importance of other measures in addition to federal vehicle safety regulation: it estimated that the number of lives saved annually by seat belts rose from 800 to 6,000 after many states allowed police to issue tickets if a driver or passengers were not wearing seat belts. Every state but New Hampshire has enacted laws requiring seat belt use.", "The study notes that the full benefits of new federal safety standards may take many years to be felt. The passenger vehicle fleet turns over slowly; nearly half the cars and light trucks on the road are more than 12 years old. And standards can take many years to develop and issue. Although electronic stability control was introduced as standard equipment on one make of vehicle in 1998 and was subsequently adopted on some other makes, only 22% of light vehicles on the road were equipped with the technology in calendar year 2012. FMVSS required electronic stability control to be included in all new vehicles starting in model year 2012. The study estimates that more than 1,362 lives may be saved annually when all vehicles on the road utilize the technology, but this will not occur for a couple of decades. ", "In a separate study in 2012, NHTSA evaluated the crashworthiness and crash avoidance performance of passenger cars and light vehicles, isolating the vehicle element in traffic safety improvements from human and environmental effects. The study did not focus solely on FMVSS-regulated technologies, but also included overall vehicle design and improvements initiated by manufacturers. Unlike NHTSA's Lives Saved by Vehicle Safety Technologies and Associated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, 1960 to 2012 , this study did not address specific technology and product sources of the improvements. ", "The NHTSA report found that the likelihood of crashing in 100,000 miles of driving had decreased from 30% in a new model year 2000 vehicle to 25% in a new model year 2008 vehicle. The likelihood of escaping a crash uninjured improved from 79% to 82% in the same time period. The report contended that \"the nationwide impact of these advancements is substantial\" and that vehicle improvements between 2000 and 2008 prevented 700,000 vehicle crashes, prevented (or mitigated) injuries of 1 million occupants, and saved 2,000 lives in calendar year 2008 alone."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Trends in Vehicle Recalls", "paragraphs": ["In addition to promulgating and enforcing vehicle safety standards, NHTSA investigates vehicle defects that affect safety .

In practice, most recalls are issued by manufacturers, sometimes influenced by a NHTSA defect finding and sometimes solely by a manufacturer upon its own finding of a defect. Of the 1,039 recalls issued in 2016, 92 were issued by manufacturers influenced by a NHTSA finding , and 947 were issued based on a manufacturer's finding alone .", "The annual number of recall action s has generally risen in the past decade (except for the recession year of 2009), and the number of vehicles and items of equipment recalled has risen steeply since 2013 ( Figure 1 ) . There are several reasons for the rising number of recalls , including stricter laws, larger fines, delayed detection by NHTSA of vehicle problems , and several recent high-visibility cases affecting millions of vehicles . ", "In 2014 and 2015, two large recalls were issued: ", "General Motors (GM) recalled 2.2 million vehicles because of faulty ignition switches, which could slip out of the \"run\" position and prevent air bags from deploying in crashes . GM acknowledged that the defective switches caused 15 deaths and a number of injuries. NHTSA assessed a maximum $35 million civil penalty against GM . I n a separate settlement, the Department of Justice fined GM $900 million in criminal penalties.Nineteen manufacturers recalled a total of about 42 million vehicles due to a defect in airbags provided by Takata , a parts supplier. The defect may cause the airbags' inflators to explode . The faulty airbags are linked to 16 deaths globally. In the United States, there have been 220 cases of Takata-supplied airbag inflators exploding, with 11 deaths and 184 injuries. NHTSA fined Takata $200 million, with $70 million due in cash; an additional $130 million payment would be demanded if Takata fails to meet its commitments or if additional violations of the law are determined. Separately, the Department of Justice fined Takata $1 billion, including a $25 million criminal fine, $125 million for victim compensation, and $850 million for compensating automakers for a portion of the cost of recalling the vehicles.", "In response to the GM ignition switch recall, NHTSA evaluated its procedures, interactions, and communications with General Motors. Its publication NHTSA's Path Forward in 2015 outlined how the lessons learned from that recall could improve its defect investigation system. The then-NHTSA Administrator, Mark Rosekind, wrote in that publication that ", "it is no overstatement to say [the ignition switch recall] was one of the most significant cases in NHTSA's history, not only because of the tragic toll of deaths and injuries, or the technical challenges it presented, but because of the unprecedented steps the manufacturer took to conceal a deadly defect.", "Path Forward identified five shortcomings in the recall and NHTSA procedures that affected its handling of the GM ignition switch problem:", "1. GM withheld critical information about engineering changes that would have allowed NHTSA to more quickly identify the defect. 2. NHTSA did not hold GM accountable for providing inadequate information. 3. Neither GM nor NHTSA completely understood the application of advanced airbag technology in GM vehicles. 4. NHTSA did not consider alternate theories proposed by internal and external sources. 5. NHTSA did not identify and follow up on trends in its own data sources and investigations.", "The report proposed various process improvements, including increasing auto industry accountability, increasing NHTSA's knowledge of emerging technologies, and improving defects investigations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Why Have Recalls Increased?", "paragraphs": ["In addition to high-profile cases involving millions of vehicles, four other factors may have changed the magnitude of motor vehicle recalls. These are described below.", "Trends in M anufacturing E fficiency . Motor vehicle manufacturers are attempting to reduce the number of separate parts they use by installing a single part on multiple vehicle models, instead of designing unique parts for each model. For example, Ford is cutting its global platforms from 15 to nine. Much of the auto industry's sourcing is global, and one effect of having fewer vehicle platforms may be that a defective part is installed in a very large number of vehicles sold under several brands. The defective Takata airbags, for example, were used by nearly every automaker, leading to recalls in other countries as well as the largest recall on record in the United States. ", "Stricter F ederal R eporting R equirements and S tiffer P enalties . More thorough and earlier reporting requirements and steeper penalties are thought to have increased the number of defects reported and hence the number of recalls. In 2000, after a highly publicized recall of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles and the Firestone tires used on those vehicles, Congress passed the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act (TREAD Act). The law established an Early Warning Reporting System (EWRS) that requires vehicle manufacturers to report a wide range of information, including data on defects, injuries, and deaths related to use of their products, enabling NHTSA to investigate defects without waiting for complaints from vehicle owners. In addition, the law increased civil penalties for violations of safety standards from a maximum of $925,000 to $15 million and provided criminal penalties for misleading NHTSA about safety defects that cause death or injury. NHTSA issued final TREAD Act regulations in 2003. EWRS regulations were not followed by manufactures in some recent recalls, however, leading NHTSA to impose additional penalties.

NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is responsible for identifying and investigating potential vehicle safety issues and requiring recalls when warranted. In June 2015, the Department of Transportation Inspector General (DOT OIG) made 17 recommendations to improve NHTSA's procedures for collecting and analyzing vehicle safety data and deciding when to investigate. That report states that ", "weakness in ODI's training and supervision of pre-investigation staff and its processes for identifying potential safety concerns and initiating investigations, as evidenced by NHTSA's handling of the GM ignition switch defect, deter NHTSA from successfully meeting its mandate to help prevent crashes and their attendant costs, both human and financial.", "DOT OIG notes that \"without detailed guidance, decisions regarding key aspects of early warning reporting data are left to manufacturers' discretion\u2014resulting in inconsistent reporting and data that ODI investigative chiefs and vehicle safety advocates consider to be of little use.\"", "While the DOT OIG has found that NHTSA has made \"considerable progress\" in addressing these recommendations, it told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in November 2016 that five recommendations remain open: four that will improve early warning reporting data and an improvement in the consumer complaint quality control process.

Power and Associates, a market research company, found that of the more than 120 million vehicles recalled from 2013 through 2015, 45 million had not been repaired as of mid-2016. Big recalls have the lowest completion rates: recalls affecting fewer than 10,000 vehicles have a 67% completion rate, while recalls affecting more than a million vehicles have a completion rate of 49%.

In addition, owners of vehicles involved in smaller recalls are easier to contact through personalized communication methods, such as a phone call.", "The J.D. Power report also found that vehicle age, vehicle type, and the nature of the safety issue affected recall completion rates. Newer vehicles (model years 2013-2017) were completed at a 73% rate; older vehicles (model years 2003-2007) had a 44% completion rate. This may have reflected the difficulty of identifying the owners of vehicles that were more than six years old at the start of the period J.D. Power studied.

Former DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx and former NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind broadened the agency's approach beyond the traditional rulemaking to include new means of interacting with manufacturers and other vehicle safety stakeholders. In congressional testimony in November 2016, then-NHTSA Administrator Rosekind said the agency's regulatory process was too slow, given the pace of technological development. He explained that", "a traditional approach to regulating these new technologies would be to engage solely in rulemaking process, writing new regulations that prescribe specific standards. Our view is that approach would stymie innovation and stall the introduction of these technologies.... Any rule we might offer today would likely be woefully out-of-date by the time it took effect, given the pace of technological development.... ", "Among the steps DOT and NHTSA took in 2016 to address these issues and establish new forms of enhancing vehicle safety are the following:", "Secretary Foxx announced a voluntary agreement in January 2016 with 18 automakers to collectively analyze and share safety data, increase the number of car owners who respond to recall notices, and develop a joint approach to automotive cybersecurity. While automakers supported the agreement, former NHTSA Administrator Joan Claybrook reportedly criticized it as ineffective. In March 2016, NHTSA and the IIHS announced a commitment of 20 vehicle manufacturers to make automatic emergency braking (AEB) a standard feature on virtually all new passenger vehicles by 2022. This voluntary agreement makes AEB standard on vehicles three years earlier than had NHTSA pursued a traditional rulemaking. In those three years, IIHS estimates that 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries will be prevented. NHTSA's September 2016 Federal Automated Vehicle s Policy officially adopted SAE International's levels of automation, and provides guidance to automakers and other vehicle developers with a 15-point \"Safety Assessment\" that discusses safety areas that manufacturers should evaluate in developing highly automated vehicles.
