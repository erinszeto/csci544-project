Seismic core damage frequency is the probability of damage to the reactor core (fuel rods) resulting from a seismic initiating event. It does not necessarily imply that a core meltdown or loss of containment (associated with a radiological release) would occur. The seismic hazard at each plant site depends on the unique seismology and geology surrounding the site. Consequently, the report separately determined the implications of updated probabilistic seismic hazard for each of the 96 operating nuclear power plants in the CEUS.", "The data evaluated in the assessment suggest that the probability for earthquake ground motion above the seismic design basis for some nuclear plants in the CEUS, although still low, is larger than previous estimates. In March 2011, the NRC announced that it had identified 27 nuclear reactors operating in the CEUS (listed in Table 5 ) subject to priority earthquake safety reviews.

H.R. 3479 would also make some changes to NEHRP, and authorize appropriations through FY2014.

The USGS report recommends adding 100 new stations to existing arrays of seismometers in the CEUS: ", "38 deployed in seismically active zones in the CEUS to capture information from infrequent earthquakes for use in improving the understanding of how, where, and why earthquakes occur in the region; and 62 stations deployed near nuclear power plants to understand the site-specific response to earthquakes and improve assessments of seismic risk at the facilities.", "According to the USGS, the 38 proposed stations in seismically active zones would bolster earthquake monitoring where it is currently inadequate. The new stations would fill in where existing stations are farther than 50 kilometers apart (about 31 miles) or where existing stations could go off-scale during an earthquake of expected magnitude for the seismic zone. These stations would also help improve assessments of how well the seismic waves travel, or propagate, from the epicenter outwards, and inversely how the seismic energy is lost, or attenuated, as the earthquake waves move away from the epicenter. As people experienced first-hand, Virginia's August 2011 earthquake broadcast widespread ground shaking. For similar magnitude earthquakes, seismic waves travel more efficiently in general in the CEUS and shaking is felt over a broader area compared to the western United States.", "According to its report, the USGS proposes deploying 62 additional stations near nuclear power plants to help characterize earthquake effects for site-specific engineering and emergency-response applications. This would aid in the location and degree of ground shaking and estimation of damage to structures in near-real time. The combined 100 new stations proposed by the USGS would supplement the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) to compute earthquake properties more accurately in the region and improve the likelihood of capturing important earthquake data within 50 kilometers of the earthquake epicenter for moderate and large earthquakes. The USGS report indicates that this information would be useful to the NRC.", "The USGS report also includes cost information for the seismometers, which range from $15,000 to $20,000 to purchase and install \"Class A\" systems, and about $10,000 for \"Class B\" systems. Class A systems have higher resolution and other features superior to Class B systems. Operating costs range from $2,000 to $5,000 per year. For 100 new stations, costs to purchase and install Class A systems would range between $1.5 million and $2.0 million versus $1.0 million for 100 Class B systems. Operating costs would range between $200,000 to $500,000 per year, depending on location and options for transmitting data from the stations.", "Appendix A. Magnitude, Intensity, and Seismic Spectrum", "Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the strength of the earthquake as determined from seismographic observations. Magnitude is essentially an objective, quantitative measure of an earthquake's size expressed in various ways based on seismographic records (e.g., Richter Local Magnitude, Surface Wave Magnitude, Body Wave Magnitude, and Moment Magnitude). Currently, the most commonly used magnitude measurement is Moment Magnitude (M), which accounts for the strength of the rock that ruptured, the area of the fault that ruptured, and the average amount of slip. Moment is a physical quantity proportional to the slip on the fault times the area of the fault surface that slips. It relates to the total energy released in the earthquake. The moment can be estimated from seismograms (and from geodetic measurements). The Moment Magnitude provides an estimate of earthquake size that is valid over the complete range of magnitudes, a characteristic that was lacking in other magnitude scales, such as the Richter scale. ", "Because of the logarithmic basis of the moment magnitude scale, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude; as an estimate of energy, each whole number step in the magnitude scale corresponds to the release of about 31 times more energy than the amount associated with the preceding whole number value.", "In 1935, Charles F. Richter of the California Institute of Technology developed the Richter magnitude scale based on the behavior of a specific seismograph manufactured at that time. The instruments are no longer in use and therefore the Richter magnitude scale is no longer used in the technical community. However, the term Richter Scale is so common in use that scientists generally just answer questions about \"Richter\" magnitude by substituting moment magnitude without correcting the misunderstanding.", "The intensity of an earthquake is a qualitative assessment of effects of the earthquake at a particular location. The assigned intensity factors include observed effects on humans, on human-built structures, and on the earth's surface at a particular location. The most commonly used scale in the United States is the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which has values ranging from I to XII in the order of severity. MMI of I indicates an earthquake that was not felt except by a very few, whereas MMI of XII indicates damage to all works of construction, either partially or completely. While an earthquake has only one magnitude, intensity depends on the effects at each particular location.", "Greater magnitude earthquakes are generally associated with greater lengths of fault ruptures. A fault break of 100 miles might be associated with an M8 earthquake, while a break of several miles might generate an M6 earthquake. The length of the fault break, however, is not directly proportional to the energy released. The induced amplitude of acceleration (g) does increase with increasing magnitude (M). Various methods developed relate the magnitude of an earthquake to the amplitude of acceleration it induces, and different methods may result in significant variations in results.", "Appendix B. Early Seismic Zone Map", "In the late 1940s, structural engineers began considering the seismic-based shear forces that structures must resist. To supplement their design calculations, they referred to the Seismic Zone Map published by the Uniform Building Code (UBC, in Figure B -1 ). The UBC map divided the United States into six distinct seismic zones representing various degrees of seismic risk. The map expressed peak ground acceleration as the decimal ratio of the acceleration due to gravity (g) that applied to a Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) and an Operating Basis Earthquake (OBE). UBC defined a maximum credible earthquake as producing the greatest level of ground motion at a site. An operating basis earthquake was be defined as the greatest level of ground motion likely to occur during the economic life of a structure.", "Appendix C.
