Unlike covert action, clandestine activities do not require a presidential finding but may require notification of Congress. This definition differentiates clandestine from covert, using clandestine to signify the tactical concealment of the activity. By comparison, covert operations are \"planned and executed as to conceal the identity of or permit plausible denial by the sponsor.\"", "Since the 1970s, Congress has established and continued to refine oversight procedures in reaction to instances where it had not been given prior notice of intelligence activities\u2014particularly covert action\u2014that had significant bearing on United States national security. Congress, for example, had no foreknowledge of the CIA's orchestration of the 1953 coup that overthrew Iran's only democratically elected government, or of the U-2 surveillance flights over the Soviet Union that ended with the Soviet shoot-down of Francis Gary Powers in 1960. Eventually, media disclosures of the CIA's domestic surveillance of the anti-Vietnam War movement and awareness of the agency's covert war in Laos resulted in Congress taking action. In 1974, Congress began its investigation into the scope of past intelligence community activities that provided the basis for statutory provisions for intelligence oversight going forward.", "The 1974 Hughes-Ryan Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (\u00a732 of P.L. 93-559) provided the earliest provisions for congressional oversight of covert action. In the late 1970s, Congress established a permanent oversight framework, standing up the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI). These committees were given exclusive oversight jurisdiction of the intelligence community.", "Recent events in North Korea, Yemen, and elsewhere have underscored the important function Congress can have in influencing the scope and direction of intelligence policy that supports United States national security. However, despite Congress's work during the past decades to establish statutory provisions for conducting intelligence oversight, those efforts have not always achieved Congress's desired result.", "For example, there has been occasional confusion over whether the congressional intelligence or defense committees have jurisdiction for oversight purposes. This confusion is due in part to overlapping or mutually supporting missions of the military and intelligence agencies, particularly in the post-9/11 counterterrorism environment. Intelligence and military activities fall under different statutory authorities, but they may have similar characteristics that warrant congressional notification (e.g., a need to conceal United States sponsorship and serious risk of exposure, compromise, and loss of life)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congressional oversight of the intelligence community (IC) enables Members to gain insight into and offer advice on programs and activities that can significantly affect or influence U.S. foreign policy.

What agencies are authorized to conduct covert action and clandestine activities? What are their legal authorities for doing so? Which military terms describe activities that might seem similar but are distinct from covert action?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 1974, no statute existed that enabled Congress to conduct oversight of the intelligence community. Congress exercised what some have described as \"benign neglect\" of intelligence. In earlier instances, when it could have exercised greater oversight\u2014such as over the CIA's orchestration of the 1953 coup in Iran\u2014Congress trusted that the executive branch and intelligence community were acting in accordance with the law. Congress also did not question whether particular covert actions or other sensitive intelligence activities were viable as a means of supporting U.S. national security. ", "In the 1970s, controversy over public disclosure of CIA's covert action programs in Southeast Asia and the agency's domestic surveillance of the antiwar movement spurred Congress to become more involved in intelligence oversight. In 1974, the Hughes-Ryan amendment of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (\u00a732 of P.L. 93-559 ) provided the first statutory basis for congressional oversight and notification to Congress of covert action operations. Investigations by two congressional committees\u2014in the Senate, chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church, and in the House, chaired by Representative Otis Pike\u2014provided the first formal effort to understand the scope of intelligence activities. These committees became the model for a permanent oversight framework that could hold the intelligence community accountable for spending appropriated funds legally and supporting identifiable national security objectives. In 1975, Congress established the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). ", "Congress later refined its oversight of the intelligence community when the executive branch directed covert action operations without notifying Congress in advance. In August 1980, out of concern for maintaining operational security, President Carter chose not to inform Congress prior to the attempt to rescue American hostages held by the Iranian regime. In the mid-1980s, the Reagan Administration did not inform Congress about a covert initiative to divert funds raised from the sale of arms to Iran to support the Contras in Nicaragua. Through the Intelligence Authorization Acts (IAA) of 1981 ( P.L. 96-450 ) and 1991 ( P.L. 102-88 ), Congress revised procedures to try to ensure that the executive branch would, in the future, provide timely, comprehensive notification of all covert action and other \"significant anticipated intelligence activity.\" ", "The evolution of congressional oversight of intelligence, which emphasized the exclusive jurisdiction of the SSCI and HPSCI, vice the congressional defense committees, was, however, arguably out of alignment with the evolution of military operations and intelligence activities in the field. In the field, the military and intelligence communities increasingly integrated their activities for greater effect in the post-9/11 environment. A reportable intelligence activity, therefore, was often of interest to the congressional defense as well as intelligence committees. Yet, in Congress, the intelligence and defense committees have different notification standards and processes. The statutory authority for a particular intelligence or defense activity has determined the jurisdiction thereof: Title 50 of the U.S. Code provides the statutory authority for intelligence activities, regardless of which agency carries them out; Title 10 of the U.S. Code provides the statutory authority for military activities. Notification of Congress, therefore, has had the potential for artificially defining intelligence activities as separate and distinct from military activities. As a result, congressional committees may be unevenly informed about both kinds of activities, some of which may be indistinguishable regarding the respective risks they pose in terms of compromise, loss of life, and impact on U.S. national security.

", "Covert action is generally intended to influence conditions short of an escalation by the United States that might lead to a sizable or extended military commitment. Unlike traditional intelligence collection, covert action is not passive. It has a visible, public impact intended to influence a change in the military, economic, or political environment abroad that might otherwise prove counterproductive if the role of the United States were made known. ", "Covert action also requires a finding by the President, providing written notification to Congress that the impending activity supports \"identifiable foreign policy objectives.\" Covert action cannot be directed at influencing the domestic environment: \"No covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence United States political processes, public opinion, policies, or media.\" While covert action is historically most closely associated with the CIA, the President may authorize other \"departments, agencies or entities of the United States Government,\" such as DOD, to conduct covert action.

By comparison, covert activities can be characterized as the strategic concealment of the United States' sponsorship of activities that aim to effect change in the political, economic, military, or diplomatic behavior of an overseas target.

In categorizing its clandestine activities, DOD frequently labels them as [OPE] to distinguish particular operations as traditional military activities and not as intelligence functions. The Committee observes, though, that overuse of this term has made the distinction all but meaningless. The determination as to whether an operation will be categorized as an intelligence activity is made on a case-by-case basis; there are no clear guidelines or principles for making consistent determinations. The Director of National Intelligence himself has acknowledged that there is no bright line between traditional intelligence missions carried out by the military and the operations of the CIA.", "Clandestine military intelligence-gathering operations, even those legitimately recognized as OPE, carry the same diplomatic and national security risks as traditional intelligence-gathering activities. While the purpose of many such operations is to gather intelligence, DOD has shown a propensity to apply the OPE label where the slightest nexus of a theoretical, distant military operation might one day exist. Consequently, these activities often escape the scrutiny of the intelligence committees, and the congressional defense committees cannot be expected to exercise oversight outside of their jurisdiction.", "In a section titled \"Jurisdictional Statement on Defense Intelligence\" under the \"Committee Priorities\" segment of its report ( H.Rept. 114-573 ) accompanying the Intelligence Authorization Act of 2017 ( H.R. 5077 ), the HPSCI reiterated that it is", "concerned that many intelligence and intelligence-related activities continue to be characterized as 'battlespace awareness,' 'situational awareness,' and \u2013 especially \u2013 [OPE]....

Therefore, the Committee directs [DOD] to ensure that the Committee receives proper insight and access to information regarding all intelligence and intelligence-related activities of [DOD], including those presently funded outside the MIP.
