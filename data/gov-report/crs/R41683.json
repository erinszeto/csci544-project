Supply disruptions and fears about the possible spread of unrest to major exporters have pushed prices higher. Even if the crisis abates, some risk premium may persist to the degree that market participants fear such an event could occur again.", "Higher oil prices can negatively impact the economies of oil importing countries. The cost of oil is the primary determinant of gasoline prices and prices of other petroleum products; increased costs can be a burden on households and many businesses. Rising import costs for oil, natural gas and petroleum-based products can be a drag on economic growth by negatively affecting the trade balance. This may slow the current economic recovery, though it is not expected to derail it.", "Many energy policy options to address vulnerability to disruptions and higher prices, such as what is taking place in MENA, are long-term in nature. It takes a long time for the energy sector to make material shifts, be they through renewables, efficiency, or increased domestic oil and gas production. Short-term energy policy options (as opposed to the broader national security and diplomatic issues) are limited. Oil exporters with spare production capacity, particularly Saudi Arabia, may make short-term decisions to try to moderate prices by adjusting production levels, but their ability and willingness to do so are often based on internal decisions. For more information on the political unrest in MENA, see the CRS Issue in Focus page on the Middle East and its associated reports.", "Part of the U.S. energy policy debate around recent unrest has focused on whether it is appropriate to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The government holds the SPR to mitigate the impacts of a \"severe energy supply interruption.\" Proponents of using the SPR point out that there is a disruption to oil production in Libya and the resulting price increase negatively impacts the U.S. economic recovery. Critics question whether this is the appropriate time to release oil from the SPR or whether it should be saved to guard against larger future disruptions, and emphasize that the SPR has not traditionally been viewed as a device to manipulate prices."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Recent unrest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has affected international energy markets and put upward pressure on oil prices.

Current unrest there has shut down some energy production and raised uncertainties about future supply from the region. Some regional producers are seeking to reassure global energy markets, amid fears that unrest could spread to major producers or disrupt regional commerce. Oil is traded globally and oil prices are set in a globally integrated market under relatively short-term contracts. Consequently, what happens in any one part of the market\u2014especially as significant a component as MENA\u2014can affect the price of oil everywhere regardless of where the oil is produced or consumed. Natural gas markets have also been affected, but natural gas is not traded as widely as oil. Outside of North America and the United Kingdom, natural gas is traded mostly under long-term contract, and international market pricing is not as flexible as oil pricing.

Oil prices had already been increasing throughout the fourth quarter of 2010\u2014due largely to the global economic recovery and the resulting increase in oil demand\u2014but threats to oil supply from, and oil transportation through, MENA pushed them up further than might otherwise have been the case. The unrest has contributed to higher prices by causing some supply reductions and giving rise to worries that unrest may spread to the region's larger energy producers.", "The MENA region includes some of the world's largest oil exporting countries and most important shipping chokepoints. The region produces 29.1 million barrels per day (Mb/d), a third of global oil supply, and its oil exports equal roughly 40% of the world's oil trade (see Table 1 ). Unrest in Egypt in January and February raised concerns of disruptions to oil and natural gas moving between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, highlighting transit risks. Turmoil in Libya, a much bigger oil exporter than Egypt, and unrest in the Persian Gulf state of Bahrain increased concern in oil markets. As of March 2, 2011, estimates for how much oil production has been shut down in Libya varied, ranging from 0.8 Mb/d to 1.2 Mb/d. (For context, Libya produced 1.8 Mb/d last year, and the global oil market is roughly 86 Mb/d.) Several U.S. companies are invested in Libya's energy production, including ConocoPhillips, Hess, and Occidental Petroleum; they are minority partners in their joint ventures with the Libyan National Oil Company.", "Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have publicly offered to make up any shortfall from the Libyan disruption by using their spare oil production capacity, and industry data show that Saudi Arabia has increased production by about 400,000 barrels per day. But some of the additional Saudi volumes may be of lower quality (heavier and higher in sulfur content) than the Libyan crudes, making them an imperfect substitute for certain refiners. European refineries not equipped to process the lower quality crudes may have to source cargoes from places like Nigeria and Azerbaijan, which have crude closer in quality to the lost Libyan supplies. Other refineries around the world, particularly some of the new refineries in Asia, may be better able to absorb the additional heavy, higher sulfur crude from Saudi Arabia, but at least in the short run there may be a dislocation that may raise prices, particularly for light, low sulfur crude, as global supply is redistributed. The transition may have some leeway as a number of European refiners are undergoing prescheduled maintenance in March, though the situation may tighten as they come back into operation in April. ", "Of greater concern to oil markets is the risk that unrest may spread to other, larger producing countries in the region. Of particular concern would be if unrest spreads to Saudi Arabia. It is the world's second-largest producer behind Russia. In addition to its current output, as of the end of 2010, Saudi Arabia also held about 80% of the world's spare oil production capacity \u2014capacity that is now being used to offset supply disruptions elsewhere. If significant geopolitical unrest emerges in Saudi Arabia, market concern may drive prices considerably higher. If any such unrest somehow disrupts Saudi oil production, it is difficult to predict how high oil prices may rise. The security of the Strait of Hormuz, between Iran and Oman, is also of great concern. A third of the world's oil trade passes through the Strait of Hormuz, and any closing or confining of transit could also substantially raise oil prices.

More than 2.0 Mb/d came from three countries: Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Iraq. Imports from Libya were less than 0.1 Mb/d; most of Libya's oil and other petroleum product shipments go to Europe. Because the oil market is globally integrated, the disruption of Libyan exports to Europe has affected the price of oil worldwide, including all U.S. imports and domestic production. ", "Economically, higher oil prices have a negative impact on household budgets and national economic growth for countries that are major importers. According to recent testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, while rising oil prices increase inflation and take income out of the pockets of consumers, reducing consumer spending and confidence, the recent increase does not yet appear to be a significant risk for the recovery or inflation. Some analysts estimate that a sustained $10 increase in the oil price can reduce U.S. economic growth by roughly two-tenths of a percentage point. However, this may not account for potential secondary effects such as through consumer confidence or other areas. The benchmark U.S. oil price on March 8, 2011, was $105 per barrel, versus an average of $80 per barrel in 2010. ", "Even under a scenario in which the United States produced as much oil as it consumes, international events would still affect U.S. oil prices as long as international trade were permitted. The drag on economic growth via the trade deficit would be muted in such a scenario. Households and businesses could still face higher (or lower) costs due to international events, but wealth would be redistributed domestically from energy consumers to producers to a greater degree than it is today."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Natural Gas More Insulated from MENA Turmoil", "paragraphs": ["There is much less risk to the United States from MENA-related disruptions of natural gas supply. The United States imports about 16% of the natural gas it consumes, nearly all via pipeline from Canada. In 2009, MENA liquefied natural gas (LNG) accounted for less than 1% of U.S. consumption. Since the beginning of the unrest, U.S. natural gas prices have actually declined. (See Figure 3 .)", "The global natural gas market is much more regionally segmented than the oil market, and events in one part of the world do not necessarily affect prices everywhere. Only about 30% of natural gas is traded internationally, versus 60% for oil. Most natural gas exports from MENA go to Europe or Asia, where supplies are mostly sold under long-term contracts, insulating consumers in the short term from any price fluctuations caused by unrest. Figure 3 highlights the minimal influence the unrest has had on natural gas markets. Some companies have had to scramble for LNG cargoes to limit their risk of a natural gas supply disruption, but there is ample spare capacity to meet this demand. The northern hemisphere winter is the main consumption season for natural gas, used primarily for heating, and prices will mostly be affected by changes in temperature.", "Europe is the region most vulnerable to a natural gas shutdown in MENA, particularly from North African countries. The complete cut off by Libya of its natural gas exports, which almost exclusively go to Italy, has contributed to a 12% increase in European spot prices since major protests began. Russia has increased its pipeline exports to Italy to compensate for the shortfall. However, since a market vendor in Tunisia lit himself on fire in December, European prices are down almost 7%. If supply from Algeria\u2014Europe's third-largest supplier of natural gas behind Russia and Norway\u2014were for some reason reduced or cut off, Europe would be hard-pressed to replace this gas. (See the Algeria synopsis in the Appendix for additional information.) Europe's network of natural gas pipelines is designed to move natural gas from east to west, and requires more interconnections to move supplies throughout the region. In contrast, Asian prices have remained almost flat since the unrest started in Libya."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Considerations: Risks May Persist", "paragraphs": ["Oil and natural gas exporting countries in MENA rely heavily on revenues from energy exports to fund government budgets and fuel their economies. And MENA exports will make up a substantial component of world oil and gas trade for the foreseeable future. MENA countries hold approximately 61% of oil reserves and 45% of natural gas reserves. Changes in government policies that affect the development of these resources will have a long-term impact on global markets. MENA is home to 8 of the 12 countries in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and 5 of the 11 members of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF).", "If unrest persists in MENA countries, the long-term effects may be incorporated into oil and natural gas market expectations. Energy markets may evaluate the risk associated with exports from MENA differently in the future. The outbreak and persistence of unrest across the region has highlighted geopolitical risks that may not have been fully recognized before the crisis. Even after the current outbreak of unrest subsides, concerns that it could re-emerge may mean that some part of the current risk premium may persist. ", "Countries that undergo regime change may re-evaluate national energy development, production, and export policies. In the short term, regime change is likely to support relatively higher prices by creating uncertainty. Long-run risks from regime change and energy policy re-evaluation from energy exporting countries can vary on a case-by-case basis. Risks from regime change in countries such as Libya or Iran, historically sources of instability to the oil market, may be different than regime change in Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, market observers may judge that the revenue requirements of many regional producers create strong incentives for energy policy continuity in producing states, regardless of the makeup of their governments.", "Even absent regime change, the current crisis may foster changes in MENA energy policy. Some governments have already increased public expenditures in apparent hope that it may dampen unrest, and these expenditures may increase revenue needs over the long term. Increasing energy consumption in some exporting countries also creates complex choices for government and industry. Should increases in government expenditures be sustained, these countries may require greater revenues from oil and natural gas exports. Whether they attempt to do this through higher export volumes than would otherwise be the case (which may contribute to lower prices), or coordinating lower exports than would otherwise be the case to raise prices, is unclear.

The oil market is global; no one country controls it, though the policies of larger producer and consumer nations can have more influence than others. Policy measures aimed at reducing the price of oil or U.S. import dependence tend to focus on increasing oil supply (or the supply of oil alternatives) and reducing demand. But the energy industry has long lead times and is capital intensive, so it takes long periods of time to implement most supply and demand measures. As a result, there are limited short-term policy options, which Congress recognized in its justification for establishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR created a short-term policy tool that reduces the vulnerability of the United States to the consequences of a severe energy supply interruption. However, debates have continued concerning the appropriateness of using the SPR and what qualifies as \"severe.\"", "Much of the discussion around energy policy responses to MENA unrest is focused on oil. U.S. natural gas consumption, as mentioned above, is mainly supplied by domestic resources with some imports largely from Canada. As natural gas is currently not a substitute for oil, particularly in the transportation sector, policies to increase production will have minimal if any effect on U.S. oil consumption. There are proposals to encourage more natural gas use in the transportation sector, but these proposals are long-term in nature. The United States uses very little oil in electricity generation, making the effect of fuel switching to natural gas in that sector minimal. Globally, some U.S. companies have applied for permits to export natural gas, but the limited LNG additions would unlikely change the overall global natural gas picture.

Further, some of the light, sweet barrels available in the SPR are a closer match to shut-in Libyan crude (or the Nigerian, Azeri, etc., crude that may substitute for it) than some of the heavier and/or higher sulfur crude that may come out of Saudi Arabia. An SPR release can be coordinated with other members of the International Energy Agency, which also hold strategic reserves. However, using the SPR at any given point may leave less oil in storage to deal with subsequent disruptions. ", "The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 ( P.L. 94-163 , EPCA), establishing the SPR, authorizes a drawdown upon a finding by the President that there is a \"severe energy supply interruption\"\u2014an energy supply shortage that is likely to be of significant scope and duration and may cause major adverse impact on national safety or the national economy which results from an interruption in the supply of imported or domestic petroleum. What qualifies as a severe interruption is a matter of debate (see below). EPCA also includes provisions for test sales and exchanges of crude in the SPR.

One of the 62 caverns that hold the reserve, one at the Choctaw Bayou SPR site in Louisiana that had originally been assessed as able to hold 7.5 million barrels, has leached toward the edge of the salt dome it sits under and may now only be able to safely hold 3.2 million barrels. The excess oil is being moved to other locations, but the DOE is concerned about overfilling these other locations and has proposed selling the excess crude rather than risk losing it through leaks. The sale will reduce the crude oil stocks to 74 days of imports. ", "Congressional views on the use of the SPR vary. Some have supported the sale of 6 million barrels for operational reasons, citing fiscal and environmental concerns about losing the oil. Others have asked the Administration to stand ready to draw down the SPR if the situation in MENA deteriorates any further, posing greater risk to oil supply. And still others are calling for an immediate SPR release to bring down prices. Critics of tapping the reserve have questioned the Administration's motive in selling crude for operational reasons, and suggested that the SPR should be preserved for more severe disruptions, resisting calls that it be used to affect prices.

When prices were rising rapidly in 2008, Congress considered but did not pass a temporary \"gas tax holiday.\" The proposal, S. 2890 in the 110 th Congress, would have amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce the 18.4\u00a2 per gallon federal gas tax and 24.4\u00a2 diesel tax to zero during the summer driving season.

Some Members of Congress and others cite the current unrest in MENA and the resulting increase in oil costs in backing proposals ranging from increasing support for domestic oil and gas production, and renewable energy, or mandating greater efficiency. Such proposals may contribute to lower import dependence but only over time, as they take months or years to make material impacts on liquid fuels supply and demand.
