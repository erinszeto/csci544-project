Beginning in 2014, or sooner at state option, the law requires states to expand Medicaid to certain individuals who are under age 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). This reform not only expands eligibility to a group that is not currently eligible for Medicaid (low income childless adults), but also raises Medicaid's mandatory income eligibility level for certain existing groups to 133% of the FPL. This represents the single largest eligibility expansion since the start of the program in 1965. The law also modifies income counting rules when determining Medicaid eligibility for certain populations. From 2014 to 2016, the federal government will cover 100% of the Medicaid costs of these \"newly eligible\" individuals, with the percentage dropping to 90% by 2020. States cover the percentage not paid by the federal government. Maintenance of effort provisions. The law requires states to maintain current Medicaid and CHIP eligibility levels through 2013 (or when the Secretary determines that the state exchange is fully operational) for adults and 2019 for children. Outreach and enrollment provisions. The law includes provisions to encourage states to improve outreach, streamline enrollment, and coordinate with the proposed American Health Benefit Exchanges (exchanges). Benefit reforms. The law adds new mandatory and optional benefits to Medicaid. Such mandatory benefits include coverage of free-standing birth clinics, and tobacco cessation services for pregnant woman. The law also authorizes states to offer new optional benefits such as preventive services for adults and health homes for persons with chronic conditions. Additional options for states to expand home and community-based services as an alternative to institutional care are also included. Payment and financing reforms. Some of the law's reforms affecting payments and financing include (1) increases in federal matching payments for the \"newly eligible\" individuals in the eligibility expansions up to 133% FPL, (2) reductions in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotments, (3) expenditure reductions for prescription drugs including revising the definition of the average manufacture's price (AMP) to help make AMP more closely reflect prices retail community pharmacies pay for prescription drugs, (4) reductions in inappropriate hospital expenditures for health care-acquired conditions, and (5) increases in primary care physician payment rates for selected services. Increased funding for the territories. The law permits the territories to establish exchanges and provides federal funds for premium and cost-sharing assistance for individuals who obtain health insurance coverage through an exchange. Territories that do not opt to establish an exchange will receive their share of the appropriations earmarked for the state exchanges in addition to an increase in their Medicaid spending caps also established under the law. The law also increases the Medicaid FMAP rate available to all of the territories from 50% to 55% beginning with the fourth quarter of FY2011. Program integrity reforms. The law creates enforcement and monitoring tools and imposes new data reporting and oversight requirements on states and providers. States will also be required to implement initiatives used by the Medicare program, such as a national correct coding initiative and a recovery audit contract program for their Medicaid programs. The law provides additional program integrity funding through indexing of the Medicaid Integrity Program for fiscal years beginning with FY2010. Nursing home accountability. The law adds a number of requirements to improve the transparency of information within facilities and chains, and provides long-term care (LTC) consumers with information on the quality and performance of nursing homes. Demonstrations, pilot programs, and grants. The law provides the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) and state Medicaid and CHIP programs with opportunities to test models for improving the delivery, quality, and cost of services. CHIP-related provisions. The law requires states to maintain the current CHIP structure through FY2019, but does not provide federal CHIP appropriations beyond FY2015, at which point, if future appropriations are insufficient, CHIP children will obtain comparable coverage through the exchanges or Medicaid, as applicable. If new funding is made available, states will receive higher federal matching rates for CHIP services beginning in FY2016. Upon enactment, states are required to maintain CHIP eligibility levels through FY2019 as a condition of receiving federal matching funds for Medicaid expenditures (notwithstanding the lack of corresponding federal CHIP appropriations for FY2016 through FY2019). Miscellaneous Medicaid and CHIP reforms. The law adds several offices within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to better coordinate care across the Medicare and Medicaid/CHIP programs. One of these offices will be dedicated to improving coordination for beneficiaries eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles). Another will add a Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Center to develop and test new payment and service delivery models to reduce Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP expenditures, while preserving and enhancing quality of care for beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program operated by states within broad federal guidelines.

", "Of the approximately 50 different eligibility \"pathways\" into Medicaid, including those that existed even before the health reform law was enacted, some are mandatory while others are offered at state option. Examples of groups that states must provide Medicaid to include pregnant women and children below specified income levels and poor individuals with disabilities or poor individuals over age 64 who qualify for cash assistance under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. Examples of groups that states may choose to cover under Medicaid include pregnant women and infants with family income between 133% FPL and 185% FPL, and \"medically needy\" individuals who meet categorical requirements with income up to 133% of the maximum payment amount applicable under states' former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs based on family size. Under prior law, \"childless adults\" (nonelderly adults who are not disabled, not pregnant and not parents of dependent children) were generally not eligible for Medicaid, regardless of their income.", "The health reform law makes several changes to Medicaid eligibility. ACA adds two new mandatory eligibility groups, and several new optional eligibility groups. In addition, it makes several modifications to existing eligibility groups, changes the way income is counted for certain groups to determine if an individual meets Medicaid's income eligibility requirements, and adds provisions to facilitate outreach and enrollment in Medicaid, CHIP, and the Health Insurance exchanges. In their March 20, 2010, final cost estimate for ACA and HCERA, CBO and JCT estimated that coverage expansion provisions in the health reform law would result in a Medicaid enrollment increase over the baseline of approximately 16 million by FY2019.

For such individuals, the provision establishes 133% of FPL based on modified adjusted gross income (or MAGI as described below) as the new mandatory minimum Medicaid income eligibility level. The law also specifies that an income disregard in the amount of 5% FPL will be deducted from an individual's income when determining Medicaid eligibility based on MAGI, thus the effective upper income eligibility threshold for such individuals in this new eligibility group will be 138% FPL. Additional federal financial assistance will be paid to all states to share in the cost of care provided to those in the new eligibility group who meet the definition of \"newly eligible.\" (These financing arrangements are described in more detail under the financing section of this report.)", "As a conforming measure, the provision also changes the mandatory Medicaid income eligibility level for poverty-related children ages 6 to 19 from 100% FPL to 133% FPL (as applied under prior law to children under age 6). MAGI income counting rules and the 5% income disregard will apply to all poverty-related children (except those determined eligible through an Express Lane eligibility determination as permitted under the State Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act, CHIPRA, P.L. 111-3 ). Thus, in 2014, most nonelderly citizens up to 138% FPL (i.e., 133% FPL with the 5% FPL income disregard) will be eligible for Medicaid.", "During the transitional period between April 1, 2010, and January 1, 2014, states will have the option to expand Medicaid to individuals eligible under the new eligibility group up to 133% FPL as long as the state does not extend coverage to (1) individuals with higher income before those with lower income or (2) parents unless their children are enrolled in the state plan, a waiver, or in other health coverage. Prior to 2014, states are not required to use the MAGI income counting rules when determining income eligibility for the new eligibility group up to 133% FPL. States that pick up this option may apply a different income counting methodology (e.g., SSI's income counting rules) as long as it is approved by the Secretary. Finally, during the optional phase-in period no additional federal financial assistance will be available for the cost of care associated with these individuals. ", "The provision also allows states to make a \"presumptive eligibility\" determination for individuals eligible for the new eligibility group or for individuals eligible for family coverage under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act (SSA), if the state already allows for presumptive eligibility determinations for children or pregnant women subject to guidance established by the Secretary. That is, states may enroll such individuals for a limited period of time, before completed Medicaid applications are filed and processed, based on a preliminary determination by Medicaid providers of likely Medicaid eligibility.

Consequently, these standards vary across states, and different standards apply to different population groups within states. ", "Under ACA, asset tests and certain income disregards (e.g., type of expenses such as child care costs or block of income disregards where a specified portion of family income is not counted) will no longer be used to assess the financial eligibility of (1) individuals eligible under the new eligibility group up to 133% FPL, (2) other nonelderly populations eligible under prior law (subject to certain exceptions as specified below in the subsection titled \" Financial Eligibility Requirements for Certain Populations Eligible Under Prior\u00a0Law \"), and (3) certain Medicaid or CHIP-eligible children.

Although ACA prohibits any continued use of income disregards under Medicaid once the new income definitions are in place, HCERA (Section 1004(e)) requires states determining individuals' Medicaid eligibility under MAGI to reduce their countable income by a certain amount. That amount will be 5% of the upper income limit for that Medicaid eligibility pathway. MAGI will also be used to determine applicable premium and cost sharing amounts under the state plan or waiver.

The priority is to be given to integration of Medicare and Medicaid claims and payment data. Other program data, including CHIP, will be integrated as appropriate. Access to Data. Inspectors General have substantial independence and power to carry out their mandate to combat waste, fraud, and abuse, including relatively unlimited authority to access all records and information of an agency. This provision in ACA grants the HHS/OIG and the DOJ explicit access to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment and claims data (including Medicare Part D data) to conduct law enforcement and oversight activities.

In addition, beneficiaries are required to return overpayments within 60 days of receipt of those payments or be subject to enforcement action. National Provider Identifier (NPI). Health care providers often have multiple provider numbers, one number for billing each private insurance plan or public health care program.

The Secretary is permitted to withhold federal matching payments for services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries if states do not report encounter data to MSIS (as determined by the Secretary) for those beneficiaries in timely manner (as determined by the Secretary). Permissive Exclusions. HHS/OIG has the authority to exclude health care providers from federal health care program participation. Exclusions are mandatory in some circumstances, and permissive in others (i.e., HHS/OIG has discretion in whether to exclude an entity or individual). This provision subjects individuals or entities that make false statements or misrepresentations on applications to enroll or participate in federal health care programs to the OIG's permissive exclusion authority. The provision explicitly applies to Medicare Advantage plans, Prescription Drug Plans, and MMCOs as well as these entities' participating providers and suppliers. Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs). Previous law authorized the imposition of CMPs on individuals, organizations, agencies, or other entities that engage in improper conduct under federal health care programs. ACA provides for CMPs of up to $10,000 for each false claim submitted, $15,000 or $50,000 under other circumstances, and an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed. ACA also adds additional actions that are subject to CMPs. Among other changes, the following individuals are subject to CMPs: those who have been excluded from a federal health care program, but who order or prescribe an item or service; those who make false statements on enrollment applications, bids, or contracts; and those who know of an overpayment and do not return the overpayment. Testimonial Subpoena Authority. Under ACA, the Secretary has authority to issue subpoenas and require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any other evidence that relates to matters under investigation or in question by the Secretary. The Secretary also can delegate this authority to the HHS/OIG and the CMS administrator for program exclusion investigations. Increased Medicare and Medicaid Integrity Program Funding.

First, the original focus on children will be expanded to include all Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, MACPAC's review and assessment of payment policies under Medicaid and CHIP will be expanded to include, for example, how factors affecting expenditures and payment methodologies enable beneficiaries to obtain services, affect provider supply, and affect providers that serve a disproportionate share of low-income and other vulnerable populations. Additional topics that MACPAC will be required to review and assess include policies related to eligibility, enrollment and retention, benefits and coverage, quality of care, and interactions between Medicaid and Medicare and how those interactions affect access to services, payments and dual eligibles.

These programs, which may be operated by Indian Tribes (ITs) or Tribal Organization (TOs), are eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, state programs, and third parties such as private insurance. Facilities are permitted to retain these reimbursements and use them to increase available services. Prior to ACA, IHS, an IT, or a TO was only considered the payor of last resort for contract health services\u2014services that these facilities purchase through contract, with providers in instances where the facility or program cannot provide the needed care. ACA designates programs operated by IHS, an IT, TO, or an urban Indian organization (UIO) as the payer of last resort for services provided to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives, including services covered by Medicaid and CHIP. IHS funds are limited and tribal members have raised concerns about which program is considered the payor of last resort.

American Indians and Alaska Natives face a number of barriers to enrolling in Medicaid and CHIP. GAO found that some tribes have the ability to determine Medicaid eligibility for some of their tribal members, which can facilitate Medicaid enrollment. ACA permits IHS, ITs, TOs, and UIOs to serve as \"Express Lane\" agencies; this may increase Medicaid and CHIP enrollment among American Indians and Alaska Natives. ", "American Indians and Alaska Natives receiving services through IHS programs or at IHS facilities may not be charged premiums, cost-sharing or similar charges in Medicaid. ACA also prohibits cost-sharing for American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in a qualified health plan offered through the newly established exchanges. American Indians and Alaska Natives are not charged for services provided by IHS, an IT, or a TO. Given this, there may be few incentives to enroll in a private health insurance plan that charges premiums or copayments.
