This report also examines some of the steps that these institutions might voluntarily take, which, in the view of the FRB and FDIC, would improve their resolvability, including strategic divestiture; legal reorganization; amendment of default trigger provisions of qualified financial contracts; and increasing their long-term, unsecured debt as a proportion of their assets.", "In addition to voluntary measures, there are bills in the 113th Congress that would change how financial institutions are regulated to promote the financial stability of the United States.

In fact, the first two titles of the DFA are devoted specifically to that policy objective. ", "Title I establishes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)\u2014a council of financial regulators authorized \"to identify risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected [financial institutions]\" and generally \"to respond to emerging threats to the stability of the United States financial system.\" Title I also establishes a heightened regulatory regime for domestic bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, certain foreign banks and foreign bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, and certain nonbank financial institutions that are designated by a two-thirds vote of the FSOC as potentially systemically significant. These \"covered financial institutions\" are subject to, among other things, heightened capital requirements and more restrictive leverage ratios than their smaller, less complex peers. ", "Additionally, a pillar of this heightened regulatory regime is that each covered financial institution must submit \"credible\" plans to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) detailing how the firm could be quickly resolved in an orderly fashion under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other applicable insolvency regime \"in the event of a material financial distress or failure.\" These resolution plans are commonly referred to as \"living wills.\" If a covered financial institution fails to submit a \"credible\" resolution plan in the discretionary view of both the FRB and FDIC, then the company could be subject to enforcement actions, including the compelled divestiture of certain business lines and assets, as a means to foster its resolvability. The DFA does not explicitly define what it means to be \"credible,\" thus providing the FRB and FDIC considerable discretion to implement the living wills regime.", "Relatedly, Title II of the DFA establishes a special insolvency regime that could be used if it were determined that the failure or financial distress of a bank or nonbank financial institution poses a systemic threat to the U.S. financial system in spite of the heightened regulatory regime established by DFA, Title I, and related financial laws and regulations. The Title II insolvency regime, called Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), would be administered by the FDIC. Under OLA, the FDIC generally would have to liquidate the failed firm within five years, and, although public funds could be used initially, the cost of the resolution ultimately is intended to be paid for through the assets of the failed company or, if necessary, post-hoc assessments on surviving covered financial institutions. ", "A financial firm generally can only be subject to OLA if: ", "two-third of the FRB and either two-thirds of the Board of Directors of the FDIC, two-thirds of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Director of the Federal Insurance Office vote to recommend the appointment to OLA based on a series of statutory standards, including an evaluation of the impact that the company's failure would have on financial stability; and the Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is \"in default or in danger of default,\" that \"the failure of the financial company and its resolution under otherwise applicable Federal or State law would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States,\" and \" no viable private sector alternative is available .... \" ", "In other words, OLA is statutorily structured as a fallback alternative to the normally applicable insolvency regimes, such as the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and is to be triggered only under extraordinary circumstances. ", "The living wills regime theoretically could play a crucial role in avoiding the need to employ OLA or some other extraordinary governmental action. This living wills regime requires large, complex, or otherwise systemically significant financial firms, in coordination with federal regulators, to design detailed roadmaps for utilizing\u2014and to modify corporate, contractual, and other legal structures to make it easier to utilize\u2014normal resolution regimes if these firms become insolvent or in danger of default.", "Covered financial institutions' initial living wills were required to be submitted in several waves, beginning in July 2012. Over 130 institutions have filed at least one resolution plan with regulators. Each of the 11 largest financial firms in the United States, which each hold more than $250 billion in nonbank assets, has filed at least two resolution plans. Table 1 sheds some light on the size, make-up, and complexity of these 11 financial institutions. As is discussed in greater detail below, all 11 of these companies' plans, in spite of the fact that some of them span tens of thousands of pages, have fallen short of the minimum requirements of DFA Section 165(d) in the view of the FRB and FDIC. These 11 firms' next living wills are due July 2015. If any of these plans is determined to be insufficient, then the FRB and FDIC have expressed their intent \"to use their [enforcement] authority under section 165(d),\" which eventually could include the power to require an institution \"to divest certain assets or operations ... to facilitate an orderly resolution.... \"", "This report reviews the legal structure of the DFA's living will requirements, pursuant to both DFA Section 165(d) and the regulations and guidance issued jointly by the FRB and FDIC; explains the August 2014 joint announcement of the FRB and FDIC regarding the inadequacies of the 2013 living wills filed by the 11 largest, most complex financial institutions in the country; analyzes the steps that the FRB and FDIC have suggested that these companies could take to rectify the common shortcomings in resolution plans filed thus far; and discusses the enforcement tools the FRB and FDIC may utilize against firms that fail to submit \"credible\" resolution plans.", "This report focuses on the legal aspects of the DFA living wills regime and how the FRB and FDIC are administering the regime. Policy issues, although raised at times, generally are outside its scope. In particular, this report takes no stance on whether or not the living wills regime, specifically, or DFA, Titles I and II, generally, actually promote financial stability, or whether the steps that the FRB and FDIC have recommended that covered financial institutions take to improve their resolvability would in fact do so. ", "It also should be noted that this report concentrates on the FRB's and FDIC's interpretation and implementation of the living wills regime because these two regulators are empowered to implement DFA Section 165(d) by law, as it currently exists. Congress, of course, has broad discretion to pass legislation modifying the existing regime. In fact, there are bills in the 113 th Congress that would change how financial institutions are regulated to promote the financial stability of the United States. For example, H.R. 46 and S. 20 , the Financial Takeover Repeal Act of 2013, would repeal the DFA in its entirety, including the provisions designed to promote financial stability in Titles I and II. On December 2, 2014, the House of Representatives approved H.R. 5421 , the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2014, which would amend the Bankruptcy Code \"in order to facilitate the resolution of an insolvent financial institution in bankruptcy.\" H.R. 5421 appears to be intended to eliminate the need for OLA. A similar bill, S. 1861 , the Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act, would make changes to the Bankruptcy Code to facilitate the resolution of financial institutions, while also explicitly repealing DFA Title II. ", "H.R. 1450 / S. 685 , the Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act, would require the Secretary of the Treasury to identify all financial institutions it considers to be \"too big to fail,\" and within one year of such designation, \"break up [these] entities ... so that their failure would no longer cause a catastrophic effect on the United States or global economy without taxpayer bailout.\" And as a final example, H.R. 613 , the Systemic Risk Mitigation Act, would among other things, require every bank holding company with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets to hold long-term, subordinated debt of the value of at least 15% of its total consolidated assets. As is discussed more fully below, increasing long-term, unsecured debt arguably could help promote the long-term viability of the firm and, if the firm actually fails, help absorb some of its losses.

Although this report focuses on the legal issues associated with living wills, it should be noted that implementing the changes discussed below could result in increased administrative, regulatory, and market costs.

As is indicated in Table 1 , each of the 11 first-wave filers is spread over at least 29 different countries, with two operating in more than 100. If these covered financial institutions failed, they likely would have assets in each of those countries that could be subject to insolvency regimes specific to those countries.

FDIC Vice-Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig has explained:", "Countries have their own laws, courts, and regulatory environment. Contracts enforceable in one country might not be so in another. Depositor preference, wholesale funding arrangements, derivatives, and repurchase agreements often are treated differently among countries when a firm enters bankruptcy.", "Reducing the number of countries of operation and the extent of operations within countries could help improve a covered financial institution's resolvability by, for example, reducing the coordination burdens of multiple insolvency regimes cooperating on the proper allocation of assets and treatment of creditors and, relatedly, the incentive of administrators of those regimes from engaging in self-interested \"ring-fencing\" of the failed institution's assets. Ring-fencing, in this context, refers to an insolvency regime administrator freezing the transfer of assets held by an affiliate of a failed institution that are located within the jurisdiction of the administrator so that those assets may be used to pay off domestic creditors, potentially at the expense of creditors located in other jurisdictions. Ring-fencing can lead to an inefficient allocation of the failed firm's assets, inconsistent treatment among creditor classes, and cutting the flow of cross-border funds that may be needed to maintain certain Critical Operations.", "The FDIC in recent years has been active in entering memoranda of understanding (MOU) with administrators of these cross-border insolvency regimes establishing ground rules regarding how the administrators of the cross-border insolvency regimes will interact and coordinate with each other if a multinational financial institution went into default. While the FDIC's actions are potentially beneficial, it may be difficult to reach agreements with every relevant country. Even to the extent that MOU are entered into, they generally are not legally enforceable, and thus essentially rely on voluntary cooperation, which might be lacking in the midst of financial tumult.

It also could ease the company's ability to maintain necessary operations during the resolution process. When assessing a legal restructuring strategy, covered financial institutions might place a particular focus on aligning certain Material Entities and Core Operations within distinct legal structures to help buffer them from financial losses originating in other parts of the conglomerate. Taking these steps also likely would increase directors', management's, and the regulators' understanding of the covered financial institution's legal structure and help reduce its complexity and interconnectedness.", "To further address the regulators' concerns, the covered financial company could have policies in place intended to ensure that each intermediate holding company is sufficiently capitalized to absorb some potential losses by the subsidiaries in the intermediate holding company. Companies could take additional steps to implement policies by which the intermediate holding company would formally serve as a \"source of strength\" for its subsidiaries and which generally would prohibit other portions of the covered financial institution from guaranteeing the liabilities of entities within the intermediate holding company structure.

According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, AIG FP's ability to issue those credit default swaps was aided by the fact that the AIG parent holding company guaranteed their performance. Had AIG FP been organized within an intermediate holding company and prohibited from entering credit default swaps that were guaranteed by the parent holding company, counterparties may have been more reticent to purchase credit default swaps from AIG FP.

Some of the policy justifications for these regulations were to reduce the risk of a firm's cross-border activities to the financial stability of the United States, help eliminate a \"fractured organizational structure that can reduce the effectiveness of attempts ... to manage [] risks,\" and improve the resolvability of U.S-based subsidiaries within U.S. resolution regimes. Similarly, the FRB noted that, to the extent that unusual circumstances prevent a foreign banking organization from transferring all ownership rights of its U.S.-based subsidiaries to the intermediate holding company, then \"the [FRB] expects to require passivity commitments or other supervisory agreements to limit the exposure to and transactions between the U.S. intermediate holding company and the U.S. subsidiary that remains outside of the U.S. intermediate holding company.\" ", "It appears that some foreign covered financial institutions are indeed taking some of these reorganization steps.

The borrowing costs of intermediate holding companies or other subsidiaries that are subject to contractual or other legal barriers to receiving financial support from the parent also might be higher than they would if there was an explicit guarantee by the parent. There also is the possibility that, even if contracts between intermediate holding companies and their counterparties explicitly state that the parent covered financial institution does not guarantee the performance of specific contracts or the financial stability of certain subsidiaries, counterparties might presume the parent would choose to do so in practice to avoid legal and reputational harms of default.

One possible change could be to contractually provide for a brief \"stay\" on a counterparty's ability to enforce its rights under the contract, akin to the FDIC's power as receiver under OLA and as a conservator or receiver for insured depository institutions under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). The special but disparate treatment of derivatives, securities, and other financial contracts under the Bankruptcy Code, on the one hand, and the FDI Act and OLA, on the other, are discussed in detail below.

First, it would ensure that the contracts are treated the same in a standard bankruptcy process as they are in the special insolvency regimes administered by the FDIC, which would mean that the impact on parties to these contracts would more likely be the same regardless of which insolvency regime a covered financial institution is subject. It also could increase the likelihood that cross-border financial contracts would be treated uniformly by insolvency regimes in other countries, although complete uniformity would likely require statutory and regulatory changes, as well. As is discussed more fully below, it appears that a significant number of global financial institutions are voluntarily taking steps to modify many of these contracts to provide a temporary stay from counterparties' ability to exercise default trigger rights when a financial institution enters bankruptcy or another insolvency regime. ", "Separately from the issue of modifying these financial contracts, FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig has suggested that some covered financial institutions should reduce their overall exposure to these contracts.

Stays prevent creditor runs and keep contracts in force\u2014the counter party is bound by the contract; claims on the insolvent firm remain pending; and collateral may usually not be liquidated. This facilitates the coordination of creditor claims.", "The U.S. Bankruptcy Code establishes a general stay automatically upon petitioning for bankruptcy. However, the Code provides a number of exceptions to the automatic stay, including for certain \"qualified financial contracts (QFCs),\" that is, securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements, and netting arrangements. It is especially common for financial institutions to be parties to QFCs, making special protections provided for them all the more important in case of a financial institution's insolvency.", "Additionally, the Bankruptcy Code provides trustees, who administer bankruptcy liquidations, the authority to avoid (i.e., claw-back or reverse) certain transfers (subject to certain limitations) made by debtors shortly before a bankruptcy petition is filed. The purpose of this avoidance power is to facilitate the equitable distribution of the bankruptcy estate's assets among credit classes and to limit the \"race to the courthouse\" problem. However, most QFCs are exempt from this general avoidance power. ", "These so-called \"safe-harbor protections\" for QFCs were established, in part, to suppress the negative repercussions of a financial institution's bankruptcy on global financial markets\u2014in other words to reduce systemic risk. These safe harbors provide counterparties with the power to terminate or liquidate the collateral held against the contracts and net or setoff each party's positions subsequent to a troubled firm filing a bankruptcy petition. These legal constructs are explained by two prominent economists this way: ", "Close-out and netting consist of two separate but related rights, often combined in a single contract: 1) the right of a counterparty to unilaterally terminate contracts under specified conditions (close-out), and 2) the right to offset amounts due at termination of individual contracts between the same counterparties when determining the final obligation [(netting)].", "Almost all QFCs have close-out and netting provisions that are triggered by an act of default, including the institution filing for bankruptcy, even if the contract itself is still performing. Some scholars argue that these provisions have the potential to exacerbate the financial condition of ailing firms and to deplete their assets. For example, debtors of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy estate estimated that, just prior to the bankruptcy petition being filed, they were a party to around 930,000 QFCs. Of those nearly 1 million contracts, approximately 733,000 were terminated within about three months of Lehman Brothers filing its bankruptcy petition. It appears that, in the vast majority of the QFCs that were terminated, the non-Lehman counterparties were \"in the money\"\u2014that is, Lehman owed money to the counterparty. Those counterparties that held collateral against their QFCs were able to terminate the contracts and keep the collateral as settlement of their claims. QFCs that were not collateralized could be closed-out and overall positions could be netted. The counterparties were then able to seek a claim as unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate. Harvey Miller, the lead attorney for the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, testified before a Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee that Lehman's counterparties' unilateral authority to terminate, close-out, and net QFCs \"caused a massive destructive value for Lehman.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of the Treatment of Qualified Financial Contracts Under the FDIC's Receivership Regimes", "paragraphs": ["Whereas the general rule for a corporate liquidation under the Bankruptcy Code is the implementation of the automatic stay to provide time to ensure that similarly situated creditors are treated equally, the FDIC as receiver is more likely to further the statutory objectives of the FDI Act and OLA by maintaining much of the company's operations. For example, when acting as a receiver under the FDI Act, the FDIC generally will ensure that consumers continue to have access to FDIC-insured consumer deposits in order to achieve its primary goal of protecting insured deposits \"at the least possible cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\" Although it has never exercised the authorities before, the FDIC has indicated that maintaining a failed firm's Critical Operations would be a major strategy of resolution under OLA as a means to promote financial stability, which is the overarching purpose of OLA. To reach these ends, the FDIC is empowered with greater flexibility to manage the QFCs of a troubled depository under the FDI Act or a nondepository financial institution under OLA than is available under the Bankruptcy Code. ", "Notably, the FDIC, as receiver, is empowered with the authorities of the failed firm's directors, management, and shareholders. The FDIC also under certain circumstances may transfer, repudiate, and avoid the QFCs of a troubled depository or nondepository financial institution. It may employ those powers during the imposition of a temporary stay in which counterparties are prohibited from exercising their rights to terminate QFCs, liquidate collateral, and net their overall positions with the failed firm solely because the FDIC has been appointed its conservator or receiver. Such a stay would remain in place until the counterparties are notified of a transfer of the QFC or until 5:00 p.m. of the business day after the appointment of the receiver. Only after this temporary stay are counterparties free to exercise rights to net, terminate, or liquidate under such contracts.", "During this stay, the FDIC is permitted to transfer QFCs to other financial institutions as long as certain notice requirements are met. In exercising this authority, the FDIC must either transfer all QFCs with a particular party and its affiliates to a single financial institution, or it may not transfer any of them. ", "The FDIC, as receiver under the FDI Act and OLA, also may repudiate certain contracts if allowing performance would be \"burdensome\" and \"disaffirmance or repudiation ... will promote the orderly administration of the institution's affairs.\" The FDIC may only repudiate QFCs, however, if it repudiates all QFCs with a particular counterparty and its affiliates. In other words, the FDIC must either repudiate all QFCs with a particular party and its affiliates, or it may not repudiate any of them. ", "Finally, in contrast to QFCs being completely exempt from the avoidance power under the Bankruptcy Code, the FDIC as conservator or receiver may avoid (i.e., reverse or claw-back) property transferred pursuant to a QFC when the transfer was performed with the \"actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\" the FDIC, or the failed company or its creditors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Strategy to Amend the Default Trigger Provisions in Qualified Financial Contracts", "paragraphs": ["The temporary stay for QFCs under both the FDI Act and OLA gives the FDIC a brief period of time to determine how to most effectively and economically exercise its transfer, avoidance, and repudiation powers and to assess whether requisite legal conditions for employing those powers exist. For example, the FDIC might choose to transfer performing QFCs to different financial institutions to obviate the unnecessary and inefficient process of a counterparty terminating the QFC with the failed firm and then seeking to re-establish virtually the same contract in the private market with a different financial institution to stand in the shoes of the failed firm. ", "This temporary stay is in stark contrast to the blanket exception from the automatic stay for netting, terminating, and liquidating QFCs under the Bankruptcy Code. Modifying QFCs to provide covered financial institutions in default or their insolvency regime administrators with the same powers as the FDIC as receiver under OLA or the FDI Act arguably could reduce the financial strain on an insolvent covered financial institution, as well as its many counterparties. ", "On the other hand, providing the FDIC with the discretion on whether to transfer or repudiate QFCs arguably could increase uncertainty in financial markets because it may be difficult to predict how the FDIC will exercise that discretion. This uncertainty could incentivize a covered financial institution's counterparties to exercise default trigger rights prior to the FDIC stepping in (or the company filing a petition for bankruptcy), thus hastening and exacerbating the covered financial institution's financial duress. If the FDI Act and OLA were amended so as to treat QFCs under those regimes the same as they are under the Bankruptcy Code, there is a strong likelihood that counterparties to a failed firm would decide whether or not to terminate, close-out, and net QFCs based on whether not they would be \"in the money.\" ", "In October 2014, 18 of the world's largest financial institutions, working through the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.

This policy also is being proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board to apply globally to systemically important financial institutions. ", "There has been a significant amount of focus on the role that minimum capital requirements can have on reducing the likelihood that covered financial companies will fail. Capital requirements are not intended to completely eliminate a financial institution's risk of default. In order to effectively serve as financial intermediaries for their customers and to keep financial markets functioning, financial institutions typically fund their loans and other assets through liabilities (e.g., customer deposits). As a result, there always will be some risk that the capital held by a financial institution will not be enough to cover its losses. ", "According to the FDIC and FRB, long-term unsecured debt has several benefits over secured and short-term unsecured debt in an insolvency proceeding. First, holders of long-term, unsecured debt are more likely to be willing to accept haircuts and otherwise restructure their claims in a resolution. Secured creditors in an insolvency proceeding generally are protected up to the value of the collateral underlying their claim against the insolvent company. Thus, they have little incentive to voluntarily take a haircut or accept less than the value of the underlying collateral. ", "Second, it is often the case that long-term debt better aligns the market interests of the covered financial institution with debt holders, as compared with short-term and secured debt. Secured debt holders, because they are generally protected up to the full value of the underlying collateral, generally do not have a strong incentive to ensure that covered financial institutions are managed for long-term stability. Similarly, short-term debt holders of a covered financial institution are more likely to only be concerned about the financial strength of covered financial institutions through the life of the debt. On the other hand, long-term, unsecured debt holders are more likely to have an interest in the long-term stability of the covered financial institution because they generally are going to be low priority claimants in a resolution proceeding. Consequently, if a covered financial institution fails, the long-term, unsecured creditors likely will be absorbing its losses. As a result, part of the consideration into whether or not to extend long-term, unsecured credit to a covered financial institution is the company's long-term viability. If a covered financial institution's long-term financial health is questioned, it likely will have difficulty obtaining long-term unsecured credit at a reasonable cost. Additionally, short-term debt could be hard to rollover in a stressed environment. A firm that is heavily reliant upon short-term debt may be less stable during a market downturn than one that relies more on long-term debt. ( Table 1 lists the short-term funding as a percentage of total liabilities of the 11 first-wave filers.)", "FRB Governor Daniel K. Tarullo has explained it this way:", "While minimum capital requirements are designed to cover losses up to a certain statistical probability, in the even less likely event that the equity of a financial firm is wiped out, successful resolution without taxpayer assistance would be most effectively accomplished if a firm has sufficient long-term unsecured debt to absorb additional losses and to recapitalize the business transferred to a bridge operating company. The presence of a substantial tranche of long-term debt that is subject to bail-in during a resolution and is structurally subordinated to the firm's other creditors should reduce run risk by clarifying the position of those other creditors in an orderly liquidation process. ... [L]ongterm debt also should have the benefit of improving market discipline, since the holders of that debt would know they faced the prospect of loss should the firm enter resolution.", "In fact, both FDIC Chairman Gruenberg and FRB Governor Tarullo have acknowledged that the agencies are considering imposing a minimum level of long-term, unsecured debt that must be held by covered financial institution parent holding companies. ", "It should be noted, however, that long-term, unsecured debt generally is more expensive than short-term, secured debt. Additionally, many of the policy justifications for holding long-term, unsecured debt that are discussed above could prove illusory if creditors of the covered financial institution believe that it will receive emergency governmental assistance if it becomes insolvent or in danger of default.
