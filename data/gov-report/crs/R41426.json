To contribute to an HSA, the insured must have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), and generally no other health insurance coverage. One of a number of the stated goals of the 2003 legislation is to encourage workers to better save for their health care in retirement. Moreover, the HDHP/HSA combination is thought to provide incentives for the consumers to be more active in their care, and purchase the best possible medical services for the lowest possible price. This report analyzes existing data and reviews the current literature to discuss whether HDHPs and HSAs have begun to meet some of these objectives.", "Enrollment in HDHPs has been increasing since HSAs were introduced in 2004. Nevertheless, the HDHP enrollment growth rate is slowing. Individuals who have an HDHP may or may not open an HSA; it is estimated that between 51% and 58% of HDHP holders go on to open an HSA. Whether opening an HDHP/HSA is financially advantageous is a complicated issue. In fact, those at many levels of the health spending distribution might save money by opening an HDHP/HSA instead of enrolling in a standard preferred provider organization (PPO) plan (the most common type of health insurance plan).", "A review of the literature on HDHPs and HSAs suggests the following:", "HSAs are designed to change consumer behavior by providing incentives for consumers to be more concerned with the cost and quality of their health care. Although a few studies suggest this is happening, the literature in this area reports mixed and inconclusive results. HSAs could encourage individuals to save for their health expenses in retirement. However, because only about half of HDHP plan holders open an HSA, the remaining half are not saving for their health expenses in this tax-preferred account. Among those with HSAs, some may be using the account as a tax benefit and not saving for health care in retirement. The uninsurance rate could potentially decrease with the advent of HDHPs as previously uninsured individuals purchased these plans because of their relatively low premiums. There is little evidence, however, that the currently uninsured are transitioning into HDHPs. Some hoped that a change from standard PPO plans to HDHP/HSA plans would lower aggregate health expenditures. They maintain that expenditures would fall if most of those insured in a standard PPO plan actually moved to an HDHP/HSA.", "The empirical evidence backing many of these results is weak or limited, and much remains unknown about the effects of HDHPs and HSAs on uninsurance, the utilization of health care, and aggregate health expenditures."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), as authorized by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act ( P.L. 108-173 , MMA) of 2003, are tax-preferred savings accounts used to pay for unreimbursed qualified medical expenses such as health insurance deductibles, copayments, and services not covered by insurance.

First, HDHPs have lower premiums than most other types of insurance plans, and therefore may be affordable to those who would otherwise not purchase insurance. Second, a plan with a high deductible removes some of the incentive for patients to purchase more care than they otherwise would under low deductible plans. On the other hand, the lower premium does not guarantee that all individuals will go on to open an account or use health services. Indeed, it has been argued that HSAs encourage individuals to under-use health care and forego necessary services.", "These various objectives of HDHPs, with and without HSAs, are part of a larger concept known as Consumer-Directed Health Care (CDHC). CDHC, which is also known as consumerism, provides incentives for the consumers of health services to become more active in their care by becoming well informed, and choosing practitioners and treatments that best suit their medical needs at the lowest possible prices. In fact, the use of \"consumer\" and not \"patient\" is indicative of the degree to which individuals are intended to take charge of their health care and expenditures.", "Despite their growing importance in the insurance market, little has been known about the effects of HDHPs and HSAs; data for any analysis have simply not been available.

The decisions are separate because selecting an HDHP does not require subsequently opening an HSA. The decisions are related because some of the factors that influence selecting an HDHP might also influence opening an HSA. For example, wealthy individuals might choose an HDHP because they can easily afford the relatively high out-of-pocket payments for health care associated with a high deductible. These same individuals might go on to open an HSA because they will receive relatively high tax benefits because of their high marginal tax bracket. On the other hand, lower-income individuals might choose an HDHP for its lower premiums but would not necessarily have the same tax incentive to open an HSA.", "In addition, all individuals may not face the same insurance plan options.

Even though the legal minimum deductible in 2009 was $1,150, average deductibles were between 40% and 180% greater than this amount. As the market size increases, the HDHP deductible becomes a greater multiple of the PPO deductible; for example, in large firms, the HDHP is about 3.4 times the PPO deductible. The reason for this relationship is unclear. Nevertheless, the fact that HDHP deductibles may not fall below a given minimum while PPOs need not have a deductible may play a role.", "The HDHP high deductibles are offset by lower premiums.

Because insurance plans with HSAs have high deductibles and may cover preventive care, some have concluded that they only benefit healthy people. This would be because the healthy are more likely to have only preventive health expenditures. The healthy would therefore spend very little on health care, and would be able to increase their tax-exempt savings. ", "Nevertheless, it is often impossible to tell in advance which income levels would be better off with an HDHP/HSA. Figure 1 illustrates that, for one representative set of possible insurance plans, it is difficult to predict in advance whether a representative consumer would be better off with a high-deductible policy or a lower-deductible policy. In other words, at the start of health insurance open season, the consumer may not know whether the HDHP/HSA or the standard PPO would result in lower total out-of-pocket spending (incorporating premiums, deductibles, and copayments).", "In Figure 1 , the PPO policy, on the left, has a $500 deductible, and a $1,000 maximum level of out of pocket expenditures. The plan pays 80% of the individual's costs between $500 and $3,000. At the $3,000 expenditure mark, the individual's expenditures reach the maximum out of pocket level ($500 + 0.2*$2,500 = $1,000). The HDHP with HSA policy, on the right, has a $2,000 deductible and also a $2,000 out of pocket maximum. At low expenditure levels (below $500), the individual will foot the entire health care bill under both insurance plans. At high levels of expenditures (above $3,000), the individual again does not prefer one policy over another, because either policy covers 100% of his or her health expenditures.", "Between these two extremes, however, the individual sometimes would save money under a PPO, and sometimes under an HDHP. Although this example assumes that the individual has at least $2,000 in the HSA (and also ignores the tax benefits associated with the HSA), the general conclusion remains: it is hard to tell, especially during open enrollment when the next year's health expenditures are uncertain, whether some individuals would save money with a PPO or an HDHP/HSA.", "This subsection has discussed whether those of a certain health status might find it in their interests to enroll in the HDHP/HSA combination from a theoretical perspective.

Relative to traditional health insurance plans, an individual with an HDHP spends his or her own money until reaching a much higher deductible. This difference in the relative cost of care should reduce health spending by the individual. For example, consider an individual who has already incurred about $1,500 in medical bills. When this individual develops what appears to be a minor cold, but could actually be a more serious flu, he or she must decide whether to visit the doctor. If the individual belongs to a standard PPO, he or she might only incur 20% of the total doctor visit's costs. If the individual belongs to an HDHP/HSA, however, he or she would need to pay 100% of the costs (either from a funded HSA or out-of-pocket). The higher cost sharing might decrease the probability that the HDHP/HSA individual goes ahead and sees the doctor. In this scenario, the individual's health expenditures might be lower with an HDHP than with a PPO because the individual chose not to visit the physician. On the other hand, the tax savings associated with an HSA may make the individual feel wealthier overall, and therefore increase his or her willingness to spend on all goods and services, including health care. ", "The above discussion treats all health care as the same. However, certain medical procedures are clearly more important than others. In most cases, skipping a doctor's visit for a minor cold does not permanently damage a patient's health. Skipping a doctor's visit for the treatment of diabetes or for blood pressure monitoring, however, can have lasting consequences.

Cancer screening tests were free to the consumer in both insurance policies, and therefore the consumers had no incentive to reduce their screening behavior. Those who switched to the HDHP did not change their use of breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening. However, these plan switchers may have changed their specific test for colorectal screening away from a test no longer fully covered (such as a colonoscopy) to an equally-appropriate test that was fully covered (such as a fecal occult blood test). Researchers examined participants over time in an Aetna health fund where some were enrolled in a standard PPO while others were enrolled in an HDHP. The cost of preventive services, cancer screening, and diabetic monitoring was free for those in the HDHP, and included a very low co-payment for those in the PPO who used in-network providers.

The study design was a before-and-after comparison of workers whose employers mandated a switch to an HDHP, as compared with a before-and-after comparison of those remaining in a standard HMO.

It is unclear, however, whether consumers are also expected to take a larger share of the responsibility if things go wrong. Currently, the bulk of responsibility for treatments falls on medical professionals and insurers. Under consumerism, some of this responsibility may, in a legal sense, shift to patients.

Therefore the two studies that conclude that those who enroll in HDHPs and HSAs are more likely to have higher income than others are methodologically stronger than the third study cited above. ", "Turning to other demographic characteristics, there are no differences by gender in the percent of persons covered by an HDHP, and of those, the percent with an HSA. On the other hand, black individuals are less likely to be covered by HDHPs than individuals of other races, and those with higher levels of education are more likely to have HDHPs than those with lower levels of education.

In this context, tax arbitrage refers to the process of taking advantage of the different tax treatments of HSAs and 401(k) retirement savings plans in order to earn a profit. Under some scenarios, prudent taxpayers might use their funds as retirement savings accounts instead of health savings accounts. Consider a firm that does not make contributions to its employees' 401(k)s. Workers will come out ahead financially if they put money into their HSAs instead of their 401(k)s. Contributions to, investment income from, and withdrawals from HSAs are tax-exempt if used for qualified medical expenses. All withdrawals made at age 65 and above are tax free, whatever their usage. On the other hand, withdrawals from 401(k)s are taxable income. In short, HSAs can be viewed as a tax shelter.", "Given that so little data on HSAs themselves are available, it is not surprising that there is almost no research on their impact on retirement savings. One recent paper looks at the health plan choices and retirement savings of about 16,000 workers in one firm. This research, which may or may not generalize, cannot reject the hypothesis that, for otherwise comparable individuals, there is no relationship between HSA contributions and retirement savings.

HDHP data are sufficient to look at changes in uninsurance rates induced by consumerist plans and policies because individuals with an HDHP are insured whether or not they open an HSA.", "The effect of HDHPs on the aggregate number of individuals without health insurance cannot be known in advance. Because HDHPs have lower premiums than standard plans, some uninsured individuals may find the plans attractive, purchase them in the nongroup market, and thereby decrease the number of individuals without insurance. On the other hand, healthy individuals with standard policies might be attracted to HDHPs because of their low premiums. However, a large increase in enrollment, coming mainly from those with standard policies switching to HDHPs, would not reduce uninsurance.", "In addition, an argument based on \"adverse selection\" concludes that HDHPs could actually lead to an increase in the uninsurance rate. Suppose enrollment in HDHPs increases dramatically, and attracts healthier than average members. The pool of individuals remaining in the standard PPOs would correspondingly become increasingly less healthy and more costly to insure. The PPOs would then increase their premiums and other forms of cost-sharing in response to their cost increase.", "Two studies measure transitions from uninsurance into HDHP insurance. Both studies are complicated simulation models, attempt to control for (incorporate) demographic characteristics of consumers, and incorporate hypothetical policy scenarios. Both studies use approximations of HDHPs. The data sources also differ. Given the complexity of each model, and the differences in data and model specification, it is perhaps not surprising that the two papers reach opposing conclusions. One simulation predicts no change in the uninsurance rates. In this simulation, few uninsured individuals would move into HDHPs because their incomes are too low to receive tax advantages from the associated HSAs. The second simulation predicts a decrease in uninsurance. In this simulation, individuals without access to either public insurance or a group market would purchase HDHPs in the nongroup market because they are attracted to the HDHP's low premiums. In conclusion, there is very little available research measuring insurance transitions into HDHPs (or HSAs).

Those who enrolled in an HDHP were more likely than comparable individuals in the same firm without an HDHP to be in excellent or very good health and not to have any chronic health conditions. Otherwise comparable employees of a single firm (Alcoa) were more likely to choose an HDHP if they did not have a chronic health condition and had health spending in the bottom quartile of the sample.", "These separate studies yield similar results, although their reliance on single-employer studies makes the conclusion weaker than it would otherwise be. In addition, these studies compared health status at the time the individual chose the HDHP, and differences in health status may surface after consumers have been in the HDHP for more than a year. There is, therefore, evidence that those who enroll in HDHPs are somewhat healthier than average, but this evidence may or may not generalize.

For example, one study concludes that 1% of individuals accounted for about 24% of health expenditures in 2003. This distribution of spending levels across the population suggests to some that aggregate expenditures cannot be reduced by adopting HDHPs, because most of the adopters will not be high users of care.", "Nevertheless, a substantial amount of cost-sharing is possible under HDHPs. In particular, according to one analysis, expenditures above the standard PPO deductible and below the HDHP deductible account for about 35% of total expenditures. Individuals in this range would experience more cost sharing, and therefore, on average, lower health expenditures after moving from a standard PPO to an HDHP/HSA. However, this analysis concludes that a notable decrease in aggregate expenditures would require that most or all individuals moved from a representative PPO to a representative HDHP.", "Aggregate changes in health expenditures also depend on the composition of HDHP enrollees. If those in consumerist plans are healthier than those in standard PPOs, as the early evidence suggests, those remaining in the PPOs are by definition less healthy.

The evidence on whether consumers respond to the new incentives provided by the HDHPs and HSAs is mixed.

The HSA deduction is available to all filers with an HSA; whether or not the filer itemizes deductions is irrelevant. Second, the number of HSAs and their aggregate market value are filed by banks (and other account trustees).

First, in this report, comparisons by insurance plan structures give priority to HDHPs. In other words, if a consumer has an HDHP that uses a PPO network, he or she is considered in the HDHP group and not in the PPO group. Most of the academic and policy literature follows this convention, and the articles almost never provide enough information to calculate what the conclusions would be if HDHPs were not given priority. Second, HDHPs are compared to PPOs (instead of indemnity plans or other plan structures) because more employers offering health insurance offer PPOs than any other plan structure; about 44% of employers offered a PPO in 2009."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
