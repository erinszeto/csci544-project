One of the major policy issues to emerge concerns the role of the federal government in supporting affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. Much of this debate centers on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). As GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are hybrid entities, private companies with congressional charters that contain special privileges and certain responsibilities to support affordable housing. Some argue that the hybrid nature of the GSEs\u2014private companies with a public mission\u2014leads to perverse incentives and, therefore, the government should instead support affordable housing primarily through existing government programs or agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Others argue that the perverse incentives can be realigned such that private companies could be encouraged to support affordable housing in a responsible manner.", "The GSEs' business model is intended to provide support to the broader mortgage market, but they take certain required actions that are geared primarily toward assisting low- and moderate-income households. The ways in which the GSEs currently support housing that is affordable to low- and moderate-income households provide one potential baseline to compare recent legislative proposals. This report discusses three major channels of support. First, since 1992 the GSEs have provided support through affordable housing goals mandated by Congress. The goals are numerical standards in which each GSE is required to dedicate a certain amount of its business on specified types of low-income borrowers and underserved areas. Second, in 2008 Congress also established for the GSEs a duty to serve requirement. Under the duty to serve requirement, the GSEs are required to provide leadership to assist low-income households in certain market segments: manufactured housing, affordable housing preservation, and rural markets. Third, in 2008 Congress also directed the GSEs to make contributions to two affordable housing funds, the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund. The funds were intended to increase the supply of housing affordable to low-income households. The duty to serve regulation has not been finalized and the housing funds have not received contributions from the GSEs since the GSEs were placed into conservatorship.", "Although three of the more prominent housing finance reform proposals\u2014the Johnson-Crapo GSE Reform Proposal, the Housing Opportunities Move the Economy Forward Act proposal (HOME Forward Act), and the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act (PATH Act, H.R. 2767)\u2014would repeal the affordable housing goals and wind down the GSEs, they offer different approaches to supporting affordable housing in a reformed system. The PATH Act would not have a mandate or requirement for private actors to support affordable housing and would leave the support to existing government agencies and programs. The Johnson-Crapo GSE Reform Proposal and the HOME Forward Act differ in their details but offer similar approaches; they would impose a fee on certain mortgage-backed securities and direct that fee to the Housing Trust Fund, Capital Magnet Fund, and a newly established Market Access Fund. They would also have, among other provisions, affordability requirements in their proposed multifamily finance systems.", "This report explains the ways in which the GSEs currently support affordable housing and describes the different affordable housing approaches contained in the reform proposals."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["As Congress considers different approaches to reform the housing finance system, one of the major policy issues to emerge concerns the role of the federal government in supporting affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households.

Some argue that the hybrid nature of the GSEs\u2014private companies with a public mission\u2014led to perverse incentives to lower underwriting standards in an effort to expand credit availability to low-income borrowers.

There can be many definitions of what constitutes \"affordable,\" but one common definition classifies housing as affordable if a household is paying no more than 30% of its income toward housing costs. Households that pay more than 30% of their income for housing costs are considered to be cost burdened, and households that pay more than 50% of their income for housing costs are considered to be severely cost burdened. With a larger percentage of income going to housing costs, households that are cost burdened may have difficulty paying for other necessities. ", "Generally speaking, the lower a household's income, the harder it might be to find housing that is affordable. When the concept of affordable housing is discussed, it is usually in reference to housing that is affordable to low- or moderate-income households. Low-income households are commonly defined to be households with incomes at or below 80% of area median income (AMI). Very low-income households are defined as households with incomes at or below 50% of AMI, and extremely low-income households are defined as households with incomes at or below 30% of AMI. There is not a consistent definition of \"moderate-income,\" which is defined differently in different contexts. ", "Affordable housing can be rental housing or owner-occupied housing. For the lowest income households, affordable housing will often be rental housing, because lower-income households might find it more financially feasible to rent rather than own their homes. Evidence shows that there is a shortage of rental housing that is physically adequate, affordable, and available to households at the lowest end of the income spectrum. (A unit is generally considered \"available\" to a household at a given income level if the unit is either currently occupied by a household at or below the same level of income or is vacant.) According to HUD, in 2011, there were about 93 adequate, affordable, and available rental units for every 100 low-income households. There were fewer adequate, affordable, and available rental units farther down the income spectrum: 57 units for every 100 very low-income households and 31 units for every 100 extremely low-income households. ", "Affordable housing can also be owner-occupied housing, particularly for moderate-income households, households at the higher end of low income, or households in areas with little rental housing stock and inexpensive single-family housing (such as rural areas). When there is discussion of \"affordable housing\" in the context of homeownership, it is often in reference to ensuring that creditworthy households have opportunities to access mortgages on affordable terms. There has been particular concern about whether certain types of households are \"underserved\" by the mortgage market, meaning that they are less likely to be able to access affordable mortgages. Possible underserved market segments could include low- and moderate-income or minority households, households living in certain areas (such as neighborhoods with high concentrations of poverty or in rural areas), and households seeking less traditional types of housing, such as manufactured housing. ", "To address this perceived need for affordable rental and owner-occupied housing, Congress has established several federal programs designed to increase the availability of housing that is affordable to low-income households. Most of these programs are administered by HUD, and they include rental assistance programs to support affordable rental housing and block grants that states and local governments can use for rental or owner-occupied housing. Congress has also established programs to support access to affordable homeownership, such as by providing mortgage insurance through FHA. FHA insures mortgages made by private lenders to certain creditworthy borrowers who might otherwise have difficulty qualifying for affordable mortgages, such as households with small down payments. FHA traditionally serves many first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minority households. In addition to insuring single-family mortgages, FHA also insures mortgages on multifamily buildings (i.e., apartment buildings with five or more units), which can encourage lenders to offer multifamily mortgages on better terms and in turn increase the supply of affordable rental housing.", "In addition to these programs and activities, Congress has also directed the GSEs to support affordable housing, primarily by purchasing both single-family and multifamily mortgages that provide affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households or households that are located in underserved areas.

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA; P.L. 110-289 ) replaced the previous housing goals with new single-family and multifamily goals for new categories of borrowers.", "Under the affordable housing goals established by HERA, each GSE is required to focus a certain amount of its business on specified types of borrowers. By purchasing mortgages that are made to lower-income borrowers, some argue, the GSEs can increase homeownership rates among segments of the population that are less likely to own their home.

", "The GSEs can satisfy each of the single-family affordable housing goals in one of two ways, either (1) by meeting the prospective benchmark that is set in advance by FHFA for the goal (Benchmark Level) or (2) by having \"the goal category's share of the Enterprise's business for the year [be] at least as great as the category's share of the overall market\" (Market Level). For example, if the Benchmark Level set by FHFA for the low-income home purchase goal in 2012 is 23% but, in retrospect, it turns out that home purchases by low-income households made up 26.6% of the total market in 2012, then a GSE could satisfy the goal if the share of its total purchases that were low-income home purchases exceeded either the Benchmark Level or the Market Level.", " Table 1 shows Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's performance for the single-family housing goals using both performance metrics for 2012. Fannie Mae met each goal by performing above the Benchmark Level, though it met the Market Level for only the low-income areas home purchase goal. Freddie Mac also met each goal by performing above the Benchmark Level; it performed above the Market Level for the low-income areas home purchase goal and the low-income refinance goal. ", "In addition to the single-family goals, the GSEs must also satisfy two multifamily goals. To the extent that poorer families are more likely to rent than own their homes, the multifamily goals are more likely to benefit such households than the single-family goals. The multifamily goals are the", "low-income multifamily goal , which is the number of units in multifamily properties that are financed by a GSE that are affordable to households with incomes no greater than 80% of AMI; and very-low income multifamily goal , which is the number of units in multifamily properties that are financed by a GSE and that are affordable to households with incomes no greater than 50% of AMI.", "Unlike the single-family goals, the multifamily goals can only be satisfied by meeting a Benchmark Level set by FHFA and do not have a Market Level compliance option. To satisfy the Benchmark Level for a goal, each GSE must finance a minimum number of units that meet the requirements of that goal.

For example, the GSEs could assist the affordable housing preservation market by refinancing loans on multifamily properties that, without favorable financing, may convert to market rate rents.

For years, affordable housing advocates had argued for the establishment of a national housing trust fund that would be funded through a dedicated funding source, rather than through appropriations, and that would be focused on increasing the supply of rental housing available to households at the lowest end of the income spectrum.", "The Capital Magnet Fund, which is administered by the Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, provides competitive funding to nonprofit housing organizations for affordable housing primarily for low-, very low-, and extremely low-income households. A major goal of the Capital Magnet Fund is to leverage the funds to attract additional funding for affordable housing development. ", "Both the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund were to be funded through contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Specifically, the GSEs were directed to contribute 4.2 basis points (that is, 0.042%, or .042 cents for each dollar) of the unpaid principal balance of the new mortgages they purchased each year. Ultimately, 65% of those contributions were to go to the Housing Trust Fund and 35% to the Capital Magnet Fund. However, the law also required the Director of FHFA to suspend the contributions under certain circumstances related to the GSEs' financial status. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship, where they have remained since. In November of that year, just a few months after HERA had been enacted, FHFA directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to suspend their contributions to the affordable housing funds. Neither GSE had begun making contributions at the time that the contributions were suspended. The Housing Trust Fund has not received any funding to date. The Capital Magnet Fund received one appropriation, in FY2010, for $80 million, which is the only funding it has received to date.", "The following subsections describe in more detail the structure of the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund, respectively, based on current law and regulations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Housing Trust Fund", "paragraphs": ["The Housing Trust Fund would provide funds to states to use to increase housing opportunities for extremely low-and very low-income renters and homeowners.

Unlike the Housing Trust Fund, funds from the Capital Magnet Fund can also be used to help finance economic development activities or community service facilities (such as day care centers or health clinics). Funds from the Capital Magnet Fund must primarily benefit low-income households (including very low- and extremely low-income households); no specific amount must be used to benefit very low- or extremely low-income households.

Some analysts, however, take a broader perspective on the GSEs' affordable housing initiatives, arguing that the GSEs' support for affordable housing had severe negative effects for the broader economy. In his dissent to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Peter Wallison contends that the government's efforts to increase homeownership for low- and moderate-income households through the GSEs and other channels led to perverse incentives, which \"caused underwriting standards to decline, increased the numbers of weak and high risk loans far beyond what the market would produce without government influence, and contributed importantly to the growth of the 1997-2007 housing bubble.\" By directing the GSEs to have a larger share of their business focus on lower-income borrowers, the argument goes, the government gave lenders the incentive to make riskier loans because those lenders knew they would be able to sell some or all of those loans to the GSEs. Furthermore, to the extent that some of these loans resulted in foreclosure, the goals could have resulted in financial harm to the population they were designed to help.", "The role of the GSEs in the financial crisis is a contested issue, a full discussion of which is beyond the scope of this report. However, one of the narrower questions that is a part of the argument made by Wallison and others\u2014to what extent did the GSEs' affordable housing goals lead to increased lending to low-income households?\u2014has been widely examined in the research literature and may be useful in assessing the legislative proposals described later in this report. The general consensus of the research literature is that the GSEs appear to have had a limited effect on lending to low-income households. ", "A 2007 speech by former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke cited a study by Dwight Jaffe and John Quigley which concluded that a \"substantial literature has now developed analyzing the efficacy of HUD housing goals for promoting home ownership among lower-income families. The consensus conclusion is that the affordable housing goals (AHGs) have achieved very little in terms of increasing homeownership among low-income families.\" (The goals are referred to as \"HUD housing goals\" because HUD set the numerical targets at the time.)", "Similarly, a 2011 paper by Karen Dynan and Ted Gayer of the Brookings Institution summarized in more detail recent analyses of the GSEs and affordable housing:", "As for the benefits of assigning the GSEs an affordable housing mission, the available evidence suggests that the GSEs\u2014despite meeting their affordable housing goals\u2014had only limited effects on the supply of affordable housing (Congressional Budget Office, 2010). In a case study of underserved markets in the Cleveland area, Freeman, Galster, and Malega (2006) found little relationship between the degree of GSE secondary-market purchases of mortgages and home price appreciation. Gabriel and Rosenthal (2005) presented evidence suggesting that almost all of the sizable increase in homeownership in the 1990s can be attributed to household characteristics rather than policies to lift credit barriers. Bostic and Gabriel (2006) studied the effects of GSE activities on homeownership rates, vacancy rates, and median house values in California, and found only limited evidence of improved housing market performance. Other studies suggesting that the GSEs have not had a significant or sizable impact on homeownership among low-income and other underserved families include Feldman (2002) and Ambrose and Thibodeau (2004).", "In addition, two staff working papers by the Federal Reserve analyzed the effect of the Underserved Areas Goal (one of the affordable housing goals in place prior to HERA). Bhutta concluded that the Underserved Areas Goal \"has had only a limited effect on GSE purchases and total mortgage credit flow\" while Bolotnyy\u2014using a more comprehensive data set\u2014found a smaller effect on affordable housing than Bhutta.", "Levitin and Ratcliffe, taking a broader perspective on efforts to support affordable housing, analyzed the GSEs' housing goals and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which is intended to incentivize banks to provide credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The authors argue that though the efforts may have had a positive but modest effect on expanding credit availability, they \"may have affected the credit availability in [low-to-moderate income] and minority communities in a qualitative manner. If [the housing goals and CRA] did not exist, there would likely be housing finance available, but less of it, and it would be qualitatively different.\"", "The studies cited above analyzed the pre-HERA goals' effects on homeownership. It is possible that the goals instituted by HERA may be more effective and better target low-income households. A 2010 study by CBO, however, notes that the mechanism through which the GSEs support homeownership (reducing interest rates) may not be the most effective in helping low-income households because down payment requirements may be more of a barrier to homeownership for lower-income families making their first home purchase: \"Mortgage purchases that satisfy the goals for low- and moderate-income borrowers help those borrowers by reducing the interest rates they pay and by making credit more available than it would be otherwise. But small reductions in interest rates have only marginal effects on rates of home ownership, in part because down payments appear to be a bigger obstacle for first-time buyers.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislative Proposals", "paragraphs": ["As Congress considers different proposals to reform the housing finance system, it is faced with several broad questions related to affordable housing. Among other things, some of these questions may include the following: ", "Should any entity that replaces the GSEs be required to support affordable housing in some way or should any federal support for affordable housing be left to existing government programs? If a new entity is required to support affordable housing, what form should that support take? To the extent that a new entity supports affordable housing, should that support be geared towards rental housing, homeownership, or both? To the extent that a new entity supports affordable housing, should that support target specific market segments, such as certain types of households (e.g., low-income households or moderate-income households), certain geographic areas (e.g., rural areas or low-income or minority neighborhoods) or certain types of housing (e.g., manufactured housing or preservation of affordable rental units)?
