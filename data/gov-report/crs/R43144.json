For access to low Earth orbit, including the International Space Station (ISS), it confirmed NASA's plans to develop a commercial space transportation capability for both cargo and astronauts. The first commercial cargo flight for ISS resupply was conducted in May 2012. Pending the planned availability of commercial crew transportation in 2017, NASA is paying Russia to carry U.S. astronauts to and from the ISS on Soyuz spacecraft. Issues for Congress include the cost, schedule, and safety of future commercial crew services, as well as the need for alternatives if commercial providers do not succeed.", "For human exploration beyond Earth orbit, the 2010 NASA authorization act mandated development of the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle and the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket to launch Orion into space. A test flight of Orion, on an existing rocket and without a crew, took place in December 2014. The first test flight of Orion on the SLS, again without a crew, is planned for FY2018. The first test flight with a crew is planned for FY2021-FY2022. Issues include NASA's ability to meet that schedule, the feasibility of accelerating the schedule, the payload mass capability of the SLS in the near and long term, and how Orion and the SLS should be used when operational. NASA plans to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the 2030s, but some in Congress would prefer to focus on returning humans to the Moon. Orion and the SLS could also be used as a backup option for access to the ISS, but that option raises additional questions about cost and schedule.", "U.S. use of the ISS is currently authorized through FY2020. NASA has announced that it plans to extend ISS operations through at least 2024. In addition to crew access concerns and issues related to service life extension, Congress is likely to examine the utilization of the ISS for research, both through traditional NASA mechanisms and via the independently managed ISS national laboratory process.", "Many in Congress are concerned that the needs of the human spaceflight program may reduce the resources available for NASA's other activities, including science, aeronautics research, and education. Funding for Earth science satellites is particularly contentious, because of their use for climate change research. Proposed cuts in funding for planetary science have encountered opposition in both Congress and the scientific community. The explosion of a small asteroid over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 may have increased congressional interest in the science and potential threat of near-Earth asteroids and comets. The Administration's proposals to reorganize federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education programs would affect numerous NASA education activities, especially those outside the Office of Education.", "NASA's budget for FY2015 is $18.010 billion, an increase from $17.647 billion in FY2014.

This report discusses a number of issues that arise within the framework of that question. Among them are the following:", "Can commercial services transport U.S. astronauts into Earth orbit, including to the International Space Station, cost-effectively and safely? For human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, will the spacecraft now in development be ready on schedule, and how should they be used when operational? How will the needs of the human spaceflight program affect resources for NASA's science missions, aeronautics research, and education programs? What is the appropriate level of NASA support for Earth science, planetary science, and other scientific fields? In general, is NASA being asked to do more than it can afford?", "Major NASA policy developments since the start of the current Administration include:", "in October 2009, the influential Augustine report on the future of U.S. human spaceflight; early in 2010, the Obama Administration's announcement of a plan to cancel the Bush Administration's Vision for Space Exploration and rely on commercial services for crew access to Earth orbit; later in 2010, Congress's passage of the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-267 ), mandating the development of new spacecraft for human exploration beyond Earth orbit; the final flight of the space shuttle in July 2011; and in FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013, annual reductions in NASA's budget as a result of government-wide fiscal constraints.", "This report begins with some context: a brief survey of NASA's organization and programs, a summary of recent NASA authorization legislation, and an overview of NASA's budget.

Starting in the 1990s, these acts became less frequent. In the past decade, Congress has enacted three NASA authorization acts: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Acts of 2005 ( P.L. 109-155 ), 2008 ( P.L. 110-422 ), and 2010 ( P.L. 111-267 ).", "The 2010 act set a new direction for NASA's human spaceflight programs. It confirmed the already planned termination of the space shuttle program, which had provided access to space for U.S. astronauts since 1981. In place of the space shuttle, the act established two new programs for human spaceflight. First, for access to low Earth orbit, including the International Space Station (ISS), it confirmed NASA's plans to develop a commercial space transportation capability for both cargo and astronauts. Second, for human exploration beyond Earth orbit, the act mandated the development of a crew capsule, to be known as the Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), and a heavy-lift rocket to launch the capsule, to be known as the Space Launch System (SLS). The act directed that the MPCV and SLS should serve as backup systems for cargo and crew access to the ISS, in the absence of a successful commercial capability. It also supported \"full and complete utilization\" of the ISS through at least 2020 and gave direction to NASA regarding ISS utilization and management.", "In making these changes, the 2010 act assented to the Obama Administration's cancellation of the Constellation program. The purpose of Constellation had been to implement the Vision for Space Exploration, a policy announced by President Bush in January 2004 as a new direction for NASA following the February 2003 Columbia space shuttle disaster. Under the Vision, NASA was to focus its efforts on returning humans to the Moon by 2020 and eventually sending humans to Mars and \"worlds beyond.\" The main elements of the Vision were as follows:", "Return the space shuttle to flight status following the Columbia disaster, but then retire the space shuttle in 2010 (later changed to 2011). After the retirement of the space shuttle, use Russian Soyuz spacecraft for human access to space while developing a replacement vehicle. Complete construction of the ISS in accord with existing international commitments, but then terminate U.S. use of the ISS at the end of 2015. Under the Constellation program, develop new systems for human space exploration: the Ares I rocket to launch astronauts into low Earth orbit; the Orion crew capsule, to be launched atop Ares I, to carry astronauts into orbit and beyond; the Ares V heavy-lift rocket to send astronauts and equipment to the Moon; the Altair lunar lander; and various lunar surface systems.", "Although Congress endorsed the broad goals of the Vision in the 2005 and 2008 NASA authorization acts, concerns grew about its cost and schedule. In 2009, NASA and the Office of Science and Technology Policy chartered a committee chaired by Norman R. Augustine to reexamine NASA's human spaceflight goals. The report of the Augustine committee found that", "developing Ares I, Orion, and the other Constellation systems was likely to take longer than NASA anticipated; without substantial increases in NASA funding, human exploration could not continue \"in any meaningful way\"; not extending U.S. use of the ISS past 2015 would \"significantly impair U.S. ability to develop and lead future international spaceflight partnerships\"; and commercial services to launch crews into Earth orbit were \"within reach.\"", "The report also examined alternatives to the spacecraft being developed under Constellation and considered several alternatives to the Moon as the first destination for future human exploration beyond Earth orbit.", "In February 2010, the Obama Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a number of changes for NASA, some of them based on the Augustine report. The proposals were controversial in Congress and led to an extensive debate about whether to retain Constellation and the Vision or, if not, what alternative approach to take. The 2010 NASA authorization act was the result of this debate, but some advocates of other approaches remained unsatisfied.", "In addition to human spaceflight, the 2010 act addressed NASA's programs in science, aeronautics, space technology, and education, as well as cross-cutting institutional and management issues. It also authorized NASA appropriations for FY2011 through FY2013.", "Because the provisions authorizing appropriations did not extend past FY2013, and in order to address other policy concerns, the 113 th Congress considered new authorization legislation. In July 2013, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology ordered reported the NASA Authorization Act of 2013 ( H.R. 2687 ) by a vote of 22 to 17. The ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Space introduced an alternative bill with the same title ( H.R. 2616 ). These bills were effectively superseded by a bipartisan compromise bill, the NASA Authorization Act of 2014 ( H.R. 4412 ), which was passed by the House in June 2014. In the Senate, in July 2013, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation ordered reported another NASA Authorization Act of 2013 ( S. 1317 ) by a vote of 13 to 12. An amended version of S. 1317 was reported on December 10, 2014, but did not receive floor action before the 113 th Congress adjourned.

For FY2015, this was Division B of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ), enacted in December 2014, which provided $18.010 billion for NASA. For further information about FY2015 appropriations legislation, see CRS Report R43509, Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies: FY2015 Appropriations .", "Congressional budget justifications provide detailed information about the Administration's annual budget proposals for NASA and how the requested funding would be used. The Administration's FY2015 budget, released in March 2014, requested a total of $17.461 billion for NASA, plus an additional $886 million as part of the proposed Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative (OGSI), which was not considered part of the base budget request.", " Table 1 summarizes recent NASA funding. More detailed figures for particular programs are provided later in this report. For additional information, including historical data by program, see CRS Report R43419, NASA Appropriations and Authorizations: A Fact Sheet .", "In arguing for additional NASA funding, advocates often compare current funding levels with historical trends. Figure 1 shows NASA funding in current dollars and inflation-adjusted FY2015 dollars from the agency's establishment in 1958 to the present. The large peak in the 1960s is the Apollo program. The narrow peak in FY1987 is the construction of a replacement space shuttle after the Challenger disaster in January 1986. In inflation-adjusted terms, NASA funding was fairly steady for most of the past 20 years, but dropped in FY2013 to a level below any other year since FY1988.", "Another historical trend often cited by NASA advocates is the ratio of NASA funding to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). This is shown in Figure 2 . The Apollo and post- Challenger peaks are again evident. In these terms, the past 20 years have been a steady decline, except for a brief plateau in the early 2000s, an uptick in FY2009, and a smaller uptick in FY2014. As a share of GDP, the FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015 appropriations are lower than any other year since FY1960.", "While advocates of more funding for NASA generally consider these trends persuasive, others may not. One counterargument is that federal funding should be allocated based on the merit and importance of current programs, without regard to the funding those programs have received in the past. Another is that federal programs in general should represent a lower share of GDP, in order to address the federal deficit and debt or to reduce the tax burden on the economy.", "Analysts also often compare actual appropriations for NASA with the amounts authorized in NASA authorization acts, the amounts requested by current and former Administrations, the amounts projected for future years by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the \"notional\" amounts given for future years in NASA's congressional budget justifications. As shown in Figure 3 , actual appropriations rarely match the amounts authorized and may not even trend in the same direction. The authorized increase from FY2007 to FY2009 corresponded to an actual increase, but the authorized increase from FY2011 to FY2013 corresponded to an actual decrease.", "A frequent concern is that NASA is being asked to do more than it can afford. This concern is not new. For example, when the Bush Administration announced the Vision for Space Exploration in 2004, it proposed little new funding to implement it. A widely discussed \"sand chart\" showed modest funding increases in FY2005 and FY2006, but otherwise projected a NASA budget out to FY2020 that increased only at about the rate of inflation. Because of the Vision's strong emphasis on human spaceflight, supporters of other NASA programs, especially science and aeronautics, feared that the Vision's funding needs would put the rest of the agency under great budget pressure. In early 2006, a former NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science testified:", "Two years ago, the President released his Vision for Space Exploration and provided a budget that would support it. In the intervening two years, the Administration has reduced this budget to the point where the plan is insupportable. Last year, aeronautics and technology suffered. This year, the Agency's science program is to be cannibalized, even though the NASA Administrator had promised not to transfer \"one thin dime\" from scientific exploration into human space flight.", "By 2009, the Augustine report concluded that executing NASA's plans would require an additional $3 billion per year, even with some schedule delays.", "The Augustine report's conclusions were a major impetus behind the passage of the 2010 NASA authorization act, but despite the changes in direction made by that act, concerns remain. Actual appropriations fell short of the authorized amounts without any major tasks being taken off NASA's agenda. In September 2012, the chairman of the NASA Advisory Council testified:", "As I look at NASA's response to the Authorization Act of 2010, I cannot escape the conclusion that the agency is being asked to do too much with too little. The act provides the agency with a clear set of goals and priorities. The Administration has provided another set of goals and priorities. These two sets of guidance are not dramatically dissimilar, but taken together they call for more than the agency can do with the budget it has.", "In May 2014, the NASA Inspector General testified that:", "We agree ... that, in effect, too many programs are chasing too few dollars at NASA.

After the final Apollo mission, the United States did not launch humans into space again until the first flight of the space shuttle in 1981. Following the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003, NASA limited use of the space shuttle to the flights necessary for construction of the International Space Station (ISS). The last space shuttle flight was completed in July 2011.

The intergovernmental agreement has the status of an executive agreement in the United States, but is considered a treaty in all the other partner countries. It is implemented through memoranda of understanding between NASA and its counterpart agencies: the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos), the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), and the European Space Agency (ESA).

One issue of interest to Congress is whether the research capacity of the ISS is being fully utilized. Another is how research associated directly with human spaceflight should be prioritized on the ISS, compared with research in other fields of science.", "In 2009, the Government Accountability Office identified several factors that might limit research use of the ISS: limited cargo capacity to carry research payloads to the ISS, a lack of funding to develop and launch experiments, limited crew time to conduct research, and the uncertain future of the ISS past 2015. Since that time, commercial ISS cargo flights have begun, and U.S. utilization of the ISS has been extended (see \" Crew and Cargo Access to the ISS \" and \" ISS Service Life Extension \" below). Funding and crew time, however, likely remain as challenges for increased research utilization. Since 2011, NASA has exceeded its goal of spending an average of 35 hours per week on scientific investigations. As of mid-FY2014, research facility occupancy was 60%. Although the ISS is designed to support a crew of up to seven astronauts, it currently operates with a maximum of six, so that the crew can be evacuated in an emergency using two Soyuz spacecraft (which carry a maximum of three each). If a seventh crew member could be added, that could potentially add about 33 hours of crew research time per week\u2014nearly double the current amount.", "The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 required NASA to allocate at least 15% of the funds budgeted for ISS research to \"life and microgravity science research that is not directly related to supporting the human exploration program.\" It also required NASA to submit a research plan for utilization of the ISS. Issued in June 2006, the plan described proposed R&D and utilization activities in each of six disciplinary areas. It characterized the ISS as a long-duration test-bed for future lunar missions; a flight analog for future missions to Mars; a laboratory for research directly related to human space exploration, such as human health countermeasures, fire suppression, and life support; and an opportunity to gain experience in managing international partnerships for long-duration space missions. The plan stated that research not related to human space exploration would continue \"at a reduced level.\"", "At about the same time, the National Research Council issued a review of NASA's plans for the ISS.

It concluded that NASA use of the ISS must continue to have first priority, that use by non-NASA entities should be funded by those entities, and that \"the availability of cost-effective transportation services will directly affect the ability of the ISS to operate as a national laboratory in the years to come.\" The impact of the national laboratory designation was initially unclear. In the NASA Authorization Act of 2008, Congress directed NASA to establish an advisory committee on the effective utilization of the ISS as a national laboratory.

The assessment considered four market segments: the space programs of other countries, private space tourism, applied research and technology development, and other uses, such as satellite servicing, media, entertainment, and education. NASA identified a likely market for crew transportation only in the first two of these segments. Over a 10-year period, the assessment anticipated a total non-NASA market for crew transportation of between 44 and 359 individuals. The low-end estimate was driven mostly by foreign space programs. The high-end estimate was driven more by private tourism. For comparison, the assessment projected that NASA's requirements for ISS crew rotation will include two flights per year with up to four astronauts per flight. This flight rate would mean a NASA market for a total of up to 40 individuals if the service became available in 2016 (one year earlier than now anticipated) and continued through 2020, the currently authorized end date for U.S. utilization of the ISS. If the same flight rate continued for the entire 10-year period of the analysis, it would mean a total NASA market of up to 80 individuals. The assessment emphasized that \"market demand is extremely difficult to assess.\"", "The perspectives of the providers differ. Boeing, although optimistic about the potential for non-NASA customers, is basing its plans primarily on the NASA market:", "There definitely is potential for a commercial market. It is in my view, not well defined, the depth of it is difficult to estimate, and so developing a business case that depends on it is a difficult thing. So we have chosen to develop a system that will be affordable if the only transportation that we do is government transportation to ISS.... In parallel, though, we are also working hard to develop a commercial market independent of that.", "SpaceX is more confident about the commercial potential: \"In ten years there will be more commercial ... manned flights to space than there will be government. I am quite confident of that.\"", "If in fact the primary market is two NASA flights per year to the ISS, some observers question whether that flight rate can support more than one provider. If there were only a single provider, that would cast doubt on the idea of reducing costs through competition.

A variant option would capture a large boulder from the surface of an asteroid, rather than an entire asteroid. NASA argues that the proposed ARM would provide a useful early destination for Orion and the SLS while at the same time meeting other goals for the science of asteroids and the demonstration of advanced technology. For example, a robotic spacecraft using new solar electric propulsion technology (which NASA is developing anyway, for other purposes) would be used to redirect the target asteroid's orbit.

SOFIA reached full operating capability in February 2014, and previous budgets envisioned 20 years of operations at a cost of about $85 million per year. According to NASA, however, \"because SOFIA development has taken much longer than originally envisioned ... the observatory will no longer provide the kind of scientific impact and synergies with other missions as once planned.\" Congress ultimately appropriated $70 million for SOFIA in FY2015 to maintain core operations. It directed NASA to \"continue to seek partners to restore SOFIA to its full operational level\" and stated that \"any science mission terminations should be made only after a senior review that evaluates the relative scientific benefit and return on investment.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Space Technology", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, both the Augustine committee and the NRC recommended a greater emphasis on technology development as a complement to NASA's human spaceflight activities.

Will these services be available by 2017, as planned? Is the demand for such services sufficient to support more than one competing provider? Are current NASA requirements and FAA regulations sufficient to ensure the safety of commercial spacecraft that carry crews? For human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, will the Orion and SLS spacecraft now in development be ready on schedule, and how should they be used when operational? Are their budgets sufficient to meet their schedules, and could budget increases accelerate their development? What lift capability should the SLS have? Are Orion and the SLS a realistic backup option for crew access to the International Space Station, if commercial services do not materialize? What destinations should be explored using these spacecraft, once they are operational? Is the proposed Asteroid Redirect Mission a good choice of destination for the first crewed flight? How will the needs of the human spaceflight program affect resources for NASA's science missions, aeronautics research, and education programs? In a time of declining budgets and fiscal uncertainty, how should NASA and Congress balance these competing priorities? What is the appropriate level of NASA support for Earth science, planetary science, and other scientific fields? Should the share of Earth science in NASA's overall science portfolio continue to expand? How would proposed reductions in funding for planetary science, including near-term reductions in funding for robotic Mars exploration, affect the field in the longer term? How should NASA and Congress respond to concerns about the threat of collisions with near-Earth objects such as asteroids? In general, is NASA being asked to do more than it can afford?
