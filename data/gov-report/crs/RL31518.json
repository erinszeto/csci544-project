The term \"human capital\" refers to \"a concept that views employees as assets in thesame sense as financial capital ... [and] presupposes that an investment in human potential will yieldsignificant returns for the organization.\" (1) Humancapital also \"describe[s] what an organizationgains from the loyalty, creativity, effort, accomplishments, and productivity of its employees.\" (2) Theeconomist Lester C. Thurow defined human capital as:", "an individual's productive skills, talents, and knowledge. It is measured in terms of the value (price multiplied by quantity) of goods and servicesproduced. Since consumption is the ultimate goal of our economic system, the value of a man'scapital is the same as the value of the consumption goods and services which he directly or indirectlyproduces. When the value of goods and services rises, the value of human capital rises. When thevalue of goods and services falls, the value of human capital falls. (3)", "To the General Accounting Office (GAO), human capital is \"an organization's people,\" \"its most critical asset in managing for results,\" and \"assets to be valued.\" (4) In January 2001, GAO addedstrategic human capital management to its list of high-risk areas in the federal government. According to GAO, human capital challenges met the three criteria for high risk: they \"are evidentat multiple agencies\"; they \"affect a significant portion of the government's total budget or otherresources\"; and they \"should be monitored and addressed through individual agency actions as wellas through OMB [Office of Management and Budget] and OPM [Office of Personnel Management]initiatives, legislative action, and/or congressional oversight.\" GAO found that federal workforcereductions were conducted without sufficient planning for their effects on agency performance. Agencies also reduced investments in performance rewards, enabling technologies, and training andprofessional development programs. GAO also determined that many agencies anticipate rapidturnover of top leadership and managers. About 45% of the career Senior Executive Service willbecome eligible to retire by FY2005 and are expected to retire. (5)", "In a January 2003 update of the high risk designation, GAO acknowledged the administration's placement of strategic management of human capital at the top of the President's managementagenda and the authority for a new personnel system and additional governmentwide personnelflexibilities enacted in P.L. 107-296 , the Homeland Security Act of 2002. \"Nevertheless, despitebuilding momentum for comprehensive and systematic reforms,\" according to GAO, \"[t]he basicproblem, which continues today, has been the long-standing lack of a consistent strategic approachto marshaling, managing, and maintaining the human capital needed to maximize governmentperformance and assure its accountability.... [T]he problem is a set of policies that are viewed bymany as outdated, overregulated, and not strategic.\" (6)", "As the 106th Congress was drawing to a close, the then-chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Senator Fred Thompson, and the then-chairman of the Senate Subcommitteeon Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia, SenatorGeorge Voinovich, published committee and subcommittee reports that included recommendationsto address challenges in managing the federal government and its human capital, given the possibilitythat a significant number of federal employees would be eligible to retire by 2004. (7)", "The Administration of President George W. Bush submitted a legislative proposal entitled The Managerial Flexibility Act of 2001 to Congress on October 15, 2001. OMB described the proposalas \"a key component of the Bush Administration's 'Freedom to Manage' initiative ... to eliminatelegal barriers to effective management.\" (8) Theproposal included provisions on personnelmanagement flexibilities, including voluntary separation incentive payments, voluntary earlyretirement, recruitment and retention bonuses and relocation allowances, academic degrees, theSenior Executive Service, personnel management demonstration projects, and direct hire.", "Provisions similar to those in the President's proposal were part of legislation to change various policies related to managing the federal workforce that were considered in the Senate and the Houseof Representatives in the 107th Congress. Senator Voinovich introduced S. 1603 , theFederal Human Capital Act of 2001, on October 31, 2001, and S. 1639 , the FederalEmployee Management Reform Act of 2001, on November 6, 2001. Senator Thompson introduced S. 1612 , the Managerial Flexibility Act of 2001, on November 1, 2001. (9) The bills werereferred to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. The committee's Subcommittee onInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services conducted two days of hearings on thelegislation on March 18 and 19, 2002, taking testimony from the Office of Personnel Management,the General Accounting Office, employee organizations, and several scholars who have studiedfederal workforce issues. (10) RepresentativeConstance Morella introduced H.R. 4580 ,the Good People, Good Government Act, on April 24, 2002, and it was referred to the HouseCommittee on Government Reform.", "Senator Daniel Akaka, chairman of the subcommittee, said that the hearings \"continue[d] the dialogue on what needs to be done to make government service more attractive to young people andto inspire and compensate those who have chosen government as their job choice.\" He stated that\"[t]here must be a commitment from the highest levels of government and a willingness to allocatethe resources necessary to achieve a strong and vibrant workforce.\" (11) During his testimony beforethe subcommittee on March 19, 2002, Paul C. Light of the Brookings Institution noted that \"[p]astefforts to restore the luster of federal service have been hampered by a lack of interest in incrementalaction.\" He commented that the pending legislation \"would clearly increase government's ability tocompete for talent\" and should be \"viewed as first, not final, steps in what will ultimately amountto an historic restructuring of the federal government's human capital system.\" (12)", "Following the Senate committee hearings, Senator Voinovich, joined by Senators Fred Thompson and Thad Cochran, revised some of the provisions in S. 1603 and S. 1639 , as introduced, and merged them into one bill, S. 2651 , the FederalWorkforce Improvement Act of 2002, introduced on June 20, 2002. Several of the S. 2651 provisions, including those on agency Chief Human Capital Officers, alternative ranking andselection procedures, voluntary separation incentive payments, the repeal of recertificationrequirements for the Senior Executive Service, academic degree training, and modifications to theNational Security Education Program, were enacted in P.L. 107-296 , The Homeland Security Actof 2002, signed by President George Bush on November 25, 2002, and are applicablegovernment-wide.

OPM regulations could prescribe a minimumservice period. The service agreement would include the length of the required service period; theamount of the bonus; the method of payment; and other terms and conditions under which the bonuswould be payable, including the conditions under which the agreement could be terminated beforethe service period had been completed, and the effect of the termination. The agreement would beeffective upon employment with the agency or movement to a new position or geographic area, asapplicable. A service agreement for a recruitment bonus could be effective at a later date undercircumstances that OPM would describe in regulations, such as an initial period of formal basictraining (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754a(c) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5753(c)).", "Limitations on, Payment, and Nature of Bonus.

A bonus could be paid as an initial lump sum, in installments, as a final lump sum uponcompletion of the full service period, or in a combination of these forms.

Therefore,if S. 129 as passed by the Senate were enacted, agencies would be able to use the currentlaw provisions on retention allowances at 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754 and the enhanced authority for retentionbonuses proposed at 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b. S. 129 would amend current law by renaming theallowances as bonuses.", "Reason for Paying Bonuses. Current law authorizes allowances for employees whose unusually high or unique qualifications or the agency'sspecial need for their services makes it essential to retain them. Additionally, the agency mustdetermine that the employee would be likely to leave in the absence of an allowance. S. 129 would add, as another reason for paying the bonuses, an agency determination that, in theabsence of a bonus, an employee would likely leave federal service or take a different federalposition under conditions which OPM would describe in regulations (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(b) and 5U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(b)).", "Eligible Employees. Current law (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(a)) authorizes allowances for General Schedule (GS) employees. S. 129 wouldprovide that the bonuses would be paid only to employees covered by the GS pay system (except asdiscussed under \"extending coverage to other employees\" below) (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(d) and 5 U.S.C.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(a)(1)(A)). The bills would add new text (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(c) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(c)) toprovide that OPM could authorize an agency head to pay retention bonuses to a group of employeesin one or more categories of positions in one or more geographic areas, subject to 5 U.S.C.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(b)(1) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(b)(1), and regulations, if there were a high risk that a significantportion of employees in the group would be likely to leave in the absence of bonuses.", "Service Agreement. Currently, a service agreement is not required for payment of a retention allowance. S. 129 would providethat the employee would have to enter into a written service agreement to complete a period ofemployment with the agency. The service agreement would include the length of the requiredservice period; the amount of the bonus; the method of payment; and other terms and conditionsunder which the bonus would be payable, including the conditions under which the agreement couldbe terminated before completion of the service period and the effect of the termination. A writtenservice agreement would not be required if the retention bonus were paid in biweekly installmentswith the payment set at the full bonus percentage rate established for the employee with no portionof the bonus deferred. In this case, if the agency decided to terminate the payments, the agencywould inform the employee in writing of that decision. Except as OPM would provide inregulations, the employee would continue to be paid the bonus through the end of the pay period inwhich the notice would be provided. A bonus could not be based on any period of service which wasthe basis for a recruitment or relocation bonus (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(e) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(d)).", "Limitations on Payment and Nature of Bonus. Current law limits the allowance to 25% of the annual basic pay rate (excluding locality pay) and provides for payment at the same time and in the same manner as basic pay. The allowance is notpart of basic pay. Any action to reduce or eliminate the allowance is not appealable. S. 129 would amend current law by providing that a retention bonus would be stated as a percentageof the employee's basic pay for the service period associated with the bonus, and could not exceed25% of the employee's basic pay if paid to the employee individually or 10% of the employee's basicpay if paid to the employee as part of a group. A bonus could be paid in installments aftercompletion of specified periods of service or in a single lump sum at the end of the full period ofservice required by the agreement. An installment payment could not exceed the product derivedby multiplying the amount of basic pay earned in the installment period by a percentage not toexceed the bonus percentage rate established for the employee. If the installment paymentpercentage were less than the bonus percentage rate, the accrued but unpaid portion of the bonuswould be payable as part of the final installment payment after completion of the full service periodunder the terms of the service agreement (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(f) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(e)).", "As in current law, a retention bonus would not be part of an employee's basic pay. The current 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(b)(2) provision stating that reduction or elimination of the allowance is notappealable would be deleted.", "Waiver of the Limitation. S. 129 would provide that OPM, upon request of an agency head, could waive the 25% or 10% limitationsand permit the agency head to pay bonuses of up to 50% of basic pay based on a critical agency need(5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(g) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(f)).", "Plans for Paying Bonuses. The bill provides that OPM regulations would require that agencies establish a plan for paying retention bonuses beforepaying such bonuses (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(h) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(g)).", "Regulations. Current law authorizes OPM to prescribe regulations. S. 129 and H.R. 1601 would continue the policy (5U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(i) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(h)).", "Extending Coverage to Other Employees. Current law authorizes the President to apply the section to employees otherwise not covered. S. 129 would amend current law by providing that OPM could extend coverage tocategories of employees who otherwise would not be covered at the request of the head of anexecutive agency (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(j)(1) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(a)(1)(B)).", "Political Appointees Not Eligible for Bonuses. A bonus could not be paid to an individual appointed by the President, by and with the advice andconsent of the Senate; a noncareer appointee position in the Senior Executive Service (SES); or aposition which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential,policy-making, or policy-advocating character (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(j)(2) and 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754(a)(2)). According to staff of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the current authority at 5U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754 allows political appointees to be eligible for retention allowances. This provisionwould exclude political appointees from being eligible for the enhanced retention bonuses authorizedin S. 129 .", "Reporting Requirement. OPM would submit to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Reforman annual report on bonuses paid. Under the House version, the annual report would be submittedfor each of the first five years that bonuses were paid. Under the Senate version, each report wouldinclude each agency's use of recruitment and relocation bonuses, including, with respect to eachagency and each type of bonus, the number and amount of bonuses by grade, including GeneralSchedule, SES, and Executive Schedule positions. Under the House version, each report wouldinclude a description of how the authority to pay retention bonuses was used by the respectiveagencies, including, with respect to each such agency, the number and dollar amount of bonuses paidto individuals holding positions within each pay grade, pay level, or other pay classification; and ifapplicable, how the authority was used to prevent individuals from moving between positions thatwere in different agencies but the same geographic area (including the names of the agenciesinvolved). The report also would include a determination of the extent to which such bonusesfurthered the purposes of the statute authorizing them (5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754b(k) and Section 101(c)).", "The House version at Section 101(a)(3) also includes a provision which would provide that it is the sense of Congress that the OPM Director would, each time a bonus was paid to recruit orrelocate a federal employee from one government agency to another within the same geographic areaor to retain a federal employee who might otherwise leave one government agency for another withinthe same geographic area, be notified of that payment within 60 days after the date on which thebonus was paid. The OPM Director would monitor the payment of such bonuses to ensure that theywere an effective use of the federal government's funds and had not adversely affected the abilityof those government agencies that lost employees to other government agencies (in suchcircumstances) to carry out their missions.", "Applying the Statute.

The section analysis which accompanied S. 2651 (107th Congress)stated that the changes would enable agencies to use the bonuses \"in more strategic ways thatenhance their desired effect\" and \"help federal agencies be more competitive in recruiting andretaining\" the workforces they require. (30)", "By including a more specific service requirement for receipt of recruitment and relocation bonuses and by adding such a service requirement for receipt of retention bonuses, agencies wouldmore directly tie an employee's service to the bonus payments. The amendments do not addressagency funding of the bonuses, as Colleen M. Kelley of the National Treasury Employees Union(NTEU) commented during her testimony before the Senate subcommittee hearing. \"As thisCommittee knows, federal agencies have a wealth of flexibilities available to them,\" she said, but:", "Unfortunately, in December of 1999, [OPM] reported that overall, only 0.14% of all Executive Branch employees received recruitment, retention orrelocation incentives in Fiscal Year 1998. Recruitment bonuses were given 0.3% of the time. Relocation bonuses were given to 1.0% of employees and 0.09% of employees received retentionallowances. Less than 1/4 of 1% of the federal workforce received any form of recruitment, retentionor relocation incentive in Fiscal Year 1998. When agencies were asked why they did not use theincentives available to them, more often than not, they cited budgetary constraints. Agencies simplyare not being given the resources necessary to fund the very programs and incentives that mightactually help put them on the road to solving their human capital crises .... Expanding the availabilityof these incentives makes little sense if agencies are not provided with the resources to accomplishthe goal. And with agencies slated to receive a 1% reduction in their discretionary spending accountsfor 2003, it is difficult to see how increasing and expanding recruitment and retention allowanceswill in any way translate into more of these flexibilities actually being offered to either prospectiveor current federal employees. (31)", "Ms. Kelley, in testifying before the April 8, 2003 joint subcommittee hearing, emphasized the critical importance of the committee ensuring \"that appropriate funding will be forthcoming beforegiving false hope to agencies that additional bonus options are available to them.\" (32) She reiteratedthis view at the House subcommittee hearing. (33)", "Expressing his views before the Senate subcommittee on March 18, 2002, Bobby L. Harnage, Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), reiteratedthose of Ms. Kelley and commented: \"Implicitly, the assumption appears to be that bonus paymentsto select individuals would be paid from existing salary accounts. That is, agencies would only beable to use the broadened authority in the draft proposal to provide bonuses if they paid for themthrough the elimination of jobs or the denial of other salary adjustments for those not selected fora bonus.\" He stated the opinion that limiting the bonuses to General Schedule employees ignores the\"equally acute\" human capital crisis affecting blue collar workers under the Federal Wage System. Finally, Mr. Harnage observed that \"Bonuses of any size are not a replacement for competitivesalaries and benefits.\" (34) Mr. Harnage expressedsimilar viewpoints at the April 8, 2003 jointsubcommittee hearing and questioned the lack of \"a separate, supplemental funding mechanism foreither the payment of bonuses, or the expansion of critical pay authority\" in S. 129 and H.R. 1601 .

(39) At thesame hearing, John Gage of AFGE stated that theproposed legislation does not provide funding for the bonuses and questioned whether such bonuseswould improve recruitment and retention. According to him, \"Bonus payments do not count as basicpay for purposes of retirement or other salary adjustments\" and \"[t]hey are a poor substitute for ...competitive salaries and regular salary increases.\" (40) Mr. Gage also expressed views similar to thosestated by Colleen Kelley of NTEU at the Senate subcommittee hearing discussed above.

TheSenate version of the provision would authorize an agency head to deem \"a period of qualifiednon-federal career experience\" as \"a period of service performed as an employee\" for the purposeof annual leave accrual.
