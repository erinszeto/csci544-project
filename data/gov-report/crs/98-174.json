It wouldcontinue the requirement for the yearly International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) detailing theperformance of individual countries, and it wouldadd the requirement to report on major drug trafficking organizations. It would also amend the Foreign NarcoticsKingpin Designation Act to allow judicialreview of executive branch decisions to freeze the assets of suspected drug kingpins.", "The conference report on the Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2002 ( H.Rept. 107-345 on H.R. 2506 ) was filed on December 19, 2001, andcontained, in Section 591, major elements of the Senate-passed provisions modifying the annual drug certificationprocedures. This section provides that the drugcertification procedures in Section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act would not apply during FY2002, essentiallyproviding a one-year waiver of the procedureson a global basis for all major drug-transit and drug producing countries. However, the President is required tomake a report within 45 days of enactmentidentifying the major drug transit and drug producing countries. He is also required to designate each such countrythat has failed demonstrably, during theprevious 12 months, to make substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international counter-narcoticsagreements (multilateral and bilateral) and otherstandards. U.S. assistance would be withheld from any of the designated worst offending countries, unless thePresident determines that the provision ofassistance is vital to the national interest of the United States, or until the designated country makes substantialcounter-narcotics efforts. In addition, the sectionclarifies that the President's obligation to make the yearly International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR)detailing the performance of all drug-transitand drug producing countries by March 1 remains in force.", "Although some Members in each house criticized this provision as a weakening of the drug certification procedures when it was approved by the House onDecember 19, 2001, and by the Senate on December 20, 2001, a letter from the State Department characterized theprovision as a \"significant first step towardimproving the current narcotics certification process\" that \"would place a premium on cooperation rather thanconfrontation with other governments.\" Themeasure was signed into law ( P.L. 107-115 ) by President Bush on January 10, 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Action in 2002: Permanent New Requirements Enacted, But Previous Procedures Still Available", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, Congress continued to move toward adoption of new requirements relating to drug producing and drugtransit countries.

The HouseInternational Relations Committee hadreported out H.R. 1646 on May 4, 2001, without any provisions on drug certification, and the measure was passed by the House on May 16, 2001. The Senate approved H.R. 1646 on May 1, 2002, after incorporating the text of a Senate measure on securityassistance ( S. 1803 )approved in December 2001.", "Drawing from S. 1401 , mentioned above, which was reported out by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 4, 2001, the conferencereport on H.R. 1646 establishes new drug certification and designation procedures in Section 706. Thissection requires the President to make areport, not later than September 15 of each year, identifying the major drug transit or major illicit drug producingcountries. At the same time the President isrequired to designate any of the named countries that has \"failed demonstrably,\" during the previous 12 months, tomake substantial efforts to adhere tointernational counter-narcotics agreements (defined in the legislation) and to take other identified counter-narcoticsmeasures.

Notwithstanding the general suspension of the previous drugcertification and sanctions procedures, subsection706(5)(B) provides that the President may apply those procedures at his discretion. A transition rule provides thatfor FY2003, the required report must besubmitted at least 15 days before foreign assistance funds are obligated or expended.

It also permits the President to use his discretion to maintain a higherstandard and to withhold assistance and applyother sanctions against countries that are failing to cooperate fully with the United States in counter-narcotics effortswhenever he determines that such actionswould be helpful.
