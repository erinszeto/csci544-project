Under thisinformal custom, the Senate would refuse to confirm a nomination unless the nominee had beenapproved by the home-state Senators of the President's party. The Senate Committee on theJudiciary created the blue slip (so called because of its color) out of this practice in the early 1900s. Initially, the blue slip permitted Senators, regardless of party affiliation, to voice their opinion on aPresident's nomination to a district court in their state or to a circuit court judgeship traditionallyappointed from their home state. Over the years, the blue slip has evolved into a tool used bySenators to delay, and often times prevent, the confirmation of nominees they find objectionable. The following six periods highlight the major changes that various chairmen of the JudiciaryCommittee undertook in their blue-slip policy:", "From 1917 through 1955: The blue-slip policy allowed home-state Senatorsto state their objections but committee action to move forward on a nomination. If a Senatorobjected to his/her home-state nominee, the committee would report the nominee adversely to theSenate, where the contesting Senator would have the option of stating his/her objections to thenominee before the Senate would vote on confirmation.", "From 1956 through 1978: A single home-state Senator could stop allcommittee action on a judicial nominee by either returning a negative blue slip or failing to returna blue slip to the committee.", "From 1979 to mid-1989: A home-state Senator's failure to return a blue slipwould not necessarily prevent committee action on a nominee.", "From mid-1989 through June 5, 2001: In a public letter (1989) on thecommittee's blue-slip policy, the chairman wrote that one negative blue slip would be \"a significantfactor to be weighed\" but would \"not preclude consideration\" of a nominee \"unless theAdministration has not consulted with both home state Senators.\" The committee would take noaction, regardless of presidential consultation, if both home-state Senators returned negative blueslips.", "From June 6, 2001, to 2003: The chairman's blue-slip policy allowedmovement on a judicial nominee only if both home-state Senators returned positive blue slips to thecommittee. If one home-state Senator returned a negative blue slip, no further action would be takenon the nominee.", "2003: A return of a negative blue slip by one or both home-state Senators doesnot prevent the committee from moving forward with the nomination -- provided that theAdministration has engaged in pre-nomination consultation with both of the home-stateSenators.", "The blue-slip process has been the subject of growing scholarly and legal debate; a selectedlist of reading material is included at the end of this report.", "This report will be updated to reflect future blue-slip policy developments."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Judiciary Committee's blue-slip policy has been a central component in its confirmationof judicial nominations.

If, however,the Senator had some objection to the nominee and wanted to prevent confirmation, he/she coulddecide not to return the blue slip or return it with a negative response. Over the years, the blue-slippolicy has been modified to prevent a single Senator from having such absolute power over the fateof home-state judicial nominees. Today, a blue slip can stop a judicial nomination only if bothhome-state Senators return a negative blue slip and then only if the President has failed to consultwith the home-state Senators.", "This report provides a history of the Judiciary Committee blue-slip custom, a practice whichemanated from the chamber's tradition of senatorial courtesy.

Sometimes called \"the courtesy of the Senate,\" the practice is a customary one and notalways adhered to. A senator sometimes invokes the custom by declaring that the nominee ispersonally obnoxious or personally objectionable to him.", "... [The Senate] also usually complies with a senator'srequest for a temporary delay in considering a nomination, a request that is referred to as a hold. (4)", "The concept of senatorial courtesy goes beyond the confines of the Senate and, at times,represents the courtesy a President extends, or arguably should extend, to Senators. Politicalscientist Harold Chase describes the political ramifications of this Senate tradition:", "Senators, whether chosen by state legislatures, as theywere at an earlier time, or by the voters of the state, must continuously nurture their political supportback home; that is, if they hope for additional terms in office -- and it is a rare senator who does not. In this connection, senators from the First Congress on have recognized that one or two senatorshave a much greater stake in a particular appointment than others. It is, of course, exceedinglyhelpful to a senator to be able to reward supporters with good posts in the federal government. Conversely, it is enormously damaging to a senator's prestige if a president of his own party ignoreshim when it comes to making an appointment from or to the senator's own state. What is even moredamaging to a senator's prestige and political power is for the president to appoint to high federaloffice someone who is known back home as a political opponent to the senator. It was easy forsenators to see that if they joined together against the president to protect their individual interestsin appointments, they could to a large degree assure that the president could only make suchappointments as would be palatable to them as individuals. Out of such considerations grew thecustom of senatorial courtesy.

Blue slips have been employed to blocknominations in one of two ways, depending on the preferences of the Judiciary chairman. Judicialnominations have been blocked by a Senator either returning a negative blue slip or failing to returna blue slip altogether. Over the years, there have been various modifications to these basic practices.", "In the case of U.S. district court nominations, (9) once a nomination is referred to the Judiciary Committee, thecounsel for the committee will send a blue slip (so called because of its color) to each Senator of thenominee's home state, regardless of party affiliation. The Senator may then return the blue slip tothe Judiciary Committee with comments on the particular nominee in question. In most cases, theblue slip is considered to be a pro forma gesture and will be given a positive review by the Senator;however, in a select number of cases a negative review may occur.", "For U.S. circuit court nominations, the process is similar. The Judiciary Committee will giveblue slips only to the Senators of the retiring judge's home state. This tradition comes from thepractice of reserving circuit court positions for each state to ensure proportional or equal staterepresentation for each circuit. (10) The President is often effectively required by this tradition toselect a circuit court nominee from the state of the retiring judge.", "If a negative blue slip is received, the chairman may take the following actions on thenominee: (1) stop all committee proceedings; (2) move forward but give added weight to theunfavorable review; or (3) proceed without notice of the negative review. Since the late 1970s, thecommittee has generally used the latter two actions when dealing with a negative blue slip.", "The precise date on which the Judiciary Committee first used the blue-slip procedure is notknown. The committee has not made the blue slip part of its official rules for more than 30years, (11) and this is stillthe case in the 108th Congress. (12) From research conducted at the National Archives, evidencesuggests that the blue-slip procedure began sometime in the mid- to late 1910s under thechairmanship of Senator Charles A. Culberson of Texas. (13) ", "This impression is based on the appearance of the first known blue slip in the 65th Congress(1917-1918). At the time, Senator Culberson was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a capacityhe served in from the 63rd through the 66th Congresses (1913-1919). The documentary evidence ofthis time period suggests that Senator Culberson may have created the blue slip. From the 65thCongress onward almost every judicial nominee's file includes a blue slip. Prior to this time(56th-64th Congresses), the files of judicial nominees reveal no evidence of blue slips.", "Judiciary Committee materials at the National Archives do not provide a specific explanationfor the creation of the blue slip; however, they may help illuminate its early history. For instance,although the White House and the Senate were controlled by the Democratic Party, there wasperiodic tension between the two branches, and this condition may have been a factor in the blueslip's creation. (14) ", "Of particular interest is the creation of blue slips at the same time as the adoption of SenateRule XXII in 1917, which permits Senators to end a filibuster by invoking cloture. (15) Despite this apparentcoincidence, a direct link between the creation of the blue slip and the cloture rule can be dispelled,because Senate Rule XXII did not apply to judicial nominations until 1949. In that year, S.Res.15 modified Senate Rule XXII from, \"to bring to a close the debate upon any pendingmeasure is presented to the Senate ...\" to the following: \"to bring to a close the debate upon anymeasure, motion, or other matter pending before the Senate.\" (16) Therefore, the JudiciaryCommittee did not need to create a blue-slip policy as a result of the 1917 Senate rule becausecloture at that time did not apply to filibusters on judicial nominations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Structure of the Blue Slip (1917-2003)", "paragraphs": ["The basic structure of the blue slip has not changed substantially in the 86 years since itscreation.

We are confident that meaningfulconsultation can occur without reducing the role prerogatives of either branch of government, andin a way which more fully informs the President of other points of view prior to rather than after anomination is made. (48)", "Chairman Hatch went on to state that he had \"sent a letter to the White House counsel ...which clearly explains this policy.\" (49) In that letter, he laid out five circumstances that would promptthe Judiciary Committee to delay or hold up a nomination:", "(1) failure to give serious consideration to individualsproposed by home state Senators as possible nominees;", "(2) failure to identify to home state Senators and theJudiciary Committee an individual the President is considering nominating with enough time toallow the Senator to provide meaningful feedback before any formal clearance (i.e., by the ABA orFBI) on the prospective nominee is initiated;", "(3) after having identified the name of an individual thePresident is considering nominating, failure to (a) seek a home state Senator's feedback, includingany objections the Senator may have to the prospective nominee, at least two weeks before anyformal clearances are initiated, and (b) give that feedback seriousconsideration;", "(4) failure to notify a home state Senator, and theJudiciary Committee, that formal clearance on a prospective nominee is being initiated despite theSenator's objections; and", "(5) failure to notify home state Senators, and theJudiciary Committee, before a nomination is actually made, that the President will nominate anindividual. (50) ", "A little over three months after the start of President George W. Bush's administration,several reports surfaced that Chairman Hatch was planning to modify his blue-slip policy. (51) News reports were basedon two Judiciary Committee meetings. The first, held on April 5, 2001, was a confirmation hearingon the nominations of Larry D. Thompson to be Deputy Attorney General and Theodore B. Olsonto be Solicitor General of the United States. After the question and answer period, in response toa question concerning the selection process by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Chairman Hatch statedwhat his blue-slip policy would be under President Bush. (52) ", "Chairman Hatch began by stating that he would institute the same policy that \"I had askedthe Clinton Administration to follow,\" (53) which was based on the 1989 Biden letter to President Bush andhis own 1995 letter to White House Counsel Abner Mikva. Chairman Hatch went on to describe andquote these letters in detail:", "Senator Biden's letter explained the return of a negativeblue slip ordinarily does not preclude consideration of a judicial nominee, but is given substantialweight by the Committee in its evaluation of the nominee. Senator Biden also emphasized theimportance of pre-nomination consultation by the administration, with home state Senators, stressinghis belief, that, quote, \"The nomination process will function more effectively if consultation is takenseriously,\" unquote. Thus, as Senator Biden also wrote, quote, \"If such good-faith consultation hasnot taken place, the Judiciary Committee will treat the return of a negative blue slip by a home stateSenator as dispositive and the nominee will not be considered,\" unquote. (54)", "Chairman Hatch stressed the pre-nomination consultation component of the blue slips and went onto note, \"the Senate expects genuine good faith consultation by the administration with home stateSenators before a judicial nomination is made, and the administration's failure to consult in genuinegood faith with both home state Senators itself is grounds for a Senator's return of a negative blueslip.\" Thus, \"[w]here the administration has failed to provide good faith pre-nominationconsultation, a negative blue slip is treated as dispositive and precludes Committee considerationof a judicial nominee.\" (55) Chairman Hatch warned that \"if any of our colleagues here wantto veto the President's constitutional prerogative to make his appointments with the advice andconsent of the Senate, that is a different matter, and one which I think diverges from the policy ofthis Committee since as far back as I can remember, and that is 25 years, since Senator Kennedy wasChairman of this committee.\" (56) ", "Senator Richard J. Durbin questioned the policy laid out by Chairman Hatch. Senator Durbinbegan by stating that \"[t]he practice that has been followed in the 4 years that I have been in theSenate is different than what you have just described. In that time, one Senator could stop a nomineefrom a state.\" Moreover, he added, that \"there have also been times when members of the SenateJudiciary Committee, not even from the same state as the nominee, could stop a nomination.\" (57) ", "Chairman Hatch responded to Senator Durbin's concerns. The discussion did not, however,settle the questions over the committee's blue-slip policy. The exchange ended with theunderstanding that the blue-slip policy would be discussed by the entire Judiciary Committee laterthat month.", "The subsequent meeting, held in executive session on April 24, 2001, reportedly focused onthe concerns Senator Durbin and other Democratic Senators had relating to the JudiciaryCommittee's blue-slip policy. However, neither side was able to come to an agreement on what thecommittee's blue-slip policy had been or what blue-slip policy would be followed in the 107thCongress. Reportedly, during this meeting, Chairman Hatch asserted that \"his policy has alwaysbeen that a negative blue slip from a single senator should be given great weight, but should notautomatically block a nomination.\" (58) ", "Democratic Senators were reportedly alarmed, stating that it was \"an unfair change in [theblue slip] policy.\" (59) Part of the problem in reaching a compromise was that Democratic Senators claimed that ChairmanHatch had allowed individual Senators to use a blue slip to prevent nominees from being confirmedduring the Clinton Administration. For example, the CQ Daily Monitor reported that \"Jesse Helms,R-N.C., used the 'blue slip' to block Clinton's nominees to the bench in his state even when they hadthe approval of Democrat John Edwards.\" (60) ", "Chairman Hatch scheduled another committee meeting on May 3, 2001. However, newsreports stated that the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee \"walked out of\" the meetingbecause \"they [were] being shut out of the judicial nominations process.\" (61) Both parties held newsconferences shortly after to state their position on the matter of blue slips.", "At the Democratic news conference, Senator Leahy said that Chairman Hatch had changedthe blue-slip policy in place during the Clinton Administration. (62) Senator Leahy read an oldversion of Chairman Hatch's blue slip: \"No further proceedings on this nominee will be scheduleduntil both blue slips have been returned by the nominee's home-state senators.\" (63) Senator Leahy went onto assert, \"this was the Republican policy when there was a Democratic president. It should be thesame policy with a Republican president.\" (64) ", "Chairman Hatch, at the Republican news conference held the same day, answered theDemocratic Senators' assertions by stating, \"As I confirmed in two letters to the White House in 1995and 1997, during my tenure as chairman, I continued as a matter of practice and policy to follow thecommittee's blue slip policy of my predecessor, Joe Biden.\" (65) That policy, ChairmanHatch stated, was a continuation of Senator Kennedy's blue-slip policy, which was \"[a] withholdingof a blue slip or a denial of a blue slip or a negative blue slip will have great weight, but it will notbe dispositive.\" (66) Chairman Hatch continued by stating that the change in blue-slip policy occurred in 1998:", "[W]hen we had a conflict between two Republicansenators, and I sent a message to them through the blue slip policy and changed it to the point -- and,by the way, in 1998 we were getting zero -- zero -- consultations with the Clinton White House. Isent them a letter saying this is serious problem, and I made it very clear that we couldn't put up withit. And because of the conflict with the two Republican senators, we changed the policy to theconsent of -- to require the blue slips from both, but mainly because of the lack of consultation....\" (67) Chairman Hatch defended the 1998 change in the blue-slip policy by stating, \"I agreed to follow thepolicy of Biden up till that point [1998], and I still followed it after that point, except for those wherethere was no consultation, and even then would not allow just one senator to stop a nominee.\" (68)", "(69)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "June 6, 2001, to the End of the 107th Congress", "paragraphs": ["On June 6, 2001, Senator Leahy took over as Judiciary chairman.

This letter, sent to Gonzales over amonth before Senator Leahy became chair of the committee, endorsed the 1997 blue-slip policystatement \"made by Chairman Hatch.\" As the letter notes, \"the Administration [should] undertaketo incorporate the following consultative procedures into its selection, vetting and nominatingprocesses\":", "1.

(70)", "Although Senator Leahy's statement was a further refinement of Senator Hatch's policyregarding blue slips in terms of consultation, it was reported that Senator Leahy would follow adifferent policy than Senator Hatch's. For example, the CQ Daily Monitor reported that ChairmanLeahy indicated he \"probably will return to the practice of moving ahead with a nomination onlywith approving 'blue slips' from both senators representing the nominee's home state.\" (71) This report was supportedlater on June 6, 2001, when CQ Weekly reported that, in an interview, Chairman Leahy identifiedhis blue-slip policy: \"unless he is satisfied that both senators from the home state of a nominee havebeen consulted by the Bush administration, a nomination will not move.\" (72) ", "News reports claim that Chairman Leahy not only adhered to the policy stated on June 6,2001, but went further. (73) These reports indicated that Chairman Leahy permitted MichiganDemocratic Senators Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow to not only block nominations of fellowMichiganders to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, but all nominations to that Circuit. (74) The Legal Times cited anAugust 6, 2001 letter written to Chairman Leahy by Senators Levin and Stabenow asking thechairman to \"halt all movement on any nominations to the 6th Circuit.\" (75) Reportedly, SenatorsLevin and Stabenow \"used their blue slips to block confirmation\" of two Sixth Circuit nominations,Jeffrey Sutton of Ohio and Deborah Cook of Ohio, during the 107th Congress. (76) ", "Also during the 107th Congress, Chairman Leahy, along with Ranking Member Hatch, agreedto a fundamental change to the blue-slip system. Under their agreement the blue slips would \"betreated as public information.\" (77) The two Senators stated: \"[w]e both believe that such opennessin the confirmation process will benefit the Judiciary Committee and the Senate as a whole.\" Inorder to confirm continuance of this new reform, both Senators also agreed that \"this policy ofopenness with regard to 'blue slips' and the blue slip process will continue in the future, regardlessof who is Chairman or which party is in the majority in the Senate.\" (78) This agreement wasadhered to, and continues, with blue slips publicly available on the Office of Legal Policywebsite.

(82) The hearing marked thefirst time in the 108th Congress that the Judiciary Committee moved forward with a nominationwithout the support of both home-state Senators: (83) Senator Dianne Feinstein of California had returned a blue slipto the committee. (84) The Kuhl nomination appears to represent a significant change in the blue slip policies betweenChairman Leahy in the 107th Congress and Chairman Hatch in the 108th Congress. During the 107thCongress, Chairman Leahy required both blue slips to be returned, which meant that no action wastaken on Kuhl's nomination.

Blue-slip policy has undergonevarious changes in its 86-year history. The blue slip started out as a way for the Judiciary Committeechairman to gain information on a judicial nomination. From 1917 to 1956, the blue slip providedhome-state Senators with a means of notifying the chairman if the President selected an individualwho was personally objectionable to them. A negative blue slip did not stop committee action. Untilthe mid-1950s, other Senators would reject a nomination on the Senate floor if the home-stateSenator would stand and state that the nominee was \"personally obnoxious.\" Eventually, the blueslip evolved from an informal committee device once used to gain information on a nominee to animportant device for checking the executive branch in the appointment process.", "Since 1979, the impact of negative blue slips has varied as leadership in the SenateCommittee on the Judiciary has changed. Some chairmen have permitted committee action on anomination only when both home-state Senators return positive blue slips. However, other chairmenhave proceeded to consider a nomination with receipt of only one positive blue slip. Even thoughrecent chairmen have implemented different blue-slip policies, each has communicated to thePresident the importance of pre-nomination consultation with both home-state Senators. Pre-nomination consultation has been a key expectation of recent chairmen in the evaluation ofnegative blue slips. The President is now expected to consult and involve each home-state Senatorin the pre-nomination phase of the selection process. Without consultation by the White House,chairmen appear to accord greater value to a negative blue slip submitted by a non-consultedhome-state Senator.", "While the Judiciary chairman controls the impact of a negative blue slip, individual Senatorscan still determine the fate of a judicial nomination after it is reported to the Senate floor. A Senator,or a group of Senators, may choose to either place a hold on or filibuster a nomination. In eachinstance, at least theoretically, a vote can be delayed indefinitely -- thus preventing confirmation ofthe President's nominee. A negative blue slip, therefore, is not the only means available to preventthe confirmation of a judicial nomination by a home-state Senator.", "This report will be updated to reflect policy changes relating to blue slips.", " Table 1.
