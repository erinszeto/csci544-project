In the context of immigration law, parole means that the foreign national has been granted temporary permission to be present in the United States. Parole does not constitute formal admission to the United States, and parolees are required to leave when the terms of their parole expire, or if otherwise eligible, to be admitted in a lawful status. Options to expedite the immigration of Haitians with approved petitions that would require legislative actions would include enacting an amendment to the INA that exempts certain Haitians for the numerical limits, and amending a transitional nonimmigrant visa\u2014the V visa\u2014for immediate relatives (spouse and children) of LPRs who have had petitions to also become LPRs pending for three years to include certain Haitians.", "Proponents of expediting the admission of Haitians with family in the United States maintained that it would relieve at least some of the humanitarian burden in Haiti. \"Unless our government does something to make sure loved ones can join families quickly,\" argues Cheryl Little of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, \"it could have devastating consequences for those in Haiti waiting for these visas.\" Other supporters assert that it would increase the remittances sent back to Haiti to provide critical help as the nation tries to rebuild. \"A larger Haitian diaspora would be a far better base for the country's economic future than aid pledges that may or may not be met,\" according to Elliot Abrams of the Council on Foreign Relations. Those opposed to expediting the admission of Haitians asserted that it would not be in the national interest, nor would it be fair to other foreign nationals waiting to reunite with their families.
