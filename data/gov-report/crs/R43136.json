The information would be used by EPA to determine whether a chemical would meet the safety standard of \"a reasonable certainty of no harm from aggregate exposure,\" given the imposition of any needed restrictions on manufacture, processing, distribution, use, or disposal. S. 696 would prohibit uses of evaluated chemical substances unless they were determined by EPA to meet the safety standard. S. 696 would increase public access to information about EPA's decisions and to some information about chemicals that currently is treated as confidential business information. S. 696 would rarely preempt state and local laws.", "S. 1009 would authorize EPA to require manufacturers to develop new information if EPA can show need in the context of an evaluative framework for chemical risk assessment and management.

In addition, both bills would explicitly require manufacturers to substantiate some requests for protection of confidential business information from public disclosure.", "S. 696 (but not S. 1009) also would add a new section to TSCA to allow U.S. implementation of three international agreements. S. 1009 would amend an existing section of TSCA to allow implementation of one treaty. Other provisions included in S. 696 would authorize EPA to support research in \"green\" engineering and chemistry, promote alternatives to toxicity testing on animals, encourage research on children's environmental health, require biomonitoring of pregnant women and infants, require EPA to identify \"hot spots\" where residents are exposed disproportionately to pollution, and direct EPA to develop strategies for reducing their risks.", "Key provisions of S. 696 and S. 1009 are compared with current statute in Tables 1 through 6 of this CRS report."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In 1976, President Gerald R.

Thirty-seven years of experience with TSCA implementation and enforcement have demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the law and led many to propose legislative changes to TSCA's core provisions in Title I. Based on hearing testimony, a diverse set of stakeholders generally concur that TSCA needs to be updated, although there is disagreement about the extent and nature of any proposed revisions. For a summary of TSCA provisions and history, see CRS Report RL31905, The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA): A Summary of the Act and Its Major Requirements , by [author name scrubbed] .", "Legislation to amend TSCA Title I was introduced in the 111 th and 112 th Congresses. The Safe Chemicals Act (SCA), S. 847 , was reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in the 112 th Congress. In the 113 th Congress, Senator Lautenberg reintroduced the reported bill as S. 696 . A few weeks later, Senator Lautenberg and 14 co-sponsors introduced a second comprehensive bill, the Chemical Safety Improvement Act (CSIA), S. 1009 .

For example, provisions related to testing would remain in Section 4, requirements for notifying EPA when a new chemical or new use is proposed would remain in Section 5, and regulatory authorities would remain in Section 6. Also unaffected would be changes to TSCA Title I that were enacted during the 110 th Congress, such as a provision that bans exports of elemental mercury. However, S. 696 would amend or delete most of the original Title I provisions and would make substantial additions to the current statute. S. 1009 also would amend TSCA Title I provisions significantly but without adding most of the new provisions in S. 696 . Some key differences between the current statute and the bills are summarized in the following sections.

The bill would direct EPA to include in each minimum information set any information that the EPA deems necessary for the conduct of a screening-level risk assessment, \"sufficient for the Administrator to administer this Act\" with regard to categorization of new and existing chemical substances, assignment of priority classes, and safety standard determinations and redeterminations. S. 696 would require submission to EPA of a minimum information set by each manufacturer and processor of a new chemical substance or, as specified by the Administrator, of an existing chemical. The bill would authorize EPA to require, by rule or order, testing and submission by a specified date of additional results of tests not included in any applicable minimum information set \"as necessary for making any determination or carrying out any provision\" of TSCA. S. 696 would authorize EPA, by order, to take regulatory action if a manufacturer or processor failed to submit required information. Finally, S. 696 would direct EPA to accommodate use of testing methods and strategies to generate information quickly, at low cost, and with reduced use of animal-based testing, to the extent that such methods and strategies would yield information of equivalent quality and reliability. ", "Neither S. 1009 nor the current statute requires development and submission of specified data for either new or existing chemicals. Instead, S. 1009 would direct the Administrator to develop a general framework, policies, and procedures for collecting, evaluating and developing data, and would require integration of relevant information from multiple sources into a tiered testing framework. The bill would authorize EPA to require manufacturers to develop new data if the agency promulgates a rule, enters into a testing consent agreement, or issues an order based on a determination that additional data are needed to", "perform a safety assessment, make a safety determination, or meet testing needs of an \"implementing authority under another Federal statute.\" ", "S. 1009 would require EPA to publish a statement identifying and explaining the need for data. It also would require EPA to specify a period for test data submission, \"which period must not be of an unreasonable duration.\" Failure to submit any required information is a prohibited act and subjects the manufacturer or processor to penalties. ", "Finally, S. 1009 would direct the Administrator to minimize the use of animals in testing of chemical substances or mixtures through various means. The bill would require the Administrator to promote the development and timely incorporation of new testing methods that are not laboratory animal-based. S. 1009 would authorize the Administrator to adapt or waive animal-testing requirements on request from a manufacturer or processor under specified circumstances.", "Under the current statute, there is no specific framework or minimum information set, but EPA has the authority to require data submission if it promulgates a rule, including a finding that a chemical \"may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,\" or is produced in very large volume and there is a potential for substantial quantity to be released into the environment or for substantial or significant human exposure. The agency also must demonstrate a need for data.", "EPA also may promulgate such rules for categories of chemicals, but is prohibited by Section 25(c)(2) from promulgating a rule for a group of chemicals that are grouped together solely on the basis of their being new chemical substances.

Manufacturers and importers must notify the EPA prior to manufacturing or importing a chemical not on the EPA inventory (that is, a \"new\" chemical). Based on information submitted with that notice (see TSCA 5(d) in Table 3 under the heading \"Notice content for new chemical substances\"), EPA has up to 90 days to determine whether a new chemical may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. In addition, under the current statute EPA has authority to require notification 90 days prior to a significant new use of a chemical on the inventory, but the agency first must promulgate a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) naming the chemical and defining the uses for which notice is required. Based on information submitted with that notice (see TSCA 5(d)), EPA must decide whether the new use may present an unreasonable risk.

S. 1009 is similar to the current statute in that it also would require notice prior to a significant new use of a chemical, if EPA has issued a SNUR. S. 696 would add a notification requirement for all chemicals already on the inventory prior to manufacture or processing for any new use or at a new production volume. For chemicals that had undergone a safety evaluation and determination by EPA, notice also would be required prior to a change in the manner of production or processing under S. 696 as introduced. ", "In response to a pre-manufacture notice from a manufacturer to EPA, both bills would require EPA to categorize chemicals based on available information within 90 days of receiving a notice (but the period may be extended). S. 1009 also requires categorization of chemicals with proposed new uses.", "S. 696 would establish the following categories for new chemicals: ", "Substances of Very High Concern, Substances Unlikely to Meet the Safety Standard, Substances with Insufficient Information, and Substances Likely to Meet the Safety Standard.

The ITC reports to EPA biannually, establishes a prioritized list of chemicals, and designates up to 50 chemicals on the list as the highest priority. In selecting chemicals, the committee is authorized to consider all relevant factors, including \"the extent to which the substance or mixture is closely related to a chemical substance or mixture which is known to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.\" Priority attention is to be given to chemicals \"known to cause or contribute to or which are suspected of causing or contributing to cancer, gene mutations, or birth defects.\" The EPA Administrator also is authorized under TSCA 5(b)(4) to compile and keep current a list of chemical substances that the Agency has determined present or may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. This list of chemicals of concern must be promulgated by notice and comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) and must provide opportunity for oral and written presentation of data, views, or arguments. In addition, EPA routinely prioritizes chemicals in commerce using its knowledge of chemistry and biology.", "S. 696 would eliminate the ITC provisions as well as the provision at TSCA 5(b)(4). Instead the bill would direct the Administrator to establish a system for assigning chemical substances into batches, categorizing them, and assigning priorities for testing and regulation. The bill would require the EPA Administrator to screen and prioritize all chemicals on the inventory for the purposes of risk assessment, safety standard determinations, and risk management. EPA would initially assign chemicals to batches. The first batch generally would include chemicals currently in commerce in the United States\u2014that is, chemicals for which manufacturers submitted information to EPA in response to the most recent Chemical Data Reporting rule (issued under TSCA 8(a)). The bill then would direct EPA to assign all of the chemicals in the first batch to one of four categories based on available information: ", "Substances of Very High Concern, Substances with Insufficient Information, Substances of Very Low Concern, and Substances to Undergo Safety Standard Determinations. ", "S. 696 also would direct EPA to add new chemical substances categorized previously by EPA as Substances Likely to Meet the Safety Standard to the inventory of existing chemicals, assign each to a batch, and further categorize each as a Substance of Very Low Concern or a Substance to Undergo a Safety Standard Determination. All chemicals on the inventory categorized as Substances to Undergo a Safety Standard Determination would be prioritized further (Priority 1, Priority 2, or Priority 3) for risk assessment. After the initial categorization and prioritization, S. 696 would direct EPA to review information continually with an eye toward revising chemical assignments.", "S. 1009 retains the ITC but would require it to advise EPA with regard to testing consent agreements and test orders in addition to test rules. S. 1009 eliminates the chemicals of concern listing provisions of TSCA 5(b)(4), but would direct the Administrator to establish a risk-based screening process as well as criteria for identifying whether existing chemical substances are a high or a low priority for a safety assessment and determination. Priorities would be determined based on: (1) the ability of EPA to schedule and complete safety assessments and determinations in a timely manner; and (2) reasonably available data and information concerning the hazard, exposure, and use characteristics at the time the decision is made. The agency's proposed prioritization screening process and criteria would be published for public comment. Using the screening process, EPA would be required \"in a timely manner\" to evaluate all existing chemical substances or categories of substances on the active inventory (created under proposed TSCA 8(b)).

", "Under S. 696 , as introduced, continued production and use of a chemical would be permitted only if EPA made, or expected to make, an affirmative safety determination for the chemical. S. 696 would require manufacturers of chemicals to supply scientific data sufficient for EPA to conclude, based on a risk assessment, that the chemical would meet the safety standard: \"there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to human health or the environment from aggregate exposure to the chemical substance\" under the use conditions evaluated and specified by EPA. The bill would require EPA to base these safety determinations \"solely on considerations of human health and the environment, including the health of vulnerable populations.\" An EPA determination that a chemical would not meet the safety standard would not require a risk assessment.

Under the current statute, EPA is obligated to follow procedures laid out in the Administrative Procedure Act and to provide opportunities for persons to present data, views, or arguments orally and in written submissions. The current statute requires that a transcript be made of oral presentations, and the EPA Administrator must publish findings.
