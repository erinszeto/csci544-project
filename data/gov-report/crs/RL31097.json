The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) contended that the retail value of the bread was half the normal sales price since the industry practice of major bakers is to discount four-day-old bread, but if the court had ruled the value of the bread was half the retail selling price, the donor would have received no tax benefit and, thus, no encouragement to make such charitable donations.

Moreover, no tax was imposed or collected on the appreciation. As an example, a farmer making a charitable contribution of a portion of his crop not only received a tax deduction of the fair market value of the donated crops, but also escaped the tax on the difference between his crop production costs and fair market value. Because the tax savings from the charitable deduction (in the case of ordinary income property) was measured by the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, it was possible for taxpayers to make contributions which permitted a greater after-tax benefit than would have been received if the crop had been sold and the farmer allowed to keep the proceeds after paying tax on the gain. It should be remembered that tax rates at that time were much higher than today's rates. Since this provision was seen as unfair when compared with those making charitable cash gifts, the Tax Reform Act of 1969 changed the law so that the appreciated value was to result in a reduction of the contribution deduction to the extent of the appreciation.", "It was with passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 ( P.L. 94-455 ) that corporations were provided more favorable tax treatment of contributions of inventory (such as food) to certain charitable organizations. The 1976 Act provided that such gifts by corporations were to be based on the taxpayer's basis in the property and one-half of the unrealized appreciation as long as the deduction did not exceed twice the property's basis. In a summary of the act, it was stated that the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 had resulted in reduced contributions of certain types of property to charitable institutions. In particular, those charitable organizations that provide food, clothing, medical equipment, and supplies, etc. to the needy and disaster victims had found that contributions of such items to those organizations were reduced. It was stated in the general explanation of the law that Congress believed that it was desirable to provide a greater tax incentive than in prior law for contributions of certain types of ordinary income property which the donee charity uses in the performance of its exempt purposes. However, Congress believed that the deduction allowed should not be such that the donor could be in a better after-tax situation by donating the property than by selling it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statistical Trends", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, total charitable giving was estimated to have reached $295 billion. Corporations and their foundations contributed $12.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations. Two predictors of corporate giving, corporate pretax profits and the gross domestic product both rose in 2006. Individual giving represented 75.6% of total giving and corporate gifts were 4.3% of the total (with foundations and bequests representing the remainder). However, these numbers mask the importance of corporate charitable gifts because religious organizations receive little funding from either corporate donors or their foundations since individuals are the primary support of religious institutions. The American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel (AAFRC) Trust for Philanthropy, Inc. found that for 2006, contributions to religion represented 32.8% of all charitable gifts. It is important to remember that companies support non-profits through cause-related marketing, public relations, sponsorships, contracts, and other joint promotional activities as well as through advertising expenditures. These types of expenditures are not shown as charitable gifts. In an earlier edition of Giving USA , the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy, Inc. made the following four points:", "Corporate giving has ranged from a low point of 0.7% to a high of 2.3% of pretax income over 30 years, with historical variation largely due to changes in tax law. Profits grow fastest in the service industries, like banking and telecommunications. Non-manufacturing companies cannot take advantage of tax-deductible gifts of inventory that make up much of the manufacturing sector's charitable activity, even though non-manufacturers make up a large component of profit growth. There is a trend toward strategic corporate support, which is not counted as a charitable gift by the company, the IRS, or Giving USA. Nonetheless, this activity appeals to both companies and non-profits and may be a mutually satisfactory substitute for charitable giving. There is no practical reason why companies should use pretax income as the basis for determining their charitable contribution levels. There is no reason not to pursue a strategy in which charitable support to non-profits increases without consuming an increasing share of corporate profits.", "The Conference Board, which has surveyed the charitable giving behavior of firms, wrote that, in 1999, \"companies reported that 28% of their contributions were in forms other than cash donations, the highest level of non-cash expenditures ever reported by companies in the Conference Board Analyses of cash and non-cash giving.\" Among the industries reporting the largest non-cash percentages were \"chemical companies, which donated 68% of their 1999 contributions in forms other than cash; pharmaceutical companies, with 64%; manufacturers of computer and office equipment, with 59%; printing, publishing and medical firms with 48%.\" In a table of cash and non-cash contributions by industry, it was reported that the 10 companies in the Food/Beverage/Tobacco industrial classification gave 28% of their contributions in in-kind giving.", "An article which appeared in Worth magazine provided information on the 50 companies that gave the most in 1999.

According to the article in Worth , only four nonfood related companies gave a greater percentage of their profits than Sara Lee (Dupont; J.C. Penney; Target, and the United Parcel Service). All of the food companies showed substantial in-kind giving while 15 of the remaining 45 companies showed no in-kind giving at all.

First, corporate managers have been careful about making charitable contributions since their responsibility is to provide the highest rate of return that is legally possible to those who have invested in the corporation. Often, making charitable contributions conflicts with this mandate. Having said that, corporations do make charitable gifts all the time. It is also true that their contributions are usually intended to enhance the corporation's visibility or image before the consuming public. That is, goodwill is a valuable asset for a corporation, and charitable contributions help to create that goodwill. However, it generally makes no difference to a corporation whether it deducts its payment as a charitable contribution or as a business advertising expense because either deduction lowers its federal income tax by the same amount. Only when the special rules for contributions of inventory come into play does it make a difference as to how the gift is viewed and how the value of the contribution changes under current tax law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Equity Concerns", "paragraphs": ["There are equity challenges to extending the current enhanced tax deduction for corporate contributions of food to all taxpayers engaged in a trade or business, such as small family farms and family operated restaurants (sometimes referred to as entrepreneurs in this report). A primary obstacle is that the cost basis could be higher for corporations than for a small business. This result can be caused by the inclusion of wages and germane taxes (such as Social Security, unemployment taxes, etc.) that are paid by corporations, but are not always included in the cost basis of small businesses such as farmers who grow crops or owner-chefs who own individual restaurants. Since it can be expected that (one-half of the) appreciation of the crops generally would be lower for corporations, with the full deductibility of the cost basis, than for individual farmers, an inherent advantage would still be given corporate farmers with their higher cost basis. For example, if a corporation has a cost basis of $7,000 with appreciation of $3,000, this equals a market price of $10,000. A small entrepreneur would more likely have a cost basis of $3,000 and an appreciation rate of $7,000 for the same $10,000 market price. In the corporate case, one-half of the appreciation ($1,500) and the cost basis ($7,000) is equal to $8,500. In the case of the entrepreneur, one half the appreciation ($3,500) plus the cost basis ($3,000) is equal to $6,500. Thus, the corporation would receive nearly $2,000 more in deductibility.", "It can be argued that the temporary law provides more equity among all taxpayers engaged in a trade or business than the current, permanent law which provides the enhanced deduction only to C corporations and does not include provisions for S businesses or individuals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tax Rate Differentials", "paragraphs": ["In addition, it should be noted that tax rates and the graduation of those rates are different for individuals and corporations. Current law provides for corporate tax rates which range between 15% and 35% depending on the company's taxable income (phase-outs can make the effective rates for certain corporations rise as high as 39%). In tax year 2005, individuals will be subject to six tax rates ranging from 10% to 35%. In all cases, whether corporate or individual, the value of the enhanced deduction is dependent on the applicable tax rate. Typically, those with higher incomes would receive more advantage than those with lower incomes under the proposal. Thus, it does not appear that full equity can be achieved through the extension of the current enhanced deduction for corporate gifts of food inventory to all taxpayers engaged in a trade or business. For example, a large corporation will most likely have a 35% rate. A small farmer filing a joint return whose income is less than $182,800 would be subject to a 28% rate.

Fixed costs such as seed, fertilizer, and other costs such as purchased irrigation water (typically referred to as sunk costs) are not taken into consideration when making the decision to harvest.
