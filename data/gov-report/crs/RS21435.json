(3) Over four out offive graduates in the class of 1972 would have been first generation college students were they to have gone tocollegecompared to two out of three graduates in the class of 2000. (4) This decline of would be first generation college studentsroughly coincides with the growth in educational attainment that occurred during the same period. In 1970, 11%of theU.S. population were college graduates and by 2000 this had increased to 24%. (5)", "The proportion of high school graduates from families with income below 150% of the official poverty level has remainedrelatively stable at around 21% over the last 30 years, according to these data. Twenty percent of the class of 1972lived inlow-income families compared to 22% of the class of 2000. This parallels the rate of poverty for the U.S.population as awhole which has fluctuated between 16% and 20% over the same period. (6)", "Similar trends can be seen in the data on college students, although the Department has only begun to collect such datasince 1987. (7) These data indicate modest declinesin the proportion of low-income and first generation college students. The proportion of students from low-income families dropped from 16% to 12% between 1987 and 2000. Theproportionwho, upon graduation, would be the first in their family to get a college degree declined from 65% in 1987 to 62%in 2000.", "A second indication from these data is that the representation of first generation and low-income students among thoseenrolled in college has been consistently lower than among those graduating from high school.

Conversely, Table3 reveals thatparental educational attainment is strongly associated with college attendance among students above150% of poverty.

Rates of college enrollment among low-income and first generation students were muchlowerthan the overall rate for 2000 high school graduates. In the final analysis of the combined effects of these factors,firstgeneration status was found to have little association with the rate of enrollment of low-income students, but wasstronglyassociated with the rate of enrollment of students from families with greater income.", "These results have particularly important implications for the TRIO programs since the legislation stipulates that not lessthan two-thirds of program participants be both low-income and first generation students. The results which show that firstgeneration status does not impact upon the enrollment rate of low-income students might lead some to argue forremoval ofthe first generation portion of this requirement. However, since the findings do reveal lower college going ratesamongfirst generation students from higher income families, some might argue that the statute should be amended to read\"or\"rather than \"and.\" Another possibility would be an amendment to the definition of low-income to include studentsatgreater income levels whose enrollment likelihood is impacted by first generation status."], "subsections": []}]}}
