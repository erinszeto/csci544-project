Measures proposed included opening the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas drilling, regulation of speculation in energy markets, and policies concerning the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.", "A large number of factors combined to put pressure on gasoline prices, including increased world demand for crude oil and limited U.S. refinery capacity to supply gasoline. The war and continued violence in Iraq added uncertainty, and threats of supply disruption added pressure, particularly to the commodity futures markets. Concern that speculation added volatility and upward pressure was frequently cited. In recent months, a decline in the value of the dollar compared to other currencies increased the dollar price of oil on futures markets.", "The gasoline price surge stimulated much legislative activity, but until the last year or so there was not the sense of the extreme urgency of previous energy crises. In part, this may be due to the fact that there was been no physical shortage of gasoline or lines at the pump, as there were after the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and the Iranian revolution in 1979. At that time there was expectation that prices were destined to grow ever higher, and many believed that the world's supply of oil was running out. Such views have been less prevalent during the current run-up. But the continued and unrelenting increase in crude oil prices to record levels, even discounting inflation, led many to suggest that changing world market conditions may cause permanent, or at least chronic, shortages of petroleum production capacity. Others continued to expect that growth in demand would moderate, and production increase to meet demand, as it did following the shortages of the 1970s.", "The continuing high prices led to a further search for legislative remedies.

When the Congress broke for the November elections, it had passed legislation affecting oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), energy taxes, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), but it had also considered legislation regarding price gouging and speculation in energy futures markets, and also dealing with oil market manipulation by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background and Analysis", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Activities", "paragraphs": ["The persistence of high gasoline prices led to a broad spectrum of proposed new legislation in the First Session of the 110 th Congress.

P.L. 110-140 also increased the requirement to use renewable fuels in gasoline, including advanced biofuels such as cellulosic alcohol starting in 2016. However, a number of proposals included in one or more versions of energy legislation in 2007 were dropped from the final bill, and those issues remained of interest to the Congress during the Second Session.", "With gasoline prices soaring, a new wave of legislative proposals appeared in the Congress. Prominent among them were bills to suspend the federal gasoline and diesel transportation tax during the summer driving season, by presidential candidates Senators McCain and Clinton. Senator Domenici introduced a bill emphasizing U.S. petroleum production, including opening the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and gas leasing and encouraging leasing of oil shale deposits. Senator Reid introduced a bill which, among other measures, would impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies. Another tax issue was the effort to extend tax credits for renewable energy production, and offset them by increasing taxes on the oil companies.", "Numerous bills were also introduced to deal with the possibility that speculation was unreasonably driving up oil prices. The House passed several bills identifying and prohibiting price gouging. President Bush's policy of continuing fill of the SPR was opposed in both Houses, and a bill suspending fill became law. Proposals to sell SPR oil in an effort to moderate oil prices were not adopted, however.", "The major debate in the Second Session was the proposal by Republicans to open up the OCS for oil and gas leasing.", "This report reviews the major legislative initiatives to deal with the gasoline price issue.

In 2004, a large number of factors combined to exert pressure on gasoline prices in all parts of the country. Some of these factors affected the price of crude oil, and others the cost of producing and marketing gasoline."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Crude Oil Prices", "paragraphs": ["Past energy crises have demonstrated that oil is traded in a world market, in which events in remote areas affect the price of crude for almost everyone. As a result, the price of crude oil is set through the interaction of world demand and supply. Major factors in the run-up of crude oil prices were the sharply increased consumption of imported oil by China (see Figure 2 ) and the continuing possibility of a supply disruption, either from violence or terrorism in the Middle East, or from natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.", "World demand for crude oil grew by 1.3% in 2007 to 86.0 mbd. World supply was 87.3 mbd in March 2008, leaving relatively little excess supply to draw on if the market were disrupted by natural or political disasters. When excess supply on the market is low, prices tend to rise and become more volatile.", "Some observers have suggested that speculators, who have entered the commodity markets in large numbers looking for ways to increase their monetary investments rather than to trade in oil and oil products, were causing an unacceptable upward pressure on prices. Another factor in recent months was been the decline in the value of the dollar compared to other currencies. Since world prices of oil are quoted in dollars, this would have an upward effect on market prices.", "One of the major factors pushing crude prices higher is the perception that, as demand increases, production capacity will not increase with it. Most of the spare production capacity in the world market is located in OPEC countries, and, as Figure 3 shows, spare capacity in those countries has been lower than average over the past several years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gasoline Prices", "paragraphs": ["Higher prices for crude oil tend to translate directly into higher prices for gasoline. At the peak of the market, crude oil accounted for about 72% of the cost of gasoline. Refining, distributing, and marketing account for about 16% of the cost of gasoline, and taxes account for about 13%. However, until recently crude oil's share of the cost of gasoline has been more typically in the range of 45% to 55%. In May 2007, for example, with gasoline at $3.15 per gallon, crude oil contributed 46% of the cost; refining, distributing and marketing 41%; and taxes 13%. With the collapse of crude prices, contribution of crude costs to the gasoline price declined somewhat. This trend is illustrated in Figure 4 .", "Whether the crude oil a refiner processes is purchased on the open market or is produced by the oil company itself, higher costs for any element in the cost of gasoline are likely to be passed on to consumers. A number of factors aggravated the pressure on gasoline prices, including limited refining capacity in the United States, the range of fuel blends required to meet air pollution requirements, and the mandated use of ethanol as an additive. Perhaps most important, U.S. demand for gasoline increased as economic growth continued, at least through 2007. However, consumption of gasoline for the first 311 days of 2008 averaged 9.01 mbd, compared to 9.29 mbd during the same period in 2007. (See Figure 5 .)", "The 2004 price surge intensified discussion of energy policy and led to further calls for passage of energy legislation. However, until the climax of the Katrina disaster, the urgency of previous energy crises had been lacking. Throughout the period, U.S. gasoline consumption continued to rise. In part, this may be because although the price of gasoline in nominal terms set a record, in real terms it did not appear to be reaching the level of the Iranian crisis years of the early 1980s (see Figure 6 ); that is, until Katrina pushed it toward the $3.00-per-gallon mark. Further, unlike the earlier crises, there was no physical shortage of gasoline and there were no lines at the pump, except in local disaster-affected areas.", "As Figure 7 indicates, by the early 1990s the proportion of consumer expenditures on oil and gasoline had declined from the high levels of the 1970s and early 1980s. Data are not yet available to indicate what effect the price run-up starting in 2004 has had on this measure.", "Perhaps most important, the common view during the earlier crises was that oil prices not only were high, but were destined to become ever higher in the coming years, because world resources were probably beginning to level off and would decline in the future. This view is no longer widely prevalent, largely because world proved reserves have increased faster than production, and are currently more than twice the level at the time of the Arab oil embargo in 1973.", "At the beginning of the current crisis, the general expectation was that the price increase was a temporary phenomenon. In part, this may be due to the fact that there has been no physical shortage of gasoline or lines at the pump, as there were after the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and the Iranian revolution in 1979. But the continued and unrelenting increase in crude oil prices to record levels, even discounting inflation, is leading many to suggest that changing world market conditions may have led to permanent, or at least chronic, shortages of petroleum production capacity. The persistent increases in world demand for oil, despite higher prices, and the inability or unwillingness in many parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East, to develop known existing resources, appear to presage a continuing tight market, in which production capacity is only slightly greater than demand. Under those conditions, temporary interruptions in production, caused for example by local political crises or weather, are much more likely than normal to force prices upward.", "Others continue to expect that growth in demand will moderate, and production will increase to meet demand, as it did following the shortages of the 1970s. They argue that the market price of oil appears to be much higher than production costs, and is being sustained by the expectation of continued strong demand in the indefinite future. In addition, they point to large profits flowing to oil producers, and political pressure to invest those profits in increased production."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Policy Options", "paragraphs": ["Congress has considered numerous energy policy initiatives and enacted many of them. With the continuing pressure of rising prices, however, energy policy has once again become the focus of attention, both in the Congress and on the campaign trail.", "Policy options include efforts to ameliorate the effects of high prices in the short term, and to attack the longer term problem. The latter options come in three major forms: to reduce consumption by increased efficiency without having a negative effect on the economy; to substitute alternative fuels at a cost comparable to the oil they replace; and to encourage production of more oil, either in this country or abroad.", "The choice of these options depends to a certain extent on how the future of the oil market is viewed. Those who consider it likely that the present tightness of the market is likely to continue, as described above, tend to support alternative fuels and increased efficiency, and to denigrate efforts to increase oil production as futile and ineffective compared to the growth in world demand, which they expect to continue indefinitely. Those who view the present tightness of the world market as an aberration that can be relieved with adequate investment in new production capacity view any move to increase supply, anywhere in the world, as a positive signal that the tightness and volatility of the world oil market can be eased and prices can more closely reflect the cost of production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oil-Related Legislation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reducing Consumer Impacts and Regulating Oil Markets", "paragraphs": ["A number of proposals are aimed at easing the impact of high prices on consumers, or are aimed at the oil industry's price-making policies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Gas Tax Moratorium", "paragraphs": ["Bills introduced by Senator McCain ( S. 2890 ) and Senator Clinton ( S. 2971 ) would have suspended federal gasoline and diesel transportation taxes for the summer driving season, and the proposals were a topic in the presidential campaigns of the two candidates.

Since FY1999, any fill of the SPR has been with deliveries of royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil to the SPR in lieu of cash royalties to the federal government on offshore production. Through FY2007, royalty-in-kind deliveries to the SPR have totaled roughly 140 million barrels and forgone receipts to the Department of the Interior are estimated to be $4.6 billion. DOE has projected deliveries of RIK oil during FY2008 of 19.1 million barrels and $1.170 billion in forgone revenues.", "Continued fill of the SPR with royalty-in-kind oil became controversial in the 110 th Congress. Critics argued against adding oil to the SPR when markets are tight and prices remain high. They argued further that the additional oil adds little to U.S. energy security. Supporters of RIK fill argue that the fill rate is too little to have a discernible impact on markets, and that currently high refined-product prices are sustained by factors other than crude supply, which is more than ample at this time.", "Legislation was introduced in the Second Session ( H.R. 5146 , S. 2598 ) to suspend RIK fill.
