Title V would provide a budgetary offset for bill authorizations. The bill was derived directly from S. 1392, often referred to as the Shaheen-Portman bill of 2013. During the first session, floor action on S. 1392 was halted by a push for votes on controversial non-energy amendments. Many energy amendments were also prepared for S. 1392, but floor action stopped before formal consideration.", "In the second session, anticipating the potential for further procedural battles, bill sponsors sought to expand the S. 1392 framework. The aim of expanding the bill was to secure enough additional votes to address the potential for a filibuster by ensuring sufficient votes for cloture on debate. The expanded bill was introduced as S. 2074. It contains all the core provisions of S. 1392, and the text of 10 bipartisan amendments that had been proposed for S. 1392 in floor action during 2013. The text of S. 2262 is identical to that of S. 2074, except that the amount of budget offsets in section 501 was increased from $638 million to $720 million (for FY2014 through FY2018).", "This report reviews the provisions of S. 2262, highlights the most controversial bill provision, and identifies potential amendments to the bill.", "The most controversial provision in S. 2262 is section 431. That section is an updated version of S.Amdt. 1917 to S. 1392 (Hoeven-Manchin amendment). Section 431 would repeal an existing requirement to eliminate fossil energy use in new federal buildings by 2030. DOE has found the provision difficult to implement, and has not yet issued a rule to enforce it. In place of that requirement, section 431 would tighten energy efficiency guidelines and building codes for new federal buildings\u2014but to a lesser degree. Supporters assert that the existing prohibition is unworkable, citing DOE's inability to implement it and the \"more feasible\" goals in section 431. Opponents claim that the amendment would undermine federal leadership-by-example on net-zero energy buildings and on the effort to reduce federal greenhouse gas emissions.", "The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), which has publicly stated support for the bill, estimates an energy-saving potential of 1.8 quadrillion Btu (quads) by 2030, with an associated cost-saving potential of $16.2 billion. S. 2262 was designed to be deficit neutral. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that it would provide a net decrease in the federal budget deficit of $12 million over the period from FY2014 through FY2024.", "Bill sponsors reported that over 270 businesses, associations, and trade groups\u2014from the National Association of Manufacturers to the Chamber of Commerce\u2014support S. 2262.

Only the Keystone XL Pipeline amendment and one ACA amendment were the subject of major floor debate on S. 1392 .", "S.Amdt. 1908 on the Keystone XL Pipeline called for a Sense of Congress resolution that would encourage the President to issue a permit needed to begin construction. In floor debate, proponents argued that the project would create thousands of jobs; generate tax revenues for federal, state, and local governments; reduce dependence on oil imports from Venezuela; and gain an \"environmental advantage\" from using high-tech refineries on the Gulf Coast. Opponents contended that there would be fewer than 100 permanent jobs, most of the oil would be exported, and there would be a \"tangible risk\" of a spill that could have severe environmental impacts. S.Amdt. 1866 would have amended Section 1312(d)(3)(D) of ACA and would affect how Members of Congress, congressional staff, the President, the Vice President, and many executive branch political appointees can obtain health insurance coverage through their federal employment. The sponsor of S.Amdt. 1866 requested a vote on the amendment and objected to further consideration of other amendments, which blocked voting on all other amendments. Shortly after floor debate began, the sponsor introduced a stand-alone bill ( S. 1497 ) with similar content and expressed a willingness to drop the objection, if a vote could be \"locked down\" for S.Amdt. 1866 \u2014or if a vote on the proposal ( S. 1497 ) could be guaranteed for any other active legislation.", "Despite a tentative agreement to take votes on S.Amdt. 1908 and S.Amdt. 1866 , supporters of non-energy amendments increased their requests to include four additional non-energy amendments.
