The battery pack provides power to the motor that drives the vehicle. At times, the motor acts as a generator, sending electricity back to the battery. The broad categories of EVs can be identified by whether they have an internal combustion engine (i.e., hybrid vehicles) and whether the battery pack can be charged by external electricity (i.e., plug-in electric vehicles). The numerous vehicle technologies further determine characteristics such as fuel economy rating, driving range, and greenhouse gas emissions. EVs can be separated into three broad categories:", "Hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs): The internal combustion engine primarily powers the wheels. The battery pack and electric motor provide supplemental power. Plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs): The battery pack can be charged by an external source of electricity. Depending on the model, primary power to the wheels may be supplied by the battery pack and electric motor, the internal combustion engine, or a combination. All-electric vehicles (AEVs; also called battery-electric vehicles or BEVs): The battery pack must be charged via an external source of electricity. The battery pack and electric motor power the wheels.", "Current technology offers three levels of charging for plug-in EVs. Level 1 and Level 2 are currently the most widely accessible with standardized vehicle connectors and charge ports that can be set up for at-home charging. Level 3 (also called DC fast charging) offers the fastest charging rates on the market but is not available for at-home installation due to high voltage. Vehicle connectors and corresponding charge ports for Level 3 are also not standardized, with three different systems currently in use by different vehicle manufacturers. Some research has raised concerns regarding the potential impact of fast charging on battery performance, resulting in technology development aimed at addressing potential capacity loss and decreased charging cycles.", "As an emergent technology area, EVs present a number of issues for consideration. The fuel sources used to generate the electricity to charge PHEVs and AEVs are a major factor in determining EV greenhouse gas emissions relative to ICEVs. Per-mile EV emissions vary geographically and with the time of day and year that charging takes place. Growing demand for lithium-ion batteries also shifts the material requirements of the vehicle market from fuels for combustion to minerals and other materials for battery production. A growing EV market may encourage new strategies around the supply and refining of raw materials, ability to manufacture batteries, and end-of-life management for batteries that are no longer suitable for use in vehicles.", "Support for EV deployment stems from, among other things, federal and state policies establishing manufacturing rebates, tax credits for purchases, funding for research and development, and standards for fuel economy and emissions. These policies include the Plug-In Electric Vehicle Tax Credit, and the coordinated Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and emissions standards for vehicles. Over time, some federal incentives and grant programs have expired. Several bills pending in the 116 th Congress would extend or repeal tax credits for EVs, establish highway usage fees on alternative fuel vehicles, fund grants for charging infrastructure, or establish a national zero-emissions vehicle standard."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Electric vehicle (EV) technology has emerged as a potential alternative to the internal combustion engine with an increasing variety and volume of electric vehicles sold since the 1990s. Numerous policies and incentives are in place or have been proposed to encourage the production, purchase, and use of alternative fuel vehicles (including EVs). These proposals have been at times alongside efforts to reduce fuel consumption and subsequent emissions, support U.S. vehicle manufacturing, and address the growing shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund. Since 2010, some incentives and grant programs have expired, and other legislative options have been proposed. Underlying these policies are congressional interests such as reducing reliance on foreign sources of petroleum, encouraging rural development, promoting domestic manufacturing, and addressing environmental concerns.", "The electric car was first created in the early 1800s as a simple electrified buggy. It was considered to be quiet, easy to drive, and did not emit exhaust like its gasoline- and steam-powered counterparts. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), by the early 1900s, electric cars had enjoyed a brief popularity, accounting for one-third of cars on the road. Within a few decades, however, electric cars were practically obsolete. Electric starters and increasing availability of gasoline fueling stations made gasoline-powered cars as easy to start and drive as electric cars. Neither type of car required the use of a cumbersome hand-crank system, but gasoline-powered cars gained the edge since electricity availability was slow to expand relative to gasoline fueling stations. The Model T, first produced in 1908, came to dominate the market due to its affordability and driving range.", "Growing concerns in the late 20 th century over the environmental impact of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas and other emissions sparked renewed interest in electric vehicles. EVs may support ongoing efforts to address environmental concerns through reducing petroleum consumption in transportation. Support for EV deployment stems from, among other things, federal and state policies establishing manufacturing rebates, tax credits for purchase, funding for research and development, and standards for fuel economy and emissions standards. National standards include Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under the authority of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA; P.L. 94-163 ; as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P.L. 110-140 )), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles as air pollutants under authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA; P.L. 88-206). In 2012, NHTSA and EPA coordinated these standards under a joint rule establishing the National Program; standards applicable to model years 2021-2026 are currently under reconsideration under the proposed Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule.", "In the 1990s, the first contemporary hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) debuted on the global market, the Toyota Prius, while General Motors released (and terminated) the first contemporary all-electric vehicle (AEV), the EV-1. From 2000 to 2010, a few more electric vehicles emerged, including the first commercially available plug-in hybrid-electric (PHEV), the Chevrolet Volt, the all-electric Nissan Leaf, and Tesla's line of dedicated all-electric vehicles. Many of these EVs were made possible by DOE support for research and development of EV technology, in particular battery technology, as well as DOE-sponsored loans made available to EV automakers and investments in nationwide charging infrastructure. More manufacturers followed, contributing models to a growing electric vehicle market. From 2010 to 2018, EV sales increased from 275,000 to 705,000, making up 4.2% of all new light-duty vehicles sales in 2018 in the United States ( Figure 1 ).

At 1,866 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017, transportation sector emissions have increased more than any other sector since 1990 ( Figure 2 ), along with increasing demand for travel. Light-duty vehicles contributed 59% of total transportation emissions, with the remainder coming from trucks and other highway vehicles, aircraft, trains, and ships and boats. Light-duty vehicles also consumed 53% of petroleum-based fuels in the transportation sector in 2017. Other sectors exhibited reductions in carbon dioxide emissions while making improvements in energy efficiency and reducing consumption of coal and petroleum products. In the electricity generation sector, electric power generated is observed to be relatively flat from 2013 to 2017, while emissions decreased and natural gas and renewable energy consumption replaced coal consumption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are Electric Passenger Vehicles?", "paragraphs": ["An electric vehicle (EV) is characterized by its electric motor and traction battery pack, comprising numerous battery cells, most commonly lithium-ion. EV batteries provide power that drives the vehicle and are distinct from the lead-acid batteries that are used in the ignition process of most internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). At times, the motor acts as a generator, sending electricity to the battery, which is later used to power the motor. The broad categories of EVs can be identified by whether they have an internal combustion engine (i.e., hybrids) and whether the battery can be charged by external electricity (i.e., plug-ins). Figure 3 demonstrates the differentiations between the three broad categories of EVs: hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (AEVs).", "Internal combustion engine vehicles are the most common passenger vehicles on the road. They rely primarily on petroleum-based fuel (typically gasoline), which is injected into a small chamber in the internal combustion engine where a spark ignites the fuel to produce the power that propels the vehicle ( Figure 4 ). The ICEV powertrain can have more than 100 moving parts between the engine, the transmission, and other components. Fuel efficiency in new ICEVs has increased, with some vehicle models achieving a rating of up to 39 miles per gallon (mpg) for model year 2019. Table 1 summarizes various aspects of ICEVs and the different electric vehicle types.", "Of the electric vehicle alternatives, HEVs are most similar to ICEVs, but with higher fuel economy due to a traction battery pack, electric motor, and regenerative braking system. Like ICEVs, HEVs require gasoline to initiate the engine that powers the car, but once running, HEVs supplement that initial power through the electric motor using electricity stored in the battery ( Figure 5 ). The battery is continuously recharged while the car is in use, either by the internal combustion engine or regenerative braking (see shaded box on Features of Electric Vehicles). HEVs cannot run without a petroleum product, but they are generally more fuel efficient than ICEVs, achieving up to a 58 mpg rating.", "PHEVs combine the technology of HEVs with the ability to charge the traction battery pack via an external source of electricity ( Figure 6 ). As a result, PHEVs can be operated without external charging over a driving range similar to HEVs or in electric-only operation over a certain driving range, especially with regular access to charging facilities. To accommodate this electric driving range, PHEVs require more electricity and batteries with greater electricity storage capacity than HEVs\u00e2\u0080\u0094up to 42 kilowatt hours (kWh) for PHEVs versus up to 1.6 kWh for HEVs. In a PHEV, the internal combustion engine and the electric motor may both be enabled to power the wheels directly in a parallel configuration. The internal combustion engine may also be used in a series configuration only to generate electricity to store in the battery, which is then used by the motor to power the wheels (other configurations are also possible). PHEVs offer higher fuel economy than both HEVs and ICEVs, up to 133 miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (mpge).", "AEVs (also called battery-electric vehicles or BEVs), run entirely on electricity stored in a large traction battery pack ( Figure 7 )\u00e2\u0080\u0094the largest among EVs with a capacity of up to 100 kWh. The battery must be charged via an external source of electricity. Regenerative braking alone is insufficient to generate the quantity of electricity needed to power the motor and all other functionality of a car. AEVs offer the highest fuel economy ratings, up to 136 mpge. AEVs do not use gasoline and have no internal combustion engine. The result is fewer moving and wearing parts in the powertrain and more electronic components. Consequently, a manufacturing shift toward AEVs may disrupt parts manufacturing and maintenance in the automotive industry due to changing demands for parts and differing required skillsets for laborers in the production and maintenance of AEV parts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How to Charge Plug-In Electric Vehicles", "paragraphs": ["Batteries in plug-in electric vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0094PHEVs and AEVs\u00e2\u0080\u0094can be charged using a standard residential outlet. Providing a full charge in this manner takes hours due to the low voltage available from a home electrical service. The slow pace of charging is one factor currently affecting consumer acceptance of EVs; most motorists are used to filling up a tank with gas in a matter of minutes.", "Current technology ( Table 2 ) offers three rates of charging, differentiated by the voltage of the electrical current: Level 1 at 120 volts alternating current (AC; see shaded box on Alternating Current Versus Direct Current); Level 2 at 240 volts AC; and Level 3 (also called DC fast charging) at 500 volts direct current (DC). Level 1 and Level 2 are the most widely accessible, with both voltages often available in a standard home. Connectors and charge ports for AC charging use the SAE J1772 standard, a result of the SAE International standards process documenting common engineering practices. Most plug-in electric vehicles come with a Level 1 cordset with a standard three-prong plug on one end and a J1772 connector on the other that plugs into a vehicle's corresponding charge port. Some vehicles come with a Level 2 cordset, which has a plug for a 240-volt outlet, such as that used for a clothes dryer. For drivers charging at home, no additional cost is required if the selected outlet is served by a dedicated circuit.", "Lower voltages mean longer charging times. Level 3 offers the highest voltages and faster charging rates than Level 1 and Level 2. The Level 3 charging unit has a charger that converts AC from the electric grid to DC, enabling direct charging of the battery pack. Ordinarily, EVs use an on-board charger to perform this conversion. As an emergent technology, Level 3 connectors and charge ports are not currently standardized and include CHAdeMO (used by Kia, Mitsubishi, and Nissan); SAE combined charging system (CCS; used by BMW and Chevrolet); and Tesla Supercharger (proprietary to Tesla vehicles).

In 2019, many EVs with fast-charging capabilities are equipped with a variety of systems to address capacity loss, including cooling systems, as well as battery management systems that monitor battery health, track frequency of fast charging, and adjust the charge rate to prevent damage to the battery, potentially addressing some of these concerns.

These emissions include greenhouse gases and other pollutants that contribute to smog and other air quality problems. Transportation emissions can be divided into upstream emissions and downstream emissions. Upstream emissions are associated with the processes of fuel extraction and production, including the production of gasoline and diesel for combustion in ICEVs, and the generation of electricity for charging plug-in EVs. Downstream emissions are emitted while the car is in use, including those emitted from the tailpipe or from evaporation during fueling. PHEVs operating on electricity and AEVs produce few downstream emissions, but they are not emissions free. Determining the emissions from charging a plug-in EV relative to an ICEV depends largely on the sources of the electricity used to charge the vehicle. Research has also shown that emissions are further impacted by charging and usage patterns as well as the efficiency of an individual vehicle.", "Electricity generation in the United States produced more greenhouse gases and other pollutants than any other sector between 1990 and 2017.

However, national averages obscure regional variation in potential emissions from the mix of fuel sources used for electricity generation ( Figure 8 ).", "For plug-in EVs, per-mile emissions attributed to upstream sources vary geographically. An AEV would be expected to produce fewer emissions on average if charged in the state of Washington where 70% of electricity is produced with hydropower than if charged in Hawaii where 69% of electricity is produced with oil. Additionally, sources for electricity may change over time, resulting in changing emissions for PHEVs and AEVs\u00e2\u0080\u0094new and otherwise.", "Emissions attributed to upstream sources also depend on the time of day and year when charging takes place. Typically, electrical power systems leverage different electricity generation units to meet electricity demand, shifting electricity generation sources throughout the day or year as demand changes.
