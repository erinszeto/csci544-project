Deployment of the technologies and products has been primarily through no- and low-cost routes, such as the normal overhaul process or procedural changes. However, fuel efficiency has not been given a high priority in future system design. Fuel consumption enters design tradeoffs as one of many components of operating cost, and in most cases is one of the least important components because its benefits are so undervalued for reasons presented [elsewhere in the report].

These include a 1600dwt tanker Shin Aitoku Maru and a 26,000dwt bulk/log carrier Usuki Pioneer [ Figure 5 ]. In Denmark, Knud E Hansen has designed a 50,000dwt-class bulk carrier, and today in Germany, more research is being handled by Sail Log into a 50,000dwt Panamax bulker with 20,000m 2 of sail. Traditional square rigs have been chosen by this company because they are known to work satisfactorily, but alternatives do exist, including the more revolutionary Walker Wingsail [ Figure 6 ].", "The long-haul bulk trades (traditionally not in need of express service) have been identified by the German team as most suitable for sail assistance, or even full sail, because the principal bulk trades run more or less in a north-south direction in parallel with the globe's principal wind systems. Sail Log is part of Schwab-Orga GmbH, which holds the patent to a modern square-rigged design with automated sails....", "Sail Log claims that the running costs of an automated sail-assisted bulk carrier could be 22% lower than those of a fully diesel-powered vessel, although in general, it has to be said that figures appear to vary quite dramatically, depending on the source. Sail Log estimates that sails could normally be used for two-thirds of a voyage. A model has been built and has confirmed all propulsive predictions.", "Cooke Associates, an engineering consulting firm in Cambridge, England, that has worked with wingsail developers, states that in evaluations conducted between 1984 and 1993, the Usuki Pioneer and another sail-equipped ship called the Aqua City claimed a fuel reduction of 30%-40% in ideal wind conditions, but that the projects were terminated due to falling oil prices and high maintenance costs.", "An 8-ton version of the Walker wingsail, Cooke states, was evaluated in 1986-1988 aboard the MV Ashington, a small commercial vessel. Due to low fuel costs at the time and limits on usable wind in the ship's trading routes, Cooke, states, the firm that operated the ship decided that wingsail did not meet the firm's payback criteria.

Further consideration of sail-assist retrofit and/or new building is recommended.", "In 1995, the Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy funded a study by Consulting Naval Architects and Marine Engineers Knud E.

The effect of varying the average speed was investigated. A product carrier was chosen as study example. The study pointed out some of the commercial limitations of WindShip-application at present time. It proved uneconomical to use WindShips on typical product carrier routes. A cost increase of approximately 10% was calculated when comparing the WindShip with an equal-sized conventional product carrier.", "The results showed that by lowering the average speed of a conventional ship by 1 knot a reduction of approximately 25% in fuel consumption could be achieved. However, by adding the rig of the WindShip on average an additional three tons of fuel per 24 hrs could be saved in the more windy areas. This corresponded to 10-15% of the total fuel consumption....", "On the economical side the results may be less inspiring at first sight. There is no doubt that the results were both reliable and realistic. However, the main conclusion that emerged was that a product carrier is not the preferred choice for a modern WindShip. There was no economical advantage in using a WindShip, instead it cost 10% more to sail with. Worse yet, the fuel savings were marginal, under certain assumptions and conditions a WindShip even consumed more fuel than a conventional ship.", "However, on the route between Rotterdam, Holland and New York, USA an average HFO [heavy fuel oil] saving of 20.5 to 27% was shown, depending on average speed. It was only here that the average wind speed of 8 m/s initially estimated during phase 1 could be found. Decisions on sail area etc. were based on this estimate early on in phase 2 [1998-1999] of the\u00a0project.", "At the same time the feasibility study showed that the comparison had been made at a sub-optimal speed for a WindShip. Calculations using 11 knots instead of 13 lowered the required freight rate with up to 5%. Due to the special requirements of the product carrier trade the larger internal volume of a WindShip was not used to its advantage in the study.", "Taking the above issues into account we see the potential of modern WindShips concept. If speed is reduced, but same productivity is maintained due to the larger volumes carried, money will be saved. It is in this market segment that the WindShip should operate. Careful routing, including effects of seasonal weather variations could then prove the WindShip both environmentally beneficial and economically favourable.", "As of 2003, there was continued interest, at least among maritime researchers in Japan, in developing oceangoing commercial ships with high-performance hybrid-sails similar to those on the Windship."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Kites", "paragraphs": ["Sails on masts have certain potential disadvantages.

But the Panama Canal limits masts to 60 metres, and collapsable masts would be prohibitively expensive to build, operate and service....", "The cost of retrofitting a cargo ship with a row of masts, and strengthening its hull and deck to dissipate the additional stress, was estimated at euro10m ($12.5m).

This time, there is strong evidence that recent fuel cost increases aren't going to be temporary, and environmental restrictions will become increasingly draconian.", "Conventional masted sail solutions have inherent limitations which will continue to delay their application long past the point where wind-assist can become cost effective. The ability to design massive sail power without need for ballast, without fixed masts interfering with loading and unloading procedures, without adding hundreds of tons and tens of millions of dollars to build costs is critical. The ability to retrofit existing vessels cheaply and efficiently is paramount. The ability to build, repair and maintain systems remote from shipboard, eliminating downtime is an important asset; KiteShip has understood these advantages for decades. We have been readying appropriate technology for commercial tethered flight sailing since 1978.", "One of the principals of KiteShip, Dave Culp, stated in a 2003 interview:", "In studying attempts to bring back commercial sailing ships in the 1980's, it struck me that they were doomed to fail for the same reasons commercial sail failed in the 19 th century. The cost of the equipment, expressed as a rate of amortization, was far higher than powered vessels, even including their fuel. Second, the fundamental inability to schedule wind power\u00a0plays havoc with effectively utilizing expensive ships. Motor sailing was and is possible to fix this, but requires parallel systems on the boat\u2014wind plus diesel\u2014at even higher total cost.", "Kites, on the other hand, can be added to existing ships. They take up no deck space, require minimal retro-fitting, need no ballast, fit under bridges and can be taken in out of the weather when not in use. They can be taken off the boat for maintenance and even used on a second boat when/if adverse or no wind is expected aboard the first. These factors dramatically decrease the capital cost of the sailing rig, thus the amortization rate. If added to existing vessels, especially if the vessels are partially depreciated already, it becomes very cost effective to fit a single ship with both power (which it has) and kites (which are cheap).

Further, the Committee requests that the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics prepare a report for the congressional defense committees on the Defense Department's assessment, use, and plans to continue to explore the potential of synthetic fuels, to include fuels produced through the Fischer-Tropsch process.
