The White House vowed to veto any bill that supports the acquisition of F-22s beyond the 187 that had been procured through FY2009.", "In past years, the issue of how many F-22s to procure has been a topic of apparent disagreement between the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Air Force leaders, with OSD supporting a total of 183 (now 187), and Air Force officials supporting procurement of substantially more than that. Disagreement on the issue appeared to come to a head in June 2008, when Secretary of Defense Robert Gates asked the Secretary of the Air Force and the Air Force Chief of Staff to resign. It was reported in press articles, and later confirmed by the former Air Force Secretary, Michael Wynne, that their reluctance to support a total of no more than 183 F-22s was the key factor leading to their resignations. ", "The potential costs of restarting production (discussed in \" Potential Production Restart \" above) may significantly change the economic argument for procuring more F-22s, were the United States to bear all of the restart costs.

A projected Air Force fighter gap of up to 800 aircraft by 2024 that Air Force officials identified in 2008 testimony is open to question, because the projection is strongly influenced by assumptions on threats and whether the United States will fight alone or as part of a coalition. Even if such a fighter gap does emerge, procuring F-22s is not necessarily the most cost-effective way to address it\u2014other potential options for addressing the shortfall would include procuring less expensive aircraft, such as F-35s, upgraded F-15s, or upgraded F-16s.", "Advocates of acquiring additional F-22s could argue one or more of the following:", "In the fall of 2011, the Obama Administration announced a reorienting of U.S defense strategy to focus on the Pacific. (See CRS Report R42448, Pivot to the Pacific? The Obama Administration's \"Rebalancing\" Toward Asia , coordinated by [author name scrubbed].) With the deployment distances and air defense environments found in the Pacific theater, it is uncertain whether the current number of F-22s would be sufficient to meet U.S. strategic goals. As the Air Force continues to gain operating experience with F-22s, the aircraft's mission-capable rate will increase, and F-22 maintenance costs per flight hour will come down. F-22 mission-capable rates are increasing. (See \" Reliability and Maintainability of In-Service F-22s \" below.)

They could argue that resolving instability problems with the F-22's advanced avionics has been a significant contributor to the program's development cost, and that adding a new feature such as an air-to-ground radar or new communications capabilities could jeopardize the progress that has been made in the F-22's avionics software.

The committee was informed that, with new production of the F-22A coming to an end, the Air Force intends to stop reporting within the SAR system on the F-22A, despite the fact that there could be as much as $11.7 billion remaining to be spent on defined F-22A upgrade programs. The committee believes the category `major defense acquisition programs' is not limited only to programs that are acquiring brand new weapon systems, and that any F-22A program for modifications or upgrades, if it would otherwise meet the statutory definition of a major defense acquisition program, should be treated that way. ", "The committee believes there is ample justification for continuing to track F-22A modernization past the end of new production. ", "(1) In April 2012, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report on the program to modernize the F-22A Raptor fleet, estimated to cost almost $10.0 billion through 2023. In this report, GAO noted that similar efforts to modernize Air Force and Navy tactical fighters in the past involved building upgrades into newly produced jets, resulting in entirely new, fresh airplanes. ", "(2) In another report, issued in May 2012, GAO found that the total projected cost to modernize the F-22A Raptor fighter jet more than doubled from $5.4 billion to $11.7 billion since the program started and the schedule for delivering full capabilities slipped 7 years from 2010 to 2017. ", "(3) Upgrades to the F-22A are much more complicated than those made to other legacy fighters, giving rise to likelihood of schedule slips and cost growth. ", "(4) With these factors in mind, GAO believes that many of the Air Force's F-22A Raptors may not get their long-promised capability upgrades until they will have, in some cases, expended as much as 20 percent of their service lives. This could limit the amount of utility the Air Force will be able to extract from this enormously expensive modernization program. ", "F-22A Raptor Sustainment ", "In addition to the near-term modernization, sustainment over the life cycle of a weapon system represents a significant expenditure of resources. On average, about two-thirds of the total life cycle cost of a major defense system lies in post-production\u2014in its operation and sustainment over its useful life. If that rule were to hold true, with a charge of roughly $79.0 billion to buy the F-22A, the Air Force could be facing a demand for roughly $160.0 billion in F-22A sustainment costs. Moreover, under its `structures retrofit program', over the next few years the Air Force will need more than $100.0 million to retrofit the F-22A fleet just to ensure these aircraft can fly for the full 8,000 hours for which they were designed. Over just the last 2 years, the Air Force issued sole-source contracts for sustainment of the F-22A fleet to the prime contractor totaling almost $1.4 billion. ", "The Air Force recently completed an F-22A sustainment strategy review that concluded that a joint contractor/government approach could save more than $1.0 billion in sustainment costs over the life of the aircraft. The committee believes that the Air Force must transition its sustainment strategy to adopt the least expensive sustainment strategy now, while continuing to be aggressive in exploring opportunities to compete F-22A sustainment work. ", "F-22A Raptor Pilot Air-Supply Problems ", "The Air Force has been having problems with the oxygen-supply for its F-22A Raptor pilots. The committee is aware of, and has been closely monitoring, these problems. The Air Force has documented 11 reported incidents of hypoxia-like symptoms in 10,000 sorties (about 0.1 percent) since late 2011, with 6 of these incidents having occurred as recently as February and March 2012. Since reports of pilots experiencing hypoxia-like symptoms in flight first arose, the Secretary of the Air Force, among other actions, directed the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) to conduct a quick-look study; gather and evaluate information; and recommend any corrective actions on aircraft using on-board oxygen generation systems. Unfortunately, to date, the Air Force has not been able to identify conclusively a root cause for the problem. But, the committee has been assured that the Air Force has put in place measures intended to ensure that these aircraft are safe to fly, including new commercial oxygen status sensors and emergency oxygen handles in the aircraft. For this reason, after having grounded the fleet after initial reports of hypoxia-related symptoms in its pilots late last year, the Air Force returned the F-22A to flying under its full mission envelope and, in fact, deployed it to Southwest Asia and the United Arab Emirates in late April. Despite that a small number of pilots have asked not to fly the F-22A or to be reassigned because of this issue, Air Force leadership has conveyed to the committee that, while the Air Force continues to investigate this problem, these aircraft are safe to fly today. ", "Notably, the Navy had similar problems with F-18s; there were 64 incidents from 2002 to 2009, resulting in 2 deaths. Ultimately, however, the Navy overcame these problems. The committee remains hopeful that the Air Force will be similarly successful. In the meantime, the committee will continue to exercise close oversight of this problem and how the Air Force addresses it.
