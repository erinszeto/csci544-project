Congress has repeatedly taken action on the issue through water and soil legislation, often as part of omnibus farm bills. Early policy decisions were directed at addressing natural resource concerns on the farm, primarily reducing high levels of soil erosion and providing water to agriculture in quantities and quality that enhanced farm production. In more recent years, conservation policy has shifted to concerns about the off-farm impacts of agricultural activities.", "The latest farm bill, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246), reauthorized most existing conservation programs, modified several programs, and created a few new programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) conservation efforts have centered on implementing these conservation programs through working land conservation practices, retiring land from production or establishing conservation easements, and providing technical assistance. Program implementation controversies could lead to congressional oversight or action, especially given the recent financial statement audit reports on conservation program payments at USDA.", "Other emerging issues in the 111th Congress could have a significant impact on agricultural conservation. The climate change debate and use of ecosystem services markets has brought conservation to the forefront of discussion on the role of agriculture in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the effect of ethanol production on natural resources and changes in land use is an ongoing concern in the area of biofuels policy. Other environmental issues for agriculture such as concentrated animal feeding operation regulations, greenhouse gas emission reporting for livestock producers, and wetlands mitigation could lead to expanded opportunities and challenges for many conservation efforts.", "Appropriations and budget issues continue to influence conservation programs and policy. Conservation programs with mandatory funding have been routinely reduced through annual appropriation bills. In FY2009 and FY2010, the reductions were limited to a handful of programs, with the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) receiving the largest reductions, including $270 million in FY2009 and FY2010. The watershed programs have experienced an increase in congressionally directed projects through appropriations, with Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations being 97% earmarked in FY2009 and 74% in FY2010. The ongoing issue of funding for conservation technical assistance in mandatory programs will likely be raised again due to an expiring authority.", "Other issues of potential interest in the 111th Congress include implementation of conservation program payment and income limitations, use of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project, and recent financial audits and conservation contract administration concerns."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Agricultural conservation has been a public policy issue for more than 60 years, an issue repeatedly recast as new problems have emerged or old problems have resurfaced. Early conservation efforts were focused on two themes\u2014reducing high levels of soil erosion and providing water to agriculture in quantities and quality that enhanced farm production.", "Congress responded repeatedly to these themes by creating or revising programs designed to reduce resource problems on the farm. By the early 1980s, however, concern was growing that these programs were not adequately dealing with environmental problems resulting from agricultural activities (especially off the farm). Publicized instances of significant problems, especially high soil erosion rates said to rival the dust bowl era, increased awareness and intensified the policy debate. In 1985, conservation policy took a new direction when Congress enacted four major new conservation programs in the conservation title of the Food Security Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-198 ): the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Sodbuster, Conservation Compliance, and Swampbuster. These programs, all administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), were the first conservation programs designed to deal with environmental problems related to the off-farm impacts of agricultural activities.", "Provisions enacted in subsequent farm bills, including in 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, reflect a rapid evolution of the conservation agenda, including the growing influence of environmentalists and other non-agricultural interests in the formulation of conservation policy, and a recognition that agriculture was not treated like other business sectors in many environmental laws. Congress also began funding many of these new programs through mandatory spending for the first time, using the borrowing authority of USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) as the funding mechanism instead of annual appropriations. In addition to the original soil erosion and water quality and quantity issues, the conservation agenda has continued to expand to address other natural resource concerns such as wildlife habitat, air quality, wetlands restoration and protection, energy efficiency, and sustainable agriculture.", "Many conservation programs receive continued support among producers and Congress, as evidenced by the recent reauthorization and expansion of existing programs and creation of new ones in the most recent farm bill (Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246 ). The enacted bill addressed several emerging issues, such as payment structure, geographic targeting, program complexity, the importance of large-scale conservation efforts, and measurement of costs and effectiveness. Funding also played a large role in the 2008 farm bill debate as a pronounced domestic budget constraint caused several conservation groups to compete with other farming interests for the necessary resources to expand and continue many conservation programs. Many of these general policy issues were central to outcomes in the enacted conservation title of the farm bill."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Major Activities", "paragraphs": ["USDA's conservation efforts have centered in recent years on implementing conservation programs that target working lands, remove land from production (also known as retiring land) or create conservation easements, and provide technical assistance.

Recent trends in policy for the suite of conservation programs include less emphasis on land retirement and on land producing row crops, and more attention to conservation on land in other agricultural uses and to livestock producers. Congress in the 2008 farm bill expanded many program benefits to include specialty crop producers, producers transitioning to organic production, forested and managed lands, pollinator habitat and protection, and nutrient and pest management.", "Lead agricultural conservation agencies within USDA are the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which provides technical assistance and administers most programs, and the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which administers the largest program, CRP.

General sign-ups are specified enrollment periods during which landowners compete nationally to enroll their land in the CRP. Following the expiration of acres in 2009, which reduced the total enrolled acres below the 32 million acre cap, a general sign-up was expected to enroll additional acres. During a June 2010 hearing before the House Committee on Agriculture, USDA was questioned about the delay in offering a CRP general sign-up. In response, USDA indicated that an executive branch control on mandatory program spending, often referred to as administrative PAYGO, resulted in delayed implementation of CRP, including enrolling additional acres. While Congress may have the understanding that it has given USDA statutory authority and access to mandatory funding to enroll 32 million acres, as well as the expectation that the authority would be used, the process outlined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) appears to have prevented USDA from reaching that goal, at least for a time.", "USDA eventually announced a new general sign-up in August 2010 (sign-up number 39). Unlike continuous sign-up, general sign-up is always competitive. Approximately 85% of CRP acreage (26.7 million of 31.3 million acres) is currently enrolled through general sign-up. For this most recent general sign-up, FSA enrolled 4.3 million acres of 4.8 million acres offered.

Mandatory funding for EQIP has grown substantially from its FY2002 level of $200 million, to the authorized level of $1.75 billion in FY2012. Despite this significant increase in authorized mandatory funding, annual appropriations acts have reduced the actual funding levels by a total of nearly $1.16 billion from FY2005 through FY2010. Some of this reduction has come at the request of both the current and previous Administrations. The number of pending applications continues to exceed the amount of available funding ( Table 1 ). In 2009, 37% of eligible applications were funded. Many conservation groups are concerned that this has deterred producers from applying and enrolling in the program.

NRCS implements CSP through a final rule published in the Federal Register on June 3, 2010. Applications for CSP are accepted on a continuous basis and ranked and funded based on established cut-off dates. During the first sign-up period in FY2010, NRCS funded over 10,600 contracts enrolling approximately 12.7 million acres. States enrolling the most applications were Missouri (1,007), Minnesota (906), and Iowa (729).", "One possible implementation issue with the new CSP could be similar to one faced by the old CSP\u2014cost restrictions. NRCS argued that because the 2002 farm bill placed a statutory 15% limit on technical assistance cost to administer CSP, program implementation was constrained. The new CSP could face similar implementation concerns owing to a 2008 farm bill requirement that the program achieve a national average program cost of $18 per acre. This per-acre cost includes all financial assistance paid to the producer, technical assistance, and any other expense associated with enrollment or participation in the program. Depending on the cost of implementing CSP, the total per-acre payment offer to producers during a sign-up could be reduced in order to meet the average $18 per-acre cost requirement. This lower per-acre funding level could also impact the type of acres enrolled if NRCS must enroll 12.7 million acres annually.

By previously offering support for wildlife habitat projects on all land and aquatic areas, WHIP provided an assistance option to landowners who were unable to meet the specific eligibility requirements of other USDA conservation programs. The new requirement of agricultural production could shift financial assistance for WHIP contracts away from the traditionally large-allocation states in the Northeast to more agriculturally intensive states in the West and Midwest.

Because previous language only addressed those programs authorized under the 1985 farm bill, the issue of where technical assistance funding should originate for non-1985 farm bill programs was once again raised. On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted clarifying language for this issue in Section 103 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ). The new language allows all mandatory programs established or amended in the 2008 farm bill, excluding those in Title I, to use CCC funds for administrative expenses and technical assistance. Congress will likely need to address this issue again because the new language only covers FY2009 and FY2010, while funding authority for most farm bill programs expires at the end of FY2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Audit and Contract Administration", "paragraphs": ["Most USDA agencies are covered by a consolidated financial statement audit for the entire department.

Although the project is not legislatively mandated, many believe its potential outcomes could prove useful in shaping future policy debates surrounding environmental issues in the 111 th Congress, namely environmental services markets.", "Despite some of the strides made to quantify the environmental benefits of conservation practices through CEAP, there are possible limitations to its use, namely the availability of data. To date, the depth of information gathered through this project is enormous, yet very little has been made available to the public or to other federal agencies. Despite some frustration generated by reporting delays, some in the scientific community support what they say is a meticulous in-depth assessment and evaluation system, claiming it is necessary for statistical credibility. Only a few initial results are currently available based on cropland in the upper Mississippi river basin. Initial findings show beneficial effects from conservation practices as well as additional application needs.

Market-based approaches are often viewed as encompassing broader societal benefits by complementing existing agricultural conservation programs and evolving regulatory approaches intended to address environmental improvements in the farm and forestry sectors. Among the principal questions regarding the inclusion of ecosystem services provisions as part of any major legislative initiative is whether the agriculture and forestry sectors can effectively provide environmental goods and services along with the more traditional food, fiber, and other services these sectors already provide.", "Ecosystem goods and services are the benefits society obtains from the environment and ecosystems, both natural and managed, such as water filtration, flood control, provision of habitat, carbon storage, and many others. In most cases, these constitute \"free services,\" since landowners and managers are not compensated in the marketplace. The continued degradation of these services over time has generated interest in creating markets, developed either through regulation or voluntarily, so that providers of ecosystem services can be compensated in private markets for the services they provide. This could offer a potential business opportunity to the agriculture and forestry sectors, which may be able to provide for such services and participate in the market, for example, by creating, restoring, and preserving function and value in a natural resources area, or by capturing and storing carbon before gases that contribute to global climate change are released into the atmosphere. These services would be in addition to the food and fiber services traditionally supplied by the agriculture and forestry sectors.", "Conservation practices on agricultural land provide one of the main vehicles through which producers may develop environmental credits and benefits to be sold or traded in a market-based system. Many existing USDA conservation programs offer incentives through financial and technical assistance to implement these practices. For example, cropland tillage practices such as reduced/medium-till, no-till, and ridge/strip-till practices sequester carbon that could be sold through a carbon offset program. Conservation programs such as EQIP, AMA, CSP, and CTA provide incentives for farmers to install these practices. Programs such as WRP offer incentives for wetland restoration, the benefits of which could then be used in a wetlands mitigation program. Other conservation practices such as riparian buffers, setbacks, wind breaks, and buffer strips offered under EQIP, CRP, CSP and WHIP create water quality improvements that could be traded in local water quality credit programs.", "The inclusion of these market provisions in legislation has raised procedural and implementation questions as Congress continues to consider the role of the agriculture and forestry sectors in environmental legislation. One key question is how USDA will respond to several existing barriers that may prevent the development of ecosystem goods and services markets involving the farm and forestry sectors, such as participation challenges, and issues of measuring and valuing credits, monitoring, and enforcement, among others.

As reported by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the agriculture and forestry sectors currently account for 6%-8% of estimated total U.S. GHG emissions annually. However, combined carbon sequestration on farm and forested lands is currently estimated to mitigate about 11% of total annual GHG emissions in the United States. The potential to reduce emissions and sequester carbon on agricultural lands is reportedly much greater than current rates.", "Congress is considering a range of climate change policy options, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction programs that would either mandate or authorize a cap-and-trade program to reduce GHG emissions. In general, the current legislative proposals would not require emission reductions in the agriculture and forestry sectors. The drafters of some proposals are reluctant to include opportunities for agriculture and forestry participation due to uncertainties regarding measuring, monitoring, and permanence of agriculture and forestry activities. Others in Congress would like a GHG program to include provisions allowing farm and forestry landowners to receive emissions allowances (or credits) to generate carbon offsets.", "Most land management and farm conservation practices can help reduce GHG emissions and/or sequester carbon, including land retirement, conservation tillage, soil management, and manure and animal feed management, among other practices. Many of these practices are encouraged under existing USDA conservation programs that provide financial and technical assistance to farmers, such as EQIP, CRP, CSP, CTA, and WHIP, among others. However, uncertainties are associated with implementing these types of practices depending on site-specific conditions, the type of practice, how well it is implemented, the length of time a practice is undertaken, and available funding, among other factors.", "USDA has already expanded some of its existing conservation programs to further encourage emission reductions and carbon sequestration. For example, many of the practices encouraged under EQIP and CSP reduce net emissions. Programs such as CTA, AMA, EQIP, and CSP list a reduction in emissions as a national priority for the program, which affects the funding and ranking of projects. Under CRP, USDA has modified how it scores and ranks offers to enroll land in CRP in order to place greater weight on installing vegetative covers that sequester carbon. USDA also has an initiative under CRP's continuous enrollment provision to plant up to 500,000 acres of bottomland hardwoods, which are among the most productive U.S. lands for sequestering carbon. Recently, USDA has recognized the potential credits generated by these conservation programs and has removed any claim on the credits through recent changes to many of the program rules. Whether or not benefits generated from existing conservation programs would be considered eligible carbon offsets under current legislative proposals varies.", "Congress has already taken steps to address some of the challenges associated with measuring carbon changes from forested and agricultural lands and practices. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions that could expand the scope of existing land-based conservation and other farm bill programs by providing incentives to encourage farmers and landowners to sequester carbon and reduce emissions associated with climate change and participate in markets for carbon storage (see \" Environmental Services Markets \" section, above). The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-140 , Sec. 712) directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a methodology to assess carbon sequestration and emissions from ecosystems. This methodology is to cover measuring, monitoring, and quantifying GHG emissions and reductions, and provide estimates of sequestration capacity and the mitigation potential of different ecosystem management practices.

Energy sources closely tied to the agriculture and forestry sectors are biofuels derived from corn-based ethanol and cellulosic feedstock. Federal support for ethanol through mandated levels of consumption, grants and loan guarantees, tax credits, tariffs on imports, and research and development projects has generated some controversy. Critics say that important and unwanted environmental consequences resulting from the production of biofuels should be considered when evaluating renewable energy options.", "A continued expansion of corn-based ethanol production could have significant consequences for traditional U.S. agricultural crop production and rural economies. Supporters of an expanded renewable fuels standard (RFS, the statutorily required use of renewable fuels) claim that increased biofuels production and use would produce enormous agricultural and rural economic benefits by increasing farm and rural incomes and generating substantial rural employment opportunities. However, large-scale shifts in agricultural production activities will likely also have important regional economic consequences that have yet to be fully considered or understood. As corn prices rise, so too does the incentive to expand corn production to more marginal soil environments. Further, corn production is among the most energy-intensive of the major field crops. This shift could have important and unwanted environmental consequences due to possible increases in fertilizer and chemical use and soil erosion.", "Ethanol and biodiesel produced from cellulosic feedstocks, such as prairie grasses and fast-growing trees, have the potential to improve the energy and environmental effects of U.S. biofuels. A key potential benefit of cellulosic feedstocks is that they can be grown without the need for chemicals. Reducing or eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers could address one of the largest energy inputs for corn-based ethanol production. However, additional concerns about cellulosic feedstocks exist, including concerns that required increases in per-acre yields to obtain economic feasibility could require the use of fertilizers; that availability of sufficient feedstock supply is limited and expansion could generate additional land use pressures for expanded production; and that development of harvesting machinery and technology lags behind that of traditional corn-based ethanol production. In addition to these concerns, some groups say that other potential environmental drawbacks associated with cellulosic fuels should be addressed, such as the potential for soil erosion, increased runoff, the spread of invasive species, and disruption of wildlife habitat.", "Although the 2008 farm bill expands many existing agricultural conservation programs to encourage producers to adopt energy efficiency measures and produce renewable energy feedstocks, it does not address the potential environmental consequences that could result from biofuels production. Expanding existing conservation efforts or creating new ones can serve as a potential countermeasure to the increased environmental pressures generated by biofuel production.

Amendments to the Waxman/Markey climate change and energy legislation ( H.R. 2454 ) would change the EISA biomass definition to the definition in the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) and prevent EPA (for at least six years) from including emissions from international indirect land use changes when weighing biofuels' carbon footprint under the 2007 RFS."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
