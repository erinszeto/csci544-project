The Archives would also be directed to transmit physical and electronic copies to the Judiciary Committee chairs of the Senate and House of Representatives. One relevant constitutional amendment has also been introduced to date in the 115th Congress, H.Con.Res. 73.

To date in 2017, three states have submitted applications for a convention to consider a balanced budget as proposed by the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) Task Force.

According to one estimate, more than 700 have been filed since 1789, most of which have been proposed since 1900. They have included applications for a general convention and petitions for a convention to consider single-subject amendments in an estimated 47 issue areas. In the second half of the 20 th century, two campaigns for Article V Conventions approached the constitutional threshold of applications from two-thirds of the states, 34 at present. Mounted largely between 1964 and 1983, they concerned politically sensitive issues: apportionment in state legislatures, which gained 33 state applications between 1964 and 1969, and an amendment requiring a balanced federal budget under most circumstances, which gained 32 applications between 1975 and 1983. After reaching these high water marks, the reapportionment proposal lost momentum following the death of its leading advocate, while the balanced budget amendment campaign stalled in the face of growing opposition. The Article V Convention alternative returned to relative obscurity for more than 20 years. Between 1988 and 2010, 17 state legislatures passed resolutions rescinding their earlier calls for a convention. In some cases, these resolutions rescinded all previous Article V applications, while others specifically cited a convention for a balanced budget amendment.", "Late in the first decade of the 21st century, interest in the Article V Convention revived among a range of advocacy groups. Originally linked to the Tea Party movement and organizations generally characterized as conservative and populist, the most widely advocated convention subjects included an amendment or amendments to require a balanced federal budget, restrict the federal debt, and set general limitations on the authority and activities of the federal government. The Article V Convention's appeal spread, however, as self-identified progressive movements, such as Occupy Wall Street, began to advocate a convention for such purposes as overturning parts of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, changing the definition of corporate personhood, or banning allegedly restrictive state voter identification requirements. The convention option is arguably attractive on several grounds: It springs unquestionably from the \"original intent\" of the founders, the need for state applications suggests widespread popular grass-roots origins, and the prospect of proposing amendments directly to the states offers an alternative to what some have characterized as a legislative and policy deadlock at the federal level.", "The revival of the Article V Convention option is arguably reflected in the actions of state legislatures. According to the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force, an Article V Convention advocacy group, since 2010, 15 states have reversed earlier rescissions of convention applications. Conversely, since 2016, five states have rescinded their earlier convention applications, suggesting the growth of \"second thoughts\" in some states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Issues in Brief", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is the Standard for a Valid Application?", "paragraphs": ["A number of questions have been raised concerning the standard for a valid Article V Convention application.

What sort of convention application meets Article V's constitutional requirements? Did the framers of Article V contemplate state applications for (1) a general convention; (2) a convention to consider a single issue, such as a balanced budget amendment; or (3) a convention to consider a specific amendment, the text of which has been included or identified in the petition? Or does it give sanction to all of these alternatives?", "Some observers hold that only applications for a \"general\" convention, those that do not cite a specific policy issue or amendment, are valid. Other commentators maintain that state applications for an Article V Convention must address the same issue in order to be counted toward the two-thirds threshold established by the Constitution. Most scholars agree that applications proposing a specifically worded amendment would not meet the constitutional standard. Congress has, however, received applications calling for an Article V Convention that would consider a particular, specifically worded, amendment. The practice was most common in the 1980s, utilized by the campaign for a convention to consider a balanced budget amendment. A number of states during that period included the text of the proposed amendment in their applications. At present, the following organizations, \"Compact for America,\" \"Single Subject Amendment,\" and \"Restoring Freedom\" all propose conventions to consider specifically worded amendments, notwithstanding the opinion expressed by the House Judiciary Committee in 1993 that an application requesting an up-or-down vote on a specifically worded amendment cannot be considered valid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contemporaneity", "paragraphs": ["Another question concerns the issue of timeliness or contemporaneity: is a state application for a convention valid forever, or does it have a limited \"shelf life\"?

Some argue that state applications are valid for seven years, the same length of time as the ratification window established in the 20 th century for most amendments proposed by Congress. Others suggest a shelf life of two to four years for state applications. Conversely, the great majority of Article V Convention supporters generally assert that state applications are valid indefinitely, and that Congress has no authority to set a deadline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rescission", "paragraphs": ["A further issue centers on the question of whether states have the constitutional authority to repeal or rescind earlier applications for an Article V Convention. Over the years, some state legislatures have passed resolutions retracting either one, some, or all of their previous applications. For instance, as noted earlier, between 1988 and 2010, an estimated 17 states passed such resolutions, although some have since rescinded their rescissions. Do states have the authority to rescind applications for an Article V Convention? Opinion is divided: some hold that the application process is only preliminary, and that states may withdraw their applications, so long as the two-thirds threshold has not been crossed.

One advocacy group, Friends of the Article V Convention (FOAVC), maintains that one application is as good as another, that applications are valid indefinitely, and that states cannot rescind their applications. It further asserts that as soon as Congress had received applications of any sort from two-thirds of the states in the union at that time, it had a constitutional obligation to call a convention.

FOAVC, cited earlier in this report, identifies over 700 applications on its website, filed from 49 states.

According to the National Archives, state applications have traditionally not been collected in a central repository, but are scattered through the holdings of the Center for Legislative Archives, generally filed with committee papers, and arranged by the Congress in which they were received. FOAVC has criticized this practice, asserting that \"Congress has failed miserably (most likely by design) at its duty to track and keep a count of all Article V Convention applications (so that they will know when two thirds of the states have met the prerequisite number for a peremptory Article V Convention).\" Beginning in 2013, Article V Convention activists accelerated their campaigns for an official congressional count of state applications, including petitions to both the House and Senate.

In addition, H.R. 1742 , the \"Article V Records Transparency Act of 2017,\" introduced in the 115 th Congress by Representative Luke Messer, would require the National Archives to make an organized compilation of all state applications for, and rescissions of applications for, an Article V Convention.

The single action of the requisite number of states agreeing to the Compact would, its proponents argue, set in motion the convention process through a series of \"conditional enactments,\" each of which would trigger the next step in the process, ultimately leading to ratification. Proponents claim the interstate compact device would speed up the process so that a convention could be called, convened, and adjourned and an amendment proposed and ratified within 12 months.", "The Compact seeks to anticipate and prescribe procedures for various elements in the Article V Convention process. A state's act of agreement to the Compact would constitute its application for an Article V Convention, the sole purpose of which would be to propose an amendment whose text is prescribed in the Compact. Participating states also agree to observe the Compact's provisions governing the convention's composition and rules of procedure. By agreeing to the Compact, states also commit themselves to \"prospective\" ratification of the proposed amendment. One distinguishing feature of the compact is its self-termination provision. The compact effectively limits itself to a seven-year lifespan: if it fails to gain membership by the requisite 38 states within seven years after the first state joins, the compact terminates, and is \"repealed, void ab initio , and held for naught.\"", "Since the CFA initiative would use an interstate compact as its vehicle for the convention, and since the Constitution requires congressional approval for such a compact, CFA provides model legislation for a concurrent resolution that could be used by Congress to call the convention.

We are not prepared to encourage state governments at this time to apply to Congress to call an amendments convention.", "More recently, however, a 2016 Heritage study appeared to be noncommittal on the subject, balancing concerns about a \"runaway convention\" with \"the need to maintain an overriding focus on holding Congress and the President, and, by extension, federal agencies accountable for the decisions they make today.\"", "Eagle Forum, which describes itself as a \"pro-family\" conservative public interest organization, founded and headed for many years by the late Phyllis Schlafly, has consistently opposed an Article V Convention since at least 1986, on the grounds that it could \"jeopardize our most basic liberties enshrined in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\" In July 2017, \"PS [Phyllis Schlafly] Eagles,\" a break-away group, also voiced opposition, asserting that anonymous financial supporters of a convention were pursuing a \"hidden agenda of globalism and open borders, views that they conceal with broad platitudes like 'limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government.'\"", "In January 2017, the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities cautioned against both a balanced budget amendment and an Article V Convention, asserting that \"state lawmakers considering such resolutions (applying for a convention) should be skeptical of claims being made by groups promoting the resolutions ... that states could control the actions or outcomes of a constitutional convention.

It warned of the dangers of a runaway convention and noted, \"There are no rules and guidelines in the U.S. Constitution on how a convention would work, which creates an opportunity for a runaway convention that could rewrite any constitutional right or protection currently available to American citizens.\" Earlier, in December 2015, Common Cause issued a position paper opposing an Article V Convention. The report observed that convention advocates cover a broad range of the political spectrum, but declared that \"Common Cause strongly opposes an Article V convention, even as we strongly support a constitutional amendment to reverse Citizens United .\" Specifically the report asserted that no existing judicial, legislative, or executive body would have authority over a convention; that lack of pre-existing procedures could lead to political manipulation of a convention; and that a convention could not be limited to a single issue, and that it might propose \"additional changes that could limit or eliminate fundamental rights or upend our entire system of government.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The Article V Convention alternative for amending the Constitution has enjoyed a revival in interest over the past decade. It has gained the support of activist organizations that embrace a broad range of the political spectrum, from the Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street and places in between. Its partisans appear to be active and committed, and the progress of some of these organizations toward their goal continues. It remains uncertain, however, whether any of them can attain the constitutional threshold of 34 convention applications. ", "Several factors may contribute to this condition. One observer, attorney David Guldenschuh, suggests that the proliferation of advocacy groups may actually dilute support for the overall concept as they compete for the limited time and attention of state legislators. The same observer notes that the more complex \"multi-subject\" strategies pursued by some groups may further vitiate the force of their arguments. A single-issue approach, he suggests, might enjoy a greater chance of success. For example, the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force, which advocates a convention that would consider only one issue\u2014a balanced federal budget requirement\u2014claims 28 applications, although 17 of these are \"legacy\" applications that filed more than 30 years ago and whose validity may be open to challenge. By comparison, no other Article V Convention advocacy group can claim more than 12 applications at this time. In addition, it is worth noting that the balanced federal budget amendment is arguably the best known and most widely supported of these proposals: Survey research results show consistent public support for a federal balanced budget amendment since at least 1994.", "Guldenschuh also cites what he claims is an apparent lack of coordination, noting that \"different advocacy groups have somewhat supported each other in states where multiple resolutions have been introduced, [but] their overall failure to work together is causing confusion among legislators and hurting the effort's overall success rate.\"", "Further, it is arguable that the Article V Convention remains largely an Internet or social media phenomenon, where it enjoys multiple websites and frequent postings among diverse elements of the advocacy community, both pro and con. By comparison, however, traditional media coverage is comparatively sparse, and, notwithstanding the aforementioned public support for a balanced federal budget amendment, the convention alternative does not appear to command widespread attention or support among the general public at this time.", "The number of state applications for a convention has grown in the past two years. While only the BBA, with 28 applications, including its \"legacy\" states, is within striking distance of the constitutional threshold, the Convention of States added four applications in 2017, bringing its total to 12 states. These gains, however, have arguably been balanced by four states that rescinded earlier applications in 2017. Going forward, advocates may assert that applications by the state legislatures will continue at the same pace. Conversely, it could also be argued that the movement's progress could lead to the same sort of \"second thoughts\" that slowed, and then stalled, the BBA campaign of the 1980s. To this may be added constitutional questions concerning state applications that would likely be raised if or when a convention call seemed imminent. For instance, are state applications submitted over 30 years ago still valid, and, what is the constitutional status of state actions to rescind their earlier applications? ", "Ultimately, it may be argued that the constitutional process is working as the founders planned. The Article V Convention device was intended to provide an alternative method of amendment, but it was also intended that a convention should enjoy a broad national consensus of support and meet similarly exacting standards as those that apply to amendments proposed in Congress. While the current campaign has generated considerable interest and advocacy among convention advocates, its awareness and support among the wider community appears to be limited. In order to succeed, the convention alternative would arguably need to attain the breadth of public awareness and active support necessary to meet the Constitution's demanding requirements."], "subsections": []}]}}
