Straight-line depreciation is used for structures, where equal amounts are deducted in each year. For equipment, deductions are accelerated, with larger amounts deducted in earlier years. Equipment is most commonly depreciated over 5 years or 7 years, but some short-lived assets are depreciated over 3 years and some longer-lived assets are depreciated over 10, 15, or 20 years. Nonresidential structures are depreciated over 39 years.

The presence of bonus depreciation or expensing would make some temporary provisions more important (such as the benefits for motorsports complexes, which would otherwise become ineligible) and some less important (such as shortening lives for racehorses or Indian reservation property, or expensing for films and television, which would have received the benefit regardless).

Initially, the provision was set to expire at the end of 2008.

Eligible productions are limited to those in which at least 75% of the compensation paid is for services performed in the United States. For productions that started before 2008, the expensing deduction is not allowed if the aggregate production cost exceeds $15 million ($20 million for productions in designated low-income and distressed communities).

The magnitude of the benefit depends on the average lag time from production to earning income. For many films, production costs would be deductible in the year the film is released. If the film is released one year after the production costs are incurred, which may be the case for independent and smaller productions, the provision accelerates cost recovery by one year. The benefit conferred by accelerating cost recovery deductions by one year is limited. Taxpayers with limited or no tax liability may derive little or no benefit from the expensing allowance.", "The primary policy objective of providing special tax incentives for film and television producers is to deter productions from moving overseas, lured by lower production costs as well as tax and other subsidies offered by foreign governments. Because live theatre is tied to audience location, runaway productions are not a concern.

However, if these provisions' main objective is to improve the economic status of individuals currently living on Indian reservations, it is not clear to what extent this tax subsidy will succeed, because it is not given directly to workers but instead is received by businesses. Capital subsidies may not ultimately benefit workers. It is possible that capital equipment subsidies may encourage more capital-intensive businesses and make workers relatively worse off.

The main conclusion from these studies is that the EZ, EC, and RC programs have not been shown to have caused a general improvement in the examined localities' economic conditions. One possible cause for this inability to empirically show the program effects on a large geographic area is that the EZ tax incentives are relatively small.

The NMTC is a competitively awarded tax credit overseen by the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, organized within the Department of the Treasury. For each NMTC round authorized by Congress, the CDFI Fund ranks all requests for NMTC allocation authority and grants awards to those CDEs that score highest.

All taxable investors, such as banks, venture capital firms, and other private investors, are eligible to receive the NMTC.

CDEs benefit from the NMTC because they charge fees to their investors for organizing the NMTC application and for structuring the financing for a portfolio of community development projects. The private investors benefit because they receive, each year over seven years, an annual tax credit equal to 5% to 6% of the total amount paid for the stock or capital interest in the CDE that they purchase. Overall, the tax credit amounts to 39% of the cost of the qualified equity investment (less the CDE's fees) as long as the interest in the investment is retained for the entire seven-year period. Thus, even if the community development project funded by the CDE incurs some losses, the value of the tax credit could generate a positive return for the private financers. ", "Opposition to the NMTC is partly based on the belief that corporations and higher-income investors primarily benefit from the provision or that the NMTC leads to an economically inefficient allocation of resources. For instance, while banks and other investors might benefit directly from the credit, a 2009 study found that the NMTC's benefits to selected low-income communities were modest. The study concluded that poverty and unemployment rates fall by statistically significant amounts in tracts that receive NMTC-subsidized investment relative to similar tracts that do not. From a national economic perspective, the NMTC's impact would be greatest in the case where the investment represents net investment in the U.S. economy rather than a shift in investment from one location to another.

Studies evaluating the credit have examined whether it increases job opportunities for targeted disadvantaged individuals, and whether the WOTC is a cost-effective policy measure for achieving this objective. ", "Early evidence on the WOTC suggested that although the credit did offset part of the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training WOTC-eligible employees, it had a limited effect on companies' hiring decisions. More recent studies have found that the WOTC provided benefits to certain groups: increasing the wage income of disabled veterans and increasing employment among long-term welfare recipients, for example. Researchers have also explored whether the credit causes employers to \"churn\" their workforce to take advantage of the credit, replacing currently credit-ineligible workers with credit-certified workers. Evidence of this behavior has not been found. ", "For more information on the WOTC, see CRS Report R43729, The Work Opportunity Tax Credit , by Benjamin Collins and Sarah A. Donovan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Look-Through Treatment of Payments Between Related Controlled Foreign Corporations45", "paragraphs": ["The temporary look-through rules were originally enacted in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-222 ), for 2006 through 2008, and subsequently extended. These rules effectively allow U.S. corporations to reduce tax paid by allowing them to shift the income of certain foreign subsidiaries in high-tax countries into a lower-taxed foreign subsidiary. ", "Depending on its source, income earned abroad by foreign-incorporated subsidiaries of U.S. parents is taxed at full rates, not taxed at full rates, or not taxed at all. Tax rules require passive income (such as interest income) and certain types of payments that can be easily manipulated to reduce foreign taxes to be taxed at the full rate (21% for a corporate shareholder) if earned by controlled foreign corporations (CFCs). This income is referred to as Subpart F income, reflecting the part of the tax code where treatment is specified. Credits against the U.S. tax imposed are allowed for any foreign taxes paid on this income, and are applied on an overall basis (so that unused foreign taxes in one country can offset taxes paid on income in another country). Other income earned abroad by CFCs is subject to the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provision, which taxes this foreign-source income at half the corporate tax rate (10.5%), after allowing a deduction for a deemed return of 10% on tangible assets. Credits are allowed for 80% of foreign taxes paid. This GILTI rate is scheduled to rise to 13.125% after 2025.", "Thus, some income (Subpart F) is taxed at the full rate, some income (GILTI) is taxed at partial rates, and some income (the deemed return from tangible assets) is not taxed. (For a more extensive discussion of international tax rules, see CRS Report R45186, Issues in International Corporate Taxation: The 2017 Revision (P.L. 115-97) , by Jane G. Gravelle and Donald J. Marples.)", "Unless an exception applies, Subpart F income includes dividends, interest, rent, and royalty payments between related firms. These items of income are subject to Subpart F because affiliated firms can use them to shift income and avoid taxation. For example, without Subpart F a U.S. parent's subsidiary (first-tier subsidiary) in a country without taxes (e.g., the Cayman Islands) could lend money to its own subsidiary (second-tier subsidiary) in a high-tax country. The interest payments would be deductible in the high-tax country, but no tax would be due in the no-tax country. Thus, an essentially paper transaction would shift income out of the high-tax country. A similar effect might occur if an intangible asset were transferred to the no-tax subsidiary, and then licensed in exchange for a royalty payment by the high-tax subsidiary. Subpart F taxes this income at full rates. ", "Methods of avoiding Subpart F taxation were made easier in 1997, when U.S. entity classification rules (to be a corporate or noncorporate entity) were simplified to allow checking a box on a form. These \"check-the-box\" regulations provided a way to avoid treatment of payments as Subpart F income under certain circumstances by allowing firms to elect treatment as an unincorporated entity. They were originally intended to simplify classification issues for domestic firms and the IRS, but their usefulness in international tax planning quickly became evident. The Treasury issued regulations in 1998 to disallow their use to avoid Subpart F, but withdrew them after protests from firms and some Members of Congress.", "In the example above, if the high-tax subsidiary is not a direct subsidiary of the U.S. parent but is a subsidiary of the Cayman Islands subsidiary (i.e., a second-tier subsidiary), the Cayman Islands (first-tier) subsidiary can elect to treat the high-tax subsidiary as if it were a pass-through entity. This treatment would effectively combine the two subsidiaries into a single firm. This outcome can be achieved simply by checking a box, making the high-tax subsidiary a disregarded entity under U.S. law. Because there are no separate firms, no income is recognized by the Cayman Islands firm, although the high-tax subsidiary (second tier) is still a corporation from the point of view of the foreign jurisdiction in which it operates and can deduct interest in the high-tax jurisdiction.", "The look-through rules expand the scope of check-the-box. The rules were originally enacted in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-222 ), for 2006 through 2008, and subsequently extended, most recently through 2020 in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 ( P.L. 116-94 ). The check-the-box rules do not work in every circumstance. For example, if the related firms do not have the same first-tier parent, check-the-box does not apply. In some cases, because of foreign countries' rules about corporate and noncorporate forms, the check-the-box regulations' classification of some entities as per se corporations make this planning unavailable. In addition, other undesirable tax consequences (from the firm's point of view) could occur as a side effect of check-the-box. The look-through rule effectively puts this check-the-box type of planning into the tax code, rather than implementing it as a regulation (which could be altered without legislation), but disconnects it from the check-the-box regulations' creation of a disregarded entity. Related firms do not have to have the parent-child relationship; they can be otherwise related as long as they are under common control. ", "The main argument against the look-through rules (and check-the-box as well) is that they undermine Subpart F's purpose, which is to prevent firms from using passive and easily shifted income to avoid taxation. The main argument for the provision is to allow firms the flexibility to redeploy earnings from one location to another without having U.S. tax consequences (foreign tax rules are unchanged). Firms could, for example, accomplish much of the treatment of look-through rules (even in the absence of check-the-box), but that may involve complex planning and inconvenience. An argument can also be made that in some cases (for example, with the payment of interest), the profit shifting is not harming the U.S. Treasury, but rather reducing taxes collected by foreign governments, as income is shifted out of high-tax countries into low-tax ones. Some might view this last argument as a \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" argument because it facilitates U.S. firms in using tax planning to reduce taxes paid to other countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Provisions Modifying the Excise Taxes on Wine, Beer, and Distilled Spirits47", "paragraphs": ["The temporary provisions modifying excise taxes on alcoholic beverages were originally enacted through 2019 in the 2017 tax revision (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, P.L. 115-97 ).
