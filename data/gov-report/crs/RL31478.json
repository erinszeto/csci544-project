The process was intended to provide an incentive to Congress and the President to reduce the deficitthrough legislative action to avoid an automatic sequestration. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990changed the focus of the sequestration process. Instead of maximum deficit targets, the BEA tiedsequestration to new statutory limits on discretionary spending and a \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO)requirement for new direct spending and revenue legislation. The change was intended to holdCongress and the President accountable for projected budget outcomes that would result from newlegislation, rather than the level of the deficit, which could be affected by factors beyond their directcontrol, such as economic growth, inflation, and demographic changes.

Sequestration is triggered if the OMB director estimates in the final sequestration reportthat one or more of the discretionary spending limits will be exceeded or the PAYGO requirementwill be violated. The President is required to issue a sequestration order cancelling budgetaryresources in non-exempt programs within the applicable spending category by the amount of anyspending limit breach or PAYGO violation. A within-session sequestration is possible if asupplemental appropriations bill causes the spending levels of the current fiscal year to exceed thestatutory limit for a particular category.

Therefore, an advantage of separate caps is thatthey ensure a violation and subsequent sequester in one category would not harm programs in othercategories.

According to the law, an emergency requirement is whatever Congressand the President agree to designate as such.

That is, Congress would be required to make offsetting cuts in ongoingprograms without knowing what specific situation or purpose it was financing, or even if all of thefunding would be needed. In contrast, under the current process, Congress can weigh the merits ofspending for ongoing programs with those of a specific emergency situation. Some may argue thatthis existing process allows Congress to make more rational budgetary tradeoffs.

If the BEA procedures are not extended beyond FY2002, the emergencydesignation issue will be irrelevant. If the BEA procedures are extended, proponents argue that newdiscretionary spending limits should assume a certain level of emergency spending, based on anhistorical average, making an adjustment for emergency-designated spending unnecessary.

On the other hand, annual action on budgetarymatters consumes a significant amount of Congress's time, resulting in a desire by some Membersto reduce the number or frequency of budget measures that need to be considered. One possiblereform that has been proposed to accomplish this is to change the budget cycle to 2 years from oneyear. (70) "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The efficient operation of an annual budget cycle is, in many ways, dependent on the timelyenactment of budgetary legislation. Consideration of budget questions in the form of concurrentresolutions on the budget, authorization measures, regular appropriations, supplementalappropriations, continuing resolutions, public debt legislation, revenue measures, and reconciliationbills are often closely linked so that delays in consideration of one measure will have an impact onseveral other budgetary measures. One consequence of this is that budgetary legislation, particularlyfinal action on regular appropriations measures, has significantly contributed to the need forextended congressional sessions. As shown in Table 3 , final action in recent years on the lastregular appropriations bill (either separately or as part of an omnibus measure) has occurred anaverage of 75 days after the start of the fiscal year on October 1. Considering budgetary legislationwith a duration of 2 years might be one way to reduce the likelihood that Congress would need toendure extended sessions as frequently.", " Table 3. Dates of Enactment of Last Regular AppropriationsLegislation, FY1996-FY2002", "Source: Calendars of the House of Representatives.", "One consistent source of support for biennial budgeting has been the presidency. Theadministrations of the past four Presidents have all supported the idea of biennial budgeting. (71) One of the most visibleexamples of this occurred during the Clinton Administration. The 1993 report of the NationalPerformance Review (the Gore report) noted, \"Considerable time could be saved--and used moreeffectively--in both the executive and legislative branches of government if budgets andappropriations were moved to a biennial cycle.\" (72) "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options and Discussion", "paragraphs": ["Because budgeting for the federal government encompasses a number of processes, biennialbudgeting can have several meanings. Biennial budgeting can involve 2-year budget resolutions,2-year appropriations, and multiyear authorizations. In addition, biennial budget proposals typicallyrequire that executive branch planning and performance reviews be revised so that they be based ona 2-year cycle.", "Typically, biennial budgeting proposals, such as H.R. 981 (107th Congress, theBudget Responsibility and Efficiency Act of 2001), include all three aspects of congressionalbudgeting, although proposals embracing only one or two are possible options. For example, thebiennial budgeting component of a reform proposal reported by the Senate Rules and AdministrationCommittee in 1994 ( S. 1824 , 103rd Congress, the Legislative Reorganization Act of1994) included 2-year budget resolutions and multiyear authorizations, but not 2-year appropriations. Another significant option concerns the period for which money will be appropriated. One optionwould be to retain the current system of fiscal years, and enact budgetary legislation allocatedbetween two one-year periods. Alternately, biennial appropriations could provide funding for theentire 2-year fiscal period, increasing flexibility for apportioning money over the course of thebiennium.", "Advocates of biennial budgeting feel that reducing the number of times that Congress hasto consider budget questions will likewise reduce the amount of time consumed by the process. Supporters project that the benefits of a 2-year cycle would include more time for Congress toconduct agency and program oversight, and more time for budget planning within Congress, as wellas better long-range planning by federal agencies and by state and local governments.", "Proposals to convert the federal budget process to a 2-year cycle are also favored by somewho believe that a 2-year cycle provides greater flexibility with regard to deadlines. Without thepressure to enact budgetary legislation every year, there would be greater time available for makingdecisions within the budget cycle, and more efficient coordination of budgetary decisions. This, theyassert, would result in fewer delays and more timely enactment of necessary legislation.", "Supporters also point to the multiyear nature of the summit agreements between Congressand the President that have been a part of the budget process for more than a decade as evidence ofthe efficacy of multiyear budgeting, and as a major factor in recent years for promoting moreefficient consideration of budgetary legislation.", "Critics of biennial budgeting have countered by arguing that some of the projected benefitscould prove to be illusory. Reducing the number of times that Congress considers budget matters,they suggest, may only raise the stakes, and thereby heighten the possibility for conflict and increaseddelay. In addition, enacting a budget resolution and spending legislation every other year could beeffective in reducing congressional workload or aiding longer-term planning only in the second yearof the cycle. With only a limited ability to anticipate future conditions, critics argue that a 2-yearcycle could require Congress to choose between allowing the President greater latitude for makingbudgetary adjustments, or engaging in mid-cycle corrections to a degree that could nullify anyanticipated time savings or planning advantages. Furthermore, they argue that annual review ofappropriations requests is an important part of oversight that would be lost under a biennial budget,with no guarantee that a separate oversight session would be effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative History", "paragraphs": ["Almost from the time that the Congressional Budget Act was enacted in 1974, budget processreform has been a topic of congressional interest, and biennial budgeting was discussed at least asfar back as the 95th Congress (1977-1978).
