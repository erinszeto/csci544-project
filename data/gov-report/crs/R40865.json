In many cases, the conflicts involve the protection of endangered and threatened species, often with one group seeing listed species as an obstacle to their development goals or property rights, and another group advocating protection in line with their environmental, scientific, or economic goals. One such controversy is developing in 11 western states over sage grouse, whose numbers can be threatened by roads, fences, power lines, urban expansion, and energy development. This report describes the state of knowledge about these birds, history of efforts to protect them, and current controversies.", "The sage grouse, once abundant in western sagebrush habitat in 16 states, has dropped in numbers, and is now found in 11 states. Its decline can be attributed to several factors\u2014increased use of sage grouse habitat by ranching and energy development, decreased sagebrush due to noxious invasive species, and loss of habitat due to more frequent fires. However, the extent of the decline is not certain, and some dispute that the sage grouse is in peril.", "There is some discussion over how many species of grouse there are and how they may be related. Currently, two closely related species are recognized by scientists: the Gunnison grouse (Centrocercus minimus) and the sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), sometimes referred to as the greater sage grouse. At one time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS or Service) also recognized two subspecies\u2014the eastern sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus urophasianus) and the western sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus phaios)\u2014but FWS reversed that position. In addition, FWS has designated distinct population segments (DPS) of sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Parties have filed petitions seeking to protect these birds under the ESA by having them listed as threatened or endangered, but none are listed under the act. On January 11, 2013, however, FWS proposed listing the Gunnison grouse as endangered.", "In July 2011, FWS reached a settlement in several lawsuits regarding delays in listing species, include the sage grouse. According to the settlement agreement, a proposed listing rule or a decision that listing is not warranted is due for the Mono Basin sage grouse DPS by the end of FY2013, and for the Columbia River Basin sage grouse DPS and the greater sage grouse by the end of FY2015. At present, those grouses' protection under the ESA has been deemed warranted but precluded by higher protection priorities. Thus, the sage grouse is treated as a candidate species and does not have the protections that a listed species would have.", "One factor in making a listing decision is whether other regulations are in place to provide adequate protection of a species so that federal listing is not necessary to prevent extinction. States in primary sage grouse habitat have taken action to forestall an endangered species listing, which some believe would inhibit energy development on vast amounts of public and private property. Additionally, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service have policies to protect the grouse on their lands, although courts have found those policies lacking. These issues are at the forefront as Congress considers increased energy development on federal lands, while balancing the mission of the ESA."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["A common theme in controversies over the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is that a conflict is triggered by the need for the same dwindling resources by humans and a listed species.

The debate over ESA and species protection typically signals an intensification of an underlying and usually much larger struggle.", "Sagebrush habitat in the West is diminishing and becoming fragmented due to urbanization, global climate change, roads, fences, grazing, energy development, water scarcity, power lines, etc. While the remaining habitat is vast, its fragmentation presents special problems, especially for sage grouse, which need large treeless areas to discourage the roosting of additional avian predators. Thus, fences, roads, and utility poles can produce a very substantial change in the sagebrush habitat, even though the actual surface disturbance is minimal. Loss of habitat is the most common factor leading to species' decline.", "The story of listing the sage grouse under the ESA is a tale of petitions, missed deadlines, and lawsuits. Petitions have been filed under the ESA to protect the Gunnison grouse, the greater sage grouse, a western subspecies of the greater sage grouse, the Bi-State population, and the Columbia River Basin population. To date, no member of this genus has been listed at any taxonomic level. However, on January 11, 2013, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS or Service) proposed listing the Gunnison grouse as endangered.

Within 12 months of filing the petition, FWS must publish whether listing is warranted or not. A final decision must be made one year after the 12-month notice. FWS receives more petitions than it has resources to address, and has the option of publishing a determination at the time of a 12-month finding that a listing is \"warranted but precluded\" due to limited FWS resources. Failure to meet the deadlines can be a basis for suit.", "In addition to listing entire species, the ESA authorizes listing distinct population segments (DPS) of vertebrates. This term refers to a portion of a listed species separated from the rest of the species by genetic distinction and range.

The Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) policy was designed to encourage nonfederal landowners (including state and local governments) to manage their property in ways that helped vulnerable species before they became listed under the ESA. According to FWS, the policy was motivated by the practice of property owners doing things to keep certain species from their land so that if that species became listed later, their property would not be subject to any associated restrictions. ", "A CCAA rewards land management practices that aid species by assuring cooperating landowners that changes in federal policy would not impose additional burdens on them. The Service said, \"the ultimate goal of Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances is to remove enough threats to the covered species to preclude any need to list them,\" but to do this, the substantive requirements of the CCAA must be performed by a significant fraction of the landowners in a species' range, and must provide noticeable improvement. In exchange for landowners' agreements to manage property for the benefit of a species, FWS issues assurances in the form of incidental take permits, excusing landowners from prosecution if their actions should take a listed species in the course of an otherwise lawful action.

It is a squat, feathered, chicken-like bird, grayish with a black belly and spiky tail feathers, and highly prized by hunters. Its winter diet of sage leaves gives the flesh a strong sage flavor. It remains a game bird in many western states. Sage grouse have one of the lowest reproductive rates of any North American game bird. Because of this, \"its populations are not able to recover from low numbers as quickly as many other upland game bird species.\"", "During winter snows, grouse shelter under sagebrush. Sage grouse feed on sage leaves throughout the year, but particularly in winter. They also eat leaves, flowers, and seeds from other plants, plus insects. Young grouse are dependent on insects for rapid growth.", "Male grouse of both species gather in the spring year after year in the same areas, called leks . The leks are found in open sagebrush areas, usually on broad ridges or valley floors where visibility is excellent and noise will travel well. There, the males strut, raise and lower their wings, fan their tail feathers, and make loud booming noises with the aid of bright yellow inflatable air sacs in their necks. Under optimal conditions, these sounds carry for hundreds of yards. Dozens or even hundreds of these males attract the attention of resident females, who survey the spectacular offerings of the displaying males, make their choices, and mate. Once mating has occurred, females leave the lek to nest, sometimes at a distance of several miles. Females raise their offspring alone, without help from males.", "The sage grouse is particularly vulnerable to changes in its habitat. Grazing, oil and gas development, communication towers, roads, utility poles, and wind turbines all pose a threat to sage grouse habitat. The roads provide ingress for invasive species such as cheatgrass; the fences interrupt migration to and from leks; and both fences and power lines provide perches for avian predators.", "While the grouse can fly, they do not fly long distances. They escape their predators through concealment, short flights to cover, or running under rocky outcrops or brush. Sage grouse are subject to predation by hawks, and avoid areas near tall objects that afford hawks a perch from which they can easily swoop down to attack an unwary bird.", "Cheatgrass is the primary invasive species threat to sagebrush habitat. It appears after an area has been grazed or when roads are developed. The nonnative grass spreads quickly, is disliked as forage by grazing mammals and grouse, and burns much more readily than native plants. Both the number of fires and the total area burned in sage grouse habitat have increased dramatically in the last decade when compared to the past 100 years. Drought and global climate change could accelerate the loss of sagebrush by facilitating cheatgrass invasion, increasing the likelihood and severity of fires. ", "Additionally, many types of development introduce standing pools of water into an environment where none had existed. Coal bed methane production and oil wells both involve a footprint with a pond of some sort. This introduces mosquitoes into the habitat, and mosquitoes can carry the West Nile Virus. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the federal agency responsible for tracking wildlife disease, the West Nile Virus is always fatal for the grouse. According to a 2006 report by USGS, West Nile Virus has been reported among sage grouse in every state of the grouse's range except for Washington. Because habitats are becoming fragmented, grouse populations are becoming genetically isolated, leaving them more vulnerable.", "It is hardly surprising that sagebrush and sage grouse habitat seem virtually synonymous. Yet they are not, because much of the West where sagebrush is still dominant is no longer suitable for these birds. The addition of a transmission line or a long fence can make the area too dangerous.", "The sage grouse was once abundant in 16 western states. Now its current range includes portions of 11 states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Nevada, and California.

It cites data from the Western States Sage and Columbia Sharp-Tailed Grouse Technical Committee, which estimated the decline between historic times and 1999 to have been about 86%.", "According to a team assembled by FWS to study the sage grouse, habitat loss is severely affecting the viability of the species:", "The primary threat to greater sage grouse is fragmentation. Large expanses of intact sagebrush habitat are necessary to maintain viable sage grouse populations. Only two areas in the 11 state range currently provide such expanses and both are already heavily fragmented and are projected to experience additional significant fragmentation in the foreseeable future.

In 1980, there was thought to be only one species, the sage grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus (hereinafter C. urophasianus )), the largest grouse in North America. Most birds in the genus are \"sage grouse,\" but further study and field data caused the American Ornithological Union (AOU), the major scientific society for the study of birds, to recognize a second species, the Gunnison grouse.

These birds, known as the Gunnison grouse, are consistently about two-thirds as big as their relatives; males have different markings and behaviors; birds with these characteristics do not breed with the larger birds; and these birds occupy only this particular part of the western sagebrush area. Genetic studies showed that the DNA of birds of this region is distinct. As a result, in 2000 the AOU recognized the grouse of that area as a separate species ( Centrocercus minimus ), and in 2006 the International Ornithological Congress recommended the common name \"Gunnison grouse\" and that the remainder of the species be called simply \"sage grouse.\"", "The Gunnison grouse was once abundant in its four-state range.

Because listing additional species, subspecies, or populations might affect land use, especially on federal lands, states and local governments have some incentive to conserve species to avoid listing, and thereby to avoid potential restrictions on energy development, grazing, urban development, and other activities. Discussions of some of these state and local plans are included as appendices to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efficacy of Conservation Agreements in Avoiding Listing", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned, one goal of a CCAA or other form of conservation agreement with FWS is to establish such protection for a species that federal protection is not deemed necessary. The ESA provides that the Service may find that listing is not needed if adequate regulatory mechanisms exist. Courts have looked at three things in determining the existence of adequate regulatory mechanisms:", "1. Courts have found that \"voluntary\" actions are not regulatory; the protections must be enforceable. 2. Courts define \"adequate\" as sufficient to keep populations at a level such that listing will not prove necessary. 3. Existing means the plans for protection must be in place and are not future or speculative.", "Courts have reviewed CCAAs and other conservation agreements in challenges to listing decisions. No court has deemed voluntary state actions as a regulatory action sufficient to avoid federal listing. Even the Ninth Circuit, which found there were adequate regulatory measures to remove the grizzly bear from the threatened species list, reached the decision not because the voluntary state measures amounted to regulation, but because there was so much federal land in the grizzly's range that the plan was sufficient. It expressly ignored the state voluntary actions: \"For the purposes of the [existing adequate regulatory mechanisms] determination, however, we need not, and do not consider those [state] measures, some or all of which may not be binding.\"", "The second criterion is whether the measures are adequate . Adequate can mean sufficient to keep populations at a level such that listing will not prove necessary. Courts have typically looked at the size of areas being protected as a way of finding adequacy, in addition to looking at the types of measures being taken. ", "For example, in the case of listing steelhead trout, the Northern District of California found that the state plans of Oregon and California were voluntary and so they did not count as a regulatory measure, and that the federal plan would only cover 64% of habitat, which was not enough to prevent species' further decline. Therefore, the regulatory measure affecting federal habitat was not adequate to prevent the need for listing. On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit held that a plan that would have the force of law on federal lands but be voluntary on other lands was adequate to protect the grizzly bear because federal lands constituted 98% of the grizzly's primary conservation area. ", "The third criterion is that the regulatory mechanisms be in place and not be future or speculative. One court said it would not consider a new agreement to be an adequate regulatory mechanism, requiring a conservation agreement to have a record of two years to be sufficient."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["As development proceeds in sagebrush territory, habitat for sage grouse and Gunnison grouse diminishes. This habitat loss in combination with increased fire threats from cheatgrass and climate change could put the sage grouse at risk of extinction. FWS has been petitioned on many occasions to review the statutory factors to determine whether Gunnison grouse, sage grouse, and/or its subspecies, and populations, should be listed under the ESA, and, following litigation, has found that listing was warranted but precluded for all of these groups. States are taking action to protect the sage grouse, in part to protect a game bird, but also to forestall the listing that many see as an obstruction to development of the sagebrush territory that covers so much of the western United States. Congressional pushes for more energy development, both for oil and gas and for green energy such as wind farms and solar collectors, may end up conflicting with the grouse and the protections offered by the ESA.", "Wyoming Sage Grouse Policy Regarding Core\u00a0Population Areas", "While the sage grouse in Wyoming is classified as a game bird, the state is attempting to protect it. A 2011 executive order from the Wyoming governor replaced 2008 and 2010 executive orders directed at sage grouse protection. The 2011 order continues the 2008 practice of using Core Population Areas identified by the governor's Sage Grouse Implementation Team. The 2011 order affects up to two-thirds of the state's sage grouse habitat and is intended to direct energy production to those areas with the highest predicted yields and lowest numbers of sage grouse. The 2011 order alters the 2008 order, however, by specifically approving certain energy corridors through core habitat areas, provided construction occurs within established dates.

The law added Gunnison Sage-Grouse Lek and Occupied Habitat maps to those maps the county must consider when reviewing a Land Use Change Permit application. The lek map shows private lands within 0.6 miles of known leks. This is the key radius for the other restrictions in the law.
