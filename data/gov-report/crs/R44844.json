The agency was the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC), which was partly created for this purpose, and Congress gave it these powers to ameliorate small businesses' financial difficulties while \"mobiliz[ing] the productive facilities of small business in the interest of successful prosecution of the war.\" The SWPC's subcontracting authority expired along with the SWPC at the end of the World War II. However, in 1951, at the start of the Korean War, Congress created the Small Defense Plants Administration (SDPA), which was generally given the same powers that the SWPC had exercised. Two years later, in 1953, Congress transferred the SDPA's subcontracting authorities, among others, to the newly created SBA, with the intent that the SBA would exercise these powers in peacetime, as well as in wartime. When the Small Business Act of 1958 transformed the SBA into a permanent agency, this subcontracting authority was included in Section 8(a) of the act. At its inception, the SBA's subcontracting authority was not limited to small businesses owned and controlled by the socially and economically disadvantaged. Under the original Section 8(a), the SBA could contract with any \"small-business concerns or others,\" but it reportedly seldom, if ever, employed this subcontracting authority, focusing instead upon its loan and other programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Programs for Racial and Ethnic Minorities", "paragraphs": ["Federal programs for racial and ethnic minorities began developing at approximately the same time as those for small businesses, although there was initially no explicit overlap between them. The earliest programs were created by executive orders, beginning with President Franklin Roosevelt's order on June 25, 1941, requiring that all federal agencies include a clause in defense-related contracts prohibiting contractors from discriminating on the basis of \"race, creed, color, or national origin.\" Subsequent Presidents followed Roosevelt's example, issuing a number of executive orders seeking to improve the employment opportunities for various racial and ethnic groups. These executive branch initiatives took on new importance after the Kerner Commission's report on the causes of the 1966 urban riots concluded that African Americans would need \"special encouragement\" to enter the economic mainstream. ", "Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon laid foundations for the present 8(a) Program in the hope of providing such \"encouragement.\" Johnson created the President's Test Cities Program (PTCP), which involved a small-scale use of the SBA's authority under Section 8(a) to award contracts to firms willing to locate in urban areas and hire unemployed individuals, largely African Americans, or sponsor minority-owned businesses by providing capital or management assistance. However, under the PTCP, small businesses did not have to be minority-owned to receive subcontracts under Section 8(a). Nixon's program was larger and focused more specifically on minority-owned small businesses. During the Nixon Administration, the SBA promulgated its earliest regulations for the 8(a) Program. In 1970, the first of these regulations articulated the SBA's policy of using Section 8(a) to \"assist small concerns owned by disadvantaged persons to become self-sufficient, viable businesses capable of competing effectively in the market place.\" A later regulation, promulgated in 1973, defined disadvantaged persons as including, but not limited to, \"black Americans, Spanish-Americans, oriental Americans, Eskimos, and Aleuts.\" However, the SBA lacked explicit statutory authority for focusing its 8(a) Program on minority-owned businesses until 1978, although courts generally rejected challenges alleging that SBA's implementation of the program was unauthorized because it was \"not specifically mentioned in statute.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1978 Amendments to the Small Business Act and Subsequent Regulations", "paragraphs": ["In 1978, Congress amended the Small Business Act to give the SBA express statutory authority for its 8(a) Program for minority-owned businesses.

Thus, if an individual was a member of one of these groups, he or she was presumed to be socially disadvantaged. Otherwise, the amendments were generally seen to grant the SBA discretion to recognize additional groups or individuals as socially disadvantaged based upon criteria promulgated in regulations. Under these regulations, which include a three-part test for determining whether minority groups not mentioned in the amendment's findings are disadvantaged, the SBA recognized the racial or ethnic groups listed in Table 1 as socially disadvantaged for 8(a) purposes. The regulations also established standards of evidence to be met by individuals demonstrating personal disadvantage and procedures for rebutting the presumption of social disadvantage accorded to members of recognized minority groups.", "The 1978 amendments also defined economically disadvantaged individuals , for purposes of the 8(a) Program, as \"those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged.\" In 1989, the SBA established by regulation that personal net worth of less than $250,000 at the time of entry into the program ($750,000 for continuing eligibility) constitutes economic disadvantage.

The OIG concluded that this lack of documentation resulted in \"potentially ineligible firms\" being accepted into the program. To address this situation, the SBA agreed with the OIG's recommendation to clearly document, in its Business Development Management Information System (BDMIS) which tracks 8(a) Program applications, justifications for approval when they differ from that of lower-level reviewers. The SBA asserted that this lack of documentation was not an indication that ineligible firms were being certified into the program without adequate review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Variation in Service Delivery", "paragraphs": ["Witnesses at congressional hearings have reported that common Business Opportunity Specialists (BOS) practices, including the interpretation and implementation of standardized policies and procedures, vary from SBA district office to SBA district office and across state lines.

Instead, they argue, the position's responsibilities \"have been left to develop with SOPs [Standard Operating Procedures] and common practices.\" They have also asserted that BOSs are \"often pulled by their district offices to help with other small business programs rather than overseeing the 8(a) participants as intended.\"", "During the 115 th Congress, P.L. 115-91 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, among other provisions, amended the Small Business Act to clarify the responsibilities of Business Opportunity Specialists by providing them a statutory list of duties.", "Those concerned about variation in 8(a) Program service delivery also note that a 2010 GAO report found a \"breakdown in communication between SBA district offices and headquarters \u2026 that resulted in inconsistencies in the way district offices delivered the program.\" In addition, in 2015, GAO indicated that the SBA's overlapping organizational structure may contribute to variation in 8(a) Program service delivery:", "SBA's organizational structure often results in working relationships between headquarters and field offices that differ from reporting relationships, potentially posing programmatic challenges. District officials work with program offices at SBA's headquarters to implement the agency's programs, but these officials report to regional administrators, who themselves report to the Office of Field Operations. For example, \u2026 business opportunity specialists in the district offices work with the Office of Government Contracting and Business Development at SBA headquarters to assist small businesses with securing government contracts but report to district office management. ", "During the 114 th Congress, legislation ( H.R. 4341 ) was introduced to require GAO to review the SBA's Office of Government Contracting and Business Development (GCBD) and make recommendations to address several administrative concerns, including issues related to the SBA's organizational overlap. ", "In a related development, GAO reported that a \"skill gap\" among BOSs may also contribute to the possibility of variation in the program's service delivery. ", "GAO noted that the SBA's Office of Field Operations (OFO) revised its field office operations in 2012 following a 2010 review of all position descriptions to ensure that the descriptions aligned with the SBA's strategic plan and district office strategic plans. The SBA informed GAO that it undertook this review because district office staff were given new responsibilities after the SBA moved loan processing from district offices to loan processing centers in 2004. Before the review, district office staff had two principal program delivery positions, lender relations specialist and business development specialist. As a result of the review, descriptions for both of these positions were rewritten and the business development position was split into two separate positions, economic development specialist and business opportunity specialist. The skills and competencies for the new position descriptions focused on the change in the district office's function from loan processing to program compliance and community outreach. Staff were retrained for the rewritten positions. ", "The SBA reported that the change in the position descriptions created a \"skill gap\" because employees who were originally required to have a financial background for loan processing were now required to have different skills, such as a marketing background and interpersonal skills needed for assisting and overseeing 8(a) firms and conducting outreach to small businesses.", "The SBA informed GAO that the skill gap was particularly pronounced among 885 employees in two job series, GS-1101 and GS-1102, including BOSs, economic development specialists, and procurement staff, and that despite its efforts to address this skill gap through training and offering early retirement and separation incentives in FY2012 and FY2014 in an effort to restructure its personnel, \"the competency gap remains.\" The SBA also noted that its skill gap had been compounded by recent changes in job requirements and new initiatives that require new skill sets for its employees. For example, P.L. 114-92 , the National Defense Authorization Act of FY2016, requires BOSs to obtain federal acquisition certification in contracting as a prerequisite for employment.", "Arguably, the SBA's relatively recent issuance of a new 300-page SOP (effective September 2016) for the Office of Business Development, which oversees the 8(a) Program, may help to address the reported skill gap. The new SOP provides all SBA staff, including BOSs, specific guidance concerning their roles and responsibilities in 8(a) Program service delivery.

DBE firms, which are provided special consideration in the awarding of federal transportation contracts, argued that the limit penalized success and imposed \"a glass ceiling on the growth and competitiveness of DBE firms.\" Opponents argued that the $1.32 million limit was too high and would include business owners who were not truly disadvantaged and that raising the limit would favor larger, established, and richer DBEs at the expense of smaller, start-up firms because the larger companies would be able to stay in the program longer.
