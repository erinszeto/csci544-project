Most states have laws \"prohibiting public officials from discussing official business privately and failing to disclose information regarding the operations of government.\" On the other hand, some contend that text messages should be treated as private because of the nature of the delivery platforms or technological devices employed to send text messages. States are increasingly disregarding the public nature of the employee's position and the property ownership of the device used to send e-mail and text messages, and instead defining public communication based on whether the individual is conducting the public's business. Thus, communication about the public's business, and records documenting the communication are a part of the public record. Because text messaging represents a relatively new form of electronic communication, federal and state courts, legislatures, and commissions are considering access to text messages pursuant to Sunshine Laws, Open Meetings Laws, Public Records Acts, Freedom of Information Acts, and electronic surveillance laws.", "In Detroit, MI, newspapers filed a Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against that city seeking disclosure of text messages sent by Detroit elected officials on city-issued pagers that related to the city's $8.4 million settlement of two whistle-blower lawsuits brought by former Detroit police officers. The city argued that disclosure of the text messages would violate the federal Stored Communications Act, which outlaws unlawful access to stored communications. A public records directive issued by the city states that all electronic communications sent on city equipment \"is not considered to be personal or private.\" Although the newspapers obtained the text messages through an anonymous source, they continued to press for the release of additional information under public records law. A court ruled part of the information the newspapers wanted was public, the Free Press published text messages related to the cover-up, and the mayor and chief of staff were charged with eight felonies and convicted. In Flagg v. City of Detroit , the district court held that a city's text messages satisfied the definition of \"public records\" under Michigan's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) because they captured communications among city officials or employees in the performance of an official function. For purposes of the discovery rule governing production of documents, the district court concluded that the city had \"control\" over any such \"public records\" in the possession of a third party service provider under contract with the city by virtue of its statutory obligation to maintain these records and make them available for examination or inspection. ", "Courts also have examined whether the disclosure of text messages sent by employees on employer-issued pagers violates the privacy rights of employees, and whether such disclosure is barred by the Stored Communications Act (SCA). The United States Supreme Court in City of Ontario v. Quon overturned a federal appellate court decision which had held that officials in the city of Ontario, CA, engaged in an unconstitutional search and seizure when they acquired and read the contents of messages sent to and from a city police officer's city-provided pager. In Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Company , the court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that, under certain circumstances, an employee sending text messages from an employer's device has a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. The United States Supreme Court resolved the case by applying settled principles for determining when a search is reasonable. In City of Ontario v. Quon , the Supreme Court held that officials had acted reasonably when they reviewed transcripts of messages sent to and from Sergeant Quon's city-issued pager in order to determine whether service limits on the pager's use should be increased. The Court assumed, without deciding, that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy for Fourth Amendment purposes, but found that the search of the transcripts was reasonable.", "Courts also have begun exploring ways to apply open government laws to text messages.

Under this law, the FCC was required to develop plans for a commercial mobile-alert system through which wireless carriers would voluntarily transmit text messages sent out by the government. The FCC has divided the types of messages the government will send out to mobile-phone users into three broad categories:", "Presidential Alerts deal with national emergencies and will take precedence over any other impending alerts Imminent Threat Alerts deal with emergencies that may pose an imminent risk to people's lives or well-being. Child Abduction Emergency/AMBER alerts will be related to missing or abducted children.", "In addition, the FCC says that all subscribers with roaming agreements will receive timely alerts \"provided the subscriber's mobile device is configured for and technically capable of receiving alert messages from the roamed upon network.\"", "The architecture adopted by the FCC calls for a centralized alert-aggregator where federal and state emergency-response agencies would send their warning messages to be authenticated and dispersed to the appropriate participating commercial mobile services. Noting FEMA's role in developing the proposal for the adopted architecture, the FCC recommended the agency as its first choice to serve as the alert aggregator and FEMA has accepted that role.", "The FCC has issued a Second Report and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; an Order on Reconsideration and Erratum; and a Third Report and Order. Of particular note, in the Third Report and Order, the FCC\u2014", "adopted notification requirements for wireless providers that elect not to participate, or to participate only in part, with respect to new and existing subscribers; adopted procedures by which wireless providers may elect to transmit emergency alerts and to withdraw such elections; adopted a rule governing the provision of alert opt-out capabilities for subscribers; allowed participating wireless providers to recover costs associated with the development and maintenance of equipment supporting the transmission of emergency alerts; and adopted a compliance timeline under which participating wireless providers must begin CMAS deployment.", "The FCC continues to refine the rules for providing PLAN/CMAS. The most recent set of requirements is contained in the Third Report and Order , released August 7, 2008 (Docket No. 07-287). The WARN Act did not provide a mandatory deadline for the implementation of PLAN/CMAS. ", "The National Continuity Programs (NCP) Directorate, within the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), will take on the responsibility of acting as a gateway and aggregator of alerts for dissemination through PLAN/CMAS. On December 7, 2009, FEMA and the FCC jointly announced that FEMA had adopted the CMAS Government Interface Design specifications. This triggered requirements in the Third Report and Order for wireless carriers that have agreed to participate in the PLAN/CMAS program to begin development and testing. The deadlines established by the FCC give these carriers until April 7, 2012, to provide PLAN/CMAS alerts sent through the IPAWS gateway. The four major wireless carriers will participate in the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional and Industry Response to SMS-Related Issues", "paragraphs": ["The issues discussed in this report have prompted different levels of response from Congress and the wireless industry:", "Issues that are being addressed by industry, so policymakers may wish to wait and see how those efforts play out; Issues that have not risen to a level of priority in Congress, but would require statutory action to effect change; and Issues that have triggered a legislative response.", "As wireless communications technologies, and the issues that accompany them, evolve over time, so likely will the approaches that industry and Congress will take to ensure consumer safety and satisfaction."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
