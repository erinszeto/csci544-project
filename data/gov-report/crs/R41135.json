The WIA system provides central points of service by its system of One-Stop centers. The concept of a One-Stop center is to provide a single location for individuals seeking employment and training services, thus making the process of locating and accessing employment services more efficient and seamless. WIA requires certain programs to be \"partners\" in the One-Stop center, either by physical collocation or other accessible arrangements. Unlike its predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), WIA provides universal access to its services. Whereas JTPA provided training services to individuals who were \"economically disadvantaged\" or dislocated, WIA provides core services (discussed below) to any individual regardless of age or employment status. WIA is oriented toward a work first approach to workforce development. That is, placement in employment is the first goal of the services provided under Title I of WIA. To this end, WIA established a \"sequence of services\" (discussed below) that requires individuals to receive core and intensive services before training is considered. Similarly, there is no minimum established in WIA on the amount states and local WIBs must spend for training services; JTPA, on the other hand, required that a fixed percentage of funding be spent on training services.

The Rehabilitation Act specifies that if authorization for appropriations expires and Congress has not acted to reauthorize the program, it will automatically be reauthorized for one year and the annual appropriation will equal the prior year's appropriation plus an increase equal to inflation. The program has operated under these automatic authorization provisions since the WIA authorization expired at the end of FY2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Programs", "paragraphs": ["Several other formula and competitive grant programs are authorized under the Rehabilitation Act. These grants are administered by RSA and support the employment and independent living of individuals with disabilities.

A full list of these authorizations and their recent funding histories are listed in Table B-7 in Appendix B .", "Appendix A. Glossary of Selected WIA Terms", "Areas of Substantial Unemployment (ASU) \u2014This concept is used in the Title I state grant formulas for Youth and Adult Activities. As defined in Sections 127(b)(2)(B) and 132(b)(1)(B)(v)(III), an ASU is \"any area that is of sufficient size and scope to sustain a program of workforce investment activities carried out under this subtitle and that has an average rate of unemployment of at least 6.5 percent for the most recent 12 months.\" States submit potential ASU designations and DOL approves ASUs once each fiscal year.", "Additional guidance from DOLETA defines an ASU as a \"contiguous area with a current population of at least 10,000 and an average unemployment rate of at least 6.5 percent for the 12-month reference period.\" If a state has a statewide unemployment rate of at least 6.5%, the entire state will be designated as an ASU for allocation purposes.", "Economically Disadvantaged \u2014This concept is used in one of the factors for the Title I state grant formulas for Youth and Adult Activities. For the state formula grants for Youth Activities, \"disadvantaged youth\" is defined (in Section 127(b)(2)(C)) as an \"individual who is age 16 through 21 who received an income, or is a member of a family that received a total family income, that, in relation to family size, does not exceed the higher of the poverty line or 70 percent of the lower living standard income level.\" Similarly, a \"disadvantaged adult\" is defined (in Section 132(b)(1)(B)(v)(IV)) the same as a disadvantaged youth with the exception that the reference individual is age 22 or older. In practice, for both the Youth and Adult Activities formulas, DOLETA has used the poverty calculations from the 1990 Census (for PY2001-PY2003) and the 2000 Census (for PY2004-present) for this factor.", "Excess Unemployment \u2014This concept is used in one of the factors for the Title I state grant formulas for Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker Activities. For the state formula grants for Youth and Adult Activities, excess unemployment is defined (in Sections 127(b)(2)(D) and 132(b)(1)(B)(v)(VI)) as the higher of \"the number that represents the number of unemployed individuals in excess of 4.5 percent of the civilian labor force in the state\" or \"the number that represents the number of unemployed individuals in excess of 4.5 percent of the civilian labor force in areas of substantial unemployment in such state.\" For the state formula grant for Dislocated Worker Activities, excess unemployment is defined (in Section 132(b)(2)(B)(iii)) as \"the number that represents the number of unemployed individuals in excess of 4.5 percent of the civilian labor force in the state.\" For example, in a state with a civilian labor force of 100,000 and an unemployment rate of 8.0% (which would equal 8,000 unemployed individuals), the \"excess unemployment\" would be 3,500 (8.0% - 4.5% = 3.5%; 3.5% of 100,000 is 3,500).", "Local Workforce Investment Areas (LWIA) \u2014This concept is used in identifying geographic areas within states that function as administrative units within the One-Stop delivery system. Section 116 of the WIA directs the governor of each state to designate\u2014in consultation with the state WIB and with the chief elected local officials in the relevant areas\u2014LWIAs within the state. WIA requires that each LWIA have a local WIB and a One-Stop center. In designating LWIAs, the governor is required to take into consideration geographic areas served by educational agencies and institutions, labor market areas, distances that individuals must travel to receive services, and the resources available from local areas to help carry out the WIA services. WIA does allow for \"automatic designation\" of substate areas as LWIAs under three conditions: a unit of local government with a population of at least 500,000; an area served by a rural concentrated employment program grant recipient that was a service delivery area (SDA) under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA); and an area that served as an SDA in a state with a population of no more than 1.1 million and a population density of no greater than 900 persons per square mile.", "Long-Term Unemployment \u2014This concept is used in one of the factors for the Title I state grant formulas for Dislocated Worker Activities. For the state formula grants for Dislocated Worker Activities, long-term unemployment is defined (in Section 132(b)(2)(B)(ii)(III)) as the number of individuals in a state who have been unemployed (as measured by the Census bureau) for at least 15 weeks.", "Relative Number/Share \u2014This concept is used in the state grant formulas for Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker Activities. Each formula consists of three equally weighted factors. The factors themselves are based on the concept of the \"relative number\" or \"relative share\" of that factor compared to the analogous number in all of the states. An example from the Dislocated Worker Activities formula\u2014based on the factors of regular unemployment, excess unemployment, and long-term unemployment\u2014will demonstrate this. In the PY2012 state formula allotments, Nevada had the following factor values:", "Regular Unemployment = 178,314; Excess Unemployment = 118,912; and Long-Term Unemployment = 117,600.", "For each of these factors, Nevada's \"relative share\" was calculated by dividing the number of individuals in Nevada by the number of individuals in all states. For example, Nevada's relative share of regular unemployment was 1.25% (178,314/14,259,148); its share of excess unemployment was 1.63% (118,912/7,299,720); and its share of long-term unemployment was 1.41% (117,600/8,358,500). Multiplying each of these individuals by 1/3 and summing the results would give Nevada a total share of 1.43% ((1.04%*1/3) + (1.45%*1/3) + (0.98%*1/3)). Finally, multiplying Nevada's share, 1.43%, by the total funding for all states ($1,008,151,464) yields $14,404,698, which Nevada received in PY2012.", "Appendix B.
