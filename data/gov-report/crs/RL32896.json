{"id": "RL32896", "title": "Social Security: Raising or Eliminating the Taxable Earnings Base", "released_date": "2018-10-26T00:00:00", "summary": ["Social Security taxes are levied on covered earnings up to a maximum level set each year. In 2018, this maximum\u2014formally called the contribution and benefit base, and commonly referred to as the taxable earnings base or the taxable maximum\u2014is $128,400. The taxable earnings base serves as both a cap on contributions and on benefits. As a contribution base, it establishes the maximum amount of a worker's earnings that is subject to the payroll tax. As a benefit base, it establishes the maximum amount of earnings used to calculate benefits.", "Since 1982, the Social Security taxable earnings base has risen at the same rate as average wages in the economy. Because the cap is indexed to the average growth in wages, the share of the population below the cap has remained relatively stable at roughly 94%. However, due to increasing earnings inequality, the percentage of aggregate covered earnings that is taxable has decreased from 90% in 1982 to 83% in 2016.", "Raising or eliminating the cap on wages that are subject to taxes could reduce the long-range deficit in the Social Security trust funds. For example, phasing in an increase in the maximum taxable earnings to cover 90% of earnings over the next decade would eliminate roughly 30% of the long-range shortfall in Social Security. If all earnings were subject to the payroll tax, but the current-law base was retained for benefit calculations, the Social Security trust funds would remain solvent for over 60 years. However, having different bases for contributions and benefits would weaken the traditional link between the taxes workers pay into the system and the benefits they receive."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Since the beginning of the program, Social Security taxes have been levied on covered earnings up to a maximum level set each year, referred to as the taxable earnings base . In 2018, an estimated 175 million workers paid into Social Security via Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes or Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) taxes, or both, on their wages and net self-employment income. Both employers and employees contribute taxes at the FICA rate, and SECA taxes are paid by the self-employed. Both taxes have three components: Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), Disability Insurance (DI), and the Hospital Insurance (HI) part of Medicare. The OASDI (combined OASI and DI) tax is levied on earnings up to $128,400 in 2018. The HI tax is levied on all earnings. By law, the Commissioner of Social Security is required to raise the base whenever an automatic benefit increase\u2014a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)\u2014is granted to Social Security recipients, assuming wages have risen (e.g., there was no increase in the base from 2015 to 2016 due to no COLA increase for 2016).", "The taxable earnings base limits the amount of wages or self-employment income used to calculate contributions to Social Security. Unlike income taxes, workers who have earnings above the limit, whether they earn $200,000 or $2 million, pay the same dollar amount in Social Security payroll taxes. Under the 2018 limit of $128,400, the maximum amount a wage and salary worker directly contributes to Social Security is $7,961 (the worker's employer contributes an equal amount), whereas a self-employed individual contributes a maximum of $15,922.", "The taxable earnings base also limits the annual amount of earnings that are used in benefit calculations and thus sets a ceiling on the amount Social Security pays in benefits. If a worker earned at or above the earnings base for his or her entire career and retired in 2018 at the full retirement age, his or her annual benefit would be $33,456 ($2,788 per month).

Most of the individuals earning above the base were men (7.8 million individuals, or roughly 74% of the total). Approximately 9% of all male workers and 3% of all female workers had earnings above the maximum.

The bill emphasized who was to be covered by the system, not how much wages should be taxed. Being in the midst of the Depression, the Administration's attention was on the large number of aged people living in poverty. The committee's goal in proposing a Social Security program was to complement public assistance measures (Old-Age Assistance) in its plan. The plan offered immediate cash aid to the aged poor and created an earnings-replacement system intended to lessen the need for welfare benefits in the long run. It was recognized that the new system would not be sufficient to provide full income in retirement, but would provide a \"core\" benefit as a floor of protection against poverty. Not concerned about high-income retirees, the Administration's proposal exempted nonmanual workers earning $250 or more a month from coverage. Manual workers were to be covered regardless of their earnings, but few had earnings above this level.", "It was the Social Security bill reported by the House Ways and Means Committee that clearly established a maximum taxable amount, which the bill set at $3,000 per year, equivalent to 12 months of earnings at the $250 level. In addition, the committee dropped the exemption for nonmanual workers with high earnings. The committee's report and floor statements made at the time give no clear record as to the reasoning for the taxable limit, but the elimination of the high-earner exemption would include high-income individuals in the system (increasing income to the system that could be redistributed to low- and middle-income workers) and attain as much program coverage of the workforce as possible. In addition, the Administration's original exemption would be erratic for workers whose earnings fluctuated above and below the $250 monthly threshold.", "Although tax policy concerns were raised in later years, with a higher base preferred by those seeking a more proportional tax system, there was little, if any, serious attention given to eliminating the base entirely. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, and to a lesser extent later on, the major arguments concerned the base's size and how it affected the development of Social Security. A larger base meant that more earnings would be credited to a person's Social Security record and would lead to higher benefits (because benefits are based on a worker's contribution into the system via taxes on earnings). Proponents argued that the base needed to be raised to reflect wage or price growth so that the benefits of recipients, in particular moderate and well-to-do recipients, would not erode over time, thereby preserving their support for the system. Critics argued that this would increase benefits for people who could save on their own while making saving by private means more difficult.", "Prior to 1974, increases to the taxable earnings bases were specifically legislated on an ad hoc basis. However, a period of large increases to the cost of living (e.g., 5.5% in 1970) led to concerns that such a rise in the cost of living would reduce the purchasing power of Social Security benefits, and that ad hoc increases might be insufficient. President Nixon had recommended automatic adjustments to benefits in 1969, but efforts in 1970 and 1971 to incorporate automatic adjustments failed. This changed in 1972, when H.R. 1 (which would eventually become the Social Security Amendments of 1972; P.L. 92-603) gained traction. The bill included a COLA provision, but this provision, along with some others, split off from the main text, and was enacted under P.L. 92-336 instead. P.L. 92-336 included procedures that increased the taxable earnings base automatically as a means of financing COLAs for Social Security recipients, though the adjustment to the taxable earnings base was tied to average wages.", "The Social Security Amendments of 1977 ( P.L. 95-216 ) gradually increased the base beyond what resulted from the automatic-adjustment procedures from 1978 to 1981, such that in 1981, the taxable earnings base was $7,500 higher than the \"old-law\" base. This was done as a means of raising revenue to help shore up the program's ailing financial condition and was intended to achieve a base under which 90% of all covered payroll would be subject to tax (to match the original 1935 act); increases to the taxable earnings base after 1981 returned to automatic-adjustments procedures.", "Medicare was enacted in 1965, under the Social Security Amendments of 1965 (P.L. 89-97), with the HI portion of the program financed by payroll taxes. The HI tax was first levied in 1966 at a rate of 0.35% (on employee and employer, each) and the maximum taxable amount was set at the same level as Social Security's. The HI rate was subsequently raised periodically (reaching its current level of 1.45% in 1986) to meet the financing needs of the program. However, its base continued to be the same as Social Security's through 1990. Then, to reduce federal budget deficits, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-508 ) raised the HI base to $125,000. The HI base then rose automatically to $135,000 over the next two years. In 1993, as part of his plan to reduce budget deficits, President Clinton proposed that the HI base be eliminated entirely; with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ), the HI base was removed.

Prior to 1972, the taxable earnings base was updated periodically by Congress, which contributed to its dramatic fluctuations in the 1950s and 1960s.

However, the share of covered earnings that is taxed has fallen from 90% of all earnings in 1982 to 83% in 2016. The large declines in the percentage of covered earnings since the 1980s were mainly due to salaries for top earners growing faster than the pay of workers below the cap , which means top earners had wage growth that was higher than average. The cumulative growth in real wages from 1979 to 2017 was 34.3% for the 90 th percentile (high-wage earners), 6.1% for the 50 th percentile (middle-wage earners), and 1.2% for the 10 th percentile (low-wage earners). Because increases in the taxable maximum are based on average wage growth, salaries for top earners increased faster than the taxable maximum.

These higher benefit payments would lead to greater program outlays, although these expenditures would be more than offset by greater tax revenues.

The proportion of earnings that is taxed is projected to continue to fall. Maintaining a consistent tax base would increase revenue and help to improve the system's solvency. Some have proposed raising the taxable earnings base to consistently tax 90% of aggregate covered earnings, restoring it to roughly the level of coverage in 1982 when Congress last undertook a major reform effort to address Social Security solvency.

Because of the linking of taxes and benefits in this proposal, the change in benefits provides an idea of how many individuals are paying more taxes, but the values are not identical.

Some annual Social Security benefit payments would be much higher than today's annual maximum (if claimed at full retirement age) of $33,456. To contextualize how benefits are affected by the increase in contributions, authors Reno and Lavery estimate that a worker who paid taxes on earnings of $400,000 each year would get a benefit of approximately $6,000 a month or $72,000 a year, a replacement rate of 18%, whereas someone with lifetime earnings of $1 million a year would get a monthly Social Security benefit of approximately $13,500 a month or $162,000 a year, a replacement rate of 16.2%.", "One possibility to maintain the link between contributions and benefits, but limit the benefits for high earners, is to change the benefit formula.

Behavioral changes were not taken into consideration in the above estimates of the distributional and trust fund impacts, and only partially accounted for in the revenue analysis.", "Workers who earn more than the taxable maximum would have a reduced incentive to work, because workers pay more in taxes than they expect to receive in lifetime Social Security benefits and this effectively reduces the return to work. However, the degree to which the work effort will be reduced is a matter of debate; each worker would face a different choice between the reduced earnings and the additional leisure time, based on the worker's individual preferences. Workers earning above the current base would also have an incentive to change the form of their compensation (e.g., from earnings to fringe benefits) to avoid paying additional payroll taxes.", "The impact of raising the base on employers of high-income earners is also unknown. Employers contribute 6.2% of workers' wages up to the taxable earnings base toward Social Security. If employers are unable to pass along the higher tax costs to workers in the form of reduced earnings, their overall labor costs will increase. Employers may react by raising prices to consumers; reducing other nonwage forms of compensation, such as health benefits or pensions; or reducing the number of workers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Arguments For and Against Raising or Eliminating the Base", "paragraphs": ["Some arguments for and against changing the Social Security taxable earnings base follow."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Arguments For", "paragraphs": ["The major critique about the Social Security base is that it creates a regressive tax structure above maximum taxable earnings. Workers earning less than the base have a greater proportion of earnings taxed than workers whose earnings exceed it. In 2018, someone with annual earnings of $30,000 pays $1,860 in Social Security taxes, or 6.2% of his or her earnings (ignoring the employer share of the tax). However, because the tax is levied on only the first $128,400 in earnings, someone earning $200,000 a year pays $7,961, or 3.98% of his or her earnings.", "Supporters of changing the wage base point out that only 6% of workers have earnings above the base in any given year. However, because of rising earnings inequality, the proportion of their earnings that escapes taxation has risen from 12% to 17% since 1991 (see Table A-1 ). They therefore contend that the current tax structure favors a small group of the higher-earning workers in society.", "Supporters argue that subjecting a larger percentage of earnings to the payroll tax would also adjust for the higher life expectancies of high earners. On average, people with more education and higher earnings live longer than those with less education and lower earnings, and this difference has been growing over time. The impact on the Social Security program is that higher-earning individuals receive benefits for more years over their lifetimes, making the system less progressive. Supporters claim that raising the taxable earnings base would make a reasonable adjustment for the faster-than-average life expectancy gains among high earners.", "Among supporters of changing the current base, there is disagreement regarding how high the base should be raised or if other changes should be made to tax income above the base. Several proposals would not eliminate the base entirely but raise it to cover 90% of taxable wages, restoring the level that was set in the 1977 amendments to the Social Security Act. Other options would be to remove the taxable maximum, but lower the tax rate on those higher earnings or tax employers and employees at different rates above the current base (see various proposals in Table 3 ). Others have called for broadening the sources of income that are taxed beyond earnings. Proponents of these ideas argue that they would close a significant portion of Social Security's long-range deficit without subjecting upper-middle-income individuals to sizeable increases in their marginal tax rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arguments Against", "paragraphs": ["Those who support keeping the base as it is point out that although the structure of the payroll tax may be regressive above the taxable maximum, it might be partially offset by the progressive calculation of benefits.", "Supporters further maintain that its critics fail to take into account the effect of other tax and transfer programs targeted to low earners. They point out that mitigating the Social Security tax bite was part of the motivation for creating the earned income tax credit (EITC), which provides an income tax credit on earnings up to $54,884 in 2018 for married workers with three or more children (up to $20,950 for married workers without children). They also point out that low-income families receive a greater share of government transfer payments that are not subject to Social Security payroll taxes. They argue that the combination of these factors mitigates the flat-rate nature of the tax at lower earnings levels, and that for most other workers the tax is proportional (because it is flat rate). It is only at the upper end of the income spectrum that it takes on a regressive appearance.", "Critics also argue that raising the cap will serve as a disincentive to work and could serve as a drain on the economy. Because additional work effort would cause lifetime payroll taxes to increase by more than lifetime Social Security benefits, opponents claim that workers faced with lower marginal rewards for work would either reduce their hours or avoid the tax by changing the form of their compensation.", "There are additional arguments against eliminating the taxable earnings base. For example, maintaining a base makes Social Security seem less like ordinary income taxation. Another argument is that high earners would pay more payroll taxes and receive more benefits after removing the base, but the larger benefits that high earners would receive would represent a poor return for the higher taxes they would pay. Some question the wisdom of paying large benefits to higher-income people, arguing that the purpose of the program is to provide a floor of protection for retirement, not large benefits for those who can save on their own. These people contend that eliminating the base would raise public cynicism about a publicly financed system that pays enormous benefits to people who already are well off."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
