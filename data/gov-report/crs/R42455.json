While the emphasis is on technology (including key performance metrics such as cost and efficiency), this report also addresses the significant policy, market, and other non-technical factors that may impede storage adoption. It considers eight major categories of storage technology: pumped hydro, compressed air, batteries, capacitors, superconducting magnetic energy storage, flywheels, thermal storage, and hydrogen.", "Energy storage technologies for electric applications have achieved various levels of technical and economic maturity in the marketplace. For grid storage, challenges include roundtrip efficiencies that range from under 30% to over 90%. Efficiency losses represent a tradeoff between the increased cost of electricity cycled through storage, and the increased value of greater dispatchability and other services to the grid. The capital cost of many grid storage technologies is also very high relative to conventional alternatives, such as gas-fired power plants, which can be constructed quickly and are perceived as a low risk investment by both regulated utilities and independent power producers. The existing market structures in the electric sector also may undervalue the many services that electricity storage can provide. For transportation storage, the current primary challenges are the limited availability and high costs of both battery-electric and hydrogen-fueled vehicles. Additional challenges are new infrastructure requirements, particularly for hydrogen, which requires new distribution and fueling infrastructure, while battery electric vehicles are limited by range and charging times, especially when compared to conventional gasoline vehicles.", "Substantial research and development activities are underway in the United States and elsewhere to improve the economic and technical performance of electricity storage options.

These technologies have the potential to cut electricity bills, reduce peak power demand and lower greenhouse gas emissions.", "Likewise, in a statement regarding new energy storage-related rules for wholesale electricity markets, Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner John Norris stated,", "I believe today's final rule is a positive first step by the Commission in recognizing the unique characteristics and the value that storage resources offer.... As we move forward, I strongly believe that storage will become ever more critical as we look to integrate increasing amounts of variable energy resources.", "Referring to advanced batteries for electric transportation applications, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu reportedly stated, ", "It's now within grasp, that you can get a battery where the business plans are one-third of the cost of today's batteries, where you can get ranges now that would allow cars instead of 100 miles on a single charge, go 300 or more miles on the same charge\u2026.

It's in the next decade.", "Statements such as those above highlight not only the technical opportunities for energy storage in the grid and in electric transportation, but also the attention being paid to energy storage technologies at the highest levels in the federal government. Nonetheless, many new energy storage technologies continue to face significant technological and economic challenges to their commercialization and widespread deployment. The recent bankruptcy of Beacon Power, one of the leading developers of flywheel energy storage technologies for the grid, is a prominent illustration of commercial barriers to grid storage technology. Public concerns about elevated fire risks from Chevrolet Volt electric car batteries, although shown to be exaggerated, are another. By contrast, increasing investments by AES Corporation in utility-scale battery storage for power grids show continuing successful efforts to overcome technical challenges and market barriers to bring new storage technologies into the market.", "Understanding the potential of energy storage in electric applications is complicated by a number of factors. The first is the wide range of storage technologies either commercially available, in development, or being researched. Because they are technologically diverse, it is difficult to gain a balanced understanding of the fundamental capabilities, costs, and comparative advantages of these different energy storage options. Second, there are multiple applications of energy storage, each with distinct operational requirements. Certain storage technologies may suit certain applications better than others. Finally, there are many aspects of market structure and economic regulation that affect energy storage deployment. Taken together, these factors make the development of an energy storage research and development portfolio challenging.

In both cases, a reduction in the burning of fossil fuels could result in lower overall U.S. carbon emissions and conventional pollutants.", "For purposes of assessment and comparison, it is helpful to organize the various energy storage technologies under two industry sectors (electric grid and transportation) and two general categories of application based on the amount of time the storage device is required to provide service (high power/rapid discharge and energy management), further explained below. Table 1 lists the storage technologies considered in this report according to these categories.

Ideally, all storage devices would be able to provide all services, but some technologies are technically restricted to provide only short-term services. However, many of these services have very high value in the grid, so short-term storage can still provide considerable benefits. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "High Power/Rapid Discharge Applications", "paragraphs": ["The rapid response category can be further divided into short-term discharge\u2014less than one minute\u2014used to provide grid stability and power quality, and longer-term discharge\u2014up to about an hour. Though important, short-term discharge services can often be provided by non-storage options such as power electronics. Furthermore, this class of grid services does not address the primary challenge of renewables integration, which requires minutes to hours of discharge time. Currently, capacitors and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) are rapid response technologies capable only of providing short-term discharge. Research efforts for both technologies are focused on increasing energy density and decreasing cost, with capacitor efforts being directed in part towards vehicle applications. While SMES research has been active historically, current efforts are modest and there is no clearly defined pathway for SMES to be competitive for applications requiring extended discharge. ", "Other grid applications require devices with up to about one hour of discharge to provide services such as frequency regulation service (responding to random, rapid variations in demand) and contingency reserves (rapidly responding to a generator or transmission failure). Longer-term storage can also support renewables integration by providing the subhourly ramping requirements which will increase as greater amounts of variable generation sources are added to the grid. Flywheels have been deployed in significant demonstration projects providing frequency regulation. Several battery types have been demonstrated for both frequency regulation and operating reserves, including lithium-ion and various aqueous batteries (such as lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, and nickel-metal hydride). Most aqueous chemistries are considered mature technologies, but additional improvements are possible, even for 100+ year-old lead acid batteries. Research and development efforts on lithium-ion batteries are focused on reducing cost and weight for transportation applications, but these efforts should have spillover benefits to grid applications. In addition, there are certain lithium-ion configurations that are probably unsuitable for transportation applications but potentially suitable for the grid. A major effort by commercial vendors of rapid response technologies such as flywheels and lithium-ion batteries has been gaining access to markets for frequency regulation and full valuation of the response capabilities of the technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Energy Management Applications", "paragraphs": ["Grid storage devices for energy management applications can provide continuous discharge for several hours or more. These devices would be potentially useful for shifting energy during periods of low demand (or high renewable supply) to periods of high demand (or low renewable supply). Many of them can also provide the same services as high power/rapid discharge devices. ", "Pumped hydro storage (PHS) is the dominant technology in this category with about 22 Gigawatts (GW), equivalent to about 22 large power plants, operating in the United States for decades. PHS has high reliability, high efficiency, and long lifetime, but is dependent on the availability of suitable geologic conditions and requires long development times (~10 years including permitting). Based on siting challenges and environmental opposition, PHS suffers from the perception that these issues will prevent large-scale deployment in the future. However, the actual technical potential is large and the number of proposed plants exceeds the current installed capacity, with many of these proposed plants using \"closed-cycle\" designs that will not interact with existing water bodies and have the potential to reduce both opposition and licensing times. They may also use variable speed equipment improving their ability to provide rapid discharge services.", "Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is technically mature, and often considered the lowest-cost option for \"bulk\" electricity storage, although only one such facility is deployed in the United States. CAES is a hybrid technology which uses natural gas, and typically requires a large underground formation. Major development efforts for CAES currently underway include demonstrating the technology in bedded salt and porous rock. Use of such geologic formations would open up much more of the country to CAES development. Other research and development activities include work on CAES cycles that do not require natural gas fuel. ", "Hydrogen and other electricity-derived fuels are possible storage options with the advantage of long-term (even seasonal) storage. They currently are among the least efficient (well under 50%) and more expensive storage technologies available and have yet to be deployed beyond small demonstration projects. Fundamental research efforts are required to decrease the cost and increase the durability of electrolyzers and fuel cells. Most of the historic research on hydrogen has been as an alternative fuel for transportation. ", "Two classes of batteries are currently the primary candidates for electric grid applications\u2014liquid electrolyte flow batteries and high-temperature batteries. High-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are the most mature and commercially available, with over 270MW deployed worldwide, including installations in the United States. They also have the advantage of relying on low-cost and abundant materials, although manufacturing costs have limited larger-scale use. Sodium sulfur is the only high-temperature battery deployed at large scale, currently manufactured by a single company in Japan. There are several alternative high-temperature chemistries under various stages of research, development, and commercialization. Flow batteries are in the early stages of development and commercialization, with a few U.S. demonstration projects of vanadium and zinc-bromine technologies, with several other technologies under development. ", "Thermal energy storage (TES) is often overlooked as an electricity storage technology option because it does not store and discharge electricity directly. However, in some applications, thermal storage can be functionally equivalent to electricity storage with efficiencies exceeding 90%, which is higher than most other storage technologies. There are two primary applications of TES for electricity. The first is storing thermal energy from the sun which is later converted into electricity. The currently deployed storage medium is a relatively low-cost molten salt. The primary limitation is that TES is tied to a specific application, in this case concentrating solar power (CSP), which has the challenges of high cost and limited deployment locations, mostly in the desert southwest in the United States. The key research efforts include developing storage materials with higher working temperature, which, when combined with higher temperature CSP plants, will increase efficiency and decrease costs. CSP with thermal energy storage has been deployed in Spain. Construction of a 250 MW CSP/TES facility in the United States is expected to begin in 2012. The second application of TES is cold and hot storage in buildings. Cold storage, used to reduce peak demand from air-conditioning, has been deployed on a relatively large scale. This is a commercially mature technology that provides firm system capacity at very high round-trip efficiency, with the capability of providing multiple grid services. The primary barrier to deployment is capturing the benefits of this distributed technology in the current regulatory and market environment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Energy Storage for Transportation Applications", "paragraphs": ["As with grid storage, energy storage for transportation applications can be loosely divided into two primary categories: high power/rapid discharge and high energy/extended discharge. High power devices provide short, rapid discharges for vehicle starting and acceleration. While they cannot provide continuous discharge for electrified transport, they can dramatically improve fuel efficiency, as demonstrated by the current generation of hybrid electric vehicles. Currently deployed technologies for these applications include lithium-ion and nickel-based aqueous batteries. Technologies being explored including capacitors, flywheels, and other battery types. Some of these technologies, such as capacitors, may also be used as a fast-responding \"buffer\" between the electric drive system and the battery or fuel cell in an electric vehicle (EV). ", "For high energy applications, where stored electricity is actually used to provide a significant fraction of the driving energy, research and development efforts are currently focused on two technologies\u2014hydrogen and batteries. Conceptually, hydrogen is a simple storage technology, produced by splitting water using electricity (among other options), storing hydrogen on board the vehicle, and then converting it to electricity to drive an electric motor via a fuel cell. (Internal combustion engines could also be used, but the low efficiency of that process is less attractive.) The challenges of a hydrogen-based transportation system include the development of an entirely new fueling infrastructure including hydrogen delivery systems and filling stations, with needed safety standards and protocols. The low volumetric energy density of hydrogen makes storage challenging without extremely high-pressure tanks, or advanced chemical storage still in the early research phase. Finally, fuel cells for vehicles remain expensive, with limited lifetimes. There have been demonstration fuel cell vehicle programs by several major auto manufacturers, with announced plans for commercial deployment as soon as 2015. However, substantial research efforts will be needed to reduce costs and improve performance for many of the technologies needed for large-scale hydrogen based transportation. There are other electricity-to-fuel pathways under consideration, but with limited research and development efforts in the United States. They face similar challenges of requiring new fuel infrastructure and currently face much higher costs than fossil fuel alternatives. ", "The primary alternative to electricity-based fuel production is battery electric storage in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and EVs. Most commercially available and proposed EVs and PHEVs (such as the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf) use lithium-ion batteries. Research and development efforts are focused primarily on reducing cost and increasing energy density as well as safety of lithium-ion technology. Earlier deployed technologies, such as lead-acid used in older EVs and nickel metal hydride used in current HEVs, are not considered likely candidates in future EVs due to fundamental limits of energy density. Concerns have been expressed about the large-scale availability of several metals used in lithium-ion batteries, as well as its concentration in a few geographic regions. In the longer term, lithium-metal and metal-air batteries are in the research and development phase, with the potential of much higher energy density than currently available battery types.

The United States is largely self-sufficient for its electricity needs, and has substantial potential to increase production of low-carbon, domestically sourced electricity from renewable and nuclear sources (or from coal using carbon capture).

Historically, one of the most important grid storage functions has been \"load-leveling,\" or storing off-peak electricity during periods of low demand and releasing it during periods of high demand, enabling the decreased use of high-cost peaking generation. This function has been extended to include support for renewable electricity generation, given the variable production output of wind and solar plants. More recently, utilities have also been considering how energy storage can provide a partial alternative to the development of the power grid itself by helping utilities optimize the use of grid infrastructure already in place and thereby avoid or defer building new power lines. Other key storage functions include technical services called \"ancillary services\" needed to provide electric power transmission service to a customer. They include actions taken to effect a power transaction (e.g., scheduling), services needed to maintain the integrity of the power grid, and services needed to correct the effects associated with undertaking a power transaction (e.g., supply-demand balancing). As the electric power grid has evolved into a wholesale marketplace for competitive bulk power purchases while at the same time becoming strained by growth in electricity demand, the potential for energy storage has grown in importance, driving continued interest in storage technology development and deployment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Storage Deployment for the Grid", "paragraphs": ["There are approximately 22 GW of utility-scale electric storage capacity in the United States today, which equates to approximately 2% of the nation's total existing generation capacity. Nearly all of this storage capacity is in the form of pumped hydro storage (PHS), which works by pumping water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir, releasing that stored water through a hydroelectric generator when electricity is needed (further discussed in Chapter 9). While there was some development of PHS starting as early as the 1920s, much of the nation's PHS capacity was initiated in the mid- to late 1970s. This development was the result of a combination of factors including dramatic price increases in oil and natural gas used for meeting peak electricity demand, along with concerns about security of supply. These factors culminated in congressional passage of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-620 ) restricting use of oil and gas in new power plants. During this period utilities expected to bring online many new coal-fired and nuclear power plants to meet relatively steady baseload demand, but were left with limited options to provide generation capacity to meet daily and hourly load variations (\"load-following\") and peak demand. This limitation led utilities to actively develop PHS as an alternative to fossil-fueled intermediate load and peaking generation.", "During the 1970s, there was also significant research and development of other storage technologies including several battery types, capacitors, flywheels, compressed-air, underground pumped hydro, and superconducting magnetic storage. It was expected that deployment of storage of all types would grow significantly during this period. However, most PHS development, along with interest in and deployment of other emerging storage technologies, ended in the 1980s after steep natural gas price reductions, improvements in natural gas turbines, and repeal of the Industrial Fuel Use Act made deployment of flexible natural gas-fired generation more economically attractive. ", "Other technical, market, and regulatory factors have also served to limit the deployment of electricity storage historically. Many of these factors continue today. They are discussed in more detail later in this chapter and in the individual technology chapters. Briefly, however, a primary historical challenge of storage deployment has been the limited ability of utilities to estimate and capture the full economic value of electricity storage, especially the many dynamic benefits to the grid of fast responding storage technologies. Taken together, these factors have restricted deployment of utility-scale electricity storage in the United States over recent decades. Besides 22 GW of PHS, deployment has been limited to a single 110 MW compressed-air energy storage (CAES) facility, and a variety of smaller projects. Between 1990 and 2010, only 2 MW of new PHS was constructed in the United States compared to over 300 GW of new generating capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Applications of Energy Storage in the Grid", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, energy storage can be used in many valuable applications for electric power grids.

However, for purposes of assessment in this report, it is helpful to classify these applications into two general categories based on the amount of time the storage device is required to provide service because discharge time is a fundamental characteristic distinguishing most energy storage technologies. The first category is storage for high power or rapid discharge applications where the device must be able to discharge for periods of up to about one hour. The second category is energy management applications where the device must be able to discharge for several hours or more.

One of the challenges facing electricity storage technologies is appropriate valuation of these benefits, especially in providing multiple services in combination. For example, some storage technologies can provide load-leveling (and associated benefits such as lower cycling-induced maintenance), regulation service, contingency reserves, and firm capacity. Historically, it has been difficult to quantify these various value streams without sophisticated modeling and simulation methods. The emergence of wholesale electricity markets now provides more transparent data for both utilities and independent power producers to consider the opportunities for electricity storage. Depending on the market, these data allow evaluation of both the economic yield and optimum location of electricity storage devices for arbitrage, capacity, operating reserves, and other ancillary services. ", "While there is significant variation and uncertainty in costs, most electricity storage assessments indicate that few commercially available bulk electricity storage technologies are deployable for less than $1,000/kW. For comparison, Figure 1 summarizes the life-cycle value of several storage applications estimated in several previous studies in a number of locations. (The life-cycle value can serve as a proxy for the capital cost needed for storage to be economically viable for each of these applications.) As Figure 2 shows, $1,000/kW falls within the range of estimated life-cycle value for all but one of the applications shown, indicating that the storage value could exceed storage costs in specific applications. For example, energy arbitrage revenues, independent of other storage benefits, would require a capital cost of less than $1,000/kW over most of the locations studied. The value of electricity storage increases, however, when taking advantage of other individual sources of revenue or even combined services. A device with sufficient energy capacity for energy arbitrage would likely be able to provide system capacity as well. The combination of these two services could, therefore, likely support a device costing somewhat more than $1,000/kW.", " Figure 1 shows that regulation service and contingency reserves, which are shorter-duration applications requiring less energy capacity, have potentially higher value than energy arbitrage. The challenge for these applications is that a device providing contingency reserves must be able to respond rapidly, which is technically harder to do. Frequency regulation is particularly demanding, requiring continuous changes in output, frequent cycling, and fast response. It is also the highest-value opportunity for an electricity storage device, however, and has been the focus of many potential electricity storage applications, especially given its fairly small energy requirements.", "It is difficult to estimate the total market size for electricity storage in the U.S. grid. The most comprehensive assessment of market size identifies hundreds of gigawatts of total applications. However, some of these applications overlap. For example, end use time-of-use (TOU) rate management effectively duplicates load-leveling on the wholesale side. Furthermore, several of the highest-value services, such as regulation service, have the smallest market opportunities.

As variable renewable generation (VG) from these sources is added to the grid, it can have a number of operational impacts on the grid, many of which can be mitigated with electricity storage (or other enabling technologies):", "Frequency Regulation Requirements \u2014VG adds to the short-term (seconds to minutes) variability in electric power frequency, which must be maintained very close to the 60 cycles per second (hertz) for proper and reliable grid operation. Load Following Requirements \u2014 VG adds to the hourly requirements for generation supply (ramping) on the grid, increasing the cycling and associated maintenance of conventional generators. Uncertainty in Net Load \u2014Wind availability is less predictable than either the variation in electric load or the availability of conventional generators. This uncertainty can increase the cost of power system operation because it can result in too many or too few generators being available to respond to variation in \"net load,\" which is the electric load remaining on the grid after wind power supplies are added. Ramping Range and Curtailment \u2014 VG increases the difference between the daily minimum and maximum electricity demand (including an effective reduction in minimum load) which can force conventional generators to reduce output. In some cases this difference may force generation units that ought to be running continuously to cycle off during periods of high wind output, or it can force wind generators to curtail output, \"wasting\" renewable generation potential. Transmission Requirements \u2014Some renewable resources, like wind and concentrating solar power, are remotely located, requiring new transmission to supply the grid. New transmission is difficult to construct for economic and policy reasons, however, and use of dedicated long-distance transmission for wind or solar will be limited by the relatively low capacity factor of the resource. Storage could increase line-loading and help reduce wind generation curtailment due to transmission constraints.", " Figure 2 illustrates several of the above impacts on net load and corresponding operation of the grid. In this figure, wind generation is subtracted from the load, showing the \"residual\" or net load that the utility would need to meet with conventional sources. As the figure shows, the change in generation the grid would need to provide for load-following purposes (ramp range) can be much higher than overall load due to the variable contributions of wind power.", "Notwithstanding the potential contribution of storage technologies to grid operation, there is considerable debate over the \"need\" for electricity storage with moderate penetration of renewables. Many of the grid impacts listed above have been evaluated in various wind integration studies attempting to evaluate the operational feasibility and associated costs of wind integration. To date, most studies have found a relatively low cost of accommodating wind variability on the grid\u2014typically less than $5/MWh (0.5 cents/kWh), adding less than 10% to the cost of wind energy\u2014when wind is providing up to 20% of a particular grid system's demand. This low cost, mostly resulting from the large amount of flexible generation already available to meet the variability in demand, has been used to argue that deployment of storage is not justified based on variability impacts. However, many potentially significant costs, such as the operations and maintenance costs of increased generator cycling, have yet to be quantified and are not included in these studies. Furthermore, the studies do not consider the economic and societal challenges associated with transmission expansion, or the option of storage as a method to supplement new transmission. Consideration of these factors would almost certainly increase the value of storage. A strong argument also can be made that VG will increase the value proposition for storage, adding to the values that already exist in today's grid. In general, renewables are likely to increase the potential market size for electricity storage (for example, by increasing the amount of certain types of generation reserves needed). ", "The operational value of combining a dedicated electricity storage device with a specific wind or solar generation plant is also the subject of debate. Many storage applications dedicated to individual renewable generators, such as renewables \"firming,\" which seeks to reduce variability in renewable power output, are actually specific examples of the more general applications in Table 2 . For example, shifting wind power supply from periods of low demand to periods of high demand is fundamentally the same as energy arbitrage. The economic benefits of this application are greatest when the electricity storage operator can choose from all of the generators in a system, storing electricity from any source instead of storing only wind generation, when demand is lowest. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Grid Storage with High Renewables Penetration", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps the strongest argument for energy storage in the grid occurs at relatively high penetration of VG. The oft-cited limits of VG penetration in the range of 10%-20% and the associated \"need\" for electricity storage appear to be moving targets as new grid integration techniques develop. Recent studies have found that 30% penetration (on an energy basis) of renewables on the grid appears to be feasible without an inherent need for storage to maintain system reliability. However, there appear to be some economic limits of VG at high penetration based on the limited coincidence of VG supply and electricity demand patterns. At sufficiently high penetration of wind or solar generation, VG supply can exceed demand for electricity, which results in curtailed generation and decreased economic viability of VG. This problem is exacerbated by the cycling or operational limits on conventional generators, many of which must remain on-line to provide operating reserves or be available when wind and solar generation is insufficient to meet demand.", "Such VG limits can be observed in the Western Wind and Solar Integration Study (WWSIS) with 30% wind penetration, at which wind power supply almost completely removes conventional generation during high wind periods. Figure 3 shows the net load with wind in the study area, along with the modeled operation (dispatch) of generation plants, which requires significant ramping of coal generators. In one evening the net load (electricity demand minus wind supply) drops to about 6 GW, meaning that wind is providing about 32 GW, even after much of the wind generation is exported to surrounding areas. Doubling the amount of wind generation capacity would produce a large amount of wind generation curtailment on this day, since the remaining 6 GW of load cannot absorb an additional 32 GW of wind generation, and the conventional generation units are probably near or at their ability to ramp down or cycle off. Similarly, an analysis of the Irish grid found limited wind generation curtailment at a wind penetration of 40% on an energy basis. However, beyond this point, wind curtailment rates sharply increase and the study found economic benefits of storage at the point where about 50% of the system's energy is provided by wind. ", "At higher penetration of renewable generation, the ability of conventional generators to reduce output becomes an increasing concern. VG begins to displace units that are traditionally not cycled, and the ability of conventional thermal generators to reduce output may become constrained. Utilities in the United States have expressed concern about their systems \"bottoming out\" due to the minimum generation requirements during overnight hours, and being unable to accommodate more VG during these periods. Cycling operations, including startup/shutdown, on-load cycling, and high frequency MW changes, can damage generation equipment. However, the costs of such cycling can be very difficult to quantify. Minimum load points would be less of a constraint if conventional power plants could be quickly shut down and started up at low cost. However, with the exception of certain peaking power plants such as aeroderivative turbines and fast-starting reciprocating engines, most conventional plants have minimum up-and-down times, and require several hours to restart\u2014at considerable cost.", "In some markets, electricity prices have dropped below the actual variable (fuel) cost of producing electricity on a number of occasions. This indicates that power plant operators are willing to sell energy at a loss to avoid further reducing output. At this point an increasing fraction of wind generation will simply be unusable by the system and electricity storage becomes an increasingly attractive method of shifting otherwise curtailed wind generation to times of lower wind generation (and/or higher loads). Overall, the increase in energy storage value or market size associated as a function of increasing VG penetration is not well quantified.

These alternative fuels can be produced using electricity (for example, by splitting hydrogen from oxygen atoms in water) either centrally or near the point of use. They can then be burned in a vehicle using a modified internal combustion (IC) engine and a conventional drive train. Such fuels can also be burned in an IC engine-electric drive train (hybrid-electric) vehicle configuration (HEV), or in a similar fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) configuration. The second pathway for electrified transport is to store electricity on board the vehicle, primarily using batteries, and to use that stored electricity to power an electric motor. The vehicle can be either a \"pure\" battery electric vehicle (BEV) or a vehicle that uses both stored grid electricity and an IC or fuel cell engine, typically referred to as a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV).

", "Shifting from gasoline to electricity may have a number of impacts on the electric power grid. One possible outcome is a need for new generation capacity for battery charging. However, the availability of off-peak generation is estimated to be sufficient for a large number of vehicles assuming some level of \"smart\" charging. A 2007 study estimated that spare generating capacity could have electrified 73% of light-duty gasoline vehicles in 2002. This level of vehicle electrification would displace petroleum equivalent to more than 50% of the nation's oil imports. Another study used a somewhat more conservative methodology to estimate that the bulk power system in 2002 could have supported electrification of approximately 37% of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs). The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) analyzed a scenario with 20% of VMTs in the United States powered by electricity in 2030; the modeled electric generating capacity was just 1.7% higher in this scenario compared to the base case scenario that assumed no EVs or PHEVs. Other, regional studies similar have concluded that, essentially, if vehicles charge off-peak, a large number of vehicles can be accommodated, but if on-peak charging is allowed, there could be increased generation requirements during peak periods of electricity demand. On the electric distribution side, the impacts of vehicle electrification are more complex. In some locations, a concentration of vehicle charging could exceed the capacity of distribution systems, and increased loads could shorten the lifetimes of distribution transformers. Distribution system impacts and the need for upgrades, as well as the ability to reduce the impacts via smart charging schemes, will need to be further evaluated, typically on a local level.", "EVs and PHEVs generally produce lower greenhouse gas emissions per mile than conventional vehicles. The amount of reduction depends on numerous assumptions about vehicle performance and the mix of electricity supplies used for charging. One estimate is that a PHEV powered by an average proportion of coal-generated electricity produces carbon emissions per mile similar to those of an HEV. If the PHEV is charged using the current grid average emissions, carbon emissions per mile are reduced by almost 60% compared to a conventional vehicle. Air pollutant emission changes due to EV and PHEV penetration are complicated because they depend on the type of generators used for electricity production, the pollution control equipment, and policies that limit emissions. A California study projects that PHEVs would reduce nitrogen oxide (NO x ) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions per mile by 87% and 97%, respectively, due to limits on the emissions of these pollutants. Estimates from other regions project changes over a large range, including some locations where net emissions could increase if current power plants do not install new pollution control devices. For example, one study found that life cycle NO x emissions changes could range from -70% (assuming charging with renewable generation) to +38% (charging with uncontrolled coal-fired plants) assuming no pollution control policies. The actual impact on air quality is even more complex because PHEVs displace emissions from urban areas to rural areas where power plants are typically located and fewer people live. Estimates using air quality models generally indicate improved air quality in urban areas as a result of vehicle electrification. ", "When parked, vehicles could potentially provide various grid services. Charging of EVs can potentially be controlled and can provide a source of dispatchable demand and demand response. Controlled charging can be timed to periods of greatest VG output, while charging rates can be controlled to provide contingency reserves or frequency regulation reserves. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) (where EVs can partially discharge stored energy to the grid) may provide additional value by acting as a distributed source of energy storage. Most proposals for V2G focus on short-term response services such as frequency regulation and contingency. Their ability to provide energy services is more limited by both the storage capacity of the battery and the high cost of battery cycling. This could restrict their ability to provide time shifting (energy arbitrage) beyond their ability to perform controlled charging. The role of V2G is an active area of research. Because electric vehicles in any form have yet to achieve significant market penetration, assessing their potential as a source of grid flexibility is difficult.

The power rating of a flow battery is determined by the size of the battery stack, and the energy rating by the size of the electrolyte storage tanks.", "As stated earlier in this section, the two main types of flow battery in early commercialization are vanadium redox and zinc-bromine. Vanadium redox batteries are part of a large class of flow batteries using an ion-exchange membrane similar to that used in fuel cells. (Hence, they are sometimes called regenerative fuel cells.) In a redox flow battery, the active materials are always dissolved in the electrolyte. While a number of electrolyte materials have been proposed or are under development, vanadium has the greatest degree of commercialization, with a number of installations and active vendors. Other redox flow battery chemistries have yet to be commercialized but have the potential to provide cost-effective alternatives and are discussed in the R&D section of this chapter. ", "The redox flow battery offers several benefits over conventional batteries. First, the amount of energy storage available is limited only by the size of the tanks and the amount of electrolyte available. An additional benefit is avoiding the need to correct for differences among individual battery cells (cell balancing) typical in multi-cell storage configurations using other battery technologies, which allows for relatively simple construction of higher voltage redox batteries. Redox flow batteries can also be recharged mechanically by replacing the electrolyte. The disadvantages generally stem from the complexity of electrolyte pumping and storage; control system complexity; and relatively low specific energy and energy density (typically less than that of lead acid cells). The use of an ion-exchange membrane introduces other challenges and benefits. Leakage across the membrane is possible, causing mixing of the cathode-side and anode-side electrolytes. In a vanadium redox battery, the impact of leakage is mitigated by the fact that both electrolyte materials are identical. However, using alternative chemistries, mixing can seriously degrade performance. The challenge of cost-effectively manufacturing reliable ion-exchange membranes is cited as a primary reason for the limited development of some of the earliest flow battery chemistries. The claimed calendar lifetime for a vanadium battery stack is at least 10 years with more than 10,000 cycles.", "The primary alternative to redox flow batteries is a flow battery where at least one of the active materials is plated onto an electrode. Several chemistries have been investigated, with zinc bromine being the most well developed. During charging, zinc is plated onto the negative electrode. When discharging zinc is dissolved into the electrolyte. This configuration benefits from a low-cost electrolyte and a slightly improved energy density, but problems can arise with formation of sharp particulates during zinc plating. A 2003 estimate of cycle life is about 2000 cycles or 6000 hours of continuous operations. Commercial units have cycle life ratings from 1500 to over 2000 cycles.", "The DC-DC round-trip efficiency for flow batteries is in the range of 70%-80%. However, as with all batteries, DC-AC losses reduce this efficiency further, and flow batteries have additional parasitic loads of electrolyte pumps. As a result, estimates of AC-AC roundtrip efficiency is in the range of 65%-72%.

For many types, such as the NaS battery the cost of raw materials is, theoretically, a trivial component. Most others have couple element costs of about $10/kWh or less (assuming costs in the study year). One chemistry that stands out as a potential cost challenge is vanadium, with the couple element costs close to $100/kWh, primarily due to the high cost of vanadium.

The ARPA-E goal of $100/kWh appears to include both the power and energy component, including power conditioning equipment, installation, and other balance of system components.

The main difference among these classes of cathodes is in their crystal structures. Each offers various advantages and disadvantages as shown in Figure 9 . The largest drawbacks of the layered oxide cathodes are cost and safety. Cost is driven up by cobalt and nickel content. Safety concerns are driven by the production of oxygen under abusive conditions (typically high temperature, high voltage and state of charge, where reaction with the electrolyte or dissolution may occur). Since the electrolyte is comprised of flammable organic solvents, when combined with oxygen, such reactions lead to the risk of fire and explosion. The principal challenges in spinel-based cathodes are lower energy content compared to layered oxides and a tendency for manganese to dissolve at higher temperatures (>55 o C/131 o F), thereby limiting longevity.

The low cost and high availability of sulfur also aid the cost effectiveness and sustainability of manufacturing these batteries. However, because the electrical conductivity of sulfur is low, it is generally necessary to employ porous carbon supports, the additional weight of which lowers the energy content per unit weight or volume of the cell. The chemistry also includes a natural mechanism to protect the cell from overcharge by diverting the current to a shuttle reaction in which sulfur is cycled back-and-forth between two valence states. However, tuning the shuttle for optimal performance is complex, and limits the life of the cell to 10 months or less, in some cases.

Hydrogen is typically discussed as being used in fuel cell systems, which have higher efficiency than conventional combustion engines, partly compensating for the upstream energy intensity of most hydrogen energy pathways. Fuel cells convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity through an electrochemical process, resulting in water and heat as potentially useful byproducts. Fuel cells have been described as \"open\" or \"flow\" batteries, in which the chemical reactants, typically hydrogen and oxygen, are fed into the fuel cell continuously rather than being stored within the system like a battery. Though the concept has been understood since 1838, the first significant use of fuel cells was in the Apollo space program in the 1960s.

Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) can potentially provide a cost effective, clean and low-carbon alternative to gasoline in light duty vehicle applications depending upon the original energy source for the fuel. A 2010 study by McKinsey evaluating the current status of FCEVs concluded that the technology has moved from the demonstration phase to the commercial deployment phase. Most major automotive companies have some demonstration-scale production FCEVs in operation. Hydrogen fuel cell systems are commercially viable today in forklifts for warehouses. Demonstration FCEV projects are ongoing in the United States and elsewhere, with commercial deployment in select areas expected in 2015 for ordinary consumers. Projected costs for automotive fuel cell systems, once perceived to be a major cost barrier, have come down significantly due to R&D activities, with estimates approaching $50/kW when deployed at scale. Significant industry and government stakeholder support for FCEVs has been realized internationally and in several states including California and Hawaii . There are currently 56 hydrogen refueling stations in the United States, most being test or demonstration projects, and approximately 300 FCEVs are in use by select household consumers in California, refueling at some 22 hydrogen stations within the state .

The existing U.S. plant has a single turbomachinery drive train using a common motor-generator set connected to the compressor and expander via clutches. This results in turnaround times from compression to expansion of approximately 30 minutes, limiting its use in providing operating reserves and other services requiring fast response.", "Proposed CAES plants include a dedicated motor drive compressor and expander-generator that would eliminate the single turbomachinery train. This would allow for faster switchover from compression to generation, thus increasing its usefulness for providing ancillary services and responding to increased variability of net load. Once operating, CAES plants can provide rapid ramp rates; the McIntosh plant is capable of ramping at about 18 MW (16% of full output) per minute, or rates that are more than 50% greater than a typical gas turbine. While CAES can provide a variety of services, including those needed to aid in renewables integration, it is also well suited to help address transmission constraints in locations with good wind resources. CAES has been proposed to reduce curtailment due to transmission constraints by co-locating it with wind generation, allowing for greater utilization of transmission lines. As stated earlier in this report, this application could decrease the amount of new transmission needed to access remote wind resources, but represents a trade-off between the most cost-effective use of storage, and the cost of new transmission. In general, it is not optimal to co-locate wind turbines and storage because doing so decreases the usefulness of the storage device. However, in cases where transmission is difficult (or impossible) to site, or is very expensive, the loss of opportunities for storage may be exceeded by its use as an alternative to transmission.", "Since CAES is a hybrid system, its efficiency cannot be simply stated as a single number. The performance of CAES is based on two separate quantities: the heat rate and the charging electricity ratio. The heat rate is the fuel consumption per unit electrical output similar to heat rates quoted for conventional thermal generation. A typical value for the diabatic CAES heat rate is approximately 3900-4400 Btu/kWh, although improved turboexpansion cycles and heat recovery can reduce fuel consumption further. The charging electricity ratio (CER) is the ratio of output electricity to input electricity of the plant, typically in the range of 1.2-1.8, with higher values for increased pressure ratios across the turboexpander train and greater numbers of compression stages. The fact that the charging ratio is greater than one means that CAES produces more electricity than it consumes, with the balance made up by the consumption of natural gas. As a result, the production of 1 kWh from a CAES plant requires the input of about 0.6 to 0.8 kWh of electricity and 3900-4400 Btu of natural gas fuel. The CER also takes into account piping and throttling losses (a function the reservoir pressure range) as well as compressor and expander efficiencies. Turbine efficiency is especially important in the low-pressure expansion stage where approximately three quarters of the power is generated. Increased turbine inlet temperatures (e.g., by using expander blade cooling technologies) would enhance the turbine and CAES electrical efficiencies. Unlike almost all other storage technologies, there is virtually no decay or self-discharge of stored energy, at least when deployed in salt domes, since these formations are self-healing, meaning pores on the cavity walls seal themselves with available air moisture, virtually eliminating the possibility of air leakage.", " Figure 20 provides a method to compare the impact of the heat rate and CER of CAES with conventional storage plant efficiency (such as in a battery or pumped hydro plant). It provides the dispatch price, or fuel related costs (both natural gas and electricity) for generation of electricity from both a CAES plant and a conventional storage plant with different natural gas prices and efficiencies. Ignoring O&M costs, the dispatch price of CAES is the sum of the cost of electricity for compression, plus natural gas, while for a conventional storage plant it is just the cost of charging electricity, considering storage losses. At very low off-peak electricity prices, conventional storage has an advantage over CAES due to the fixed natural gas cost, while at higher off-peak prices, CAES has an advantage due to the need for less electricity purchases. It should be noted that this chart does not consider the capital cost of the device, where CAES has additional advantages over many other storage technologies.", "The lifetime of CAES is similar to that of a combustion turbine. While operation and maintenance is required to replace turbine blades, well materials, and other components, the existing systems at Huntorf and McIntosh continue to operate after 20 to 30 years with very high running and starting availabilities (over 95%). The impact of rapid ramping and multiple daily starts might increase operation and maintenance costs, but the conventional CAES is a proven technology with a well-established operational record."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost", "paragraphs": ["Given that no CAES facilities have been constructed since 1991, it is difficult to accurately estimate the current capital cost of the technology. Recent estimates for the capital cost of conventional diabatic CAES ( Figure 21 ) range from $600 to $1200/kW with a mean range of $880 to $1020/kW.", "Total capital cost for CAES can be disaggregated into surface turbomachinery costs and subsurface costs with the latter projected to account for approximately 5%-10% of total project capital cost depending on the type of geology chosen.", "To gauge the potential for future cost reduction associated with CAES turbomachinery, it is common to use the natural gas combustion turbine (CT) as a reference or lower bound. CT capital costs of $650-$690/kW imply a CAES-equivalent cost lower bound of $220-$230/kW. While it is unlikely that CAES surface turbomachinery will reach these costs in the near term, it does suggest high levels of deployment could drive substantial capital costs reductions.", "Typical numbers for variable and fixed O&M for CAES are $60/kW-year and $13/kW-year respectively.

While the existing plants in Huntorf and McIntosh are based largely on legacy steam and gas turbine technology, it is likely that future system designs will benefit from improved heat integration, more specialized surface turbomachinery, better systems integration and newer cycles that take advantage of the technology's unique operating characteristics. CAES output is changed by adjusting the air flow (taking advantage of the compressed air from storage) rather than by adjusting the inlet temperature as in a conventional gas turbine. This contributes to the overall low heat rate and high part load efficiency of CAES, but also allows for more specialized cycles to be employed to take advantage of these characteristics. One such example of a new design could provide improved heat recovery and elimination of specialized combustors.", "Near-term cost reductions can be realized by using CAES designs that rely to a greater extent on off-the-shelf technology. Several variations of this approach have been explored recently as exemplified by plans for the 150 MW CAES plant proposed by the New York State Electric & Gas Corporation. By integrating a stand-alone CT into the CAES configuration, capital costs can be significantly reduced (estimated by the company to be roughly half the cost of a conventional diabatic CAES system).

While there is ample geology available for near-term deployment, an accurate determination of the total availability of geologic air storage will require extensive additional data. Site testing and characterization is certainly not a trivial matter; numerous screening criteria and extensive testing are required to determine a formation's adequacy for air storage. An extensive survey of CAES geologies including aquifer permeability, porosity, and cap rock characteristics is needed to accurately make the assessment on the deployment limits of CAES.", "There are a number of other challenges associated with the underground formation and use. The development of solution mined caverns in domal or bedded salt requires water, and subsequent disposal of brine. Water use for solution mining is likely to be about 8 cubic meters of water for each cubic meter of salt excavated or about 4.8 million cubic meters of fresh water withdrawals and brine management per 220-MW plant. Disposal of brine has been raised as a concern for some locations. Additional challenges related to the introduction of air into an underground geologic formation (e.g., oxidation and additional corrosion mechanisms) have been identified and likewise cyclic loading of formations could result in greater material degradation than conventional natural gas storage operation but it is not yet clear the extent to which these could limit CAES deployment potential. With regard to permitting the subsurface component, although it will depend on the type of geology and formation characteristics, air storage is similar in most respects to a conventional natural gas storage facility that have been routinely sited for many decades.", "Other deployment challenges associated with CAES are similar to other gas-fired power plants in terms of land, water, or other environmental impacts.

As a result of these characteristics, a proposed application of capacitors is to place them in parallel with battery terminals and provide a current boost during periods of high demand, such as during vehicle acceleration. It is unclear though, whether the benefits of a parallel battery/EC system outweigh the additional cost of ECs; EV storage costs are predominantly driven by the useable energy requirement which dictates the size of the battery.

This technology has not yet been applied in a major U.S. installation, but has been used in several international plants.

PHS suffers from the perception that there are no available sites for new development, notwithstanding that the capacity of proposed plants exceeds the installed capacity of PHS in the United States. Although there is no single comprehensive estimate of PHS potential, older studies indicate the availability of hundreds of conventional PHS sites and over 1000 GW of potential capacity in just 6 western states.

PHS requires suitable topographical relief, but there is a noticeable lack of existing or proposed sites in much of the country, particularly in the Midwest and Texas (both areas with excellent wind resources). There are several proposals to extend PHS deployment in areas without traditional PHS geography. There are also proposals to decrease the footprint of PHS, which would have the added benefit of reducing its environmental impact and corresponding opposition. The most common proposal is to use an underground formation such as a natural aquifer or mined cavern for the lower reservoir. There was extensive discussion of this type of configuration, including a large number of design studies and proposals for underground pumped hydro, during the build-out period of conventional PHS during the 1970s and 1980s. Of the proposed plants with preliminary permits, several use an underground formation, but the majority use an above ground reservoir. This is likely due to cost, but updated cost estimates would be valuable to assess the feasibility of underground PHS.

A cylindrical weight sitting on a column of water is raised like a piston to store electricity and lowered during discharge. The total amount of energy that can be stored is proportional to the mass of the piston and the length of the vertical column. Since these are excavated systems, they could theoretically be sited anywhere with suitable geology and could have a relatively small footprint (about 0.3 GW/acre).

Construction times vary, with one recent estimate of 4-5 years. This results in a 10-12 year construction time for new PHS based on current schedules.", "Permitting and construction times, and associated costs, can increase due to siting opposition and environmental regulations. PHS development on existing streams can affect water quality and ecosystems as with any other hydro project. Environmental concerns have prevented or greatly delayed construction of many proposed projects, and even delayed or prevented operation of completed projects. For example, one project in Georgia was completed in 1988, but did not operate until 2002 due to environmental concerns. Another project in Missouri was completed in 1982, but has never been used due to fish kills. Finally, there is significant opposition to new PHS development based simply on the amount of land area flooded for the upper and lower reservoirs. The total flooded area of three of the more recently constructed large PHS plants in the United States (the Bad Creek Hydroelectric Station in South Carolina, the Balsam Meadow Pumped Storage Project in California, and the Bath County Pumped Storage Station in Virginia) is in the range of 1,200 m 2 /MW-1,500 m 2 /MW. Older PHS facilities with constructed upper and lower reservoirs can have flooded areas that exceed 4,000 m 2 /MW. New plants are more likely to have land use requirements towards the lower range, such as the proposed Eagle Mountain and Iowa Hill plants, with flooded area requirements of about 1,100 m 2 /MW. Since PHS facilities are generally large and in remote, they typically require new high-voltage transmission, which adds additional siting challenges.", "An approach to minimizing the environmental impact (and potential opposition) to new PHS construction is to reduce or eliminate its impact on existing bodies of water. Most existing U.S. PHS plants are \"open-cycle\" plants; that is, they use an existing water body, usually the lower reservoir, for one of their reservoirs. However, \"closed-cycle\" plants\u2014plants where both lower and upper reservoirs are constructed\u2014will likely become more prevalent in the future because they minimize environmental effects as they do not interact with natural water bodies and they have little or no impact to aquatic life. Closed cycle plants can use existing features including abandoned mines to minimize development costs. A water source is needed for a closed-cycle plant to provide water to initially fill the reservoir and to compensate for losses during operation due to leakage and evaporation. Some proposed plants will use groundwater and at least one facility has proposed to use recycled wastewater, which could be a significant opportunity for other new PHS facilities as well. Closed-cycle PHS plants could be candidates for a streamlined FERC permitting process given their lack of interaction with any active body of water. This could reduce licensing and construction times to eight years, reducing investor risks.", "Safety risks associated with PHS are similar to those of other hydro projects. The biggest risk is dam failure and flooding. There is one example of failure (resulting in property damage and injuries) at a U.S. PHS facility, which occurred at the Taum Sauk plant in 2005. The failure was due to the upper reservoir being overfilled and subsequently being breached. The resulting flood destroyed one house and caused damage to a local park. PHS requires little if any toxic, rare, or foreign-sourced materials. There are no operational emissions. \"Life-cycle\" greenhouse gas emissions due to construction and operation are relatively low.

Flywheel power density is largely based on how quickly the rotor can be slowed down. Flywheel roundtrip efficiency is determined by the combination of two factors: instantaneous roundtrip efficiency and standby losses. Instantaneous roundtrip efficiency represents the efficiency of turning electricity into rotational kinetic energy, and then returning the kinetic energy back to electricity. Most of the energy losses occur in the power electronics, converting AC electricity to DC electricity, and then the reverse. Typical instantaneous roundtrip efficiencies range from 80% to 90%.", "Standby losses refer to frictional losses on the spinning rotor, which increase with the amount of time the rotational energy is stored. Frictional losses are primarily from the bearings and air drag. Typical standby losses range of 2%-3%/hr are primarily managed by using the motor to maintain a constant rotor velocity. For example, to maintain 1 kWh of rotational kinetic energy, a constant electrical load of 25 W may be used to maintain rotor velocity. Employing superconductive magnetic bearings can reduce bearing losses to less than 0.5% per hour, but at higher cost.

More importantly, the peak demand for most U.S. utilities is strongly driven by the aggregated cooling demands of individual buildings. \"Cool\" thermal storage relies on a simple concept: operate a building's energy-intensive refrigeration equipment for space conditioning at night to create and store energy in the form of ice or chilled water. That chilled water is then used as a reservoir of \"cold\" during the day to meet building cooling loads, reducing the operation of the building's cooling equipment during daytime on-peak periods. In effect, the TES shifts electricity demand from day to night, when electric energy cost and utility demand is low, in a highly predictable way. The concept of cool storage as a \"thermal battery\" translates into operating cost savings for the building owner. It also yields broader benefits for utilities when widely applied through its ability to decrease the aggregate electric demand during on-peak periods.

The overall energy \"effectiveness\" can sometimes even be higher than 100% because a cold-storage based cooling system can use less electricity than its conventional alternative. Unlike most technologies, TES does not have to convert electricity into an intermediate energy carrier and back to electricity. TES converts electricity into \"cold\" in essentially the same manner it would in a system without TES, only at a different time. As a result, the primary losses (again compared to its conventional alternative) are heat losses in the storage tank (which are generally well insulated). One estimate of heat losses in a commercial ice storage tank was about 0.7% per day. Another report claims 1%-5% per day. However, TES systems can improve the operating efficiency of equipment used for air conditioning compared to non-storage systems. A building with TES system will run its refrigeration equipment at nighttime when the system efficiency is higher due to cooler ambient conditions. In addition TES system allows operation of refrigeration equipment at or near peak efficiency during all operating hours compared to non-storage systems which have to operate at less efficient part-load conditions for the majority of its hours of operation annually. The net effect is the potential to decrease total energy consumption associated with cooling, in addition to the load-shifting and capacity benefits.", "There are examples of comparable buildings where the TES equipped building uses less cooling energy than the non-TES building, implying an efficiency of greater than 100%. One case involves the installation of an ice storage TES system at one of the Kraft Foods Headquarters buildings in Northfield, IL. Two comparably constructed buildings were operated\u2014one with ice TES and one without. In 1997, the building equipped with ice storage consumed 10,114,460 kWh with a peak demand of 2,368 kW while the non-storage building required 11,695,468 kWh (+15%) with a peak electrical demand of 3,307 kW (+40%). The TES equipped building operated during that year with a 19% ($193,000) lower electric bill. In addition, TES has the added benefit of reduced transmission and distribution losses similar to other distributed energy storage devices.", "For most TES technologies, the device lifetime is equal to or longer than the refrigeration system it is displacing. Detailed O&M cost figures (which again must be compared to the O&M requirements to that alternative system) are not widely published, however, the ongoing maintenance of a TES system is minimal\u2014often only requiring occasional checks of water levels and water quality to assure adequate treatment is being sustained. Furthermore, buildings equipped with TES often have fewer chillers or smaller chillers.

In fact, a number of building thermal storage systems have been installed at a lower capital cost when compared to their non-storage system counterparts. The actual costs of storage systems will be variable depending on the sizing strategy.

Although the added complexity of TES to a building is small to moderate, many designers perceive this added complexity as increased risk. Overall, greater awareness and suitable design tools are needed to increase consideration of TES as a design option.

Thermal storage systems become cost-justified in cases where demand costs are high and time-of-use rates exhibit high energy cost differentials between on-peak and off-peak periods. When rate structures do not completely capture the capacity and time-shifting value of TES, then the technology will be undervalued and adoption minimized. For building types that would utilize small TES technologies, time-of-use rate structures are not uniformly available; therefore, this technology is particularly challenged to achieve market penetration.
