In February 2009, the Barack Obama Administration announced that it would send a delegation to the Review Conference consultations. Based on its observations, the Administration concluded that it would not participate in further negotiations due primarily to the draft outcome document's focus on Israel. It stated that it remained open to re-engaging in negotiations if a draft document appeared to take a \"constructive approach\" to addressing racism and discrimination.

Other Members contend that the United States should not participate or fund the Conference because of WCAR's focus on Israel.

World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (WCAR), which was held in Durban, South Africa, from August 31 to September 7, 2001. At WCAR, participating governments, including the United States, sought to acknowledge and recommend ways for the international community to address racism and related intolerance. The Conference attracted a significant amount of national and international attention because of what many viewed as participating governments' disproportionate focus on Israel as a perpetrator of racism and intolerance in the Middle East. The United States withdrew from WCAR when, in its view, it became clear that governments, particularly members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) , would continue to target Israel while contemporary forms of racism remained unaddressed.", "In December 2006, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a Durban Review Conference to assess the implementation of WCAR's main outcome documents\u2014the Durban Declaration and Program of Action. The Bush Administration opposed the Review Conference and did not participated in the preparatory process or voted for U.N. resolutions supporting or funding it. ", "In February 2009, the Barack Obama Administration decided to participate in Review Conference consultations to observe the current status of negotiations related to the Review Conference outcome document.

The Administration stated that it remained open to re-engaging in negotiations if a draft document appeared to take a \"constructive approach\" to addressing racism and discrimination. Other countries, including Canada, Israel, and Italy have announced that they will boycott the Conference, and some governments stated they will not participate unless it is clear that the Conference will not target Israel. In the coming weeks, participating countries will continue to negotiate the Review Conference draft outcome document.", "Members of Congress have demonstrated continued interest in the Durban Review Conference. Some Members, for example, are concerned that the United States would fund a U.N. conference that serves as a forum for anti-Semitism. They have proposed legislation that would withhold a proportionate share of U.S. assessed contributions to the U.N. regular budget, which funds the Review Conference. Limiting U.S. contributions to the Review Conference in this manner would have no impact on the Review Conference because assessed contributions finance the U.N. regular budget in its entirety and not specific or separate parts of it. Other Members of Congress have emphasized the importance of combating racism internationally, and have proposed and passed resolutions urging President Obama to engage in diplomatic efforts to ensure that the Review Conference does not further discredit U.N. efforts to address racism by disproportionately focusing on Israel.", "Members of the 111 th Congress will likely consider a number of issues when conducting oversight of the Review Conference and determining appropriate levels of U.S. participation and financial contributions. Some suggest, for example, that ongoing Review Conference preparations indicate that certain U.N. member states will continue to target Israel. Others are concerned about the potential diplomatic or political impact of U.S. participation, or lack thereof. Some, for instance, maintain that the question of U.S. participation in the Review Conference is inherently linked to the larger issue of U.S. participation in international organizations. They are concerned that a selective approach to U.S. engagement in the United Nations may damage the reputation and negotiating influence of the United States both within and outside of the U.N. system. Opponents, however, contend that U.S. participation in the Review Conference contradicts the objectives of the Conference and would provide legitimacy to U.N. mechanisms that allow member states to criticize Israel in the context of racism.", "This report provides background information on previous U.N. efforts to address racism and the 2001 World Conference Against Racism.

Member states, for instance, incorporated the idea of racial equality into international documents such as the U.N. Charter in 1945 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Through the 1960s, member states negotiated and ratified international agreements and declarations that addressed the issue. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), for example, requires parties to condemn and work to eliminate discrimination in all of its forms, regardless of race, sex, language, or religion. The treaty, which entered into force on January 4, 1969, has been ratified or acceded to by 173 U.N. member states. It was ratified by the United States on October 21, 1994.", "U.N. member states have also addressed racism through U.N. bodies such as the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, the main subsidiary body of the Commission on Human Rights (now the Human Rights Council). In 1993, the Human Rights Council appointed a Special Rapporteur on racism, racial discrimination, and xenophobia to report to U.N. member states on contemporary forms of racism.", "In the past three decades, U.N. member states have focused on raising global awareness of racism and taking measures to address the issue through U.N. \"Decades Against Racism\" and three global anti-racism conferences. During each Decade Against Racism\u20141973 to 1982, 1983 to 1992, and 1993 to 2002\u2014participating U.N. member states held world conferences against racism, including the 2001 World Conference in Durban, South Africa. At each Conference, U.N. member states negotiated programs of action that would be implemented by governments and U.N. specialized agencies, funds, and programs.", "Some U.N. member state efforts to address racism in U.N. fora have been controversial. Probably the most notorious effort occurred in 1975, when member states adopted General Assembly resolution 3379, which stated that Zionism is a form a racism and racial discrimination. The United States strongly opposed the resolution, stating that it treated racism not as a serious injustice, but as an \"epithet to be flung at whoever [sic] happens to be one's adversary.\" Sixteen years later, on December 16, 1991, the General Assembly adopted a resolution to revoke resolution 3379. Despite its repeal, many argue that the adoption of resolution 3379 greatly diminished the credibility of U.N. efforts to address racism and had a lasting and adverse effect on relations among U.N. member states\u2014particularly among Israel and other Middle Eastern countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Role", "paragraphs": ["The United States did not participate in the 1978 and 1985 World Conferences Against Racism because of its strong opposition to resolution 3379.

Members have supported U.N. mechanisms that address racism, such as ICERD. On the other hand, Congress has condemned the efforts of some U.N. member states to address racism that appear to target Israel.

Conference participants also aimed to recommend ways to improve regional, national, and international measures to combat racism, and ensure that the United Nations had the resources to combat racism. Unlike previous World Conferences that focused primarily on racism and racial discrimination, WCAR also addressed issues related to xenophobia and related intolerance.", "The U.N. General Assembly designated the U.N.

The group synthesized the outcome documents from regional meetings into the draft Declaration and Program of Action (hereafter \"outcome documents\") that was considered at the Conference.

Initial drafts of the WCAR Declaration, for example, included language that equated Zionism with racism. Some countries, including the United States, Canada, and members of the European Union, strongly objected to these sentiments.

Assistant Secretary Wood further stated that the United States was ready to join WCAR participants in expressing regret for historic injustices such as slavery.

Some expressed concern with drafts proposed by the Working Group. In May 2008, for example, the Working Group circulated a list of issues that might be included in the Conference outcome document.

Member States have been formally and informally negotiating the draft outcome document that will be considered at the Review Conference. On March 17, 2009, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights published a draft outcome document \"rolling text\" based on ongoing Member State negotiations. The 17-page document eliminates many controversial aspects of previous drafts, including specific mentions of Israel, Palestine, and \"defamation of religion.\" Critics, however, contend that while the March 8 text might be seen as an improvement over previous drafts it does not meet the conditions for U.S. participation. Specifically, opponents point to paragraph 1 which reaffirms the Durban Declaration and Program of Action (DDPA). The DDPA had expressed concern about the \"plight of the Palestinian people under foreign occupation\" and recognized \"the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State.\" Critics hold that by reaffirming the DDPA, the Review Conference draft outcome is singling out Israel as a perpetrator of racism. ", "Supporters of U.S. participation argue that the shortened March 8 text is an encouraging development and that the United States should participate in the Review Conference to influence its outcome. A representative from the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reportedly stated, \"we believe this shortened text represents a solid and meaningful basis for negotiations by member states toward a positive outcome for the Conference.\" When advocating U.S. participation, a number of supporters emphasize the difference between early WCAR drafts in 2001 that equated Zionism with racism and the final DDPA that contained, in the view of many, relatively moderate language by comparison.

The final decision regarding U.S. funding of the Conference, however, will be made by the Obama Administration or Members of the 111 th Congress. If Congress does not enact legislation prohibiting U.S. funding for the Review Conference, the Obama Administration may decide on its own to withhold the U.S. proportionate share of U.S. contributions prior to the Conference. If such a scenario occurred, it would raise the question as to whether the Administration would release funding after the Conference if the outcome was acceptable to the United States.", "Specifically, some Members of the 110 th and 111 th Congresses proposed that the United States withhold a proportionate share of its U.N. assessed contributions, approximately 22%, from the U.N. regular budget, which is used to fund the Conference. Withholding funds in this manner would not affect the Conference because assessed contributions finance the U.N. regular budget in its entirety and not specific parts of it. The U.S. decision to withhold a proportionate share of funding from the U.N. Human Rights Council for FY2008 would not affect funding for the Durban Review Conference or its preparatory process because funding for both mechanisms falls under separate parts of the budget of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.", "As of November 17, 2008, the Secretary-General estimates that the cost of the Review Conference and its preparatory process will be $3,754,800.

Some argue that the U.S. and Israeli withdrawals from WCAR were a turning point in negotiations and sent a powerful diplomatic message to Conference participants. They contend that the withdrawals pressured other governments to adopt more moderate language on the Middle East in the final outcome documents. Conversely, some contend that the language in the Declaration and Program of Action remains unacceptable to the United States. To support this view, opponents point to the Bush Administration's policy of consistently voting against resolutions supporting the Review Conference in U.N. fora.

Supporters contend that U.S. participation in U.N. efforts such as the Review Conference is important to the success and credibility of the United Nations as a whole. They argue that instead of withdrawing from U.N. conferences that have processes or outcomes it opposes, the United States should fully participate and work from within to build member state coalitions in support of U.S. policies. If the United States does not fully participate in U.N. fora, some argue, U.N. member state actions might be determined by groups of member states advocating agendas that are contrary to U.S. interests. They maintain that U.S. absence from such U.N. efforts could create a vacuum in which views opposed by the United States hold supreme. Supporters contend that a piecemeal and selective approach to participation in the United Nations damages the U.S. negotiating position and its influence both within and outside of the U.N. system.

They also argue that it would imply that the United States supports the anti-Semitism demonstrated at WCAR as well as what many perceive as unbalanced language in the Durban Declaration and Program of Action. According to some, U.S. non-participation in the Review Conference sends a clear message to U.N. member states that repeatedly targeting one country and regional conflict in U.N. fora is unacceptable to the United States. They contend that the long-term political impact of such a message outweighs the short-term diplomatic impact of U.S. non-participation or withdrawal. These opponents therefore agree with the Bush Administration's decision not to participate in the preparatory process until, as U.S. officials say, it is proven that the Review Conference will not become a platform for anti-Semitism. They argue that holding out the possibility of U.S. participation\u2014as well as the participation of other like-minded governments who have made similar statements\u2014may persuade U.N. member states to take a more balanced approach when drafting and negotiating Review Conference outcome documents in preparation for the April 2009 Conference."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
