{"id": "R40155", "title": "Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): Overview and Issues", "released_date": "2013-11-22T00:00:00", "summary": ["Federal policy has played a key role in the emergence of the U.S. biofuels industry. Policy measures have included minimum renewable fuel usage requirements, blending and production tax credits, an import tariff, loans and loan guarantees, and research grants. One of the more prominent forms of federal policy support is the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)\u2014whereby a minimum volume of biofuels is to be used in the national transportation fuel supply each year. This report describes the general nature of the RFS mandate and its implementation, and outlines some emerging issues related to the continued growth of U.S. biofuels production needed to fulfill the expanding RFS mandate, the potential inability of the domestic market to absorb ethanol above a 10% share of domestic gasoline fuels (a problem known as the \"blend wall\"), and the emergence of potential unintended consequences of this rapid expansion.", "Congress first established the RFS with the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct, P.L. 109-58). This initial RFS (referred to as RFS1) mandated that a minimum of 4 billion gallons be used in 2006, rising to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. Two years later, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140) greatly expanded the biofuel mandate volumes and extended the ramp-up through 2022. The expanded RFS (referred to as RFS2) required the annual use of 9 billion gallons of biofuels in 2008, rising to 36 billion gallons in 2022, with at least 16 billion gallons from cellulosic biofuels, and a cap of 15 billion gallons for corn-starch ethanol.", "In addition to the expanded volumes and extended date, RFS2 has three important distinctions from RFS1. First, the total renewable fuel requirement is divided into four separate, but nested categories\u2014total renewable fuels, advanced biofuels, biomass-based diesel, and cellulosic biofuels\u2014each with its own volume requirement. Second, biofuels qualifying under each category must achieve certain minimum thresholds of lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, with certain exceptions applicable to existing facilities. Third, all renewable fuel must be made from feedstocks that meet an amended definition of renewable biomass, including certain land use restrictions.", "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for establishing and implementing regulations to ensure that the nation's transportation fuel supply contains the mandated biofuels volumes. EPA's initial regulations for administering RFS1 (issued in April 2007) established detailed compliance standards for fuel suppliers, a tracking system based on renewable identification numbers (RINs) with credit verification and trading, special treatment of small refineries, and general waiver provisions. EPA rules for administering RFS2 (issued in February 2010) built upon the earlier RFS1 regulations and include specific deadlines for announcing annual standards, as well as greater specificity on potential waiver requests and RIN oversight.", "Over the long term, the RFS is likely to play a dominant role in the development of the U.S. biofuels sector. However, emerging resource constraints related to the rapid expansion of U.S. corn ethanol production have provoked questions about its long-run sustainability and the possibility of unintended consequences in other markets as well as on the environment. Questions also exist about the ability of the U.S. biofuels industry to meet the expanding mandate for biofuels from non-corn sources such as cellulosic biomass materials, whose production capacity has been slow to develop, or biomass-based biodiesel, which remains expensive to produce owing to the relatively high prices of its feedstocks. Finally, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the development of the infrastructure capacity (e.g., trucks, pipelines, retail pumps, etc.) needed to deliver the expanding biofuels mandate to consumers."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Dependence on foreign sources of crude oil, concerns over global climate change, and the desire to promote domestic rural economies have raised interest in renewable biofuels as an alternative to petroleum in the U.S. transportation sector. In response to this interest, U.S. policymakers have enacted a variety of policies, at both the state and federal levels, to directly support U.S. biofuels production and use (although some of these policies have expired). Policy measures have included blending and production tax credits to lower the cost of biofuels to end users, an import tariff to protect domestic ethanol from cheaper foreign-produced ethanol, research grants to stimulate the development of new biofuels technologies, loans and loan guarantees to facilitate the development of biofuels production and distribution infrastructure, and, perhaps most important, minimum usage requirements to guarantee a market for biofuels irrespective of their cost. As a result of expanding policy support, biofuels (primarily corn-based ethanol and biodiesel) production has grown significantly (up over 600%) since the early 2000s. However, despite the rapid growth, U.S. biofuels consumption remains small as a component of U.S. motor fuels, comprising about 5.7% of total transportation fuel consumption (on a gasoline-equivalent basis) in 2012. ", "Initially, the most significant federal programs for supporting biofuels were tax credits for the production or blending of ethanol and biodiesel into the nation's fuel supply. However, under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)\u2014first established in 2005, then greatly expanded in 2007 (as described below)\u2014Congress mandated biofuels use.

With respect to the GHG emissions assessments, EISA specifically directed EPA to evaluate the aggregate quantity of GHG emissions (including direct emissions and significant indirect emissions, such as significant emissions from land use changes) related to the full lifecycle, including all stages of fuel and feedstock production, distribution, and use by the ultimate consumer.

ILUC refers to the idea that diversion of an acre of traditional field cropland in the United States to grow a biofuels feedstock crop might result (due to market price effects) in that same acre reappearing at another location and potentially on virgin soils, such as the Amazon rainforest. Such a transfer\u2014when included in the lifecycle GHG calculation of a particular biofuel\u2014could result in an estimated net increase in GHG emissions. EPA's initial assessment of biofuel lifecycle GHG emissions in its proposed RFS2 was met with criticism from many stakeholders.", "Several environmental and academic groups argued that, as a result of ILUC costs, corn ethanol should not be permissible under the RFS2. Biofuels proponents argued that ILUC was too vague a concept to be measurable in a meaningful way, and that it alone should not determine the fate of the U.S. biofuels industry. As a result, EPA reconsidered all of the evidence (including ILUC) and made relevant adjustments to its analytical tools. The resultant changes were announced as part of its final RFS2 rule of February 3, 2010.", "In addition, EPA has pointed out that other pathways are likely to be similar enough to existing qualifying pathways ( Table 3 ) that they can be extended the same GHG reduction compliance determinations.

Since the RFS biofuels categories are nested, the price of biodiesel RINs is generally equal to or greater than the price of RINs for advanced biofuels which, in turn is generally equal to or greater than the RIN value for total renewable biofuels. Thus, RIN values may vary across RFS categories as well as geographically with variations in specific biofuels supply and demand conditions. ", "Differences in RIN values also reflect the degree to which the mandate associated with a specific RIN biofuel category is binding on the market equilibrium. For example, if the supply of a specific biofuel\u2014including both domestically produced as well as imported\u2014available to the market exceeds the RFS mandate (see left-hand side of Figure 2 where Q * > Q RFS ), then the RIN's \"core\" value (i.e., its price minus transaction costs and speculative component) would be zero at the mandated level (Q RFS ).", "In contrast, if the mandated biofuel usage level exceeds what is offered by the market (see right-hand side of Figure 2 where Q RFS > Q * ), the biofuels mandate is binding because it forces obligated parties (\"blenders\" for this discussion) to use more biofuels than they would without the mandate. The price of the biofuel purchased by the blender has to rise to P producer to solicit the extra production from the biofuels producers, while the biofuels price must fall to P blender to encourage greater blender purchases. The RIN's core value would be equal to the gap between these two prices, P producer minus P blender . However, the blender must pay the full price of P producer , which includes both P blender plus the RIN's core value, to acquire the mandated Q RFS . ", "A RIN also may have speculative value, even when in surplus, if an investor were to anticipate a shortage in the near future (i.e., within the period for which a RIN is valid) and seek to acquire RINs cheaply in advance of the shortage. Prior to 2013, the overall biofuels mandates had not been binding and renewable fuel RIN values were small (usually less than $0.05/gallon). However, based on EIA data for U.S. gasoline consumption, it is expected that the RFS as scheduled in the statute will become binding sometime during 2013 or 2014 (see discussion later in this report). As a result, RIN prices escalated sharply in 2013 to prices well in excess of $1.00/gallon, before dropping dramatically in the second half of the year. Economists suggest that market conditions\u2014supply, demand, and asymmetries in market power\u2014will determine how any added cost of biofuels acquisition (i.e., the RIN value) would be distributed along the supply chain\u2014that is, partially absorbed by biofuel producers and blenders or passed on to motor fuel consumers in the form of higher fuel prices.", "Because RINs have value, they are not immune to fraudulent activity. In late 2011 and early 2012, EPA issued notices of violations (NOVs) to three companies (Clean Green Fuels, LLC, Absolute Fuels, LLC, and Green Diesel, LLC) that the agency alleges fraudulently generated a combined 140 million biodiesel RINs in 2010 and 2011.

By 2013, EIA had substantially lowered its fuel consumption outlook\u2014partly due to sustained high petroleum prices, the prolonged effects of the 2008 financial crises on consumer incomes, and significantly higher fuel economy standards on new vehicles. Instead of growth, EIA projects gasoline consumption to fall to about 120 billion gallons by 2022, thus causing the RFS mandate's share of the gasoline transportation fuel market (if left unchanged) to grow to nearly 20% of annual consumption (in gasoline-equivalent gallons). ", "Two additional options to resolving this bottleneck exist but appear to be long-run alternatives. First, increased use of ethanol in flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) at ethanol-to-gasoline blend ratios as high as 85% (referred to as E85) is a possibility. However, increased E85 use involves substantial infrastructure development, particularly in the number of designated storage tanks and E85 retail pumps, as well as a rapid expansion of the FFV fleet to absorb larger volumes of ethanol. Infrastructure expansion will require significant investments, especially at the retail level. Installation of a new E85 pump and underground tank can cost as much as $100,000 to $200,000. However, if existing equipment can be used with little modification, the cost could be less than $10,000.", "A second alternative is to expand use of processing technologies at the biofuel plant to produce biofuels in a \"drop-in\" form (e.g., butanol) that can be used by existing petroleum-based distribution and storage infrastructure and the current fleet of U.S. vehicles. However, more infrastructure-friendly biofuels generally require more processing than ethanol and are therefore more expensive to produce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vehicle Infrastructure Issues", "paragraphs": ["As was stated above, if a large portion of any increased RFS is met using ethanol, then the United States likely does not have the vehicles to consume the fuel. The 10% blend wall on ethanol in gasoline for conventional vehicles still poses a significant barrier to expanding ethanol consumption beyond 14 billion gallons per year. To allow more ethanol use, vehicles will need to be certified and warranted for higher-level ethanol blends, or the number of ethanol FFVs will need to increase. Turnover of the U.S. automobile fleet has slowed during the recession, making it more difficult to integrate FFVs into the fleet. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ethanol RINs and the Blend Wall", "paragraphs": ["In the face of a looming blend wall, the status of available RIN stocks of renewable and advanced biofuels for use by obligated parties towards mandate compliance remains an important issue. Current RIN stocks in mid-2013 are estimated at approximately 2.5 billion gallons, of which 2 billion gallons are D6 RINs which can only be used for compliance with the renewable portion of the RFS mandate. However, RIN stocks were expected to tighten substantially in 2014 as a large portion of existing RINs is used for current mandate compliance as well as a scheduled increase in the RFS mandates for all categories in 2014. As a result, the price of renewable fuel RINs increased dramatically in the first half of 2013. Spot prices for ethanol RINs averaged between $0.07 and $0.08 per gallon in the first weeks of January. However, in the first week of March 2013, ethanol RINs averaged roughly $0.76 per gallon\u2014a nine-fold increase. By July 2013, RIN prices have pushed past $1.00 per gallon. In the second half of the year RIN prices dropped steadily with the expectation that EPA might use its waiver authority to lower the 2014 mandates below the 2013 levels, as the agency ultimately proposed in November 2013."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["There is continuing interest in expanding the U.S. biofuels industry as a strategy for promoting energy security and achieving environmental goals. However, it is possible that increased biofuel production may place desired policy objectives in conflict with one another. There are limits to the amount of biofuels that can be produced from current feedstocks, particularly corn, and questions about the net energy and environmental benefits they might provide. Further, rapid expansion of biofuels production based on traditional field crops such as corn may have many unintended and undesirable consequences for agricultural commodity costs, fossil energy use, and environmental degradation. Owing to these concerns, alternative strategies for energy conservation and alternative energy production (including biofuels from nontraditional feedstock sources) are widely seen as warranting consideration."], "subsections": []}]}}
