In this context, the five purely federal reserve components are referred to collectively as the Reserves, while the dual federal/state reserve components are referred to collectively as the National Guard.", "The Reserves are of comparatively recent origin, having all been established in the 20 th century. They were organized under Congress's constitutional authority \"to raise and support Armies\" and \"to provide and maintain a Navy.\" The National Guard has a much longer historical pedigree. It is descended from the colonial-era militias that existed prior to the adoption of the Constitution. The Constitution does, however, contain provisions that recognize the existence of the militia and that give the federal government a certain amount of control over it.", "Unlike the Reserves, which are exclusively federal organizations, the National Guard is usually both a state and a federal organization. The National Guard of the United States is made up of 54 separate National Guard organizations: one for each state, and one for Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. While the District of Columbia National Guard is an exclusively federal organization and operates under federal control at all times, the other 53 National Guards operate as state or territorial organizations most of the time. In this capacity, each of these 53 organizations is identified by its state or territorial name (e.g., the California National Guard or the Puerto Rico National Guard), and is controlled by its respective governor. Due to their dual federal and state role, National Guardsmen can be called to duty in several different ways (see questions 9 and 11) and the mode of activation has important implications for the pay, benefits, and legal protections they receive (see questions 10 and 12).

How Has the Role of the Reserve Components Changed in Recent Years?", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, Charles Cragin, a former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, summed up the changing role of the reserve components in the following words: \"The role of our Reserve forces is changing in the United States. We have seen their traditional role, which was to serve as manpower replacements in the event of some cataclysmic crisis, utterly transformed. They are no longer serving as the force of last resort, but as vital contributors on a day-to-day basis around the world.\" His comments, well supported by historical data at the time he made them, became even more apt given the large reserve mobilization that has occurred since the September 11 th terrorist attack on the United States.", "During the Cold War era, the reserve components were a manpower pool that was rarely tapped. From 1945 to 1989, reservists were involuntarily activated for federal service four times, an average of less than once per decade. These activations occurred only during wartime and national emergencies: the Korean War (1950-1953; 857,877 reservists involuntarily activated), the Berlin Crisis (1961-1962; 148,034 reservists involuntarily activated), the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962; 14,200 reservists involuntarily activated), and the Vietnam War/USS Pueblo Crisis (1968-1969; 37,643 reservists involuntarily activated).", "The nation has relied more heavily on the reserve components since the end of the Cold War. Reservists have been involuntarily activated for federal service six times over the past 28 years, with the activation initiated shortly after the 9/11 attacks continuing to the present and likely constituting the largest reserve activation since World War II. Some of these activations have been directly related to war or armed conflict: for example, the Persian Gulf War (1990-1991; 238,729 reservists involuntarily activated), the low-intensity conflict with Iraq (1998-2003; 6,108 reservists involuntarily activated), and military operations in the aftermath of the September 11 th terrorist attacks (2001-present; 959,701 reservists involuntarily and voluntarily activated as of September 4, 2018). Other activations have been in support of missions that were primarily peacekeeping and nation-building, such as the intervention in Haiti (1994-1996; 6,250 reservists involuntarily activated) and the Bosnian peacekeeping mission (1995-2004; 31,553 reservists involuntarily activated). The ongoing Kosovo mission (1999-present; 11,485 reservists involuntarily activated through 2003; no available data since then) has been a combination of armed conflict and peacekeeping.", "It is important to point out that\u2014except for the activations in the aftermath of the September 11 th attacks\u2014this tally of activations refers only to instances where reservists were involuntarily ordered into active federal service. It does not encompass the many instances where reservists have served on active duty under voluntary orders or annual training orders or, for members of the National Guard, service under state authority (see \" 11. Are There Other Ways in Which Members of the National Guard Can Be Activated? \" for more information on state active duty and duty under Title 32 of the U.S. Code).", "Data from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (OASD/M&RA) shed more light on the growing contribution of reservists to federal missions. According to OASD/RA, reservists contributed about 1 million duty-days per year to their respective services between fiscal years 1986 and 1989. This contribution increased since then to the point where reservists contributed about 13 million duty-days per year between fiscal years 1996 and 2001. With the large mobilization of reservists in the aftermath of the September 11 th attacks, reservists contributed about 41.3 million days in FY2002, rising to a peak of 68.3 million days in FY2005. This metric dropped to 17.3 million days by FY2014, but it still represents a vastly higher level of activity than typically occurred in the Cold War era. The continuing mobilization of reservists to participate in these operations lends support to the idea that the Reserve Component has been transformed from a \"force of last resort\" in the Cold War era into a more integrated part of the military services in the post-Cold War era.", "For more information on the history of reserve activations, see CRS Report RL30637, Involuntary Reserve Activations For U.S. Military Operations Since World War II , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "7.

As a part of the military, the reserve components are generally covered under these provisions and thus are restricted in the same way that active component forces are. However, there are important exceptions to this general rule.", "First, Congress has made a number of exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act that permit military involvement in law enforcement. For example, Congress has enacted several statutes that authorize the President to use military forces to suppress insurrections and domestic violence. If these statutes were to be invoked, the President could use the reserve component in the same way as active component forces to put down a rebellion or to control domestic violence. Another important exception relates to the Coast Guard, which Congress has vested with broad law enforcement authority. Under these statutory provisions, the Coast Guard Reserve can participate, like its active counterpart, in the enforcement of maritime, customs, and certain other federal laws.", "Second, when acting in its capacity as the organized militia of a state, the National Guard is not part of the federal military and thus is not covered by the Posse Comitatus Act. Only when it is called into federal service does the National Guard become subject to the act. As such, the National Guard can be used by state authorities to enforce the law. For example, while acting in a state capacity, the National Guard has been used for riot control and counter-drug activities. Additionally, it was used to provide increased security at airports throughout the country in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks and to assist with security and disaster relief missions in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.", "For more information on the Posse Comitatus Act see CRS Report R42669, The Posse Comitatus Act and Related Matters: A Sketch , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "8.

For example, consider a reservist who has nine years of seniority with his or her civilian employer and leaves to perform two years of military service. Upon returning to work at the end of that two-year period, the reservist will be considered to have 11 years of seniority with the civilian employer and all concomitant rights and benefits.
