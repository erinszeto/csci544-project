The pros and cons of reviving OTA or re-creating a similar body have been examined. Since 2002, at congressional direction, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted several pilot technology assessments. Legislation was proposed during the 108th Congress to restore OTA's funding; to create an entity to conduct assessments for Congress; to conduct technology assessments in GAO; and to create a technology assessment capability in GAO or under its direction. In 2006, the House Science Committee held hearings on the issue of providing science and technology advice to Congress. Policy issues under discussion include the need for assessments, funding, the utility of GAO's technology assessment work, and options for design of an advisory body. This report will be updated as needed."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of Technology Assessment", "paragraphs": ["Congress established OTA in 1972 with passage of P.L. 92-484. It was mandated to assess the consequences of applying technology by preparing comprehensive reports that discussed the pros and cons of policy options about an issue. The law effectively augmented existing congressional resources by creating a support agency dedicated to providing Congress with objective and authoritative analysis of complex scientific and technical issues to aid in policymaking. It was intended to facilitate congressional access to expertise and permit legislators to consider objectively information presented by the executive branch, interest groups, and other stakeholders to controversial policy questions. From 1973 until 1995, OTA conducted technology assessments, requested by committee chairmen for themselves, ranking minority members, or a majority of the committee, by the Technology Assessment Board (a body which was composed of equal numbers of House and Senate members and of members from both parties), or by the OTA Director in consultation with the Board. OTA had authority to hire staff and to contract for personnel and studies. Peak funding in the early 1990s totaled over $20 million annually, with about 140 hired staff plus additional contractors. OTA was effectively eliminated when Congress did not appropriate funds for FY1996 for its continued operation and appropriated funds to close down the office. Its archived reports are available via the Internet at http://www.wws.princeton.edu/~ota/ .", "Several reasons were given for terminating OTA's funding and numerous studies have been written about the rise and fall of the agency. Critics of OTA cited such factors as difficulty in completing reports in time to meet congressional schedules, lack of utility to congressional decisionmaking, alleged bias toward \"liberal\" solutions, or partisan politics. Some say that Congress can turn to and fund studies by The National Academies, composed of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine, and the National Research Council (NRC), or utilize the services of GAO and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) for information and analysis on science and technology issues. Others disagree and cite the utility of OTA studies to decisionmaking and the need for Congress to maintain its own support agency devoted to assessing technology. Some former OTA staff members and science policy analysts have called for resumption of funding for OTA or creation of a legislative organization to perform OTA-like functions or to contract with outside groups to perform such functions. Some Members of Congress and others have said that if the OTA were still operating it might have provided Congress with information required to make important program and policy decisions relating to technological issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislation to Fund OTA", "paragraphs": ["In the 107 th Congress, Representative Rush Holt introduced H.R. 2148 , the OTA Re-establishment Act. It would have authorized funding OTA at $20 million annually for FY2002 to FY2007. No further action was taken. Similar legislation, H.R. 125 , was introduced in the 108 th Congress. It proposed to rename the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 as the Office of Technology Assessment Reestablishment Act of 2003 and to authorize OTA appropriations at $20 million annually for FY2004 to FY2009. The bill was referred to the House Science Committee. Representative Holt sought, in 2002, to introduce an amendment to H.R. 5121 , the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act FY2003, to provide $4 million to fund OTA for FY2003. He made a similar attempt in 2003 to amend the FY2004 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, H.R. 2657 , to fund OTA at $7 million.

OTA had focused on providing information about technology's impacts , notably \"early indications of the probable beneficial and adverse impacts of the applications of technology\" and other information. In contrast, the proposed Service would have developed information on \"the uses and applications of technology to address current national science and technology policy issues.\" It would have incorporated some features of OTA, including a bipartisan and bicameral congressional board to govern activities; a Director to carry out policies and manage activities; and a process to select studies using Committee chairmen, the Board, or the Director. But the Assessment Service would have used NRC to select experts to conduct assessments, a provision that was not in the OTA law; it would not have OTA's Deputy Director and Technology Assessment Advisory Council, the latter which was composed of private experts, the Comptroller General, and the CRS Director, to advise the Board on OTA operations and on assessment reports. It would have had authority to contract and use personnel, but would have had less specific authority than OTA to purchase and hold property, detail personnel from other agencies, or obtain information from them. It would not have had OTA's authority to seek assistance from CRS and the National Science Foundation, nor to distribute reports.", "Language to create an Assessment Service was included as Title XVI of S. 1766 , introduced in December 2001. S. 1766 was incorporated as substitute amendment (SA) 2917 to S. 517 , the Energy Security Policy bill. The language relating to the Assessment Service in S. 517 was identical to that in S. 1716 and S. 1766 .

Operating the center would be a director and deputy director empowered to act, with the permission of the Comptroller General, to hire staff and enter into contracts to perform assessments. The director would have been authorized to establish an advisory panel for each assessment; the panels would not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA; 5 U.S.C.App.). Different from the earlier OTA, any Member of Congress would have been able to make requests to the board for assessments. Requests would have had priority as follows: \"requests with bipartisan and bicameral support; requests with bipartisan support; requests from other members.\" Each assessment report would have been subject to rigorous external peer review before delivery to the director, who would have sought release approval from the board.

The enacted Legislative Branch Appropriations bill did not contain this language. The conference report did not specify an assessment topic, but three Senators requested GAO to assess technologies for U.S. border control together with a review of the technology assessment process. At the same time, six House Members wrote to GAO supporting the pilot technology assessment project. After consulting congressional staff, GAO agreed to assess biometric technologies. It used its regular audit processes and also its standing contract with The National Academies to convene two meetings which resulted in advice from 35 external experts on the use of biometric technologies and their implications on privacy and civil liberties.
