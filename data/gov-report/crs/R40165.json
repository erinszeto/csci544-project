Without insurance, individuals often have difficulty obtaining needed care and problems paying for the care they receive. Unemployed individuals and their family members who cannot postpone care may incur large bills that create or add to financial distress.

COBRA generally requires certain employers to provide employees and their families the right to continue participation in the employer's health plan in the case of certain events, including involuntary dismissal. To continue coverage, workers must pay both the employee's and the employer's share of the premium, plus a 2% administrative fee.

Some ACA provisions made immediate market reforms to increase consumer access to health insurance, particularly for young adults, individuals with preexisting conditions, and other, higher-risk groups. For example, one provision of the ACA generally allowed dependents up to age 26 to remain eligible for insurance coverage through their parents' plans, which could help the younger unemployed. Some other provisions of the ACA that increase access to coverage do not become effective until 2014, however. Those provisions include expansion of Medicaid to those with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and insurance premium credits and subsidies for individuals and families with MAGI below 400% FPL.", "Currently, certain individuals cannot benefit from the expanded access to coverage under the ACA because either the provisions do not apply to them or because applicable provisions have not yet taken effect.

Younger unemployed individuals may have less savings to draw from compared to their older counterparts.

Married women accounted for 14.9% of the unemployed, and single women with children comprised 10.0%. ", "Marital status has a direct impact on the probability that an unemployed individual will continue to be covered by health insurance, in some cases making it more likely that an unemployed individual maintains access, and in other cases making it more likely that the unemployed individual and his or her entire family will lose coverage. Individuals married to a spouse who has a job and insurance coverage may be able to enroll in their spouse's plan if they lose their coverage. On the other hand, workers who are married (or who are the head of a household) may be providing the main health insurance for their families. In 2010, about half of the nonelderly with employer-sponsored coverage received that coverage as a dependent (i.e., as a spouse, partner, or child of an individual with employer-sponsored coverage). A single parent who is the head of household and unemployed is also at risk of losing employer-sponsored coverage for the family.

Some research shows that age and health status are strongly correlated, indicating that because the unemployed are older, they may also be less healthy.", " Table 2 presents data by perceived health status by age (regardless of employment status). In all age groups, around 30.0% of the population reports very good health.

Eligibility, benefit amount, and duration of UC is determined by each state. Generally, UC benefits are based on wages for covered work during a 12-month period. Most state benefit formulas replace half of a claimant's average weekly wage up to a weekly maximum. The average regular UC benefit duration as of December 2011 was 17.5 weeks. Approximately 3.6 million individuals claimed regular state UC benefits in a given week in December 2011. Average weekly unemployment benefits were $291, translating to an average monthly benefit of $1,261.", "The availability of other forms of income for the unemployed is important in determining their ability to pay for health insurance coverage or health care services directly out-of-pocket. Unemployment compensation by itself could be insufficient to pay for these costs. For example, among the unemployed whose only option is to\u00a0purchase insurance in the individual market, the cost of coverage could be prohibitive. In 2010, the average monthly cost of premiums for coverage bought in the individual market was $301 for self-only coverage and $592 for family coverage. Assuming premiums did not increase in 2011 (which is unlikely), the average monthly cost of the premium for self-only coverage would consume 23.9% of the average monthly unemployment benefit, and the average monthly cost of the premium for family coverage would consume 46.9%.", "Data on the income distribution of those currently unemployed are not available. However, the most recent data from the Internal Revenue Service show the number of returns with UC by household income in 2009 (see Table 3 ). Individuals with household income of $15,000 up to $20,000 are the most likely to have UC, with 11.6% of all returns reporting UC. Examining the distribution of returns with UC by income, about 44% of those who received UC benefits had household income below $25,000, while nearly 30% had household income of $50,000 or more. ", "The ability of the unemployed to purchase insurance depends on income from other sources in addition to UC, current living expenses, and other factors, such as whether individuals in the household have preexisting conditions that could significantly increase the cost of coverage.

In addition, some employers find changes to COBRA administratively burdensome, and the extensions would add expenditures to an already strained federal budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extend Eligibility Period for Receiving COBRA Beyond 18 Months", "paragraphs": ["In addition to extending the COBRA premium subsidy, another possible option is to extend the COBRA eligibility period, which now is generally limited to 18 months. An extension could help individuals who need more time in a prolonged recession (or in its after effects) to find jobs that provide health insurance. As noted earlier, a limitation of unsubsidized COBRA for the unemployed has been that covered individuals usually have to pay 102% of the health plan's full premium. Because most employers subsidize health insurance premiums for their workers, the 102% COBRA premium may not be affordable for the unemployed, especially when compared with the average level of unemployment compensation. Employers might argue that extended coverage would be most attractive to individuals who have (or whose family members have) serious health problems. If this were the case, covering these individuals in the plan could raise costs for others in the plan. While extending COBRA would not increase federal expenditures, it would provide access to health insurance, but not necessarily financial relief from paying for the coverage, to individuals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Medicare Expansion", "paragraphs": ["As noted in the preceding discussion, individuals aged 55 and older are a growing segment of the unemployed population. Unemployed individuals in this age group often have more difficulty finding another job (or at least another job comparable to the one they lost), have fewer working years remaining to recover financially, and are at an increased risk of health problems. Some have proposed allowing older unemployed individuals to buy into Medicare early, that is, to join the Medicare program by paying premiums. Individuals are generally not eligible for Medicare until age 65.", "Many different design options need to be considered in this approach, including who would be eligible and the possibility of subsidies. One approach is not to provide subsidies, but instead to fully fund the program by charging premiums for individuals aged 62 to 64. Individuals who do not have employer-sponsored health insurance or Medicaid could voluntarily enroll in Medicare. Premiums would equal the average expected cost of the program plus an administrative fee of 5%. CBO estimated that the annual premium for single coverage would be $7,600 in 2011. CBO also estimated that this would indirectly increase mandatory spending for Social Security, as it may encourage some individuals to retire earlier than they otherwise would have.", "A Medicare buy-in is similar in some ways to expanding the eligibility period for COBRA beyond the 18-month window. Both would require enrollees to pay the full cost of the coverage. There are advantages, however, to the COBRA option versus the Medicare buy-in. First, the COBRA option would be available to all the unemployed who have access to employer-sponsored insurance through former employment, regardless of age. Second, for the older unemployed, the premiums would most likely be lower under the COBRA option because the pool of applicants would include a more diverse group in terms of age and the administrative cost (of 2%) is lower. The advantage of the Medicare buy-in proposal compared to the COBRA option is that the Medicare buy-in would cover older workers re-entering the labor force, whereas the COBRA option would apply only to those individuals who had left a job."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
