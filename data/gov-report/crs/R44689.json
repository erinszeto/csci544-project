The program is designed to help institutions in eligible states build infrastructure, research capabilities, and training and human resource capacities to enable them to compete more successfully for open federal R&D funding awards. Eligibility for NSF EPSCoR funding is limited to states (including some territories and the District of Columbia) that received 0.75% or less of total NSF research and related activities (RRA) funds over the most recent three-year period. EPSCoR awards are made through merit-based proposal reviews.", "EPSCoR funding and program reach have increased over the years. Congress first directed funding for the NSF EPSCoR program in FY1979 at a level of around $1 million. EPSCoR and EPSCoR-like programs are now active at five agencies and have a collective annual program budget of over $500 million. In addition to NSF, agencies with active programs include the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH, whose program is called the Institutional Development Award [IDeA] program). In FY2015, program budgets were $273 million at NIH, $166 million at NSF, $34 million at USDA, $18 million at NASA, and $10 million at DOE. While these programs vary in some operations and policies, their common focus is to help eligible states build R&D capacity and improve their ability to compete for federal R&D funding. The EPSCoR Interagency Coordinating Committee (EICC), chaired by NSF, was formed in 1992 to help integrate the activities of EPSCoR and EPSCoR-like programs across the agencies and to create a unified effort.", "While EPSCoR was originally proposed as a short-term effort for certain states, it has grown in size and scope, generating debate among stakeholders about program goals and policies. As the programs have evolved, a number of assessments have been conducted to evaluate EPSCoR's challenges and success, and to inform future directions. These assessments, and research literature, have repeatedly raised some broad issues. For instance, an overarching concern is finding an appropriate balance between supporting research development equitably across states while also supporting high-quality science through the merit review process. Common topics of discussion among stakeholders include the expansion and focus of EPSCoR goals, program coordination among federal agencies, criteria for state eligibility and graduation from the program, and metrics for assessing EPSCoR's success.", "Congress has a long-standing interest in the EPSCoR program. Some Members of Congress have questioned the fairness of the program, which is unique at NSF in its state-targeted approach. Additionally, some have expressed concern that the EPSCoR approach does not fit within the broader merit-based grant-making process at NSF. Others Members of Congress have supported the program, stating that it has been successful in contributing to research of national interest, helping to balance federal R&D funding among states, and providing broader research education opportunities to create a skilled workforce. In the 114th Congress, legislation and amendments were introduced both in opposition (e.g., prohibiting the use of any funding for EPSCoR programs) and in support of the program. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA, P.L. 114-329), enacted on January 6, 2017, renamed EPSCoR as an established\u2014rather than experimental\u2014program, revised various program components, and included language in support of continuing EPSCoR."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)\u2014originally named the E xperimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) \u2014is a set-aside funding program that began as an effort to avoid an \"undue concentration\" of federal research funds by providing competitive grant opportunities to states that historically received little federal research and development (R&D) funding.

To participate in the EPSCoR program, an eligible jurisdiction is required to form its own EPSCoR steering committee and to develop a science and technology (S&T) plan specific to the jurisdiction's needs and goals. Each steering committee is expected to undertake \"a recent comprehensive analysis of the strengths, barriers, and opportunities for further development of its institutions in support of overall objectives in research, education, and innovation.\" Through these activities, steering committees work closely with partners in academia, government, and the private sector to build statewide networks. ", "The funding awards structure for the NSF EPSCoR program has changed over time. In 1980, NSF awarded the first EPSCoR planning grants to seven states to support establishment of state steering committees, identify barriers to research competitiveness, and suggest possible remedies. Building from that work, five states subsequently developed successful research grant proposals and received five years of initial funding, primarily to support individual investigators. In the 1990s, award levels increased, and the grant focus changed to support for research clusters and statewide proposals for infrastructure development. In the 2000s, NSF's EPSCoR program was moved to the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA) and developed to include the three current investment components: Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards, co-funding, and outreach/workshops. ", "Research Infrastructure Improvement . In FY2016, the RII component included three tracks: ", "RII Track-1 awards provide up to $20 million total over a five-year period to support physical, human, and cyberinfrastructure improvements critical to a jurisdiction's science and technology (S&T) plan (e.g., acquisition of research equipment, establishment of university-private sector partnerships). RII Track-2 (Focused EPSCoR Collaborations [FEC]) awards provide up to $1.5 million per year for up to four years to support the establishment of interjurisdictional teams of investigators from at least two RII-eligible jurisdictions working collaboratively on NSF priority research topics. FY2016 awards supported EPSCoR proposals on two topics: (1) Understanding the Brain, and (2) Sustainable, Food, Energy, and Water Systems. RII Track-3 (Building Diverse Communities) awards provide up to $750,000 per award for an award period of up to five years, with projects serving as a \"testbed\" for building approaches to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. Track-3 proposals were first called for in FY2013 as a pilot program. Initial funding supported five proposals including projects to develop and implement chemistry coursework in tribal colleges and test cyber-learning methods for STEM education in rural middle schools.

These awards provide up to $300,000 over a two-year period for non-tenured investigators to \"further develop their individual research potential through extended collaborative visits to the nation's premier private, governmental, or academic research centers.\" According to the program solicitation, through activities such as accessing unique equipment and developing research collaborations, fellows are expected to improve their individual research competitiveness, and, in turn, to enhance the research capacity of their institutions and jurisdictions.", "Specific criteria and proposal requirements vary by track. For example, for RII Track-1 awards, cost-sharing is required and an eligible jurisdiction may only submit one proposal. For RII Track-2 and -3 awards, no cost-sharing requirement is listed in the program solicitation and limits on proposal submissions are less restrictive. EPSCoR proposal evaluations follow the merit-based, peer-review process used for the vast majority of NSF's competitive awards.", "A jurisdiction becomes eligible to participate in the EPSCoR program \"if their most recent 3-year funding level of NSF research support is equal to or less than 0.75% of the total NSF Research and Related Activities (RRA) budget.\" This criterion is commonly used when referring to a jurisdiction as EPSCoR-eligible.

The study notes that nearly all states reported positive changes in cultural attitudes, programs, and policies regarding science, engineering, and research. Recommendations . Broadly, the committee recommended that the federal government continue promoting the development of research capacity in all states, asserting that \"students in all parts of the country must have the chance to participate in high-quality research, and it is in the national interest that federal funding be provided to universities in every state to ensure that these research opportunities are available.\" To improve the focus and impact of the EPSCoR program, recommendations included an enhancement of research and STEM training capacity; more rigorous proposal and project evaluation processes, including effective third-party evaluation; a matching funds requirement for all research awards; and, working through the EICC, development of a new framework for eligibility and graduation.

One analyst contends that EPSCoR somewhat inadvertently \"evolved into a program that fosters science-based economic development, an extension of the best science paradigm on which NSF and EPSCoR were founded,\" during which time there was also \"a general national trend toward partnering academic research with economic development.\" A former state EPSCoR administrator asserted that EPSCoR has \"put [S&T] on the forefront in discussions of the role and importance of universities in states. Not only from the perspective of education and research, but particularly from the perspective of technology transfer and economic development.\" ", "In its RII Track-1 program solicitation, NSF has emphasized the importance of linking an EPSCoR jurisdiction's S&T plan with its economic development plan:", "[A jurisdiction's] S&T plan should be informed by the jurisdiction's Economic Development Plan (if applicable) and should describe innovation pathways for bringing outputs and outcomes of the proposed RII Track-1 research to the marketplace. ", "In addition, the 2015-2016 NSF EPSCoR Workshop Series on Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Translational Research led to a guide to help EPSCoR jurisdictions build such connections. ", "NIH's program has a focus on innovation and economic development, as well. In its FY2017 budget request, NIH stated its intention to initiate small business and technology transfer activities in IDeA states. NIH also expressed its intention to use funds from the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs to set up biotechnology incubators in each of the four IDeA regions. The Senate Committee on Appropriations has expressed support for such plans: \"The Committee supports the initiative to direct small business research funding to IDeA States to foster the development of products to advance public health.\" ", "This focus on innovation is part of a growth of the EPSCoR objectives, which include supporting research projects, developing statewide and regional networks, building infrastructure and human capacity, broadening diversity in STEM, and connecting research to technology transfer, state economic development, and national priorities. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reevaluating Eligibility Criteria", "paragraphs": ["The threshold for NSF EPSCoR eligibility has changed multiple times over the program's duration. Recently, the 2014 IDA/STPI assessment of NSF's EPSCoR program noted\u2014based on a literature review\u2014that \"a range of indicators ... could be used to identify jurisdictions with 'relatively little' Federal funding,\" but found \"no consensus that one or more of those indicators is the preferred way to select EPSCoR-eligible jurisdictions.\" In addition to the IDA/STPI report, the 2013 NAS assessment also suggested a number of EPSCoR eligibility factors for consideration, including per capita federal research funding; state commitment; proposal success rates of research university faculty; total research funding; progress to date; future opportunities for progress; and financial need. ", "Responding to the reports, NSF noted that it would \"consider models for eligibility and graduation, including the option of using median funding level\" and \"explore the use of specific indicators of 'undue concentration' in collaboration with other federal agencies ... and ensure that EPSCoR's program design, funding levels, and eligibility criteria reflect the indicators.\" The NSF's FY2017 budget request stated that this issue was being explored by the EICC: \"In FY2016, the [EICC] was tasked with examining the eligibility criteria across the five agencies with active programs ... and determining if there should be a common federal EPSCoR eligibility criterion.\" The EICC subsequently provided recommendations to NSF's Office of Integrative Activities (OIA); as of October 2016, the recommendations remained under review by NSF leadership. Developing a common federal eligibility criterion (or criteria) might help address concerns voiced by some Members of Congress that eligibility for EPSCoR funding at DOE is based on NSF research award expenditures rather than on DOE Office of Science award expenditures (as discussed in the \" Recent Congressional Activity \" section).", "NIH also reports that, since freezing eligibility in 2008, the agency has developed a new proposed criterion under which eligible states would include those for which the aggregate NIH funding received by entities in the state is at or below the median of all states. Such a criterion raises the question of whether or not state \"graduation\" from EPSCoR remains a goal. It is uncertain yet if EPSCoR agencies will develop common eligibility and graduation criteria. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Success", "paragraphs": ["Program assessments, peer-reviewed literature, and Members of Congress have all raised broad questions about how to determine EPSCoR's success. Among the types of questions raised: What metrics should be used to determine success (e.g., increases in agency-specific R&D funding, all federal R&D funding, grant proposal success rates, research collaborations)? At which level should these metrics be evaluated\u2014institution, state, region? How can federal agencies with active EPSCoR programs best coordinate data collection and evaluation of comprehensive program success in light of the differences in agency-specific missions? ", "Several academic studies have been conducted to assess EPSCoR's impact on university research, competitiveness in R&D awards funding, and economic development. A primary measure of program effectiveness has been increased shares of federal funding in EPSCoR states. Some research has shown that states become more competitive for federal science and engineering (S&E) funding the longer they stay in the EPSCoR program. This finding was based on faster growth of federal S&E obligations in EPSCoR states compared to non-EPSCoR states; however, the effect was small, suggesting a long and slow process of addressing changes in concentrations of research funding. A 2009 study concluded that, for some states, greater success in securing federal R&D funding may have led to reduced state contributions to academic institutions. Another evaluation found that the percentage of university-performed R&D funded by industry\u2014used in the study as a rough indicator of the intensity of university-industry research partnerships\u2014was comparable in EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR states between 1985 and 2000.", "In addition to funding, researchers have suggested that including a more nuanced evaluation of capacity building\u2014looking at both the \"hard infrastructure and the human-based infrastructure and resources\"\u2014is needed to fully understand capacity and competitiveness improvements in EPSCoR states. For example, one study showed that EPSCoR had a significant positive impact on publication quality at universities in participating states. A 2009 study noted that \"a social capital approach to the assessment of EPSCoR would address capacity building at the micro level, and be targeted to state characteristics\"; the study found that\u2014within EPSCoR states\u2014scientists who participated in program projects performed better in capacity-related characteristics (e.g., larger collaborative networks) than their colleagues who did not. Notably, this and other studies highlight a common challenge\u2014demonstrating that EPSCoR is not only associated with measures of success, but directly contributes to them. Nevertheless, some may caution against focusing too heavily on directly quantifiable outcomes, which might not adequately assess impacts from EPSCoR support. For example, research investments, particularly investments in basic research, may have impacts on future competitiveness that are difficult to measure or anticipate, such as advancing fundamental knowledge and spurring new and innovative research directions.", "Broadly, researchers and program assessors have recommended more thorough data collection procedures with standardization across programs to allow for improved comparisons in future EPSCoR evaluations. NSF EPSCoR has stated that it \"strongly agrees that detailed data, captured in a uniform fashion over time, is essential to assessing the outputs and outcomes of EPSCoR investments, and effective program management overall,\" highlighting recent efforts to standardize data reporting for RII awards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Congressional Activity", "paragraphs": ["On several occasions, the 114 th Congress addressed aspects of the EPSCoR program. ", "The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA, P.L. 114-329 ), enacted on January 6, 2017, revises program requirements and renames EPSCoR as the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, among other provisions. The act directs agencies with EPSCoR programs to consider modifications to award structures and evaluations, including an emphasis on harmonization of EPSCoR metrics across agencies, long-term investments, and support for innovative and experimental research and funding models. Further, the AICA requires the EICC to brief the appropriate committees of Congress on any such modifications one year after enactment.

The amendment failed on a floor vote of 195-232. During floor debate, some Members expressed concerns with the program, asserting that many EPSCoR states have small populations and receive more in federal spending than they pay in taxes; program monies are determined on a per state basis, rather than a per capita basis; and what was originally intended as temporary assistance funding to develop research infrastructure has grown into a permanent program. Opposition to the amendment asserted that EPSCoR has supported areas of strategic importance and helped to stabilize an imbalance in funding\u2014cited as 28 EPSCoR jurisdictions accounting for about 10% of NSF funding but 20% of the U.S. population\u2014and should continue to do so.

The amendment failed on a floor vote of 206-213. During House floor debate, many of the same objections to the program were raised as for H.Amdt. 317 with additional concerns that the program at DOE is based on NSF's EPSCoR program eligibility and research grant expenditures, rather than DOE research expenditures. Supporters of the amendment asserted that \"a rational program would ... collect all research funding in all areas and base the set-asides on that [and] would do it on a per capita basis.\" Opponents of the amendment stated a willingness to debate program details\u2014such as potential modifications to program formulas\u2014and emphasized that eliminating the program would be a mistake.", "The introduced version of the 2015 Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill ( S. 1695 ) would have revised eligibility criteria for the IDeA program, including allowing NSF EPSCoR-eligible entities to apply for inclusion in NIH INBRE awards. That program revision was not included in the FY2016 omnibus, but the accompanying explanatory statement included recognition of the IDeA program's success and requests to update and incorporate EPSCoR eligible states into IDeA program eligibility criteria.
