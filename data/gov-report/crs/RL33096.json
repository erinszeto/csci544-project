Hurricane Katrina dealt some familiar blows in emergency response. The failure ofcommunication systems, and subsequent difficulties in coordination, challenged response efforts inthis disaster as with others before it. Hurricane Katrina also pushed some response elements, suchas surge capacity in the healthcare workforce, to their limits. The response to Hurricane Katrina hasalso called attention to the matter of disaster planning in healthcare facilities, and the potential roleof health information technology in expediting the care of displaced persons.

Public health activities are thosethat identify, address or prevent health problems in populations. Examples include assuring thesafety of food and water, preventing the spread of disease in shelters, evaluating the safety ofneighborhoods for rehabitation, and assuring the health and safety of responders. Medical activitiesare those that deliver healthcare services to individuals. Examples include treatment of injuries,continuity of care for those with chronic illnesses, mental health counseling, and cause-of-deathinvestigation.", "The medical response to Hurricane Katrina may have posed the greater challenge. The publichealth response required the coordination of variety of agencies, community-based organizations,and private parties at different levels of government, though these entities had generally workedtogether in the past.

In preparing for Hurricane Rita, authorities in many communities on theTexas and Louisiana coast paid particular attention to identifying and helping those with specialhealth needs, providing public transportation to support the evacuation of nursing homes and thosereceiving other health services.", "Hurricane Katrina also exposed a number of problems that healthcare facilities experiencedas a result of the scope of the disaster. The failure of communications systems across the Gulf Coastmade it difficult for facilities to seek assistance, or for emergency responders to know that a facilitywas in need. In addition, since all facilities were simultaneously affected, the use of shared resources(\"double-counting\") led to problems. For example, single ambulance companies had contracted toevacuate multiple facilities. This arrangement, which would work well if facilities had been affectedin isolation, was untenable in a wide scale disaster.", "Following the hurricanes, experts have stressed the need for coordinated disaster planningin healthcare. They note that in addition to assuring that facilities are well prepared on their own,they must be integrated into community-wide emergency management activities. Further, identifyingvulnerable non-institutionalized populations and assuring their care before, during and after adisaster also requires a community-wide coordinated approach.", "Regulation of Institutions and Services. Healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals and nursing homes) are regulated by state and local authorities,with varying degrees of federal involvement. Regulations provide an opportunity for oversight oftwo critical disaster planning functions: evacuation and continuity of operations. (In this context,continuity of operations, the ability to sustain life-saving operations in the absence of power, waterand other external supplies, could also be considered sheltering in place. ) Given the nature of theirbusiness, hospitals are generally able to continue operations in the face of power outages, at leasttemporarily, because they employ generators to maintain critical life-support functions in anemergency. Furthermore, it is difficult to evacuate hospital or nursing home patients as their specialneeds may require special transport and host facilities. This may motivate better preparedness forcontinuity of operation as a more feasible option than evacuation. Healthcare facilities should beable to do both, though, as different types of disasters would require one or the other response. Hospitals in New Orleans that initially chose to continue operations ultimately had to evacuate.", "Evacuation policies and regulations for healthcare facilities have long focused on fire safety,for which the need to evacuate is evident, and for which drills are regularly conducted by local firesafety authorities. Evacuation planning for a predicted threat such as a hurricane may be morechallenging. The decision to evacuate or not may hinge on emergency management rather thanhealthcare expertise, and may be guided by local officials rather than facility managers. Forexample, the mandatory evacuation order issued by the city of New Orleans on August 28 excluded\"essential personnel of hospitals and their patients,\" but did not exempt other types of healthcarefacilities. (64) Inpreparing for Hurricane Charley in Florida in 2004, one county issued a countywide mandatoryevacuation order, while a neighboring county issued a mandatory order for nursing homes only. (65) ", "While healthcare facilities are licensed and regulated by state and local authorities, there isa role for federal oversight of their disaster preparedness and response capabilities through standardsdeveloped by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Joint Commissionon Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), as well as through conditions ofparticipation (CoPs) for Medicare and Medicaid. (66) Following Hurricane Katrina, a JCAHO witness testified thatthe commission certifies 85% of U.S. hospitals encompassing 96% of hospital beds. (67) JCAHO-certified hospitalsare deemed by federal law as meeting the conditions of participation for Medicare and Medicaidreimbursement.

The role of state and local authorities in assuring disaster preparedness forthese facilities and services appears to dominate.", "Community-based Disaster Planning. InCongressional testimony following Hurricane Katrina, a JCAHO witness stressed the need forhospitals to prepare for disasters within a community-wide structure, not in isolation. (70) The commission's 2005emergency management standards include a requirement that hospitals conduct a \"hazardvulnerability analysis\" to determine the types of hazards the facility is likely to face. There are alsoseveral standards requiring that hospitals have and test emergency backup systems for electricity andother utilities. Careful planning of this type could prevent planning errors such as the placement ofback-up generators in the basement of a flood-prone facility. In addition, hospitals are required tocoordinate various planning tasks with local emergency management authorities.", "Problems in delivering care to the chronically ill after hurricanes were described in reportsfollowing four hurricanes in Florida in 2004. (71) The emphasis of disaster planning for non-institutional servicesis based on assuring continuity of care during and after a disaster. Some communities havedeveloped programs to identify vulnerable individuals and assure continuity of care. The massivedislocation of the victims of Hurricane Katrina demonstrates how challenging this task can be.", "Following the terror attacks in 2001, Congress created a national program of grants to statesto improve the ability of communities to respond to emergencies that cause mass casualties.

Though grant guidance directs that a majority of funds be passed through to healthcare institutions,the program is not designed to assure preparedness for each facility or service in a state. It could bea means, however, for states to develop reliable communications systems between hospitals andemergency management authorities, or to address other aspects of coordination. There is limitedpublicly available information on how states have used hospital preparedness grant funds. ", "Promising Practices. Some states andcommunities with disaster experience have come up with approaches to address problems of disasterplanning in healthcare. (74) For example, Florida has a requirement (in statute andregulation) that home health agencies include in patients' records individual disaster plans (e.g., anindividual evacuation plan) that have been discussed with the patient and the patient'scaregivers. (75) Floridaalso established Special Needs Shelters for vulnerable persons during the 2004 hurricanes. The statefacilitated evacuation to the shelters of individuals who were pre-identified by county healthdepartments. This arrangement facilitated care of those whose needs were not so great that theyrequired hospitalization, but that nonetheless exceeded the expertise available in Red Cross and othercommunity shelters.
