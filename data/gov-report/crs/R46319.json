Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) is requesting almost $7 billion to support COVID-19 efforts by several U.N. entities. International financial institutions (IFIs), including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the regional development banks, are mobilizing their financial resources to support countries grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. The IMF has announced it is ready to tap its total lending capacity, about $1 trillion, to support governments responding to COVID-19.

Taiwan has tested widely for the virus, including mandatory tests for certain groups and tests for patients with respiratory illnesses that tested negative for the flu. Directives to conduct \"self-health management\" or self-quarantine have been enforced by harnessing cellphone location data and punishing violators with steep fines. The government's daily press conferences and frequent broadcasts of public service announcements have heightened public awareness and facilitated compliance with best practices. Taiwan also created informational apps, to help citizens track the spread of the virus and locate supplies of masks. In February and March, the government announced economic relief and stabilization measures, including approximately USD$2 billion to assist Taiwan industries affected by the outbreak, and payments totaling $465 to individuals who were quarantined or providing care for the quarantined. ", "Hong Kong. Initially, the government of Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China, resisted taking aggressive measures to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak. Public criticism of what many considered an insufficient and inconsistent initial response appears to have contributed to the government's subsequent decision to act. A newly formed union of doctors and nurses working for the Hong Kong Hospital Authority held a strike on February 3, 2020, demanding the HKSAR government close the city's border with mainland China, for example. The HKSAR government closed all but two of the land crossings with mainland China the next day. The government implemented a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all arrivals to Hong Kong on March 17, 2020, which remains in effect. The HKSAR government has also indefinitely closed Hong Kong's borders to all non-resident arrivals (except people from Mainland China, Macau and Taiwan who have not been to another country in the previous 14 days). The government has also developed an extensive range of public service announcements, web pages, and other modes of informing the public about COVID-19. ", "Although the HKSAR government may have hesitated, Hong Kong's public quickly adopted social distancing and anti-contamination behaviors developed during previous viral outbreaks. Similarly, medical professionals quickly implemented anti-viral protocols. ", "After 14 days without a confirmed local case of contagion and only a few \"imported cases,\" on May 5, 2020, the HKSAR government began to selectively relax its restrictions, reopening government offices and selective businesses while maintaining the requirement to wear masks in public and prohibiting gatherings of more than eight people. The same day, it also announced that it would provide every Hong Kong resident with a free reusable face mask that complies with the American Society for Testing & Materials F2100 Level 1 Standard in terms of particle and bacterial filtration efficiency. The HKSAR government, however, also noted that restrictions may be reinstated if there is an increase in local cases.", "Singapore. Singapore, a Southeast Asian city-state of 5.7 million people, has offered lessons perceived as both positive and cautionary in its handling of the pandemic. Singapore was one of the first nations outside China to report COVID-19 cases, with its first infection reported on January 23. Public health experts have praised Singapore's rapid early actions, including extensive monitoring of cases and their contacts, temperature checks at building entrances, and clear public messaging. Singapore health officials conducted detailed interviews of affected individuals, requiring those who had come into contact with them to quarantine themselves. The Health Ministry developed the capacity to test more than 2,000 individuals a day. Individuals who come within two meters of an infected individual or spend 30 minutes with one are required to undergo testing and to quarantine or be placed under observation. Individuals found to have misled health officials are subject to criminal penalties including fines and the threat of imprisonment. The Health Ministry issues daily updates on individual cases and the numbers of people under care or protective quarantine, including details of where each individual who has tested positive lives.", "Despite its early successes curbing the spread, Singapore has experienced a significant \"second wave\" of cases, leading authorities to close schools and most businesses, steps that they had avoided earlier. Many of the new cases have come from crowded quarters where migrant workers live, and the expansion has left Singapore with Southeast Asia's largest number of COVID-19 infections, as of May 11.", "South Korea. After cases were confirmed in South Korea in late January, authorities pursued an aggressive testing regimen and public communication strategy. South Korea describes its strategy as the three \"T\"s: tracking, testing, and treatment. By early May, the number of new cases per day had fallen to 6.4. As of early May, nearly 660,000 citizens had been tested for the virus \u00e2\u0080\u0094the highest rate of testing per capita in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094at over 600 sites, including pop-up facilities and drive-through sites. Results are generally provided within 24 hours. The case fatality ratio (1.64% as of March 30) has also been low, which health officials attribute to early detection and treatment, as well as universal health care. As of early May, South Korea has been able to stabilize the outbreak without lockdowns or wholesale travel bans, in part, experts argue, by being transparent and disseminating information about the virus' spread, including possible infections at the neighborhood level. President Moon Jae-in has stepped aside to allow national health officials to take the lead in delivering twice-daily messages to the public. After MERS killed 38 people in 2015, South Korea reformed its health policy by granting the government greater powers to monitor and track individual patients and to allow private companies to rapidly produce tests. Shortly after the COVID-19 outbreak hit, authorities were able to test 10,000 patients daily. Authorities can now test over 20,000 patients per day. ", "Australia . Observers believe that Australia's mitigation efforts (including self-isolation, movement restrictions, a two-week quarantine for those entering the country), the public's general adherence to rules, and widespread testing and tracing of contacts may be responsible for a relatively successful effort to contain the pandemic in Australia. Australia reportedly has one of the highest per capita testing rates in the world. In April 2020, the Australian government launched \"Covidsafe,\" an application that traces every person running it with other application users that have tested positive for COVID-19. Using Bluetooth, the app records others that have been within 1.5 meters for 15 minutes or more who also have the app. Within three days of its release, 3 million Australian had reportedly signed up for the app. ", "New Zealand . New Zealand confirmed its first case of coronavirus on February 28, 2020. The late date of the first outbreak, New Zealand's relative isolation, swift early response, and widespread testing all appear to have helped New Zealand to effectively deal with the virus. On March 14, with only six confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that all entering New Zealand would have to self-isolate for two weeks and that the existing travel ban for those coming from China and Iran would remain in place. From March 19, the New Zealand border has been closed to almost all travelers, with only New Zealand citizens, residents, and their immediate families allowed to enter the country. This was a significant move for the country, which has an estimated 4 million international visitors a year, and where tourism accounted for approximately 5.8% of GDP for the year ending March 2019. Since April 9, arrivals have been placed in \"managed isolation facilities,\" and those deemed to be high risk have been placed in quarantine facilities. ", "New Zealand has moved from lockdown to an easing of restrictions in a relatively short period of time. Prime Minister Ardern announced on March 23 that New Zealand would enter a level 4 lockdown on March 25, when it had less than 150 cases. New Zealand then moved to alert level 3 on April 27. It subsequently moved to alert level 2 on May 13, under which most businesses will be open, tertiary education will open, travel between regions of the country, and gatherings up to 10 people will be allowed. Border controls and physical distancing requirements will remain, wide scale testing will continue, and those unwell or who have been in contact with the sick will be isolated.

Almost all European countries closed schools and some types of businesses and have restricted public gatherings to varying degrees. Numerous European governments mobilized their military forces to assist response efforts, including constructing makeshift hospitals. In some countries, government authorities scaled back public transportation and introduced curfews. In mid-April, some European countries began announcing plans for a gradual reopening of their societies and economies in the coming months, but the pace of reopening measures vary across Europe, and leaders caution that such measures would be contingent on a clear reduction in infection rates. European governments have generally stressed the importance of a staged approach to reopening, allowing for regional differences depending on regional infection rates and hospital and testing capacity. They also have sought to implement widespread testing and contact tracing capacity. Economic stimulus . Many analysts predict that the COVID-19 pandemic could cause a financial crisis in Europe that might be several times worse than the 2008 global recession. European governments and the EU have announced an array of measures to mitigate a severe economic downturn. Measures include loan programs and credit guarantees for companies, income subsidies for affected workers, tax deferrals, and debt repayment deferments. On May 14, the Italian government announced a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac55 billion (about $60 billion) stimulus plan. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to provide unlimited budgetary support to companies and workers, which the government says could cost upward of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac45 billion ($48 billion).

Socioeconomic challenges also hinder prevention measures centering on hygiene (e.g., handwashing) and social distancing. Many Africans lack access to clean water or sanitation facilities, and live in high-density areas (e.g., informal urban settlements or displaced person camps).

Both tourism and exports have declined sharply due to COVID-19-linked interruptions and declines in world economic activity, trade, and travel. In food import-dependent countries, food insecurity may also increase, due to these factors as well as lock-down linked restrictions. Remittances from abroad also have dropped. Africa's heavy reliance on imports of consumer and industrial goods from China may also suffer, alongside business sectors tied to these imports (e.g., digital technology and local retail sectors). Exports of mined and energy commodities, which comprise roughly 75% of African exports by value, may be particularly hard-hit. Africa's oil export-dependent countries may face a double threat: a global oil price collapse initially driven by a now-ended price war among selected producers and an ongoing collapse in global oil demand.

", "The patchwork of response efforts across 33 countries, including a cautious lifting of control measures in some countries in May 2020, has relied on incomplete data to guide policy since most countries have not conducted widespread testing. In Mexico, Brazil, and Nicaragua, where presidents have downplayed the threat of the pandemic, many analysts suggest the actual level of infection is essentially unknown, with some independent estimates suggesting it is a magnitude higher than what health authorities have reported. The information available suggests some countries are suffering severe outbreaks, while others, such as Paraguay, appear to have relatively few cases. ", "According to several observers, the region's vulnerability is heightened by diminished health spending and low government capacity, following several years of economic stagnation. Venezuela is of particular concern since protracted political and economic crises had already weakened its health system. An estimated 4.8 million Venezuelans have fled the country, and new immigration controls by neighboring countries are unlikely to stop Venezuelans from crossing the region's porous borders.", "As the most urbanized region in the world, Latin American and the Caribbean nations face challenges enforcing social distancing by quarantine and curfew. In some cities, such as Guayaquil, Ecuador, outbreaks have already overwhelmed medical systems. In rural areas, and urban slums, there is limited access to clean water and sewage treatment and minimal health infrastructure. Indigenous communities, Afro-descendants, migrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons often face formidable barriers to health care. Quarantine restrictions in some cases have created a dangerous rise in hunger and desperation since a large proportion of the population depends on daily earnings, often through informal employment, to make ends meet. ", "Many governments have taken extraordinary measures to respond to the pandemic. Some have been accused of abuses of power and violations of human rights for arresting and imprisoning quarantine violators, harshly treating prison uprisings and jailed gang members (notably in El Salvador), and delaying elections. Many governments also have begun to implement far-reaching economic support measures, although their fiscal capacities to support businesses and bolster social safety nets varies considerably. The IMF estimates the region's economic growth will contract this year by 5.2%.

COVID-19 containment measures significantly slowed economic activity in China, and halted production almost entirely in some areas of the country, particularly Hubei province. In early February, China's central bank pumped $57 billion into the banking system, capped banks' interest rates on loans for major firms, and extended deadlines for banks to curb shadow lending. China's central bank is seeking to stabilize China's currency and shore up liquidity in China's banking system, which remains the primary channel through which the government is providing business relief. Despite these measures, China experienced a 6.8% contraction in GDP growth in the first quarter of 2020, the first GDP contraction recorded in China since China's National Bureau of Statistics began releasing quarterly GDP figures in 1992. ", "Many firms in China are still struggling to return to full capacity as some restrictions on travel and distribution of goods and workers remain and additional reported pockets of outbreaks continue in different parts of China. In addition, COVID-19's global spread has led to a sharp global economic downturn and reduced global demand for Chinese exports. China's recovery is also constrained by a contraction in global transportation and logistics and tourism and services trade.", "The economic impact of COVID-19 has also raised questions about the capacity of the United States and China to implement the Phase One Trade Agreement signed in January 2020, which commits China to purchasing $200 billion in additional exports over the next two years. Recent analysis of both U.S. and Chinese first quarter trade data indicates that China is not on track to meet its purchase commitments\u00e2\u0080\u0094according to U.S. trade data, China's imports of agricultural products, a major component of the purchase agreements, grew by a modest 3.2%, while China's imports of U.S. manufactured goods and energy shrank. Reports in China's state media have suggested that some elements of China's leadership might be considering invalidating and renegotiating the phase one agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How is COVID-19 affecting the global economy and financial markets?", "paragraphs": ["A growing list of economic indicators makes it clear that the viral outbreak is negatively affecting global economic growth on a scale that has not been experienced since at least the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Global trade and GDP are forecast to decline sharply through at least the first half of 2020. The global pandemic is affecting a broad swath of international economic and trade activities, from services generally to tourism and medical supplies, global value chains, financial markets, and a range of social activities, to name a few. The health and economic crises could have a particularly negative impact on developing economies that are constrained by limited financial resources and where health systems could quickly become overloaded. ", "The economic situation remains highly fluid. Labeling the projected decline in global economic activity as the Great Lockdown, the IMF forecasted on April 14, 2020 that the global economy could decline by 3.0% in 2020, before growing by 5.8% in 2021, constituting the \"worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago.\" Estimates by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicate the virus could trim global economic growth by as much as 2.0% per month if current conditions persist, or 24% on an annual basis. Global trade could also fall by 13% to 32%, depending on the depth and extent of the global economic downturn. Increasing rates of unemployment are raising the prospects of wide-spread social unrest and demonstrations in developed economies where lost incomes and health insurance are threatening living standards and in developing economies where populations reportedly are growing concerned over access to basic necessities and the prospects of rising levels of poverty.", "Over the seven-week period from mid-March to early May 2020, more than 33 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance. On May 8, 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April 2020, pushing the total number of unemployed Americans to 23 million and raising the unemployment rate to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The report indicated that all major industry sectors experienced job losses, with the heaviest losses in the leisure and hospitality industries. Preliminary data indicate that U.S. GDP in the first quarter 2020 fell by 4.8% at an annual rate, the largest quarterly decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008 during the global financial crisis. The U.S. economy is projected to contract by 5.9%, about twice the rate of decline experienced in 2009 during the financial crisis. The forecast assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and that the containment measures can be reversed. ", "The IMF also argues that recovery of the global economy could be weaker than projected as a result of lingering uncertainty about possible contagion, lack of investor and consumer confidence, and permanent closure of businesses and shifts in the behavior of firms and households. Global trade, measured by trade volumes, slowed in the last quarter of 2019 and was expected to decline further in 2020, as a result of weaker global economic activity associated with the pandemic. ", "Uncertainty about the length and depth of pandemic-related economic effects and the effectiveness of pandemic control measures are shaping perceptions of risk and volatility in financial markets and corporations. Financial markets worldwide, particularly in the United States, Asia, and Europe, are volatile as investors are concerned that the virus is creating a global crisis that could be prolonged and expansive. Similar to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, central banks are rapidly becoming the lender of last resort and are attempting to address financial market volatility. Developments continue to evolve rapidly and the market dynamics have led some observers to question if these events mark the beginning of a full-scale global financial crisis.", "Financial market dislocation can potentially increase liquidity constraints and credit market tightening, as firms hoard cash, with negative effects on economic growth. In some financial markets, fund managers have started selling government securities to increase their cash reserves, pushing down government bond prices. Financial markets are also responding to increased government bond issuances in the United States and Europe to fund COVID-19-related spending, further increasing government debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How is COVID-19 affecting U.S. medical supply chains? 287", "paragraphs": ["COVID-19 has revealed U.S. and global supply chain vulnerabilities across a range of sectors, particularly PPE, which relies directly on China-based manufacturing. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, China accounted for 8% of global manufacturing exports; in 2018, China was the source of approximately 19% of global manufacturing exports, including intermediate goods vital to global manufacturing supply chains. ", "An area of particular concern to Congress in the current environment is U.S. shortages of medical supplies\u00e2\u0080\u0094including personal protective equipment (PPE) and pharmaceuticals\u00e2\u0080\u0094as the United States steps up efforts to contain COVID-19 with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient U.S. industrial capacity. Because of China's role as a global supplier of PPE, medical devices, antibiotics, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), reduced exports from China have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the United States. According to China Customs data, in 2019 China exported $9.8 billion in medical supplies and $7.4 billion in organic chemicals\u00e2\u0080\u0094a figure that includes active pharmaceutical ingredients and antibiotics\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the United States. While there are no internationally agreed guidelines and standards for classifying these products, U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and products, and related supplies are estimated to have been approximately $20.7 billion (or 9.2% of U.S. imports), according to CRS calculations using official U.S. data. ", "In early February 2020, the Chinese government nationalized control of the production and distribution of medical supplies in China, directing all production for domestic use. The Chinese government also directed the national bureaucracy, local governments, and Chinese industry to secure supplies from the global market. This effort likely exacerbated medical supply shortages in the United States and other countries, particularly in the absence of domestic emergency measures that might have locked in domestic contracts, facilitated an earlier start to alternative points of production, and restricted exports of key medical supplies. In addition to formal and informal PPE export restrictions that China reportedly has placed on domestic producers of PPE, several prominent U.S. companies with PPE production capacity located in China, including 3M, have indicated they do not have PRC government authorization to export. As China's manufacturing sector recovers while the United States and other countries are grappling with COVID-19, the Chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery. Those decisions are likely to be driven, at least in part, by political calculations, as has been the case with many countries around the world.

Although the United States has long-supported the delivery of PPE through its international pandemic preparedness programs, this practice has come into question while the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths climb in the United States. As of April 15, 2020, the United States had the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide, accounting for roughly 30% of all COVID-19 cases globally. In March, some Members of Congress began questioning the delivery of PPE by USAID to foreign countries while some governors and mayors reported shortages of the commodities. ", "The United States provides annual funding for foreign assistance, approximately $20 billion of which is administered by USAID each year. USAID programs operate in more than 120 countries worldwide and are intended to meet specific development objectives. In many of these countries, widespread poverty, weak public institutions, and diverse pre-existing governance challenges are likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic. To preserve these investments and past policy progress, protect U.S. foreign policy interests in the region, save lives, and help combat the negative socioeconomic effects of the pandemic in the region, Congress may seek to address additional help aid recipients might request to control the pandemic and its effects. ", "Congress might also consider how the pandemic may affect partner governments' absorption capacities, and the manner and degree to which U.S. assistance may complement or coincide with nationally-determined pandemic responses. Congress may also wish to consider how responding to the challenges created by the pandemic may reshape pre-existing U.S. aid priorities\u00e2\u0080\u0094and how it may affect the ability of U.S. personnel to implement and oversee programs in the field. Relatedly, Congress may wish to ensure that U.S. responses are robustly coordinated with those of other donor governments and multilateral functional agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to ensure that such efforts are transparent and cost-effective, and that donor assistance is complementary and non-duplicative.", "The pandemic is also having other effects on foreign affairs that Congress might consider. Some have questioned, for example, how U.S. immigration policy might impact COVID-pandemic control efforts. Some Members of Congress and officials representing Latin American and Caribbean governments have expressed concern that COVID-19-related screening procedures for deportations are not sufficient to prevent the importation of COVID-19 cases from the United States and have asked the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to suspend deportations. A number of people deported from the United States to Latin America have reportedly tested positive with COVID-19 or have reportedly been exposed to someone with COVID-19. Other Members of Congress continue to support the Administration's border policies, which the Administration maintains are conducted in a manner that accounts for the dangers of COVID-19.", "Congress continues to debate the extent to which the United States should contribute to multilateral organizations for COVID-19 control. Some Members, for example, are arguing for withholding contributions to the WHO, while others are urging the Administration to pay outstanding assessments to the organization and support ongoing WHO COVID-19 efforts.
