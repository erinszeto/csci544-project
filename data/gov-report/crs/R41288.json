The total is made of $2.508 billion in direct appropriations (which FDA calls budget authority) and $1.523 billion in user fees. Overall, the request is 22.8% more than the enacted FY2010 total appropriation, with budget authority up 6.2% and fees up 65.2%. Most of the increase would come from proposed new user fees to support generic drug activities, food export certification, reinspection, and food inspection and facility registration. For continuing user fee programs (prescription drug, medical device, animal drug, animal generic drug, tobacco product, mammography quality standards, export certification, and color certification), the $1.233 billion request is 33.7% above FY2010.", "Budget justification documents describe FY2011 agency initiatives in food safety, medical product safety, and regulatory science.

The total amount that FDA can spend, its program level, consists of direct appropriations (which FDA calls budget authority) and other funds, most of them user fees. An appropriations bill specifies both the budget authority and user fee amounts each year. It dictates the total for each of FDA's major program areas (foods, human drugs, biologics, devices and radiological health, animal drugs and feeds, tobacco products, and toxicological research) and several agency-wide support areas (Office of the Commissioner and other headquarter offices, rents to the General Services Administration, and other rent and rent-related activities). Traditionally, the appropriations committees have used report language to recommend, urge, or request specific activities within major programs.", "The standard appropriations procedure involves congressional passage of 12 annual regular appropriations acts, of which agriculture (including FDA) is one. For 7 of the previous 11 fiscal years, Congress had not completed that standard process and had passed omnibus or consolidated appropriations legislation, as shown in Table 1 . Recent examples include FY2009, when Congress acted in the final days of FY2008 to provide appropriations for the start of FY2009 as part of the larger Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 110-329 , signed on September 30, 2008), and passed an omnibus FY2009 appropriations bill that included FDA ( P.L. 111-8 ) in March 2009. The FY2010 agriculture appropriations ( P.L. 111-80 ) followed the standard process except that final passage occurred after the start of the fiscal year.

This would include launching an electronic drug registration and listing system to stop illegal drug imports and expanding foreign inspections. The third initiative, Advancing Regulatory Science for Public Health , involves FDA plans to build its scientific infrastructure, develop standards for new and emerging technologies, modernize the standards for evaluating products, and accelerate the development of essential medical therapies.", "Programs . The program-specific narratives highlight elements of these initiatives along with other activities. For the Food program, these include more closely integrating with state and local governments; working with public health organizations in foreign countries to shift burden of assuring imported food safety from the FDA to the foreign production/processing environment; developing tools to identify, evaluate, prioritize, and communicate risks; enhancing the reportable food registry and the consumer complaint reporting system; participating in the nanotechnology initiative; and hiring additional laboratory staff.", "For the Human Drugs program, the budget justification narrative includes expanding involvement with the science of nanotechnology and developing new biomarkers; implementing a quantitative risk-based program to target clinical site inspections; increasing inspections; improving human subject protection; completing and validating a new electronic drug registration and listing system, allowing information about specific drug products, specific ingredients, and specific facilities around the world; working with other countries' regulatory authorities; targeting high risk manufacturing facilities for inspections; continuing implementation of the National Sentinel System Network, a public-private collaboration; and staffing the Safe Use Initiative.", "Biologics program activities in FY2011 would include increasing outreach to improve industry practices and performance; building capacity to reduce the risk of disease transmission caused by infected tissues; evaluating the use of nanoparticles in analytic tests; developing analytic tests with stem cells to facilitate clinical translation of therapies; hiring and training investigators to conduct complex medical product inspections; and developing biological markers and other approaches to evaluate the safety of vaccines and vaccine components.", "For the Animal Drugs and Feeds program, the budget justification describes hiring and training scientific staff to build expertise to regulate new animal biotechnology products; expanding the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, which would allow FDA to make more informed science based decisions; establishing an Integrated National Food Safety System with Strengthened Inspection and Response Capacity; and coordinating and increasing surveillance of state activities and data-sharing.", "The FDA-listed activities for the Devices and Radiological Health program include participating in the development and implementation of a national strategy for the best public health use of health-related electronic data; systematically integrating all available internal and external data involving the pediatric population; broadening targeted surveillance; building infrastructure to analyze pediatric postmarket device information; increasing oversight of foreign manufacturing facilities; developing standards for safe and effective CT scanners and fluoroscopes; and recruiting scientists in fields such as biostatistics, epidemiology, modeling, and risk sciences.", "FY2011 will be the second year of the Tobacco Products program at FDA.
