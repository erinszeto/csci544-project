Capital gains earned in retirement and pension plans are also effectively exempt from income tax. Other types of earnings from capital (such as interest and business investments) are also taxed on nominal income, but those effects are also offset by other tax benefits.", "The effects of capital gains indexing depend on a variety of features: the choice of the price index, assets covered (by type and holding period), whether indexing generates or increases losses, whether indexing applies to past as well as future inflation, and whether indexing is in addition to or a substitute for current tax benefits.", "Past legislative proposals to index capital gains for inflation have never been enacted, although in some cases proposals led to alternatives such as exclusions or lower rates. In 1992, a proposal advanced to index capital gains for inflation by regulation was eventually rejected based on findings that the Department of the Treasury does not have the authority to index capital gains.", "Compared with an exclusion or lower rate, indexing favors short-term assets relative to long-term ones. Indexing provides the smallest exclusion equivalents to growth stocks that pay little or no dividends and the largest equivalents to gains from land, commercial buildings, and to a lesser extent residential buildings and stocks that pay substantial dividends. Some of these patterns may not be consistent with policy objectives that may favor lower rates on stocks and assets held for a long period. Compared to an exclusion, inflation indexing would favor risky assets.", "The analysis of various economic issues depends on whether indexing is in addition to or a substitute for current benefits. Questions arise as to whether interest, depreciation, and inventories should also be indexed.", "As an additional provision, depending on the design, estimates suggest a range of $10 billion to $30 billion per year in revenue costs. Economic growth effects would be relatively small, with even the largest revenue estimate pointing to a decrease in the cost of capital of 6 to 7 basis points (lower required returns of 0.06% to 0.07%). Evidence also suggests that the savings effect would be small and likely to be offset by crowding out of private investment by government borrowing if debt-financed. The change would favor high-income individuals, with about 60% benefiting the top 0.1% and around 90% benefiting the top 1% in the income distribution.", "Favorable treatment for capital gains on stocks has been advanced due to the double taxation of dividends, but the 2017 tax changes have made that justification less persuasive. Capital gains indexing would reduce the distortion between debt and equity but increase the favoritism of retaining earnings over paying dividends. It would reduce the lock-in effect that causes individuals to retain current assets because of the tax, although not as much as an exclusion equivalent. Administrative and compliance costs would increase because each vintage of assets would require a different exclusion, but improved computing facilities make that issue less burdensome."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["P roposals to index capital gains for inflation have recently reentered the public debate.

Second, assets that are held until death do not pay capital gains tax on the appreciation during the decedent's lifetime (and longer if, in turn, the decedent inherited appreciated assets). Assets received from inheritances are stepped-up, and the basis in the hands of the heir is the value at the time of death. (Thus, if the asset were immediately sold, there would be no capital gain.)

Allowing net short-term losses to offset net short-term gains dollar for dollar confers an advantage because short-term gains are taxed at ordinary rates and long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate.

In addition, some income from lending through bank accounts is never taxed because it is received as imputed income in the form of the value of banking services. Under tax law prior to the 2017 tax revision ( P.L. 115-97 ), the effect was also due to higher tax rates of the corporations and businesses borrowing funds compared to the rates of the lenders.

The consumer price index is based on a basket of consumer goods that is fixed in the CPI-U and varies in the chained CPI-U to reflect changes in consumption as relative prices change. Inflation rates as measured by the chained CPI-U are generally smaller than those measured by the standard CPI-U. The GDP deflator reflects all domestically produced goods and services with the weights changing as the mix of goods changes. From 2008 to 2017, the CPI-U increased by 15%, the chained CPI-U by 12.9%, and the GDP deflator by 14.3%.

An indexing proposal applying to assets held for a year was passed by the House during consideration of the Revenue Act of 1978, but the final bill instead increased the exclusion of gain from 50% to 60%.

That proposal would have broadly indexed the return to investment including depreciation, inventories, and interest. The proposal as it emerged from the White House (sometimes referred to as Treasury II) gave individuals an option of a 50% exclusion or, after 1991, indexing for inflation. It dropped the other indexing proposals except for inventories. The 1986 act did not contain indexing and taxed capital gains at ordinary rates (no exclusion).", "In 1989, President George H. W.

The House adopted a proposal for indexation for inflation for newly acquired assets. The Senate passed a separate set of graduated rates on capital gains that tended to benefit more moderate-income individuals. The latter provision was included in a bill ( H.R. 4210 ) containing many other tax provisions that was vetoed by the President.", "In 1994, the Republican \"Contract With America\" campaign proposed a 50% exclusion for capital gains, and indexing the basis for all subsequent inflation, while eliminating the 28% cap; this exclusion would be about a 40% reduction on average from current rates.

For stock paying dividends, the benefits of deferral are smaller (because dividends are taxed currently), but eventually (at around 10 years) deferral of the remaining gain leads to lower effective tax rates. The last three assets have no real gain, with capital gains tax applying only to prior depreciation and inflation. For the commercial building (representing nonresidential buildings in general), the economic depreciation rate is higher than inflation, so this asset declines in nominal value whereas the residential building and land increase in nominal value. Residential buildings have a favorable treatment compared with commercial buildings and land because of their faster depreciation (compare tax rates after 30 years to the 29.6% tax rate on rents), but they are also more affected by selling earlier, because the capital gains tax is applied to a larger depreciation amount."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exclusion Equivalents by Asset Type and Holding Period", "paragraphs": [" Table 2 shows how much of the nominal gain is excluded due to indexing for each of the five assets using the same assumptions as in Table 1 about rates of return and tax rates.", "Although the absolute amount of gain due to inflation is larger over time, the share of gain that reflects inflation declines over time as well as varying by asset (with the exception of land, in which all of the gain is due to inflation). For example, if instead of lower rates, gains were taxed at ordinary rates (37%) and indexed, the result is equivalent, for corporate stock with no dividend, to applying a lower rate of 29% for an asset held for a year, 31.4% for an asset held for 10 years, and 34.8% for an asset held for 30 years. These are smaller than the effective exclusion from allowing a 20% rate rather than a 37% rate, which is equivalent to a 46% exclusion.

For example, the corporate stock with no dividends has the largest real appreciation rate and thus the smallest share reflecting inflation except for residential structures held for 25 and 30 years. If part of the return is paid in dividends, the real capital gain becomes smaller and thus inflation more important as part of the nominal gain. Land with no real appreciation has all of its gain reflecting inflation. For a commercial building, tax depreciation slightly exceeds economic depreciation only in the first year so that most of the nominal gain is due to inflation. The excess of tax depreciation over economic depreciation rises each year so that more of the gain over time reflects depreciation, with a smaller share due to inflation.

The proposed legislation also limits the benefits to assets held for at least three years. Some justifications for favoring assets held over a longer period of time are to reduce the lock-in effect (the incentive to retain investments to avoid the capital gains tax), because capital gain grows as a share of the sales price over time.

As a result, the argument that it is fair to index gains because part of the income is unreal may be considered less compelling in the light of current benefits. Alternatively, indexing could be substituted in a revenue-neutral way for existing rates, which would then be increased.

For that matter, indexing capital gains by regulation to measure the true cost as deemed determined by the tax code would imply indexing a broad range of capital assets, including indexing of the basis for interest deductions and payments, depreciation, and inventory. In addition, if dividends are paid in excess of real earnings, an adjustment to the portion taxed as dividends versus being treated as a return of capital might be considered.", "As mentioned, most of these assets have other benefits in the tax code that offset the effects of inflation, and a broader inflation adjustment approach might consider cutting back on some of those benefits (such as accelerated depreciation). (Note, however, that as long as expensing is retained for equipment and research investments, there is no basis to index.) A particular concern is that, absent other changes, tax sheltering may be available by borrowing while deducting nominal interest to invest in capital gains with indexing. This arbitrage possibility already exists due to the benefits currently available to capital gains, but it would be increased if indexing were an addition to rather than a substitute for the current lower rates.

One estimate indicated that in 2012, the last year for which data on the distribution of gains by holding period were available, the revenue loss was a third of capital gains revenue. In that year, capital gains revenue was $82.8 billion, so the revenue loss was around $27 billion. The revenue loss would be smaller if losses could not expand or be converted into losses rather than gains, and taxpayers might sell more assets, although there would be more sheltering opportunities. Under these circumstances, the estimated losses were projected at between $10 billion and $20 billion, 12% to 24% of the total revenue.", "A second source, using the CPI-U, estimated conservatively a revenue loss of $102 billion over 10 years, which (given some growth) would indicate less than $10 billion per year. Another estimate found failure to index resulted in $34 billion in additional taxes (a quarter of the $134 billion collected in FY2017) was from inflation.", "Because capital gains fluctuate much more than inflation, the share of gain eliminated due to inflation indexing will vary over time, so that the upper limit of the estimates is consistent between the first and third sources at around $30 billion. The loss due to an indexation proposal would, however, depend on the coverage of assets (both by type and longevity) and whether the indexation could be used to produce or expand losses. ", "The revenue loss might also be reduced (as noted in the first estimate) to the extent that lower rates cause more sales (i.e., reduce the lock-in effect, which is the payment of tax to sell an asset and acquire another). Estimates of the amount of revenue loss offset by increased sales based on statistical studies range widely, from 20% to 70%. Many of these statistical studies, however, appear to find responses that are larger than would be feasible given the ratio of realizations and may be more consistent with a lower end, or a 20% offset. It is also unclear whether indexing would yield as large an effect on sales as an exclusion or lower rate with the same revenue consequence. The lock-in effect is largest for assets that have been held for a longer period of time and thus have accumulated gains, and for assets in which gains are larger relative to sales price (such as stocks with no dividends). These assets, however, are the ones that receive the smallest exclusions and thus may lead to a more modest lock-in reduction.", "Revenue losses would be smaller in the short and medium term if indexing were confined to future inflation or a more restrictive approach of applying it to newly acquired assets (the latter was proposed in the past). Such a change would lead to an initially small but rapidly growing revenue loss. Allowing gains only for future inflation would do less to reduce the lock-in effect.

Two methods are used for projecting the effects of indexation. The first uses a rule of thumb that capital income is approximately 25% of net national product. Using this approach, the revenue loss amounts to 0.8% of total income from capital, and, assuming a real rate of return of 7%, an increase in the cost of capital (net of depreciation) of 0.06%, or about 6 basis points. The second approach divides the revenue estimate by the estimated capital stock to provide a direct estimate of the change in the cost of capital, which is 0.07%, or 7 basis points. These effects are quite modest, and they would be smaller still with more restrictive proposals that limited the application to losses, included only some types of assets, or provided minimum holding periods. ", "In addition, unlike some other tax cuts (such as expensing or corporate rate cuts) that occur at the firm level and have the potential to draw capital from abroad as well as potentially increase saving, capital gains are on the savers side, which means their effects operate solely through saving with some of that saving leaking into investments in other countries. Capital gain effects are also limited because of evidence that savings is not very responsive to changes in rates of return. Additionally, the increase in debt from crowding out would lead, in the absence of other changes, to an offsetting effect that would eventually be expected to reduce the capital stock.

The higher end of the estimates cited above would suggest a magnitude about three times this size, with a 3% increase for the top 0.1% and a 1% increase for the remainder of the top 1%.

In addition, whereas interest income is taxed too heavily because of inflation, most interest income is not subject to tax because it is in retirement plans or received as untaxed banking services. This favoritism has been somewhat reduced in the corporate sector due to the lower corporate rate and tighter restrictions on the deduction of interest, and indexing capital gains for inflation can bring these rates closer together by reducing the tax on equity.
