If and when it does, a key challenge will be how to address the unauthorized alien population, estimated to number some 11 million. The unauthorized alien population is often treated as if it were monolithic, but it is, in fact, quite diverse. It includes individuals who entered the United States in different ways, for different reasons, and who have different types of connections to the United States. The circumstances of individuals who compose the unauthorized alien population affect their treatment under immigration law, especially with respect to prospects for obtaining legal status in the United States. Relevant immigration status-related factors include mode of entry into the United States, length of unlawful presence in the country, and the existence of family or employment connections.", "The differences in circumstances among unauthorized aliens are particularly relevant in the context of current discussions about how to address this population. In past years, immigration proposals on unauthorized aliens often called for the establishment of broad legalization programs to enable large numbers of unauthorized aliens to become U.S. legal permanent residents (LPRs) or, conversely, included provisions aimed at promoting the departure of large numbers of unauthorized aliens from the country over time. More recently, there has been discussion of developing policies to provide targeted immigration relief to unauthorized aliens. Immigration relief is a broad term that encompasses relief from removal from the United States without the granting of a legal immigration status as well as relief in the form of a legal immigration status.", "A main focus of recent discussions has been making eligibility for legal status available to certain segments of the unauthorized population. Aliens with approved immigrant visa petitions, especially those with U.S. citizen or LPR family members, seem to be of particular interest. Selected segments of the unauthorized alien population without an affirmative pathway to legal status, such as students who entered the United States as children and beneficiaries of long-term humanitarian relief, have also been the subject of policy proposals.", "Policies to provide targeted relief to unauthorized aliens could be legislative or administrative. Legislative options could include amending existing statutory provisions to make it easier for certain unauthorized aliens to obtain LPR status. They also could include establishing statutory mechanisms to enable certain subgroups of unauthorized aliens to become LPRs who may not have pathways to do so under current law, as in the case of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act.", "Unauthorized aliens also could receive temporary relief from removal through administrative action. The Department of Homeland Security's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was established in the absence of congressional action on DREAM Act legislation and includes similar eligibility criteria, provides a recent example.

While the individuals included in this population at any point in time are officially categorized as unauthorized, they may differ significantly in their particular status-related circumstances under immigration law. For example, some unauthorized aliens in the United States have U.S. citizen or LPR family members or employers who are petitioning for them to become legal permanent residents (LPRs) of the United States under current law; others have no such sponsors.", "The variety of status-related circumstances among unauthorized aliens warrants attention because some immigration reform policy options under discussion would make distinctions based on individual circumstances.

Although parole does not constitute formal admission, aliens granted parole-in-place are eligible to adjust status in the United States; they do not have to travel to their home countries for consular processing.

For example, some recent proposals would have first granted beneficiaries conditional nonimmigrant status (rather than conditional LPR status) and would have required the aliens to apply to have that conditional nonimmigrant status extended before they could adjust to LPR status. These and other new elements were incorporated in a pair of bills introduced in the 112 th Congress, which, unlike traditional DREAM Act bills, would have established separate military and higher education pathways to LPR status, each with its own set of eligibility requirements. In the case of the higher education pathway, for example, an alien granted conditional nonimmigrant status would have had to graduate from an accredited four-year institution of higher education in the United States in order to stay on track to be eligible for LPR status.", "While the granting of legal immigration status to this subgroup of unauthorized aliens would require enactment of the DREAM Act or other legislation, more limited relief from removal could be provided administratively, and DHS has established a program to do so. In June 2012, in the absence of legislative action on DREAM Act bills, DHS issued a memorandum announcing that certain individuals who were brought to the United States as children and meet other criteria would be considered for deferred action for two years, subject to renewal. DHS began accepting requests for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals, or DACA, as the program is known, in August 2012. The eligibility criteria for DACA are similar to those for relief in DREAM Act bills, and include, among other requirements, that the alien: entered the United States before age 16, has been continuously resident for at least five years, and either is in school, has a high school diploma or the equivalent, or has been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces.

Under AgJOBS legislation, eligible farm workers could obtain LPR status through a two-stage process, with work requirements at each stage. To be eligible for temporary legal status in the first stage of the legalization program, an alien would have to show that he or she had performed a requisite amount of agricultural work during a prescribed period, among other requirements. To be eligible to adjust to LPR status in the second stage of the program, the alien would have to perform additional agricultural work and satisfy other requirements. An alternative proposal would pair an AgJOBs-like agricultural worker legalization program not with changes to the H-2A program, but with other provisions on agricultural labor.

The term STEM visas refers to expedited avenues for foreign nationals with graduate degrees in STEM fields to adjust to LPR status.
