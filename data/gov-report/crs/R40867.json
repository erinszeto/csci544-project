The bills call for a unified national strategy for addressing the key legal and regulatory barriers to deployment of commercial-scale CCS. A required report detailing a national strategy would identify barriers and gaps that could be addressed using existing federal authority and those that would require legislation, as well as those that would be best addressed at the state, tribal, or regional level. Both bills would also amend the Clean Air Act (CAA) and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to require that the EPA Administrator establish a coordinated certification and permitting process for geologic sequestration sites, taking into account all relevant statutory authorities. The amended law would require regulation of geologic sequestration wells, and promulgation of regulations to protect human health and the environment by minimizing the risk of atmospheric release of carbon dioxide injected for geologic sequestration.", "Both bills contain identical provisions establishing performance standards for CO2 removal for new coal-fired power plants.

The bills would allow the establishment of a corporation, by referendum among power industry organizations, that would derive revenue of approximately $1 billion per year via a \"wires charge\" on electricity delivered from the combustion of fossil fuels.

CCS receives considerable attention in both bills because of its potential for substantially reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from stationary sources, such as coal-fired power plants, cement plants, and oil refineries, while allowing those industrial sources to continue to operate even in a carbon-constrained environment. The goal of reduced emissions and continued operations is particularly important for the coal industry: coal-fired power plants generate approximately half of all the electricity in the United States, and are responsible for over 40% of U.S. CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels. Many observers consider CCS to be an integral component of a comprehensive strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without creating a near-term disruption of the U.S. energy sector.", "Currently, no coal-fired power plants, cement plants, oil refineries, or other large industrial sources of CO 2 in the United States are capturing and sequestering large quantities of CO 2 solely for the purpose of greenhouse gas mitigation. The CCS provisions in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 are likely intended to spur commercial deployment of CCS at a scale that would greatly surpass the degree of deployment in the absence of additional federal incentives and requirements. Without these incentives, some analyses have projected that low emission allowance prices combined with high costs for installing CCS systems would preclude most additional CCS deployment. ", "Many questions remain, however, about the possible consequences of accelerated CCS development: financial, legal, regulatory, infrastructure, environmental, and public acceptance. Both bills attempt to some degree to address these questions, largely in parallel and similar fashion, albeit with some important differences. Table 1 provides a snapshot comparison of the parallel sections in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 , and the body of the report summarizes and discusses each section in sequence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of Key Similarities and Differences", "paragraphs": ["The CCS provisions in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 are very similar (some sections are identical), and both bills appear to share the goal of fostering the commercial development and deployment of CCS projects as an important component of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.

", "Both bills would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate geologic sequestration of CO 2 under both the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act, and would also require that the EPA Administrator establish a coordinated certification and permitting process for geological sequestration sites. Recognizing that these statutes do not provide for comprehensive management of geologic sequestration issues (such as long-term liability and pore space ownership), the House and Senate bills would direct the EPA Administrator to establish a task force to examine broadly the federal and state legal framework for geologic sequestration sites and activities, and to report to Congress within 18 months.", "Both bills would create two separate programs that would provide financial incentives to develop and deploy commercial-scale CCS. The \"wires charge\" program, which is nearly identical in both bills and very similar to H.R. 1689 , the Carbon Capture and Storage Early Deployment Act introduced by Representative Boucher, would create an annual funding stream of approximately $1 billion to be awarded by a private corporation to eligible projects. The allocation of development and deployment grants and contracts would be largely independent of federal control, once the corporation is established, leaving the program to the discretion of the electricity generating industry for the most part. ", "The second program would distribute emission allowances from the cap-and-trade portions of both bills to qualifying electric generating plants and industrial facilities. Although the programs in the two bills are similar in construct and scale, S. 1733 would award allowances to the first 20 gigawatts (Gw) of electricity generation that employs CCS technology via a formula that provides a significant financial incentive, as much as $106 per ton of CO 2 captured for 90% capture efficiency. In contrast, H.R. 2454 would award only the first 6 Gw via the same formula, and then employ a reverse auction scheme to allocate the rest, up to a total of 72 Gw. Arguably the reverse auction process would provide an allowance price closer to its true market value, and thus reflect how the market values CCS versus other emissions reduction options, such as fuel-switching, offsets, and others. If so, then S. 1733 hedges in favor of CCS as a preferred technology by allocating allowances to a substantially larger proportion of electricity generating capacity in the first phase of the program, at bonus allowance values that could be significantly higher than their average market value. ", "Both the \"wires charge\" program and the emission allowance scheme focus on the CO 2 capture stage of CCS and generally presume that the technical and regulatory requirements for the transportation and sequestration stages would be in place by the time capture technology is installed and operational. Three nearly identical sections in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 attempt to address those requirements, through amendments to the Clean Air Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, as well as through studies and reports to construct a national strategy for CCS and identify gaps and barriers that could require additional legislation. Despite these provisions, it is not yet clear whether all of the challenges to transportation and sequestration aspects of CCS can or will be met in concert with the technological and financial challenges of building capture technology that works at large power plants and other industrial sources of CO 2 . The promise of CCS in some part depends on the promulgation of a CCS regulatory structure, a sufficient transportation capacity, resolution of liability concerns about long-term CO 2 storage, and public acceptance of CCS, as well as other requirements prior to or in conjunction with the deployment of capture technology at large commercial facilities.

Second tranche\u201410 Gw for eligible projects achieving 50% or more reduction in CO 2 emissions with a maximum bonus allowance value of $85 per ton for 90% capture.

In contrast, the \"early mover\" bonus would apply to only 6 Gw in H.R. 2454 .", "As in H.R. 2454 , allowances would be distributed under Phase II by reverse auction. In S. 1733 , similar to H.R. 2454 , the EPA Administrator may establish reverse auctions for no more than five different project categories, defined based on (1) coal type, (2) capture technology, (3) geological formation type, (4) new versus retrofit, and (5) other factors or any combination of categories 1-4. In S. 1733 , the Administrator would establish a separate reverse auction, to be held annually, for projects at industrial sources. Industrial sources would not be allowed to participate in other auctions. A requirement to segregate industrial sources from electricity generating sources is not specified in H.R. 2454 . ", "In parallel to H.R. 2454 , the Administrator may prescribe an alternative distribution method under S. 1733 if it is determined that reverse auctions are not efficient or cost-effective. Under both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 , the Administrator would divide the emission allowances into a series of multiple tranches, each supporting the deployment of a specific quantity of cumulative electricity generating capacity. Under S. 1733 , each tranche would support 10 Gw of generation capacity. In contrast, under H.R. 2454 each tranche would support 6 Gw.

In addition, S. 1733 prohibits the distribution of allowances to industrial sources under the first tranche of Phase 1 (i.e., the first 10 gigawatts of generating capacity), but does allow industrial projects to receive allowances under the second tranche of Phase I and thereafter. Under H.R. 2454 , projects at industrial sources would be eligible to receive allowances in Phase II, after the allowances for the first 6 gigawatts of generating capacity have been distributed.", "S. 1733 also contains a provision for certification of qualifying projects that is not included in H.R. 2454 . Under S. 1733 , qualifying projects that are eligible to receive allowances under either Phase I (the first 20 Gw) or the alternative distribution method of Phase II may request a certification from the EPA Administrator that the project is eligible to receive emission allowances. A project that successfully bids under the reverse auction method of Phase II does not have an option; it would be required to request a certification from the Administrator. The process of obtaining a certification is apparently a more formal requirement for eligibility that leads to a reservation of a portion of emission allowances allocated for the deployment of CCS technology. ", "In addition to applying for a certification, a qualifying project would need to document several items in order for the Administrator to make a determination of eligibility:", "technical information regarding CCS technology to be used, coal type, geological formation type, and other relevant design criteria; the annual CO 2 reductions projected for the first 10 years of commercial operation; and a demonstration by the owner and operator that they are committed to constructing and operating the project along a timeline of reasonable capture and sequestration milestones.", "In addition to documenting this information, the qualifying project must demonstrate its commitment to the project by taking at least one of three qualifying actions :", "execution of a commitment by lenders or other appropriate entities to finance the project; commitment of the owner or operator to execute a surety bond; or an authorization by a state regulatory authority to allow cost recovery from the retail customers for the costs of the project.", "For projects that elect not to request certification (Phase I or alternative distribution projects under Phase II are not required to, although they may), the Administrator would make a separate determination of whether the project satisfies eligibility requirements. That determination would occur at a time when the emission allowances are actually distributed. As with H.R. 2454 , emission allowances under S. 1733 would be distributed on an annual basis, based on the total tons of CO 2 the project actually captures and sequesters in each of the first 10 years of operation. Although emission allowances may be reserved in advance, based on the issuance of a certification or other determination of eligibility, they would not be actually distributed until after the CO 2 has been already captured and sequestered."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Chairman's Mark", "paragraphs": ["On October 23, 2009, Senator Boxer released the chairman's mark to S. 1733 , which contained a new provision to the emission allowance distribution program for CCS. The new provision would allow for advanced distribution of allowances under Phase I of the program, thus providing an opportunity for fossil fuel fired electricity plants and industrial facilities to receive allowances before the plants have actually captured and sequestered any CO 2 . This approach differs from the allowance distribution scheme in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 (as introduced), which would distribute emission allowances based on the total tons of CO 2 actually captured and sequestered. Similar to H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 (as introduced), the chairman's mark would require that plants have at least a 50% capture rate before they would qualify for allowances.", "Under the new provision, 70% of the number of emission allowances reserved under the first tranche of Phase I would be eligible for advanced distribution, and 50% of the second tranche would also be eligible. The amount of allowances eligible for advanced distribution would total 12 Gw of the 20 Gw of generating capacity, or 60% of the total, available under Phase I of S. 1733 . By comparison, H.R. 2454 would provide only half that amount (6 Gw) in total for Phase I, and would require that the plants have commenced operations and actually be capturing CO 2 before receiving any allowances. The provision in the chairman's mark of S. 1733 could be seen as an additional incentive to \"early movers\" to build CCS-ready facilities or retrofit existing plants. The requirements for when to provide the advanced distribution are somewhat vague, however, allowing the EPA Administrator discretion to pick a time prior to the plant's operational phase that would \"ensure expeditious deployment\" of CCS technology.", "Some may view the new provision as providing access to emission allowances before the plant owner or operator has made an iron-clad commitment to building and operating a CCS unit. In part, the chairman's mark addresses that concern by specifying that advanced allowances would be limited to only cover costs for retrofitting an existing plant for CCS and to cover the difference in costs between building a new electric generating unit with CCS versus a new plant without CCS. The bill assigns responsibility for the necessary cost estimates\u2014for both the retrofit and the new plant costs\u2014to the organization requesting the advanced appropriations. The advanced allowances would be distributed using the cost estimates provided by the requesting organization.", "In addition, certification would be required for a plant to receive advanced allowances. As one of the criteria for obtaining certification, the chairman's mark adds an additional qualifying action to the list of qualifying actions in S. 1733 that would demonstrate a commitment to construct and operate a CCS project: an authorization from a state legislature to allow cost recovery for the CCS project. Thus, a project could receive authorization either from a state regulatory authority for cost recovery, or from a state legislature, as one necessary step to obtaining certification. ", "The advanced allowance scheme provides a new incentive for power plants and industrial facilities to make a commitment to building CCS that is not present in H.R. 2454 or in S. 1733 (as introduced). It is likely to accelerate early deployment of CCS by making up to 12 Gw eligible for advanced allowances, compared to H.R. 2454 , which provides for only 6 Gw in Phase I. How much more electricity generating capacity will employ CCS as a result of the advanced allowance provision is difficult to predict, and would depend, in part, on other factors such as the ratio of the value of bonus allowances established in legislation versus the market price of allowances. The long-term deployment of CCS would also depend on how well the hoped-for \"learning-by-doing\" gains in efficiency and knowledge accrue from demonstration projects and the experience gained through early deployment at a commercial scale."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
