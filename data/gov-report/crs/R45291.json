Delivery subsidies accounted for $14.8 billion (20%) of federal spending on crop insurance during crop years 2007 through 2016. The amount of delivery subsidies is not based on actual expenses incurred by Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs) but is instead based on percentages of premium that are established in the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA). The percentages vary by policy type and coverage level. Delivery subsidies are not taken from total premium. They are paid as a separate government subsidy to AIPs. The SRA sets their amounts as follows:", "Administrative and Operating (A&O) subsidy, for delivery of buy-up coverage (lower deductibles), equals between 12% and 21.9% of premium, depending on policy type. Catastrophic Loss Adjustment Expense (CAT LAE), for delivery of catastrophic level coverage (higher deductibles), is fixed at 6% of premium.", "From 2007 to 2016, total annual delivery costs (A&O and CAT LAE combined) averaged about $1.5 billion in current dollars and represented about 15% of total premium. The 2011 SRA and subsequent SRAs established a minimum (cup) of approximately $1.0 billion and a maximum (cap) of approximately $1.3 billion per year for A&O subsidies\u2014subject to an adjustment for inflation from 2011 to 2015\u2014to help stabilize A&O amounts. Since the A&O cup and cap first went into effect in 2011, the total amount spent on delivery subsidies (A&O and CAT LAE combined) has exceeded the A&O cap every year.", "Limited data is available on the actual expenses of AIPs. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) requires AIPs to report actual expenses as SRA exhibits but does not publish the reported expense data.", "CRS is aware of three publicly available sources for information on AIP expenses: (1) annual statements from state departments of insurance, (2) Form 10-K and other reports submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by AIPs that are owned by publicly traded companies, and (3) AIP survey data used in studies sponsored by the crop insurance industry.", "The available data on actual delivery expenses is not easily matched with A&O delivery subsidies and leaves unanswered the question of whether current subsidies are deficient, sufficient, or excessive relative to the actual delivery costs of AIPs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Since its inception in 1938, the federal crop insurance program has expanded from an ancillary program with low participation to a central pillar of federal support for agriculture.

The Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71501 et seq. , P.L. 96-365 ) created the public-private partnership with AIPs, which brought AIPs into product delivery and risk-sharing with FCIC.

All AIPs are directed to charge the same amount of premium for the same policy to the same farmer. Lack of price competition generated concerns among some observers around two issues in particular: (1) AIPs potentially paying excessive compensation to agents to grow their portfolios and (2) AIPs and agents potentially engaging in rebating mechanisms and other devices to indirectly compete on price. Although RMA has addressed both issues through regulations and guidance, some observers assert that these issues seem to be ongoing challenges.", "The largest single delivery expense reported by AIPs is compensation to crop insurance agents. Crop insurance agents are largely independent agents who sell policies for multiple AIPs. Because RMA determines premium rates, AIPs cannot compete for business based on the price of a policy. Instead they tend to compete by establishing relationships with agents and by providing superior customer service. Thus, it is generally in an AIP's interest to hire successful agents. This has made for a competitive market for federal crop insurance agents.", "Since 2011, the SRA has set limits on the amount AIPs are allowed to pay agents. Specifically, AIPs may not pay more than 80% of A&O and CAT LAE by state as base commission to agents. However, an AIP may pay compensation up to 100% of A&O and CAT LAE by state if certain conditions are met. There is no limitation on how much any given agent may receive so long as it is within the maximum amount allowable per state.
