Legislative Context", "Representative Sean Duffy, as noted at the first section of this report, introduced the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA; H.R. 5278 ) on May 18, 2016. This bill is a revised version of H.R. 4900 , which Representative Duffy had introduced on April 12, 2016. The House Natural Resources Committee issued a discussion draft with the same title on March 24, 2016, and a revised discussion draft on March 29, 2016. The committee held a hearing and heard opening statements for a markup on H.R. 4900 on April 13, 2016. The continuation of the markup on the following day was postponed. The House Committee on Natural Resources marked up H.R. 5278 on May 25, 2016. Amendments agreed to include technical corrections and extensions of certain studies on the Puerto Rico government and economy, among others. The major provisions of the bill, however, were unaffected. The House passed an amended version of H.R. 5278 on June 9, 2016, by a 297-127 vote. The Senate approved the measure ( S. 2328 ) on June 29, 2016, by a 68-30 vote. President Obama signed the measure into law on June 30, 2016.", "Other Proposals to Address Puerto Rico's Fiscal Crisis", "In October 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury set out a reform framework and called on Congress to pass legislation to aid Puerto Rico. Resident Commissioner Pierluisi introduced H.R. 870 on March 16, 2015, that would restore the island's access to chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code. Senator Blumenthal introduced a similar measure ( S. 1774 ) on July 15, 2015. Representative Duffy introduced H.R. 4199 , a measure to provide fiscal oversight and a process for debt restructuring, on December 9, 2015. Senator Hatch introduced a similar measure ( S. 2381 ) on the same day. On December 18, 2015, Representative Pelosi introduced H.R. 4290 , a measure to stay debt-related litigation. Senator Warren introduced a companion measure ( S. 2436 ) on the same day. On March 14, 2016, Senator Menendez introduced the Puerto Rico Recovery Act of 2016 ( S. 2675 ) and the Puerto Rico Stability Act of 2016 ( S. 2676 ). Both measures would create ways to adjust Puerto Rico's debt. On June 9, 2016, Senator Sanders introduced S. 3044 , which would establish a Puerto Rico Reconstruction Finance Corporation, restore the island's access to chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, and make changes in federal health care and economic development programs to benefit Puerto Rico. Table A-1 summarizes measures introduced to address Puerto Rico's fiscal difficulties.", "Several other measures have been introduced to alter federal programs' eligibility rules or levels of benefits available to Puerto Rico residents. For example, Resident Commissioner Pierluisi has also introduced several measures (including H.R. 1225 , H.R. 1417 , H.R. 1418 , H.R. 1822 , H.R. 2635 , H.R. 3552 , H.R. 3553 , and H.R. 4163 ) that would remove various limitations on federal health care funding, refundable tax credits, and social insurance programs. Increased federal funding for health or income security programs could mitigate the Puerto Rico government's fiscal pressures, although such funding would require an increase in federal revenues, reduction in other federal spending, or additional federal borrowing, or some combination of those means. ", "Brief Background on Puerto Rico and its Political Status", "The United States acquired Puerto Rico from Spain in 1898, at the conclusion of the Spanish-American War. The island is the largest of the five major U.S. territories and lies approximately 1,000 miles southeast of Miami. The Territory Clause of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress plenary authority over Puerto Rico and other territories. Specifically, this includes \"Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.\" Congress has enacted various statutes to address specific matters concerning the island's political status \u2014a term of art referring to the political relationship between the federal government and a territorial government. In particular, Congress recognized island authority over matters of internal governance in 1950 through the Federal Relations Act (FRA) and when it approved the island's Constitution in 1952.", "Puerto Rico's Fiscal Challenges", "The Puerto Rico government has been facing serious liquidity challenges despite several measures taken by the island's government to reduce spending, increase revenues, and restructure its obligations. Those liquidity challenges are the result of long-standing problems of stagnant economic growth, persistent structural budgetary imbalances, and governance problems, among other contributing factors.", "Structure of Puerto Rico's Government and Debt", "Puerto Rico's public sector is composed of a Commonwealth government, some 50 public corporations (described in more detail below), and municipal governments, among other instrumentalities. In general, the Puerto Rico Office of Management and Budget oversees agencies of the Commonwealth, but not public corporations or municipalities. Debt issuances or guarantees backed by the full faith and credit of the Commonwealth government are often called general obligation (GO) debt. The Commonwealth government has also issued non-GO debt.", "Role of Public Corporations", "Public corporations play a prominent role in the economy and public sector of Puerto Rico. H.R. 5278 includes provisions that would allow, in certain cases, separate oversight of public corporations and other instrumentalities of the Puerto Rico government. Public corporations in Puerto Rico serve a broad variety of purposes and activities, including public infrastructure, banking, real estate, insurance, industrial development, health care, transportation, electric power, broadcasting, education, arts, and tourism, among others. Some public corporations resemble public authorities of state governments, although in some cases, have responsibilities more akin to public agencies. Puerto Rico's electric power utility, as described in the next section, has been negotiating with its creditors since the summer of 2014.", "Current Negotiations with Creditors", "H.R. 5278 , as noted above, allows for separate voluntary agreements between public corporations and their creditors, subject to certain conditions. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) entered into a restructuring and forbearance agreement in August 2014 with major creditors, prompted by the need to maintain sufficient financing for fuel purchases. PREPA and a large proportion of its creditors have signed a Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) that would create a surcharge on electricity consumers' bills. The Energy Commission of Puerto Rico approved the PREPA revitalization surcharge on June 21, 2016. Proceeds of the surcharge would be used to help fund debt service payments for new bonds that would be exchanged with existing PREPA debt. The proposed bond exchange would allow PREPA to lower its debt service costs and would extend the maturity of its debt. ", "A proposal to use a similar strategy for Puerto Rico's water and sewer public corporation (Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority; PRASA) has passed both the Puerto Rico House of Representatives and Senate, which have agreed to conference to resolve differences. The Puerto Rico government and the Government Development Bank have put forth two bond exchange proposals. ", "Various creditor groups have also made proposals to restructure categories of Puerto Rico's debt. The Puerto Rican government, along with the Government Development Bank (GDB) and other fiscal advisors, have engaged in a series of negotiations with different creditors and bond insurers. Proposals of the island government, according to documents released on June 21, 2016, were not accepted. ", "H.R. 5278 includes provisions to allow for a carve-out for voluntary agreements reached between public corporations and bondholders that satisfy certain conditions.", "Why Now?", "The government of Puerto Rico faces debt service payments that may be beyond its current capacity to pay. In August 2015, Puerto Rico defaulted on debt service payments for \"moral obligation\" bonds issued by the Public Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the island's GDB, the island government's fiscal agent. Missed debt service payments for bonds with stronger investor protections could lead to serious legal and financial consequences. On May 1, 2016, Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla issued an order to declare a moratorium on certain debt payments by the Government Development Bank (GDB), the government's fiscal agent, which was due to make a debt service payment of $423 million on May 2, 2016. ", "Whether the Commonwealth government can make a larger debt service payment on July 1, 2016, is doubtful. The ratings agency Standard & Poors indicated that it believed a government default was \"virtually certain.\" ", "The proposed FY2017 budget, submitted on May 23, 2016, comes \"at the hour of choice between paying money to the creditors and providing services to our people,\" according to Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla. Proposed payments for debt service in FY2017 are well below amounts due. A federal district judge on March 28, 2016, held that the government of Puerto Rico \"is insolvent and no longer able to pay its debts as they become due.\" A local banking regulator, the Puerto Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions, found that the GDB was insolvent in 2015, according to evidence collected in that case. While senior GDB officials contested some claims of the Commissioner, many considered it likely that a receiver could take control of the GDB, which could complicate financial operations of the Commonwealth.", "In the week following the release of that federal district court order and opinion, Puerto Rico enacted the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act (PREMFRA; Act 21 of 2016), that empowered the governor of Puerto Rico to declare a fiscal state of emergency and a moratorium on certain debt service payments that would extend to January 2017. The act also modifies legal provisions regarding the receivership of the GDB and allows a bridge bank to be set up to assume many of the responsibilities and assets of the GDB. The act also stays legal actions against the Puerto Rico government while emergency powers are invoked. On April 9, Governor Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla invoked those authorities and declared an emergency period for the GDB in order to allow it to continue its operations. ", "An amendment offered by Chairman Bishop and agreed to during House deliberations would empower the Oversight Board to rescind laws enacted by the Puerto Rico government from May 4, 2016, until all members of the board were appointed. The latter provision would allow the board to rescind PREMFRA and thus curtail emergency powers invoked by the Governor. Two lawsuits have been filed to challenge PREMFRA in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico and one was filed in the Southern District Court of New York. Some note that the former two cases make arguments similar to those used against the Puerto Rico Restructuring Act (discussed in following section).", "Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, in a June 27, 2016, letter to congressional leaders, argued that a federal judge considering such cases could order Puerto Rico to pay constitutionally prioritized debt ahead of essential governmental services such as health, education, and public safety. Secretary Lew further contended that \"a retroactive stay on litigation passed by Congress a few days later would not reverse such a court order.\" ", "Supreme Court and Puerto Rico Restructuring Act", "In the face of an increasingly difficult fiscal environment and severe liquidity problems of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the Puerto Rico government in June 2014 enacted a law (Act 71 of 2014) that would have allowed its public corporations to file for debt restructuring through Puerto Rico's legal system. Act 71 set out two paths for restructuring debts of public corporations, one a consensual renegotiation with creditors, the other a judicial process. In February 2015, a U.S. District Court struck down that act, an opinion upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on July 6, 2015. On March 22, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments for an appeal. The Supreme Court upheld the lower court's opinion on June 13, 2016, ruling that, although Puerto Rico has no access to chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, a provision in that chapter preempts Puerto Rico's attempt to establish its own vehicle for restructuring the debts of its instrumentalities. ", "Alternative Approaches to Address Puerto Rico's Situation", "Several elements of other proposals to address Puerto Rico's fiscal challenges are not included in H.R. 5278 . Other federal responses could be considered in other legislation. In the one previous case when Congress established a control board for the District of Columbia with the enactment of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act ( P.L. 104-8 ), it revisited and amended that legislation to adjust or extend federal responses.", "The Obama Administration's framework for responding to Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis had four major elements: broad restructuring authorities, independent oversight, adequate funding of health care services, and incentives to drive economic growth. H.R. 4900 , in the view of the U.S. Treasury, addresses the two most urgent elements, restructuring of obligations and oversight, but does not include health care funding measures or provisions that directly promote economic development. Congress could consider other measures to address Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis as part of the FY2017 appropriations process or through other legislation. The Obama Administration proposed an extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for Puerto Rico in its FY2017 budget plan.", "Some argued that the establishment of an Oversight Board would not improve Puerto Rico's fiscal management and governance capabilities, and that a \"large scale\" overhaul of public financial management systems, institutions, and practices was necessary. Treasury Secretary Lew, on the other hand, has argued that federal oversight would play a \"fairly important role\" in helping develop stronger financial management and governmental management capabilities. H.R. 5278 , unlike legislation that established a control board for the District of Columbia, does not create a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) position.", "International responses to fiscal and economic crises of sovereign governments typically include bridge financing to address short-term liquidity needs and an agreement to undertake structural reforms to enhance long-term growth prospects. The bill introduced by Senator Hatch ( S. 2381 \u00a7501) provides an authorization of appropriations of $3 billion that with the approval of an Oversight Board could be used to enhance the \"financial, fiscal, economic, and health care stability\" of Puerto Rico. A rescission of funds (\u00a7501) provided by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would provide an offset to those stability funds. H.R. 5278 does not provide such direct support, although the stay on litigation and debt restructuring measures could ease pressures on the Puerto Rico government's financial resources.", "Appendix B.
