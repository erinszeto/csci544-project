However, determining the program's influence on small business lending is likely to be more suggestive than definitive because differentiating the SSBCI's effect on small business lending from other factors, such as changes in the lender's local economy, is methodologically challenging, especially given the relatively small amount of financing involved relative to the national market for small business loans.

One difference was a greater emphasis by the bill's advocates in the Senate on the SSBCI's support of state loan collateral programs. Several Senators argued that the SSBCI's support of state loan collateral programs was needed because, as one Senator pointed out, \"just as the recession has battered the value of our homes, it has also battered the value of business property such as real estate, factories, and equipment.

In a companion loan, a lender originates a senior loan and the state originates a second loan, which is usually subordinate to the lender's senior loan should a default occur, to the same borrower.

But, as Treasury has also noted, determining the SSBCI's influence on small business lending is likely to be more suggestive than definitive because differentiating the SSBCI's effect on small business lending from other, exogenous factors, such as changes in the lender's local economy and changes in the demand for small business loans, is methodologically challenging, especially given the relatively small amount of financing involved relative to the national market for small business loans. As mentioned previously, the SSBCI's $1.5 billion in financing represents about 0.24% of outstanding non-agricultural small business loans.", "Treasury's OIG's audits of 24 states' implementation of their SSBCI programs suggest that many states experienced difficulty reaching full compliance with the program's administrative requirements, which were designed to reduce the likelihood of loan defaults, investment losses, and fraudulent use of funds. The release of Treasury's \"SSBCI National Standards for Compliance and Oversight\" document on May 15, 2012, proved useful because it helped states become more familiar with, and accustomed to, the SSBCI's rules and regulations. However, given the relatively large number of new small business investment programs receiving SSBCI funding, the relatively large number of entities involved in the program (state officials, hundreds of lenders and investment companies, and thousands of small businesses), and the termination of Treasury's role in SSBCI administration, SSBCI program oversight is likely to remain a congressional interest."], "subsections": []}]}}
