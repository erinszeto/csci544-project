Congress continued to express concern with the volume of drugs readily available in the United States and elsewhere in the world. The three largest producers of cocaine are Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. Ninety percent of the cocaine in the United States originates in, or passes through, Colombia.", "The United States has made a significant commitment of funds and material support to help Colombia and the Andean region fight drug trafficking since the development of Plan Colombia in 1999. From FY2000 through FY2007, the United States provided a total of about $5.7 billion for the region in ACI funds. The United States also provides funding for Development Assistance (DA), Child Survival and Health (CSH), and Economic Support Funds (ESF) to some countries in the region. The Defense Department maintains a central counternarcotics account that funds activities in Latin America. Since 2002, Congress has granted expanded authority to use counternarcotics funds for a unified campaign to fight both drug trafficking and terrorist organizations in Colombia. Three illegally armed groups in Colombia that participate in drug production and trafficking have been designated foreign terrorist organizations by the State Department. In 2004, Congress also increased the level of U.S. military and civilian contractor personnel allowed to be deployed in Colombia, in response to an Administration request.", "The FY2007 budget request, submitted to Congress on February 6, 2006, included a total of $721.5 million for ACI, an amount Congress approved in a continuing resolution.

The final bill, the FY2007 Continuing Resolution (H.J.Res. 20/P.L. 109-289, as amended by P.L. 110-5) was passed on February 15, 2007.", "For FY2006, Congress approved the Administration's request for $734.5 million in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (H.R. 3057/P.L. 109-102), although a 1% across-the-board rescission reduced it to $727.2 million."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["In 2006 and early 2007, Congress considered a number of issues relating to the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, the U.S. assistance program to help Colombia and its neighbors address drug trafficking and economic development issues. These issues included ongoing concerns with the effectiveness of the program, funding levels, human rights, and the future of the program. The region has been viewed as particularly important because it produces virtually all of the world's cocaine and increasing amounts of high quality heroin. It is estimated that 90% of the cocaine coming to the United States originates in, or passes through, Colombia. Moreover, the stability of Colombia and the region is threatened by Colombia's longstanding leftist guerrilla insurgency and rightist paramilitary groups, which are believed to be largely funded by their participation in illegal narcotics production and trafficking.", "The Andean Counterdrug Initiative is the primary U.S. program that supports Plan Colombia, a six year plan developed in 1999 by President Andres Pastrana (1998-2002) of Colombia, and continued by current President Alvaro Uribe.

U.S. objectives for the ACI program are to eliminate the cultivation and production of cocaine and opium, build law enforcement infrastructure, arrest and prosecute traffickers, and seize their assets.", "The region also includes two major oil producing countries (Venezuela and Ecuador), members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which supply significant quantities of oil to the United States.

Funding for ACI from FY2000 through FY2007 totals about $5.7 billion. ACI is managed by the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). Some ACI funds are transferred to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for alternative development programs.", "ACI funds are divided between programs that support eradication or interdiction efforts and those focused on alternative crop development and democratic institution building. On the interdiction side, programs train and support national police and military forces, provide communications and intelligence systems, support the maintenance and operations of host country aerial eradication aircraft, and improve infrastructure related to counternarcotics activities. On the alternative development side, funds support development programs in coca growing areas, including infrastructure development, and marketing and technical support for alternative crops. They also support programs assisting internally displaced persons, promoting the rule of law, and expanding judicial capabilities.", "ACI also funds the Air Bridge Denial Program that is currently operational in Colombia, and temporarily suspended in Peru, after an accidental shooting down of a civilian aircraft carrying U.S. missionaries in 2001. After the incident, in which two Americans died, the program in both countries was suspended until enhanced safeguards were developed. The program in Colombia resumed in August 2003. The program supports an aircraft fleet, pilot training, and logistical and intelligence support. The program tracks aircraft suspected of being involved in drug trafficking, and forces them to land for inspection.

Instead of funding alternative development and institution building from the ACI account, the bill provided $135 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF) for alternative development, a $10 million increase from the request. In addition, the bill provided $26.2 million in International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funds for rule of law programs, equal to the request, that were previously provided from the ACI account. Funding for drug interdiction programs at $313.9 million, equal to the request, was maintained in the ACI account. The provision of some funds from non-ACI accounts was characterized as beginning the process of treating Colombia as a strategic partner. The Subcommittee also included $70.2 million for the Critical Flight Safety Program, earmarked for operations in Colombia. This was $4.5 million above the request.", "The bill increased funding for Peru by $10.5 million over the request, providing $46 million for alternative development and $63 million for interdiction programs. These funds remain in the ACI account. The bill cut ACI funding for Bolivia by $15 million from the request, all of it in interdiction programs. Funding for alternative development was set at $31 million, and $20 million for interdiction. The cut was made in response to reports that Bolivia's commitment to fighting drugs was lessening. ACI funding for Brazil ($4 million), Ecuador ($17.3 million), and Panama ($4 million) was equal to the request. The $1 million requested for Venezuela was not provided.", "The Subcommittee created a new account\u2014the Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund\u2014and a new position at USAID to oversee and coordinate trade assistance programs. While the total amount provided was $522 million, the bill transferred $62.5 million of ACI funds to the new account for use in ACI countries.
