In order to impose a limit on the amount of money that the government can be obligated to spend, the amount of contract authority that can be obligated is limited by a spending control mechanism called a \"limitation on obligations\" (often referred to as \"ObLim\" or \"Oblimit\"). The ObLim for each year is set in the authorizing legislation, and is included in the DOT appropriations bill.

In this report, references to DOT funding include both discretionary funds and the contract authority Oblim, unless otherwise indicated.", "In preparing legislation to fund DOT for FY2010, Congress faced several issues both within and outside the context of the President's budget request and FY2010 transportation funding initiatives.

For example, only $320 million of the $41.7 billion provided for the Federal Highway Administration in the FY2009 THUD appropriations act came from general funds; the remainder was contract authority. In addition, most federal transit funding also comes from the transit account of the Highway Trust Fund (about $2 billion of FTA's $10.2 billion in the FY2009 regular appropriation came from general funds).", "When the federal highway and transit programs were last authorized in 2005 ( P.L. 109-59 , the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, or SAFETEA), Congress authorized highway spending levels to be drawn from the Fund through FY2009. Since that time, a number of events have reduced the balance of the Fund more than was projected: Congress provided more than the originally authorized level of highway funding from the Highway Trust Fund in some fiscal years, and the economic recession led to lower than projected revenues to the Fund. This situation led Congress to transfer $8 billion in general revenues to the Highway Trust Fund late in FY2008 to maintain its solvency.", "In order to maintain the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund, the President's FY2010 budget proposed drawing only $5 billion from the Highway Trust Fund for the federal highway program for FY2010, with the remaining $36 billion for the program to be appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury. Congress rejected this proposal, and in July 2009 again transferred money ($7 billion) from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund to maintain its solvency ( P.L. 111-46 / H.R. 3357 ).

Congressional reaction to that request was mixed, with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee leadership urging Congress to pass reauthorization legislation without delay, while the Senate Environment and Public Works leadership has been supportive of the President's request to extend the existing authorization for a time. Given the many major initiatives Congress was grappling with, and the short time remaining before the expiration of the current authorization, Congress passed two short-term extensions, extending the authorization to February 28, 2010. During the last reauthorization of highway and transit programs, the then-existing authorization was extended repeatedly, for a total of almost two years beyond the original expiration date, before Congress passed new reauthorization legislation.

In order to bring the total funding level of the bill down to the limit set by the President, SAFETEA provided that $8.7 billion in contract authority would be rescinded from the federal highway program on the last day of the final fiscal year of the authorization, September 30, 2009. SAFETEA-LU, like previous surface transportation authorization legislation, provided states more contract authority than obligational authority (i.e., they are given more contract authority each year than they are authorized to spend). As discussed earlier, the actual level of contract authority expenditure is set by the limitation of obligations, not by the amount of contract authority that is authorized. The contract authority does not expire; consequently, an amount of unused contract authority builds up for each state over time. At the time SAFETEA was enacted, it seemed likely that the rescission of contract authority required on September 30, 2009, if not canceled, could be taken out of their unused amounts of contract authority by the states and would not affect their transportation spending.", "In the years since passage of SAFETEA, Congress has several times included rescissions of contract authority in the annual THUD appropriations bills. This practice enabled Congress to provide more highway funding to states than might otherwise have been possible under the annual budget limits and in light of the previous administration's calls for limiting congressional spending, since it made the enacted net highway funding levels appear to be smaller than they actually were. However, by doing so Congress reduced the amount of unused contract authority that states had accumulated.. For some states, their share of the $8.7 billion rescission that was required on September 30, 2009, was larger than their amount of unused contract authority. The result was that the rescission did actually reduce the amount of federal highway funding those states would otherwise have been able to spend in FY2010.", "An effort to add an amendment to P.L. 111-46 to prevent the September 30, 2009 rescission failed. Senator Barbara Boxer, chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, said that the issue would be taken up again before the rescission was scheduled to take place. However, canceling the rescission would have been scored as additional Congressional spending. The House had committed to offset any spending increases, so canceling the rescission would have required either increased revenues or a cut in other programs. In the end, Congress allowed the rescission to take place. This had two results; first, for some states it reduced the amount of federal transportation funding that could be spent in FY2010. Second, by significantly reducing the amount of unused contract authority states had accumulated for surface transportation prrograms, it reduced the opportunity for Congress to use the budget tactic of rescinding unused contract authority (to make the net DOT funding level appear smaller than it actually is) in the future. In the FY2010 DOT appropriation, Congress did not rescind any contract authority under the Federal Highway Administration account; in FY2009 there was a $3.2 billion contract authority rescission in that account.
