Under the law, there is broad authority to detain foreign nationals (aliens/noncitizens) while awaiting a determination of whether the noncitizen should be removed from the United States. The law also mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention (i.e., the aliens must be detained). Aliens subject to mandatory detention include those arriving without documentation or with fraudulent documentation, those who are inadmissible or deportable on criminal grounds, those who are inadmissible or deportable on national security grounds, those certified as terrorist suspects, and those who have final orders of deportation. Aliens not subject to mandatory detention may be detained, paroled, or released on bond. The priorities for detention of these aliens are specified in statute and regulations. For example, the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) increased the categories of aliens subject to mandatory detention. This increase has raised concerns about the justness of mandatory detention, especially as it is applied to asylum seekers arriving without proper documentation.", "As of December 22, 2012, on an average day in FY2013, there were 34,696 noncitizens in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody. The amount of detention space is almost exclusively controlled by Congress through appropriations, and Congress has been active in providing oversight of detention space allocations and detention conditions. Since FY2002, Congress has increased the number of funded detention beds from 21,109 beds to 34,000 beds. As DHS increases its ability to identify aliens who are subject to removal from local jails in more remote locations, the nationwide allocation of detention space may become an issue.", "Furthermore, the detention policy for aliens who have received a final order of removal may also be a congressional concern. After a final removal order has been issued against an alien, the law provides that the alien be removed within 90 days, except as otherwise provided in the statute. Certain aliens subject to a removal order \"may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to [certain] terms of supervision.\" This provision had been interpreted as permitting indefinite detention where removal was not reasonably foreseeable, but in 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court in Zadvydas v. Davis, interpreted it as only permitting detention for up to six months where removal was not reasonably foreseeable. Nonetheless, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that its ruling was made \"absent clear guidance from Congress\" (i.e., that it was not clear what congressional intent was related to detaining aliens who could not be removed within 90 days). Comprehensive immigration reform (CIR) bills in the 109th and 110th Congress would have modified and codified the regulations regarding the detention of those with final orders of removal.

For example, while some want to increase the categories of aliens who are detained and increase the amount of detention space, others want to create alternatives to detention and exempt asylum seekers from mandatory detention. In addition, immigration enforcement activities affect the need for and allocation of detention resources.

Mandatory detention is required for certain criminal and terrorist aliens who are removable, pending a final decision on whether the alien is to be removed. No bail is available and only a hearing can determine whether the alien qualifies as a criminal or terrorist alien. Aliens not subjected to mandatory detention can be paroled, released on bond, or continue to be detained. Decisions on parole made by the Secretary and bond decisions made by the Attorney General are not subject to review.", "In October 1998, the former INS issued a memorandum, which is still in effect, establishing detention guidelines consistent with the changes made by IIRIRA. According to the guidelines, detainees are assigned to one of four detention categories: (1) required; (2) high priority; (3) medium priority; and (4) lower priority. Aliens in required detention must be detained (e.g., criminal aliens, national security risks) while aliens in the other categories may be detained depending on detention space and the facts of the case.

The Attorney General must initiate removal proceedings or bring criminal charges within seven days of arresting the alien or release the alien. An alien who is detained solely as a certified terrorist, who has not been removed, and who is unlikely to be removed in the foreseeable future may be detained for periods of up to six months only if his release would pose a danger to national security or public safety.

These aliens had been ordered removed from the United States, but were detained because the aliens could not obtain travel documents to another country or the immigration officials refused to release them. These detainees were often referred to as \"lifers\" or \"unremovables.\" Many of these detainees had criminal records, but some simply lacked immigration status and the ability to return to their country of origin. Some detainees had been in immigration detention for a longer time period than their criminal incarceration. In 2000, which was the final year before the Supreme Court ruling limiting the time in detention for aliens who had been ordered removed, INS estimated that it had 5,000 aliens in indefinite administrative custody.", "In a 5-4 decision in Zadvydas v. Davis (2001), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a statute permitting indefinite detention would raise serious constitutional problems because the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits depriving any person, including aliens, of liberty without due process of law. Therefore, in keeping with principles of statutory construction and the absence of clear congressional intent for indefinite detention, the Court read an implicit limitation into the post-removal detention statute, such that detention is limited to a period \"reasonably necessary\" to achieve an alien's removal. The Supreme Court established six months after the removal order as the presumptively reasonable period within which to effect removal. After this period, once an alien shows that there is good reason to believe that \"there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,\" the government must rebut that showing with sufficient evidence. The Court emphasized that its holding does not mean that all aliens must be released in six months nor that an alien may not be held until it has been determined that \"there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\" The Court suggested that special arguments could be made for a statutory scheme of preventive detention for terrorists or other aliens in special circumstances and for heightened judicial deference for executive and legislative branch decisions regarding national security matters.", "In response to this decision, the Attorney General issued regulations governing the review of post-removal order detention cases for a determination of foreseeability of removal. The Attorney General issued regulations, effective November 14, 2001, concerning the continued detention of aliens subject to final orders of removal that are consistent with the Zadvydas decision. Subsequently, then Chief Immigration Judge Michael Creppy issued a memorandum on the Immigration Court's policy regarding these regulations. The regulations and the memorandum establish four categories of aliens whose removal from the United States is not foreseeable, but whom the Attorney General may continue to detain. These \"special circumstances\" include", "aliens with a highly contagious disease that poses a threat to public safety; aliens whose release would cause serious adverse foreign policy consequences; aliens detained for security or terrorism reasons; and aliens determined to be specifically dangerous.", "Of these four categories, only the fourth requires the involvement of the Immigration Court; the other three remain under DHS discretion. ", "In Clark v. Martinez , the Court held that the rationale it applied in Zadvydas to aliens who had been admitted to the United States and were deportable also applied to aliens who had not been legally admitted into the United States, were found inadmissible and ordered removed, and were being detained beyond the statutory removal period although removal was not reasonably foreseeable. Accordingly, the six-month presumptive detention period applied. In Zadvydas , the Court explicitly let stand an older decision which distinguished between the indefinite detention of an excludable alien (similar to inadmissible alien under current law) who sought to enter the United States and a deportable alien who had entered the United States. Therefore, the Court had suggested that it might reach a different conclusion for indefinite detention of inadmissible aliens from the one it reached in Zadvydas for deportable aliens and noted that the statutory purposes and constitutional concerns for deportable aliens were not the same for inadmissible aliens. However, in Clark v. Martinez , it decided that to treat inadmissible aliens differently under the removal statute would render an inconsistent interpretation of the removal statute, where the statute itself made no distinction between the treatment of inadmissible and deportable aliens. Justice Thomas criticized the Court's opinion as departing from its constitutional rationale in Zadvydas and its suggestion in that case that inadmissible aliens presented a different situation.

Aliens subject to expedited removal must be detained until they are removed and may only be released due to medical emergency or if necessary for law enforcement purposes. If the arriving alien expresses a fear of persecution or an intent to apply for asylum, the alien is placed in detention until a \"credible fear\" interview can be held.

Most of the fraudulent claims were made by people attempting to come to the United States for economic or family reasons, illegally rather than through legal immigration channels. False asylum claims utilize limited resources, causing those with legitimate claims to have to wait longer to have their cases processed. Thus, many argued that the only way to deter fraudulent asylum claims was to detain asylum seekers rather than releasing them on their own recognizance. Indeed some claim that the practice of detaining asylum seekers has reportedly helped reduced the number of fraudulent asylum claims.", "However, some contend that the policy of detaining all asylum seekers is too harsh. They argue that there is a need to inhibit fraudulent asylum claims, but mandatory detention of asylum seekers causes more problems than it solves. The position of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees is that detention of asylum seekers is \"inherently undesirable.\" Detention may be psychologically damaging to an already fragile population such as those who are escaping from imprisonment and torture in their countries.

The standards, known as Performance-Based National Detention Standards 2011 (PBNDS 2011) specify the detention conditions appropriate for immigration detainees. In many cases, the standards mirror American Correctional Association standards, though some of ICE's Detention Standards provide more specificity or are unique to the needs of alien detainees.
