The discussions andagreements fall into four areas: (1) the bilateral migration talks, (2) the Partnership for Prosperity,(3) the Border Partnership Agreement, and (4) the trilateral \"Security and Prosperity Partnership(SPP) of North America.\"", "The bilateral migration talks that began in 2001 stalled following the terrorist attacks uponthe United States. President Bush first called for a temporary worker program in January 2004 andsimilar legislative proposals are pending. In May 2005, Congress passed the REAL ID Act of 2005,with provisions that strengthen border control and establish identity card standards. In lateNovember 2005 and January 2006, President Bush called for a guest worker program in the contextof enhanced border control, while Mexico called for shared responsibility approaches.

Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico have engagedregularly in a series of discussions and agreements on closely related migration and border securityissues. They launched these discussions in the context of past policies, and they have sustained thesediscussions despite less-than-expected progress in the period following the terrorist attacks upon theUnited States in 2001 and disagreements over U.S. involvement in Iraq in 2003.

In 1986,during the Reagan presidency, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986( P.L. 99-603 ). Main provisions of the act include civil and criminal penalties for U.S. employerswho knowingly hire undocumented workers; increased border control and enforcement measures;anti-discrimination safeguards; provision for legalization of illegal aliens who resided continuouslyin the United States before 1982; and a special legalization for farm workers previously employedon American farms. The act sought to combine the sanctions for employers who knowingly hireundocumented workers and tougher border control and enforcement measures to discourage futureimmigration, with the provision of amnesty or legalization for undocumented migrants who alreadyhad long-established ties to the United States. The latter provision is often characterized as an\"amnesty\" because it permitted aliens living in the United States illegally to adjust their status tolegal permanent residents (LPRs) under certain procedures and with rights to obtain citizenship inthe future. (3) ", "Immigration Reform and Welfare Reform Acts of1996. In 1996, during the Clinton presidency, Congress passed two majorimmigration reform measures to control illegal immigration and to limit the eligibility of aliens forfederal programs. One was the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of1996 (IIRIRA), Division C of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY1997 ( P.L.104-208 ). The other was the 1996 welfare law entitled the Personal Responsibility and WorkOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-193 ). The first measure sought to control illegalimmigration through increased penalties for unlawful presence in the United States and increasedimmigration enforcement. Individuals who depart the United States after more than 180 days ofunlawful presence now face either a 3- or 10-year bar to admission to the United States, dependingon the total period of unlawful presence. IIRIRA provisions also added 1,000 Border Patrol agentsper year for five years (FY1997-FY2001), along with additional personnel, equipment, andprocedures. The second measure and to some extent the first sought to reduce the attractiveness ofimmigration by restricting the eligibility of aliens for federal programs. (4) ", "Clinton-Zedillo Initiatives. In the context of theU.S. legislation outlined above, the Administration of President William Clinton (1993-2001)pursued a number of initiatives on its own and with the Administration of President Ernesto Zedillo(1994-2000) in the migration, border security, and drug control areas. The countries formalizedregular bilateral consultations between consulates and border agencies through the Border LiaisonMechanisms, and they issued a Binational Study on Migration in 1997 that found that unauthorizedmigration carries costs for both countries. They also pursued a Border Safety Campaign to reduceviolence and deaths on the border through public information campaigns, and search and rescueprograms. In mid-May 2000, following expressions of concern over private ranchers detainingMexican migrants in Arizona, the governments announced that they would prosecute any unlawfulbehavior by private citizens, combat migrant smugglers, and expand regular consultationmechanisms. In the counter-narcotics area, the countries established the High Level Contact Group(HLCG) for cabinet-level anti-drug coordination twice a year. Acting through this and othermechanisms, the countries developed a joint anti-drug strategy in early February 1998, adoptedextensive anti-money laundering measures in 2000, and facilitated the vastly expanded U.S. trainingof law enforcement and military units involved in counter-narcotics activities. (5) ", "Legal Immigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act of2000. Beginning around the year 2000, the U.S. Congress began to shift thedirection of policy from the 1996 immigration legislation. In February 2000, the AFL-CIO calledfor amnesty for established illegal immigrants in the United States, a more lenient immigrationpolicy, and universal enforcement of workers rights, and this approach was generally supported bythe Clinton Administration. While some Members attempted to pass variations of the Latino andImmigrant Fairness Act (LIFA), embodied in S. 3095 (sponsored by Senator EdwardKennedy), in the end it was the Legal Immigrant Family Equity (LIFE) Act, incorporated in H.R. 4942 , supported by Representatives Henry Bonilla and Lamar Smith and bySenator Hatch that prevailed and was signed into law ( P.L. 106-553 ). As modified, this legislationcreated and expanded visa categories for persons with pending family unification applications, andallowed certain aliens involved in class action court cases to adjust to LPR status. It also reinstateduntil April 30, 2001, Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which permittedunauthorized aliens to adjust to LPR status upon a payment of a fee if they were otherwise eligiblefor visas, without being forced to return to their native countries.
