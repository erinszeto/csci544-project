When investment subsidies are provided, there is the question of how much new investment is supported relative to how much investment is subsidized that would have occurred absent the subsidy. ", "There are also challenges associated with identifying the disaster area for the purposes of providing tax relief. In some cases, relief has been provided to a certain geographic area. In other cases, relief has been tied to a federal disaster declaration or provided only when individual assistance or individual and public assistance is provided. Narrowly defined geographic areas can limit tax benefits to those most likely to be harmed by the disaster, but can exclude some disaster victims.

Bonus depreciation and enhanced expensing were used to provide disaster tax relief to businesses following several disasters before 2010. However, at present, with bonus depreciation at 100% (100% bonus depreciation is expensing), this policy tool is not readily available. Expensing allowances are higher than they have been historically, but could, if deemed necessary and under certain circumstances, be expanded further to provide additional expensing allowances in disaster areas. For instance, this could be a policy option should bonus depreciation be set at a rate of less than 100%, or eliminated altogether. An expansion to expensing for disaster-relief purposes could be accomplished through raising the expensing limit; expensing is currently allowed for investments up to $1,040,000. ", "Expansions to net operating loss (NOL) carrybacks and lengthening of replacement periods for involuntary conversions have also been used to provide tax relief following past disasters. Under current law, there is no carryback of NOLs. Allowing an NOL carryback for disaster-related losses could provide relief for taxpayers experiencing losses who had positive tax liability in a recent tax year. Expanding the replacement period for involuntary conversions could provide more flexibility to taxpayers looking to rebuild or reestablish businesses in the disaster area. ", "Tax policy can also be used to encourage businesses to provide employment and housing following disaster events. Employee retention credits encourage employers to continue paying employees in circumstances where the disaster affects business operations. Targeted hiring credits, such as the WOTC, can be used to provide an incentive to hire workers who were displaced by a disaster. With respect to housing, tax policy has been used to encourage employers to provide housing to their employees, as well as to support more low-income housing development in disaster-affected areas. ", "Disaster recovery and rebuilding has also been supported following certain disasters by providing targeted tax benefits to disaster-impacted geographic zones. The New York Liberty Zone was established following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Gulf Opportunity Zone was established following the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. These zones can receive additional allocations of allocated tax credits, such as the NMTC or the LIHTC. Past disaster tax relief has also provided additional allocations of tax-exempt or tax-credit bonds in disaster-affected zones. Some have questioned the effectiveness of tax-exempt private activity bonds as a tool for disaster relief, noting that in the case of the GO Zone, areas with the most damage were less likely to have access to bonds to help finance recovery and rebuilding. Should special bond allocations be deployed in response to future disasters, there may be ways to improve the bond allocation process to better target small businesses or heavily impacted areas.", "Other provisions might be designed to support specific industries or sectors affected by the disaster.

To provide relief for taxpayers experiencing a loss of property, Congress has enacted legislation following certain past disasters to expand the deduction for casualty losses (beyond what is available under the permanent provision). Relief has been provided to taxpayers experiencing a loss of income by providing enhanced access to retirement plan funds or by using look-back rules for computing refundable tax credits. Several past disaster relief packages have also included provisions to support providing housing to affected individuals. ", "There are limits to using tax policy to provide disaster relief to low- and moderate-income taxpayers. Many low- and moderate-income individuals have zero individual income tax liability. For these individuals, additional exclusions from income or deductions will provide little or no relief, as there is no tax burden to eliminate. Further, low- and moderate-income individuals may have limited wealth. Tax provisions designed to enhance access to certain forms of savings (e.g., retirement accounts) also provide limited relief to the least well-off. Allowing refundable tax credits\u00e2\u0080\u0094the EITC and CTC\u00e2\u0080\u0094to be computed using the previous year's income is one form of individual disaster tax relief that is targeted at low- and moderate-income taxpayers.

These taxpayers tend to have a positive tax liability that can be offset with various forms of tax reductions. Additionally, taxpayers in higher tax brackets receive a larger tax benefit from additional deductions (a deduction of $100 is worth $35 to someone in the 35% tax bracket, but worth $12 to someone in the 12% tax bracket, for example). Empirical evidence suggests access to savings via retirement account withdrawals helped some taxpayers replace lost income or destroyed assets following Hurricane Katrina. Thus, policies that reduce penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts or otherwise enhance access to this form of savings is one option for providing relief to taxpayers that have such resources to draw on. ", "There are also timing concerns in using the tax code to provide individuals relief following a disaster. As was noted for businesses, the tax code does not lend itself to providing immediate relief. ", "Another question regarding individual disaster tax relief is whether relief should be contingent on an individual having suffered losses due to a federally declared disaster, as opposed to some other disaster event. Through 2025, the casualty loss deduction is limited to federally declared disasters. However, after 2025, individuals may be able to claim a deduction for casualty losses arising from a fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, regardless of whether the casualty was caused by an event with a federal disaster declaration. Is there something about having one's personal property destroyed in a federally declared disaster that merits special relief, different from what is provided when property is destroyed from a disaster without a federal disaster declaration? As it stands, disaster tax policy is inconsistently applied across different types of disaster events (e.g., federally declared versus non-federally declared disasters; disaster areas receiving or not receiving individual or individual and public assistance). ", "Disaster tax policy can also be designed to prevent taxpayers from facing a tax burden triggered by receipt of disaster relief. The permanent exclusions from income for disaster relief payments and insurance living expense payments clarify that these items are excluded from income for income tax purposes, and thus do not result in additional tax liability.

Is it the tax benefits that drive giving, or individuals' desire to aid those affected by the storm? Another question to consider is whether individuals shift their giving to disaster-related causes at the expense of other charitable activities (i.e., does disaster-related giving \"crowd out\" other forms of charitable giving?).

If temporary tax relief cannot be relied upon to deliver relief that is efficient and effective, one option could be to expand the set of permanent disaster-triggered tax relief provisions.
