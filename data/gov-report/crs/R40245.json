Bush signed S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-81), into law. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA) amended the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 (P.L. 104-65, as amended) to provide, among other changes to federal law and House and Senate rules, additional and more frequent disclosure of lobbying contacts and activities. This report focuses on changes made to lobbying registration, termination, and disclosure requirements and provides analysis of the volume of registration, termination, and disclosure reports filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate before and after the HLOGA's passage. This report does not analyze the content of these reports.", "Under the LDA, as amended by the HLOGA, the Clerk and the Secretary manage the collection of registration, termination, and disclosure reports made by lobbyists and lobbying firms. Prior to the HLOGA, lobbyists and lobbying firms were required to submit semi-annual reports to the Clerk and the Secretary. The HLOGA amendments to the LDA modified reporting requirements to require quarterly filing of disclosure and termination reports. These forms are available for public inspection from the Clerk's and Secretary's websites.", "The filing of registration, termination, and disclosure reports under the HLOGA amendments has continued at approximately the same pace as under the LDA. Examining data for filings between 2001 and 2007 under the LDA, and for 2008 through 2010 under the HLOGA amendments, reveals that the number of new registrations has remained mostly consistent under the HLOGA amendments. The termination reports filed by lobbyists and lobbying firms no longer representing a client have also remained constant following the implementation of the HLOGA amendments. Only disclosure reports, now filed quarterly, show a change between 2007 and 2010. Under the HLOGA amendments, the number of disclosure reports filed in the fourth quarter between 2008 and 2010 has decreased from filings between 2001 and 2007.", "For further analysis on the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act and its other provisions, including amendments to House and Senate gift rules, travel restrictions, and campaign contributions, see CRS Report RL34166, Lobbying Law and Ethics Rules Changes in the 110th Congress, by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report RL31126, Lobbying Congress: An Overview of Legal Provisions and Congressional Ethics Rules, by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report RS22566, Acceptance of Gifts by Members and Employees of the House of Representatives Under New Ethics Rules of the 110th Congress, by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report RL34377, Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007: The Role of the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate, by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report R40091, Campaign Finance: Potential Legislative and Policy Issues for the 111th Congress, by [author name scrubbed]."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Since 1946, Congress has approved, on four occasions, legislation to regulate lobbyist contacts with Members of Congress.

Overall, between 2001 and 2007 there appeared to be only a slight increase in terminations at year's end, compared with the mid-year reporting period. The difference may have existed because lobbyists and lobbying firms adjust clients and staff more at the end of congressional sessions. The difference could also be tied to the number of registrations. As more lobbyists and lobbying firms register with the Clerk and the Secretary, more termination forms may be submitted.", "Pursuant to the HLGOA amendments, termination reports were changed from semi-annual reports to quarterly reports. Figure 4 shows the quarterly termination reports filed between 2008 and 2010.", "The trend toward a greater number of year-end terminations evident under the LDA continues under the HLOGA amendments.

The number of registration terminations filed with the Clerk and the Secretary in the second quarter (an average of 1,200) and the third quarter (an average of 1,134) of between 2008 and 2010 were relatively consistent.", "The difference in terminations in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 may exist because, as previously stated, lobbyists and lobbying firms change clients and staff more frequently at the beginning and end of a Congress rather than during the sessions. Alternately, the increase in registration terminations could reflect the change in administration from a Republican to a Democratic White House.

Although this could indicate an overall increase in lobbying activity, without additional data for the period under the HLOGA amendments, a definitive conclusion cannot be made. In most years, the number of year-end reports was slightly greater than the number of mid-year reports. This may reflect an increase in lobbying activity towards the end of a congressional session when additional efforts might be needed to ensure the passage of important legislation.

Data for 2008 and 2010 represent the end of a Congress. It is possible that the number of disclosures filed in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2010 was a result of decreased lobbying activity.

For termination, overall trends also continue, with an increase in terminations in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. Since the first quarter of 2009, the number of terminations has stabilized and roughly mirrors the 2008 numbers. Overall, while terminations in 2008 and 2009 are greater than anytime between 2001 and 2007, the pattern of increased terminations in congressional election years, followed by a slight decline the following year, continues.", "The most significant change in reporting occurred for the filing of disclosure statements. Instead of filing two reports per year on lobbying activity, lobbyists, and lobbying firms are required to report four times per year. Collecting the data in quarters instead of semi-annual periods appears to have uncovered a reporting trend that was otherwise obscured under the semi-annual system. For 2008 and 2010, the data shows an overall decline in disclosure reports for the fourth quarter. The data suggest that lobbyists and lobbying firms make more contacts and engage in a greater percentage of their lobbying activity in the first three quarters of the year than at the end of a congressional session. The year-end report data from 2001 to 2007, which included both third and fourth quarter activity, may have been motivated by third quarter activity that was previously included in year end reports. It is possible, however, that the 2008 and 2010 upticks in reporting reflect the transition to a new presidential administration coupled with the beginning of a new Congress.", "For 2009, the volume of disclosure reports does not easily fit with the volume of reports for 2008 and 2009. Fourth quarter lobbying activity, as shown by the number of disclosure reports continues at a high level. This may reflect the continuation of Congress's legislative agenda from the first to the second session. In the 111 th Congress, many issues that were initiated during the first session continued through an after-Thanksgiving session and into the second session.
