Over the past four years, according to DLA's website, over $2.2 billion of property was reutilized. ", "DLA Disposition Services provides support at major U.S. military installations worldwide. Headquartered in Battle Creek, MI, the DLA Disposition Services personnel serve in 16 foreign countries (including the Middle East and Southwestern Asia), 2 U.S. territories (Guam and Puerto Rico), and 41 states. DLA Disposition Services are provided in field offices in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait with teams deploying out to forward operating bases to assist combat units. With over 90 field offices, DLA Disposition Services employs about 1,500 people. ", "The Reutilization/Transfer/Donation Program establishes a process for inventory considered no longer needed by the Department of Defense (DOD) to be redistributed among various groups. Property disposal means redistributing, transferring, donating, selling, demilitarizing, destroying, or other \"end of life cycle\" activities. Disposal is the final stage before the property leaves DOD's control. In some cases, the act of demilitarization\u2014destroying the item's military offensive and defensive capability\u2014accomplishes the intent of disposal.
