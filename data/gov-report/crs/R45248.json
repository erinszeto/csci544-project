In all of the previous instances in which the CRA was used to overturn agency actions, the disapproved actions were regulations that had been adopted through APA rulemaking processes.

If a rule is disapproved, the status quo that was in place prior to the issuance of the rule would be reinstated.", "In addition, when a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, the CRA provides that a rule may not be issued in \"substantially the same form\" as the disapproved rule unless it is specifically authorized by a subsequent law. The CRA does not define what would constitute a rule that is \"substantially the same\" as a nullified rule. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Agency Actions Covered by the CRA", "paragraphs": ["The CRA governs \"rules\" promulgated by a \"federal agency,\" using the definition of \"agency\" provided in the APA. That APA definition broadly defines an agency as \"each authority of the Government of the United States, ... but does not include ... Congress; ... the courts of the United States; ... courts martial and military commissions.\" Accordingly, the CRA generally covers rules issued by most executive branch entities. In the context of the APA, however, courts have held that this definition excludes actions of the President. ", "The more difficult interpretive issue is what types of agency actions should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA. The CRA adopts a broad definition of the word \"rule\" from the APA, but then creates three exceptions to that definition. This APA definition of \"rule\" encompasses a wide range of agency action, including certain agency statements that are not subject to the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements outlined elsewhere in the APA:", "\"[R]ule\" means the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency and includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates, wages, corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof, prices, facilities, appliances, services or allowances therefor or of valuations, costs, or accounting, or practices bearing on any of the foregoing[.]", "The CRA narrows this definition by providing that the term \"rule\" does not include", "(A) any rule of particular applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing;", "(B) any rule relating to agency management or personnel; or", "(C) any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.", "Determining whether any particular agency action is a rule subject to the CRA therefore entails a two-part inquiry: first, asking whether the statement qualifies as a rule under the APA definition and, second, asking whether the statement falls within any of the exceptions noted above to the CRA's definition of rule. These two steps are illustrated below in Figure 1 . ", "This section of the report walks through the two elements of this inquiry in more detail. First, while the APA's definition of \"rule\" is expansive, courts have held that \"Congress did not intend that the ... definition ... be construed so broadly that every agency action\" should be encompassed under this provision. As a preliminary matter, courts have distinguished agency rulemaking actions from adjudicatory and investigatory functions. And under the statutory text, to qualify as a rule, an agency statement must meet three requirements: it must be \"of general ... applicability,\" have \"future effect,\" and be \"designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\" Second, even if an agency statement does qualify as an APA \"rule,\" the CRA expressly exempts three categories of rules from its provisions: rules \"of particular applicability,\" rules \"relating to agency management or personnel,\" and \"any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.\" Both inquiries are heavily fact specific, and require looking beyond a document's label to the substance of the agency's action. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Determining Whether an Agency Action Is an APA Rule", "paragraphs": ["The CRA defines the word \"rule\" by incorporating in part the APA's definition of that term. Although there is very little case law interpreting the meaning of \"rule\" under the CRA, cases interpreting the APA's definition of \"rule\" may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the CRA because the CRA explicitly relies on that provision as the basis for its own definition of the term \"rule.\" The APA provides a general framework governing most agency action\u2014not only agency rulemaking, but also administrative adjudications. The APA accordingly distinguishes different types of agency actions, separating rules from orders and investigatory acts. These distinctions may also be relevant when deciding whether an agency action is a rule subject to the CRA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Differentiating \"Rules,\" \"Orders,\" and \"Investigative Acts\" under the APA", "paragraphs": ["The APA distinguishes a \"rule\" from an \"order,\" defining an \"order\" as \"the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency in a matter other than rule making but including licensing.\" Orders are the product of agency adjudication, in contrast to rules, which result from rulemaking. To determine whether an agency action is a rule or an order in the context of the APA, courts look beyond the document's label to the substance of the action. One federal court of appeals described the distinction between rulemaking and adjudication as follows: ", "First, adjudications resolve disputes among specific individuals in specific cases, whereas rulemaking affects the rights of broad classes of unspecified individuals.... Second, because adjudications involve concrete disputes, they have an immediate effect on specific individuals (those involved in the dispute). Rulemaking, in contrast, is prospective, and has a definitive effect on individuals only after the rule subsequently is applied.", "Courts have also distinguished rules from agency investigations. A separate provision of the APA addresses an agency's authority to compel the submission of information and perform \"investigative act[s] or demand[s].\" When agencies conduct investigative actions such as requiring regulated parties to submit informational reports, courts have held that they are not subject to the APA's rulemaking requirements. However, courts have also noted that some actions related to investigations may qualify as rules. For instance, in one case, a federal court of appeals observed that the procedures governing an agency's decision to investigate \"are separate from and precede the agency's ultimate act,\" concluding that the procedures at issue constituted a rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Rules\" under the APA", "paragraphs": ["An agency statement will qualify as a \"rule\" under the APA definition if it (1) is \"of general or particular applicability,\" (2) has \"future effect,\" and (3) is \"designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\" With regard to the first requirement, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) has noted, most agency statements will be \"of general or particular applicability\" and will fulfill this condition. ", "The second requirement\u2014that a rule be \"of ... future effect\" \u2014is the subject of some ambiguity. Courts have largely agreed that this requirement is likely intended to distinguish agency rulemaking from agency adjudication. Courts often differentiate rules and orders by noting that orders are retrospective, while rules have \"future effect.\" Rules operate prospectively, in the sense that they are intended to \"inform the future conduct\" of those subject to the rules. ", "Additionally, courts have sometimes said that the \"future effect\" requirement excludes any agency statements that do not \"bind the agency.\" Thus, for example, in a concurring opinion in a 1988 Supreme Court case, Justice Scalia suggested that the \"future effect\" requirement must be read to mean \"that rules have legal consequences only for the future.\" He argued that the only way to distinguish rules from orders\u2014which can have both future and past legal consequences\u2014was to define rules as having only prospective operation. Judge Silberman of the D.C. Circuit, concurring in an opinion from that court, drew on Justice Scalia's interpretation of this requirement to argue that it would be unreasonable to conclude that every single agency statement with future effect is a rule under the APA. Instead, he argued that only agency statements that \"seek to authoritatively answer an underlying policy or legal issue\" should be considered rules. ", "These opinions raise several unanswered questions, which could suggest some hesitation before reading the phrase \"future effect\" in the APA definition of a rule to mean \"binding.\" First, these cases do not fully explain what it means for an agency statement to be binding or address the case law suggesting that the term \"future effect\" merely pertains to the prospective nature of the statement. Second, and perhaps more critical, this case law reading \"future effect\" to mean that APA \"rules\" must bind the agency does not explain how to distinguish this requirement from the separate inquiry into whether an agency action is subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. As discussed in more detail below, some (but not all) APA \"rules\" must go through procedures commonly known as notice-and-comment rulemaking. To distinguish so-called \"legislative\" rules that are subject to notice-and-comment procedures from \"interpretive\" rules, which are not, courts generally ask whether the rule has \"the force of law\" \u2014or stated another way, whether the rule is \"legally binding.\" Arguably, then, this \"legal effect\" test for notice-and-comment rulemaking may be equivalent to asking whether a rule binds an agency. However, the \"future effect\" inquiry tests whether an agency action is a \"rule\" under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7551(4), and the \"legal effect\" inquiry tests whether such a rule is subject to the notice-and-comment procedures outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7553. Because the tests are tied to two distinct statutory provisions, they arguably should not both turn on whether a rule is legally binding. This is especially true where courts have generally held that interpretive rules may not be subject to notice-and-comment but are nonetheless \"rules\" within the meaning of the APA. The fact that Congress expressly exempted \"interpretative rules\" from the rulemaking procedures applicable to \"rules\" may itself suggest that such agency actions are rules\u2014otherwise, the exemption would be unnecessary.", "The third requirement for an agency action to be considered an APA rule is that it must be \"designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\" The D.C. Circuit has held that agency documents that merely state an \"established interpretation\" and \"tread no new ground\" do not \"implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy\" and therefore are not rules. Similarly, an agency statement is not a rule if it \"does not change any law or official policy presently in effect.\" Thus, courts have concluded that \"educational\" documents that merely \"reprint[]\" or \"restate\" existing law are not rules under the APA. The D.C. Circuit has also held that an agency's budget request is not a rule. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking and Guidance Documents", "paragraphs": ["The APA outlines specific rulemaking procedures that agencies must follow when they formulate, amend, or repeal a rule. The APA generally requires publication in the Federal Register and institutes procedural requirements that are often referred to as notice-and-comment rulemaking. Under notice-and-comment rulemaking, agencies must notify the public of a proposed rule and then provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment on that rule. However, not all agency acts that qualify as \"rules\" under the APA definition are required to comply with the APA's rulemaking procedures. In particular, the APA provides that notice and comment is not required for \"interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\" Additionally, the APA's rulemaking procedures do not, in relevant part, apply to \"matter[s] relating to agency management or personnel.\" Therefore, agency statements such as guidance documents or procedural rules may not be required to undergo notice-and-comment rulemaking, but may still be APA \"rules.\" ", "Courts frequently hold that agency's guidance documents are exempt from APA notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements because those documents are properly classified either as interpretative rules or as general policy statements. Interpretive rules merely explain or clarify preexisting legal obligations without themselves \"purport[ing] to impose new obligations or prohibitions,\" while general policy statements simply describe how an agency \"will exercise its broad enforcement discretion\" without binding the agency. But as mentioned above, the critical factor distinguishing both interpretive rules and general policy statements from \"legislative\" rules that must be promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures is \"whether the agency action binds private parties or the agency itself with the 'force of law,'\" or whether the rule \"has legal effect.\" General policy statements ordinarily are not legally binding, and accordingly are not \"substantive\" rules required to undergo notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. ", "It should be noted that some cases from the D.C. Circuit have suggested that general policy statements are not \"rules\" at all under the APA definition. For example, in one case, the D.C. Circuit said that the \"primary distinction between a substantive rule\u2014really any rule\u2014and a general statement of policy, then, turns on whether an agency intends to bind itself to a particular legal position.\" As discussed above, courts have also sometimes held that where an agency statement does not \"bind\" an agency, it has no \"future effect\" and therefore cannot qualify as an APA \"rule.\" This \"binding effect\" requirement has clear parallels to these cases holding that general policy statements are not rules because they do not bind the agency. However, these latter decisions do not explicitly ground this characterization of general policy statements in the text of the APA requiring rules to have \"future effect.\" Accordingly, it is not clear how these two inquiries interrelate. Other cases have characterized general policy statements as APA rules, notwithstanding the fact that such a statement may not be legally binding in a future administrative proceeding. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CRA Incorporation of APA Definition of \"Rule\"", "paragraphs": ["The CRA incorporates the APA definition of \"rule\" by reference, and, consequently, should likely be read to incorporate judicial constructions of that definition. Thus, for example, although the CRA does not itself reference agency \"orders,\" some courts have nonetheless imported the APA's distinction between rules and orders when interpreting the CRA. Accordingly, if an agency acts through an order or investigatory act, rather than a rule, the requirements of the CRA likely will not apply. ", "In recent years, some commentators have discussed using the CRA to revoke agencies' guidance documents, raising the question of which guidance documents qualify as CRA \"rules.\" As a preliminary matter, it is important to note that \"guidance document\" is not a defined term under either the CRA or the APA. Even if an agency has characterized a statement as a guidance document rather than a rule, it still may qualify as a \"rule\" under the CRA. Instead, the relevant question is whether any agency statement labeled as guidance\u2014which could include, for example, actions such as memoranda, letters, or agency bulletins\u2014falls within the statutory definition of \"rule\" and, if so, whether it is nonetheless exempt from the CRA under any of the exceptions to that definition.", "As discussed above, agency statements labeled as guidance are frequently exempt from the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures because they fall within the exceptions for interpretive rules or general policy statements. However, while the CRA adopts the APA's definition of rule, the CRA's exceptions to that definition are not identical to the APA's exemptions from its notice-and-comment procedures. Notably, the CRA does not exclude from its definition of rule either general policy statements or interpretative rules. Instead, the category of agency \"rules\" subject to the requirements of the CRA appears to encompass most \"rules\" that must go through the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, along with some that do not. Consequently, agency guidance documents that are exempt from the APA's notice-and-comment procedural requirements may nonetheless be subject to the CRA, if they do not fall within one of the CRA's exceptions. But the effect of a disapproval resolution in such a case may be limited because such guidance documents generally lack legal effect in the first place.", "The post-enactment legislative history of the CRA indicates that the CRA was intended to encompass some agency statements that would not be subject to the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements. Following the enactment of the CRA in 1996, the law's sponsors inserted into the Congressional Record a statement in which they asserted that the law would cover a wide swath of agency actions: ", "The committees intend this chapter to be interpreted broadly with regard to the type and scope of rules that are subject to congressional review. The term \"rule\" in subsection 804(3) begins with the definition of a \"rule\" in subsection 551(4) and excludes three subsets of rules that are modeled on APA sections 551 and 553. This definition of a rule does not turn on whether a given agency must normally comply with the notice-and-comment provisions of the APA.... The definition of \"rule\" in subsection 551(4) covers a wide spectrum of activities. ", "This statement suggests that Congress intended the CRA to reach a broad range of agency activities, including agency policy statements, interpretive rules, and certain rules of agency organization, despite the fact that those actions are not subject to the APA's requirements for notice and comment.", "However, as discussed above, there is some ambiguity regarding whether certain non-binding statements are rules at all. If general policy statements or other non-binding agency actions are not \"rules\" under the APA definition, then arguably, they are not rules under the CRA. But importantly, GAO has concluded that general policy statements should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA. As discussed in more detail below, GAO's resolution of this issue may stand as the last word on the matter, given the role that GAO has come to play in advising Congress on which agency actions are subject to the CRA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CRA Exceptions", "paragraphs": ["Even if an agency action is a \"rule\" within the APA definition, it will not be subject to the CRA if it falls within one of the three exceptions to the CRA's definition of a \"rule.\" The CRA incorporates the APA definition of rule, but exempts from that definition any rules \"of particular applicability,\" rules \"relating to agency management or personnel,\" and \"any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.\" Some of these exemptions track language in the APA, and accordingly, cases interpreting those APA provisions may be useful to interpret the CRA exceptions. Additionally, the CRA does not \"apply to rules that concern monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\"", "The CRA also contains a partial exception for rules where an agency has, \"for good cause,\" dispensed with notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, as well as for rules related to \"a regulatory program for a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity related to hunting, fishing, or camping .\" However, this section does not exempt rules from the CRA procedures entirely; it merely allows the agency to determine when the rule shall take effect, notwithstanding the CRA's requirements.

Although the decision applied to a specific geographic area, it would, in the view of GAO, nonetheless \"have significant economic and environmental impact throughout several major watersheds in the nation's largest state.\"", "The CRA gives examples of some types of rules of particular applicability by specifying that this exemption includes any \"rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing.\" Moreover, the post-enactment statement for the record written by the CRA's sponsors maintained that \"IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service letter rulings are classic examples of rules of particular applicability.\" Under the APA, courts have also held, for example, that agency actions designating specific sites as covered by environmental laws are rules of \"particular applicability.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rules Relating to Agency Management or Personnel", "paragraphs": ["The second CRA exemption excludes \"any rule relating to agency management or personnel.\" The APA contains a similar exemption from its general rulemaking requirements.

", "Notwithstanding the general presumption of courts that where Congress adopts language from another statute, it also intends to incorporate any settled judicial interpretations of that same language, it is unclear whether this substantial-effect requirement developed by courts in the context of the APA should be read into the CRA. The CRA's second exemption, for \"any rule relating to agency management or personnel,\" does not expressly mention a rule's effect on third parties. By contrast, the CRA's third exemption does. This distinction in language could be read to mean that Congress intentionally chose to create a substantial-effect requirement for the third exception while omitting this limitation from the second one, so that the CRA's second exception excludes \"any rule relating to agency management or personnel\" regardless of its impact on third parties. On this view, this difference in phrasing would displace the ordinary presumption that Congress incorporates case law interpreting similar statutory provisions. This interpretation of the second exemption could mean that the CRA's exception for rules relating to agency management or personnel may be interpreted more broadly than the APA exception.

Unlike the CRA, the APA does not explicitly limit this exception to those rules that do not \"substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.\" Nonetheless, because courts have read such a limitation into the APA exemption, the case law defining this requirement may be relevant to determine the scope of this CRA exemption. ", "However, in the cases interpreting this parallel APA exclusion, the impact of a rule on a third party is not the only factor courts use to distinguish between substantive rules, which are required to go through notice-and-comment procedures, and procedural rules, which are not. Instead, courts have engaged in two kinds of inquiries. The first is the \"substantial impact test,\" which asks whether the agency action substantially impacts the regulated industry. However, the D.C. Circuit has noted that even rules best characterized as procedural measures may have a significant effect on regulated parties, and, accordingly, has held that \"a rule with a 'substantial impact' upon the persons subject to it is not necessarily a substantive rule.\" Consequently, the D.C. Circuit has also asked whether the rule \"encodes a substantive value judgment.\"", "Nonetheless, because the text of the CRA expressly excludes rules \"of agency organization, procedure, or practice\" that do not \"substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties,\" the CRA appears to mandate the use of something akin to the substantial impact test to determine whether a rule falls within this exception. In fact, one of the sponsors of the CRA emphasized prior to its passage that to determine whether a rule should be excluded under this provision, \"the focus ... is not on the type of rule but on its effect on the rights or obligations of nonagency parties.\" He went on to say that the exclusion covered only rules \"with a truly minor, incidental effect on nonagency parties.\" GAO has sometimes drawn on the APA case law described above in its own opinions analyzing whether various actions fall within the purview of the CRA. However, because the substantial-impact test and the substantive-value-judgment test were developed in the context of the APA to test whether rules \"implicate the policy interests animating notice-and-comment rulemaking,\" these judicially created tests might not be directly applicable to determine whether an agency statement is subject to the CRA."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "CRA Requirement for Submission of Rules", "paragraphs": ["The CRA requires that agencies submit actions that fall within the CRA's definition of a rule to both houses of Congress and to GAO before the actions may take effect.

The agency is also required to submit additional information pertaining to any cost-benefit analysis the agency conducted, along with information on the agency's actions resulting from other regulatory impact analysis requirements, including the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. For major rules, after receiving this information, GAO is then required to assess the agency's compliance with these additional informational requirements and include its assessment in the major rule report.

In FY1999 appropriations legislation, Congress required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide agencies with a standard form to use to meet this reporting requirement.

Thus, submission of rules to Congress under the CRA is critical because the receipt of the rule in Congress triggers the CRA's expedited procedures for introduction and consideration of a joint resolution disapproving the rule.

At a hearing on the CRA in 1997, one year after its enactment, witnesses noted that agencies were not in full compliance with the submission requirement. It was also noted at the hearing, however, that it appeared agencies were seeking \"in good faith\" to comply with the statute. At a hearing in 1998 on implementation of the CRA, GAO's general counsel testified that agencies were often not sending their rules to GAO or Congress.", "Also in 1998, to further improve agency compliance with the CRA, Congress required OMB to issue guidance on certain provisions of the CRA, specifically including the submission requirement in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7801(a)(1). To meet this requirement, then-OMB Director Jacob J. Lew issued a memorandum for agencies in March 1999. The Lew memorandum provided information such as where agencies should send their rules in the House and Senate, including the addresses of the Office of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, the offices in each chamber that receive the rules; what information the agencies should include with the rule; and an explanation of what types of rules are required to be submitted.", "Because agencies were initially inconsistent about fulfilling the submission requirement, GAO began to monitor agencies' compliance with the submission requirement by comparing the final rules that were published in the Federal Register with rules that were submitted to GAO. This was not a role that was required under the CRA; rather, GAO conducted these reviews voluntarily. As then-GAO general counsel Robert Murphy testified in 1998, GAO ", "conducted a review to determine whether all final rules covered by the Congressional Review Act and published in the Register were filed with the Congress and the GAO. We performed this review both to verify the accuracy of our own data base and to ascertain the degree of agency compliance with the statute. We were concerned that regulated entities may have been led to believe that rules published in the Federal Register were effective, when, in fact, they were not unless filed in accordance with the statute. ", "After its review of agency compliance with the submission requirement, in November 1997, GAO submitted to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) a list of the rules that had been published in the Federal Register but had not been submitted to GAO. According to GAO, OIRA distributed this list to affected agencies; GAO then followed up again with the agencies that had rules that remained un-submitted in February 1998. GAO stated in its March 1998 testimony that \"In our view, OIRA should have played a more proactive role in assuring that the agencies were both aware of the statutory filing requirements and were complying with them.\"", "GAO continued to conduct similar reviews regularly, comparing the list of rules that agencies submitted to GAO against rules that were published in the Federal Register . Until 2012, GAO periodically sent letters to OIRA regarding rules that it had not received. In March 2012, GAO notified OIRA that, due to constraints on its resources, it would no longer be sending lists of rules not received. Instead, GAO decided to continue to track only major rules not received, not all final rules, as they had previously done. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Submission of Notice-and-Comment Rules vs. Other Types of Documents", "paragraphs": ["In general, although there have been exceptions noted by GAO, agencies appear to be fairly comprehensive in submitting rules to Congress and GAO when those rules have been promulgated through an APA rulemaking process. GAO's federal rules database lists thousands of such rules each year. In the case of rules that are not subject to notice-and-comment procedures, however, agencies often do not fulfill the submission requirement, and tracking compliance for these types of agency actions is more difficult. ", "Although GAO has voluntarily tracked agency compliance with the submission requirement, its methodology for doing so did not result in a complete list of agency actions that should have been submitted. GAO's point of reference was to compare regulations that were published in the Federal Register against regulations it received pursuant to the CRA. Most rules that are required to be published in the Federal Register are indeed subject to the CRA, making this a potentially helpful method of identifying rules that were not submitted. However, many of the other agency actions that are not subject to notice-and-comment requirements are not generally published in the Federal Registe r and are also not submitted to GAO. Therefore, using this method, many rules that should have been submitted likely were undetected by GAO and thus not included in the lists of un-submitted rules it sent to OIRA and to the agencies. It is precisely this issue that led to Members requesting GAO's opinion on individual agency actions that were of specific interest to them and were not submitted to Congress (nor, in most cases, published in the Federal Register ). ", "The higher incidence of noncompliance with the CRA's submission requirement for agency actions that were conducted outside the notice-and-comment rulemaking process is likely due in large part to the practical difficulty of submitting the substantial number of agency statements that qualify as rules under the CRA. The CRA's submission requirement could potentially include a wide variety of items such as FAQs posted on agency websites, press releases, bulletins, information memoranda, and statements made by agency officials. In congressional testimony in 1997, one administrative law scholar argued that agencies \"annually take tens of thousands of actions\" that would fall under the CRA's definition of rule, and that ", "Were agencies to comply fully with [the CRA's] requirement that all these matters be filed with Congress as a condition of their effectiveness (as it appears, thus far, they are not doing), Congress and the GAO would be swamped with filings. Burying Congress in paper might even seem a useful means of diverting attention from larger, controversial matters; haystacks can be useful for concealing needles. No one believes many, if any, of these rules will be the subjects of resolutions of disapproval. Yet for them even simple accompanying documents to permit data analysis and tracking, such as GAO has been proposing, would impose significant aggregate costs, well beyond their possible benefit.", "In addition, it seems possible that many agencies are unaware of the breadth of the CRA's coverage. Reading through various agencies' responses to the GAO opinions discussed below suggests that many agencies appear to be aware that notice-and-comment rules are generally covered by the CRA, but they may be unaware that many other types of actions are covered. For example, in an opinion it issued in 2012 regarding an action taken by the Department of Health and Human Services, GAO stated that \"We requested the views of the General Counsel of HHS on whether the July 12 Information Memorandum is a rule for purposes of the CRA by letter dated August 3, 2012. HHS responded on August 31, 2012, stating that the Information Memorandum was issued as a non-binding guidance document, and that HHS contends that guidance documents do not need to be submitted pursuant to the CRA.\" GAO concluded, however, \"We cannot agree with HHS's conclusion that guidance documents are not rules for the purposes of the CRA and HHS cites no support for this position.\" "], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "GAO's Role in Determining Whether an Agency Action is Covered by the CRA", "paragraphs": ["Because submission of rules is key to Congress's ability to use the CRA, if an agency does not submit a rule to Congress, this could potentially frustrate Congress's ability to review rules under the act. To avoid Congress being denied its opportunity for review of rules in this way, however, the Senate appears to have developed a practice that allows it to employ the CRA's review mechanism even when an agency does not submit a rule for review. That practice has involved seeking an opinion from GAO on whether an agency action should have been submitted under the CRA (i.e., whether the action is covered by the CRA's definition of \"rule\").", "In several instances since the enactment of the CRA in 1996, Members of Congress sought an opinion from GAO as to whether certain agency actions were covered by the CRA, despite the agency not having undertaken notice-and-comment rulemaking or having submitted the action to Congress. GAO has issued 21 opinions of this type as of March 5, 2019. In many of these opinions, GAO has defined the term \"rule\" as used in the CRA expansively. In 11 of the 21 opinions, GAO opined that the agency statement in question was a rule under the CRA that should have been submitted to the House and Senate for review. These opinions are summarized below in this report and are listed in a table in Appendix B .", "In recent years, the Senate has considered publication in the Congressional Record of a GAO opinion classifying an agency action as a rule as the trigger date for the initiation period to submit a disapproval resolution and for the action period during which such a joint resolution qualifies for expedited consideration in the Senate. Thus, the question of whether Congress may use the CRA's expedited parliamentary disapproval mechanism generally hinges upon the nature of GAO's opinion in such cases. By allowing the GAO opinion to serve as a substitute for the actual submission of a rule, the Senate can still avail itself of the CRA's expedited procedures to overturn rules. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Origin of GAO's Role", "paragraphs": ["In responding to these requests from Members for opinions on whether certain agency actions are covered, GAO has played an important role in determining the applicability of the CRA, although the specific role that GAO has played in this regard is not explicitly outlined in the statute. But a review of the history of the early implementation of the CRA, and a consideration of GAO's other activities under the CRA, suggests that the role GAO currently plays with regard to determining whether a specific agency action is a \"rule\" is linked to other activities GAO has engaged in regarding the CRA.", "As has been noted, GAO's primary statutory requirement under the CRA is to provide a report to the committees of jurisdiction on each major rule, and to include in the report information about the agency's compliance with various steps of the rulemaking process for each major rule. ", "For non-major rules, soon after the CRA was enacted, GAO voluntarily created an online database of rules submitted to it under the CRA, suggesting that it was willing to go beyond what was required of it by the statute to facilitate implementation. As GAO's general counsel explained in congressional testimony in 1998, \"Although the law is silent as to GAO's role relating to the nonmajor rules, we believe that basic information about the rules should be collected in a manner that can be of use to Congress and the public. To do this, we have established a database that gathers basic information about the 15-20 rules we receive on the average each day.\" The database can be used to search for rules by elements such as the title, issuing agency, date of publication, type of rule (major or non-major), and effective date. The website also contains links to each of GAO's major rule reports. ", "Perhaps most notably, however, GAO's determination of whether agency actions are considered \"rules\" under the CRA appears to be closely linked to its monitoring of agency compliance with the submission requirement as discussed above. The question of whether an agency action is a rule under the CRA is also a question of whether it should be submitted; arguably, then, GAO is addressing a very similar question in its opinions on whether certain agency actions are covered as it was in its initial reports to OIRA on agency compliance with the submission requirement. ", "A discussion of GAO's role in a congressional hearing on the Tongass Land Management Plan in 1997 provides some evidence of the voluntary and, initially, ad hoc nature of GAO's role in this regard. One of the issues that was addressed at the hearing was whether the plan should be considered a rule under the CRA; GAO's general counsel was invited to testify at the hearing. Six days before the hearing, GAO issued its second opinion on the applicability of the CRA, in which it stated that the Tongass Land Management Plan should have been submitted as a rule under the CRA. Former Senator Larry Craig, who had requested the opinion, asked GAO's general counsel at the hearing about GAO's role: ", "It is our understanding of your testimony and our own reading of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that the General Accounting Office has been given the role of advising Congress and perhaps agencies on whether their policy decisions constitute rules. It is our understanding that the GAO's independent opinion is generally given considerable weight by the agencies. Is this also the GAO's understanding of its role?", "In response, GAO's general counsel, Robert Murphy, stated that the CRA", "does not provide any identification of who is to decide what a rule is, unlike the issue of whether a rule is a major rule or not, which, as [OIRA Administrator] Ms. Katzen pointed out, has been assigned to her. So in that sense, I cannot say that GAO has a special role under the statute for making that determination. The decision, the opinion, that we issued last week on the question [of whether the Tongass Land Management Plan was a rule under the CRA] was done in our role as adviser to the Congress in response to the request of three chairmen of congressional committees.", "Thus, GAO acknowledged that its opinion was provided not pursuant to any specific provision of the statute, but in a more general, advisory capacity. In the years following, Members continued to request GAO opinions advising Congress on the matter of whether an agency action should have been submitted.

In 2008, GAO issued an opinion stating that a letter from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to state health officials concerning the State Children's Health Insurance Program was a rule for the purposes of the CRA; in response, Senator John D. Rockefeller introduced S.J.Res. 44 to disapprove the guidance provided in the letter. According to a press release from the Committee on Finance at the time, however, the committee did not take further action on the resolution of disapproval because it had missed the window during which the action would have been required to be taken under the CRA to use its expedited procedures.", "The first time either chamber took action on a resolution of disapproval introduced following a GAO opinion was in 2012, when the House passed H.J.Res. 118 (112 th Congress), a resolution of disapproval that would have overturned an information memorandum issued by the Department of Health and Human Services relating to the implementation of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The first time the Senate took action on such a resolution of disapproval was on April 18, 2018, when it passed S.J.Res. 57 , overturning guidance from the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) pertaining to indirect auto lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The House passed S.J.Res. 57 on May 8, 2018, and the President signed it into law on May 21, 2018."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Consequences of GAO Opinions", "paragraphs": ["Standing alone, a GAO opinion deciding whether an agency action is a \"rule\" covered by the CRA does not have legal effect. As discussed, GAO's role in determining whether actions are subject to the CRA is not provided for in the CRA, and its opinions are, in essence, advisory. The opinions do not have any immediate effect other than advising Congress as to whether GAO considers an agency action to meet the definition of \"rule\" under the CRA. ", "As a matter of course, however, it appears that the Senate has chosen to treat the GAO opinions as dispositive on the issue. In several cases, individual Senators have stated that once a GAO opinion determining that an agency action is a rule is published in the Congressional Record , the time periods under the CRA commence and the agency action in question becomes subject to the CRA disapproval mechanism. The enactment in May 2018 of a joint resolution of disapproval that was introduced following a GAO opinion regarding a 2013 CFPB bulletin that had not been submitted by the agency further indicates that Congress, in at least some cases, is willing to consider the GAO opinion as a substitute for the agency's submission of a rule to Congress. GAO described this practice in November 2018 in one of its opinions relating to the applicability of the CRA: \"Congress has opted to treat the receipt of a GAO opinion concluding that an agency action is a rule as triggering the statutory provisions that otherwise would have been triggered by the agency's submission. Thus, Congress has used GAO opinions to cure the impediment created by the agency's failure to submit the rule, protecting its review and oversight authorities.\"", "In sum, GAO opinions facilitate congressional review of rules that were not\u2014but should have been\u2014submitted under the CRA. ", "A CRA provision barring judicial review makes it unlikely that a GAO opinion or any other congressional determination stating that a rule is subject to the CRA would be subject to challenge in court. This provision states that \"[n]o determination, finding, action, or omission under this chapter shall be subject to judicial review.\" Accordingly, most courts have refused to review any claims arguing that an agency action should have been submitted to Congress as a rule under the CRA. As a result, the question of whether an agency action is subject to the CRA and its fast-track procedures will likely be settled in the political arena rather than in the courts, and, if Congress continues to treat GAO opinions as determinative, those opinions likely will be the final word on the issue. ", "The provision barring judicial review may mean that one other critical aspect of the CRA may be addressed outside of the courts and through GAO opinions: whether a rule has taken effect. As discussed previously, the CRA states that agencies must submit covered rules to Congress and the Comptroller General \"before a rule can take effect,\" suggesting that a rule may not become operative until the report required by the CRA is submitted to Congress. Indeed, the post-enactment statement inserted into the Congressional Record by the CRA's sponsors stated that, barring two exceptions listed in the CRA, \"any covered rule not submitted to Congress and the Comptroller General will \u2026 not [take] effect until it is submitted pursuant to subsection 801(a)(1)(A).\" However, courts have refused to adjudicate claims arguing that various rules are not in effect because an agency has failed to submit the rules to Congress. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a court would be willing to enforce this provision and declare that a rule lacks effect because it was not submitted to Congress. ", "If an agency has not submitted a disputed action to Congress, it is possible that this inaction was the result of the agency's view that the rule was not subject to the CRA. A GAO opinion stating that an agency action does constitute a rule, while not itself rendering a rule ineffective, may be the first indication to the agency that the rule did not \"take effect\" because the agency did not fulfill the CRA submission requirement. But in the context of agency rules that inherently lack legal effect, the determination that they lack \"effect\" under the CRA may not have much practical impact. In the context of rulemaking, to \"take effect\" usually means that something has become legally effective. As noted, however, the CRA encompasses some non-legislative rules that inherently lack legal effect. The fact that the CRA requires agencies to submit some agency statements that lack legal effect suggests that the term \"effect,\" as used in the CRA's submission requirement, means something other than legal effect. While reviewing notice-and-comment rulemakings, some courts have held that the CRA suspends a rule's operation notwithstanding the fact that a rule may technically have become effective. With respect to rules such as general policy statements that generally lack legal force, however, even if an agency failed to comply with the CRA's submission requirement and erroneously regarded the rule as being operative, it is less likely that the operation of the statement had a discernible and independent effect on the agency's actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of GAO Opinions", "paragraphs": ["This section briefly summarizes each of the 21 GAO opinions to date on whether certain agency actions were rules and, thus, eligible for disapproval under the CRA.

GAO based this decision on a 1989 D.C. Circuit case, DKT Memorial Fund v. Agency for International Development , which held that agency actions implementing the decision of President Ronald Reagan to establish the Mexico City Policy were not reviewable under the APA. The court held that the disputed decision involved \"not a rulemaking by an agency, but rather a policy-making at the highest level by the executive branch,\" concluding that it did not have authority under the APA \"to review the wisdom of policy decisions of the President\" where the relevant statute granted the President broad discretion in the area of foreign affairs.
