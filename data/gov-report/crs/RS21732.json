{"id": "RS21732", "title": "Federal Taxation of Aliens Working in the United States", "released_date": "2012-05-18T00:00:00", "summary": ["A question that often arises is whether unauthorized aliens and other foreign nationals working in the United States are subject to U.S. taxes. The federal tax consequences for these individuals are dependent on (a) whether an individual is classified as a resident or nonresident alien and (b) whether a tax treaty or totalization agreement exists between the United States and the individual's home country.", "In general, an individual is a resident alien if he or she is a lawful permanent U.S. resident or is in the United States for a substantial period of time during the current and past two years (the \"substantial presence\" test). Otherwise, he or she will typically be classified as a nonresident alien. Resident aliens are generally taxed in the same manner as U.S. citizens. Nonresident aliens are subject to different treatment, such as generally being taxed only on income from U.S. sources. Exceptions exist for aliens with specific types of visas or employment.", "An individual who is in the country unlawfully is, like any other alien, classified as either a resident or nonresident alien. This classification is for tax purposes only, and it does not affect the individual's immigration status. These individuals' eligibility to claim the earned income tax credit is restricted because the tax code requires that taxpayers claiming the credit provide their Social Security number (SSN), as well as those of their spouse and dependents. Unauthorized aliens are ineligible for SSNs, and therefore file their tax returns using an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). In the 112th Congress, legislation has been introduced that would, with some differences, impose an SSN requirement for claiming the additional child tax credit (e.g., H.R. 3630, H.R. 5652, H.R. 3275, and H.R. 1956), for claiming any part of the child tax credit (H.R. 3444 and S. 577), or for claiming any credit or refund (e.g., H.R. 1196). Two of these bills\u2014H.R. 3630 and H.R. 5652\u2014have been passed by the House; however, H.R. 3630 was enacted into law (P.L. 112-96) without the provision.", "Finally, the provisions of an income tax treaty or totalization agreement may reduce or eliminate taxes owed to the United States. An income tax treaty is a bilateral agreement between the United States and another country that addresses the income tax treatment of each country's residents while in the other country, primarily with the intent of reducing the incidence of double taxation. Totalization agreements are bilateral treaties that address social security taxes. In 2004, the United States signed a totalization agreement with Mexico, but it has not yet been transmitted to Congress for review. In the 112th Congress, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 prohibits the Social Security Commissioner or Social Security Administration (SSA) from using any of the funds appropriated by the act to pay compensation to SSA employees to administer Social Security benefit payments under any U.S.-Mexico totalization agreement that would not otherwise be payable. Other legislation has been introduced that would state it is the sense of the House that the U.S.-Mexico totalization agreement \"is inappropriate public policy and should not take effect\" (H.R. 1196), or address a constitutional issue with the manner in which totalization agreements are disapproved by Congress (S. 181)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Immigration Status", "paragraphs": ["Under U.S. immigration law, foreign nationals are legally admitted into the United States as immigrants to live permanently or as nonimmigrants to stay on a temporary basis. The terms \"immigrant\" and \"nonimmigrant\" are not used in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).

The classification has important consequences for determining whether income is subject to U.S. taxation, what is the appropriate tax rate, and whether an individual is covered by a tax treaty. In general, an individual is a nonresident alien unless he or she meets the qualifications under either residency test:", "Green card test: the individual is a lawful permanent resident of the United States at any time during the current year, or Substantial presence test: the individual is present in the United States for at least 31 days during the current year and at least 183 days during the current year and previous two years. For computing the 183 days, a formula is used that counts all the qualifying days in the current year, 1/3 of the qualifying days in the immediate preceding year, and 1/6 of the qualifying days in the second preceding year.", "There are several situations in which an individual may be classified as a nonresident alien even though he or she meets the substantial presence test. For example, an individual will be treated as a nonresident alien if he or she has a closer connection to a foreign country than to the United States, maintains a tax home in the foreign country, and is in the United States for fewer than 183 days during the year. Another example is that an individual in the United States under an F-, J-, M-, or Q-visa may be treated as a nonresident alien if he or she has substantially complied with visa requirements. Other individuals that may be treated as nonresident aliens even if they meet the substantial presence test include employees of foreign governments and international organizations, regular commuters from Canada or Mexico, aliens who are unable to the leave the United States because of a medical condition, foreign vessel crew members, aliens in transit through the United States, and athletes participating in charitable sporting events.", "A residency definition in an income tax treaty will override these residency rules. If an individual is defined as a resident of a foreign country under a treaty, then he or she is a nonresident alien for purposes of determining his or her U.S. tax liability regardless of whether the \"green card\" or \"substantial presence\" test is met."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Unauthorized Aliens", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) does not have a special classification for individuals who are in the United States without authorization (commonly referred to as \"illegal aliens\"). Instead, the Code treats these individuals in the same manner as other foreign nationals\u2014they are subject to federal taxes and classified for tax purposes as either resident or nonresident aliens. An unauthorized individual who has been in the United States long enough to qualify under the \"substantial presence\" test is classified as a resident alien; otherwise, the individual is classified as a nonresident alien. This classification is for tax purposes only and does not affect the individual's immigration status.", "While most taxpayers file tax returns using their Social Security number (SSN) as an identifier, individuals who are ineligible to receive an SSN file their returns using an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Thus, unauthorized aliens who file tax returns will generally use an ITIN. One consequence of this is that they will be ineligible to claim the earned income tax credit (EITC) since the IRC requires that taxpayers claiming the EITC provide SSNs for themselves, their spouses (if filing a joint return), and their qualifying children. A similar rule applied to the temporary refundable tax credit (\"recovery rebate\") provided under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. Furthermore, in the 112 th Congress, legislation has been introduced that would impose, with some differences, an SSN requirement for claiming the additional child tax credit, any part of the child tax credit, or any credit or refund (e.g., H.R. 1196 ). Two of these bills\u2014 H.R. 3630 and H.R. 5652 \u2014have been passed by the House; however, H.R. 3630 was enacted into law ( P.L. 112-96 ) without the SSN provision.", "The mechanism of using an SSN requirement for restricting the eligibility of unauthorized aliens to claim tax credits may be imprecise. There remains the possibility that attempts to claim a credit could be made by resident aliens who legally received SSNs but are currently not legally present in the United States, in addition to unauthorized aliens using fraudulent SSNs. At the same time, the SSN requirement may deny the credits to families that do not include any unauthorized aliens but have at least one member without an SSN. For example, after it came to light that overseas military members with foreign spouses would be ineligible for the 2008 recovery rebate, Congress exempted military members from the SSN requirement.

Another example is that compensation for services performed in the United States is not subject to U.S. tax if the services are for a foreign employer or office, the alien is in the United States for not more than 90 days during the tax year, and the compensation does not exceed $3000. A nonresident alien with an F-, J-, or Q-visa is not taxed on compensation received from a foreign employer.
