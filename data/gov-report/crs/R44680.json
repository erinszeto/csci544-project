Other casino owners disagree, seeing Internet gambling as a potentially significant new revenue source and a possible complement to land-based casino operations.

In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association classified problem gambling as an addictive disorder akin to alcoholism. Gambling addiction experts at Washington University in St. Louis found that \"based on available research, it is unclear if the Internet contributes to more gambling problems, but we know that those who choose to gamble using the Internet and experience problems are often involved in other forms of gambling as well.\" Likewise, a survey of more than 4,500 participants in Internet gambling in Australia showed that \"online gamblers were not more likely to be classified as problem gamblers than non-online gamblers.\" Iowa's Department of Public Health recently studied the potential health issues related to legalizing Internet poker in Iowa. Among other findings, the study said that \"the literature cannot support a claim that Internet poker will cause people to become problem or pathological gamblers; however, researchers have asserted that Internet gambling has the potential to contribute to problem gambling.\" Some groups also oppose all forms of gambling, including online gambling, for moral reasons, arguing that the \"national explosion of gambling may well be the most underrated dimension of America's moral crisis.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gambling as a Government Revenue Source", "paragraphs": ["Gambling is a way for states to raise revenue. Revenues from lotteries, taxes on commercial casinos, and other gambling in most states represented between 2.0% and 2.5% of state own-source general revenues, according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government. State gambling revenues rose from $20.7 billion in FY2005 to $27.7 billion in FY2015, in part because more casinos, racinos, and lottery products entered the market (see Figure 5 ). ", "State revenues from casinos have fallen or been largely flat since 2013, and 9 of 17 states with commercial casinos experienced revenue declines in FY2015. West Virginia and Indiana reported the sharpest declines. Revenue from lotteries has been rising slowly. Changing consumer behavior, especially among younger people who may view gambling as a less attractive leisure activity than their parents and grandparents, is a contributing factor to the more recent softening in the growth of gambling revenues.", "Although minor on a national scale, gambling taxes are extremely important for certain states. In Nevada, gambling taxes made up about 20% of the state's general fund revenue in 2015, compared with 30% from sales and use taxes. In Delaware, the state lottery was the fourth-largest source of general fund revenue in FY2016, and Rhode Island's general fund received more than 10% of its revenue from the state lottery. Even though Las Vegas is the nation's number one gambling venue, Pennsylvania collected more commercial casino tax revenue in 2015 ($1.4 billion) than Nevada ($907 million). Tax rates may partly explain the difference. Pennsylvania taxes at a rate of 55% of gross slot machine revenue and 16% of table games revenue, whereas Nevada's rate tops out at 6.75% of gross gambling revenue, with additional county fees and levies.", "Federal licensing of Internet gambling could potentially bring additional revenue to the federal government.

That legislation would have authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to license and regulate Internet wagering, subject to additional oversight and licensing investigations performed by recognized state gaming authorities. The Joint Committee on Taxation also estimated that the federal government would collect an additional $42 billion over 10 years under H.R. 2230 , the Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act of 2011, which would have imposed a license fee equal to 2% of all funds deposited by customers into special accounts that could be used for online wagering; the revenue estimate was based on the assumption that no states opted out of the proposed system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Action on Internet Gambling", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, a few states have legalized online gambling, others have considered legislation on Internet gambling, and still others have made it illegal (see Figure 6 ).", "Among recent developments at the state level are the following:", "Nevada in 2001 became the first state to develop a regulatory framework for online gambling. It awards online gambling licenses for poker only. By federal law, online poker games approved in Nevada can only be played within the state. Before any online system can go live, the licensees must \"prove their systems are capable of identifying players by location and that players are of legal age.\" Only 2 of Nevada's 271 casinos currently offer online poker. In November 2014, Ultimate Poker, the nation's first licensed online poker room, ceased operations, citing sluggish revenue and a limited pool of players. In 2014, Internet poker revenue totaled $16.5 million. In October 2015, Nevada became the first state to require gambling licenses for DFS operators. Delaware became the first state to authorize full online casino-style gambling (poker, table games, and video lottery games), legalizing it in June 2012. Full-scale online gambling was launched in November 2013 at the state's three racetrack casinos. The state's tax revenue from Internet gambling has failed to meet forecasts, totaling only $1.8 million in FY2015. In February 2014, the governors of Nevada and Delaware signed the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement, the first-of-its-kind Internet gambling deal. Delaware's authorized online casino and poker offerings are operated by a single provider, 888 Holdings. New Jersey's regulations governing online gambling took effect in October 2013, allowing licensed casinos to offer poker, table games, and slots over the Internet. Each of the state's seven brick-and-mortar casinos offers online gambling in partnership with an online gaming operator, such as Gibraltar-based Bwin.party Digital Entertainment and 888 Holdings. Gross gambling revenues from New Jersey's virtual casinos totaled $149 million in 2015, an uptick from $123 million in 2014. Bills to authorize Internet gambling have been debated, but not adopted, by state legislatures including those in California, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, and Tennessee legalized online DFS betting in 2016.

The bill, also introduced as S. 1668 , would amend the Wire Act to prohibit all forms of Internet gambling in the United States, including in the three states where online gambling has already been licensed and regulated. This bill would not make online games themselves illegal, but rather would prohibit use of the communications network to play games like poker or bingo over the Internet, restoring the original interpretation of the Wire Act. It contains exemptions for online interstate horse race wagers, fantasy sports competitions, and state-licensed computer-generated retail lottery sales. The Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling supports these bills. ", "In 2015, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held an oversight hearing on Internet gambling and how it might affect Indian tribes. S. 3376 , introduced in September 2016, would prohibit financial institutions from processing Internet gambling transactions, and it aims to overturn the Department of Justice's 2011 memorandum, which interpreted the Wire Act as applying only to sports gambling and not to other forms of online gambling, including casinos and poker.

Registered sites would be subject to regulation and inspection to, among other things, prevent minors from playing, stop money laundering, and identify problem gamblers.

A Short History of U.S. Gambling and Lotteries", "paragraphs": ["Government-supported gambling has been part of America's development since the earliest days of colonization, starting with a 1612 London lottery to raise money for the Virginia Colony. While gambling restrictions were imposed in some of the colonies, the Continental Congress used lotteries to raise funds for forces during the Revolutionary War. Lotteries were used to finance public works projects and establish universities, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Princeton. By 1832, there were more than 400 lotteries in eight states. Annual ticket sales came to 3% of national income and were several times larger than the federal budget.", "Public opinion began to sour due to high-profile scandals and graft in lotteries, and by the time of the Civil War legal lotteries basically had been halted. Some gambling and gamblers moved west with the Gold Rush. During Reconstruction, Louisiana created a special lottery to help rebuild the state, drawing players from around the nation. The Louisiana Lottery continued for years, despite evidence of mismanagement and theft. Congress intervened, passing legislation in 1876 banning the use of mail for lottery advertising. Congress approved a second bill in 1890 to ban the use of mail to sell lottery tickets, and in 1895 banned the transport of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.", "By 1910, U.S. legal gambling, with the exception of horse racing, was moribund. State-sanctioned gambling began a comeback during the Great Depression as a means to raise money for charity and government services. States began to legalize bingo games in the 1930s, and Nevada legalized casino gambling in 1931.", "Illegal gambling also proliferated, leading Congress in 1950 to investigate organized crime and gambling casinos. In 1951 lawmakers passed the Johnson Act, which barred transport of gambling machines in interstate commerce unless they were being moved to a legal jurisdiction. A second round of congressional investigations (from 1955 to 1960) resulted in a series of laws to combat gambling and racketeering.", "In 1964, New Hampshire became the first state to reinstate a lottery, and, in 1976, New Jersey voted to allow casinos in Atlantic City. In 1979, Indian gambling began on the Seminole reservation in Florida. In 1987, the Supreme Court upheld the right of Indian tribes to offer unregulated gambling on sovereign lands, so long as they did not violate state criminal laws. In response, Congress in 1988 passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) providing for Indian gambling to be regulated under compacts negotiated between state governments and tribes. In 1992, Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) limiting states' ability to offer sports gambling. In 2006, Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which prevents payments to illegal gambling-related businesses but does not outlaw all forms of Internet gambling."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
