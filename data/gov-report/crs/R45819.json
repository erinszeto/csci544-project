For FY2019, the PDM program is funded through the DRF . Pre-DRRA, the amount available for PDM was appropriated separately on an annual basis, and financial assistance was limited by the amount available in the National Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. FEMA awarded PDM grants competitively, and 56 states and jurisdictions, as well as federally-recognized Indian tribal governments, were eligible to apply. Local governments, including Indian tribes or authorized tribal organizations, were required to apply to their state/territory as subapplicants. In FY2018, each state, jurisdiction, and tribe was eligible for a baseline level of financial assistance in the amount of the lesser of 1% of appropriated funding, or $575,000, although additional funding could be awarded competitively. No applicant was eligible to receive more than 15% of the appropriated funding. In FY2018, FEMA set aside 10% of the appropriation for federally recognized tribes. FEMA sets priorities annually for the competitive PDM funding, with priority given to applicants that have little or no disaster funding available through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). In FY2018, FEMA awarded $235.2 million in PDM funding . ", "DRRA authorizes the NPIPDM, for which the President may set aside from the DRF, with respect to each major disaster, an amount equal to 6% of the estimated aggregate amount of the grants to be made pursuant to the following sections of the Stafford Act: ", "Section 403\u00e2\u0080\u0094Essential Assistance; Section 406\u00e2\u0080\u0094Repair, Restoration, and Replacement of Damaged Facilities; Section 407\u00e2\u0080\u0094Debris Removal; Section 408\u00e2\u0080\u0094Federal Assistance to Individuals and Households; Section 410\u00e2\u0080\u0094Unemployment Assistance; Section 416\u00e2\u0080\u0094Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training; and Section 428\u00e2\u0080\u0094Public Assistance Program Alternative Procedures.", "The amount set aside for PDM shall not reduce the amounts otherwise available under the sections above. Funding from the NPIPDM may be used to provide technical and financial mitigation assistance pursuant to each major disaster. An additional clause in DRRA provides that NPIPDM funds may be used \"to establish and carry out enforcement activities and implement the latest published editions of relevant consensus-based codes, specifications, and standards that incorporate the latest hazard-resistant designs and establish minimum acceptable criteria for the design, construction, and maintenance of residential structures and facilities that may be eligible for assistance under this Act.... \" ", "The changes to PDM funding in DRRA may increase the focus on funding public infrastructure projects that improve community resilience before a disaster occurs, though FEMA has the discretion to shape the program in many ways. There is potential for significantly increased funding post-DRRA through the new transfer from the DRF, but it is not yet clear how FEMA will implement this new program. ", "In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) , Congress made $250 million available for PDM for FY2019, which may be merged with funds for the NPIPDM once it is fully implemented. The FY2019 PDM program will be the last PDM cycle before the rollout of the new DRRA Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program. FEMA has authority to operate the legacy PDM program for FY2019, after which BRIC will replace the current PDM program. Funding not used in FY2019 will remain for the first year of BRIC, which will likely begin in FY2020. PDM projects already in progress will continue through closeout under the current PDM guidance. Any unobligated PDM funds may be rolled into a \"carryover PDM\" funding account which could be used for obligations of PDM projects underway when BRIC is implemented. Once BRIC is fully implemented, legacy PDM funds may be merged with BRIC funds, which may then be used for both PDM and BRIC work.", "FEMA is in the process of determining how funds under the 6% set-aside will be allocated to local, state, territorial, and Indian tribal governments. FEMA expects that BRIC will be funded entirely by the 6% set-aside; however, nothing prohibits Congress from appropriating additional funds for the program. FEMA anticipates setting aside the full 6% estimate from each major disaster declaration within 180 days after declaration. Based on the recent funding trends of the DRF, FEMA assumes that it would be a rare circumstance in which there is no set-aside.", "Other provisions in DRRA Section 1234 establish that mitigation funds under Stafford Act Section 203 would only be provided to states which had received a major disaster declaration in the past seven years, or any Indian tribal governments located partially or entirely within the boundaries of such states.

The Stafford Act authorizes three types of declarations that provide federal assistance to states and localities: (1) FMAG declarations, (2) emergency declarations, and (3) major disaster declarations. FMAGs provide federal assistance for fire suppression activities. Emergency declarations trigger aid that protects property, public health, and safety and lessens or averts the threat of an incident becoming a catastrophic event. ", "A major disaster declaration constitutes the broadest authority for federal agencies to provide supplemental assistance to help state and local governments, families and individuals, and certain nonprofit organizations recover from the incident. Major disaster declarations also authorize statewide hazard mitigation grants to states and tribes through FEMA's HMGP. Authorized under Stafford Act Section 404\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hazard Mitigation, HMGP can be used to fund mitigation projects to protect either private or public property, provided that the project fits within local, state, territorial, and Indian tribal government mitigation strategies to address risk and complies with HMGP guidelines. ", "HMGP grant amounts are provided on a sliding scale based on the percentage of funds spent for Public and Individual Assistance for each presidentially-declared major disaster declaration. For states and federally-recognized tribes with a FEMA-approved Standard State or Tribal Mitigation Plan, the formula provides for up to 15% of the first $2 billion of estimated aggregate amounts of disaster assistance, up to 10% for amounts between $2 billion and $10 billion, and 7.5% for amounts between $10 billion and $35.333 billion.", "DRRA Section 1204 also requires the FEMA Administrator to submit a report one year after enactment and annually thereafter containing a summary of any mitigation projects carried out, and any funding provided to those projects, to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC), the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.", "One potential issue of congressional concern is the cost implications of providing mitigation funding for FMAG declarations. All things being equal, making HMGP available for FMAGs will increase federal expenditures for HMGP because it expands the number of incidents eligible for HMGP. The additional costs, however, may not be significant compared to HMGP funding for major disaster declarations. As previously discussed, HMGP grants are based on the percentage of funds spent for Public and Individual Assistance. Though it is unclear how the HMGP formula will be applied to FMAG declarations, HMGP grant amounts would likely be less than what is typically provided for major disasters because funding for major disasters is significantly more than what is provided for FMAGs. For example, from FY2017 to FY2018, $12.3 million has been obligated for FMAG declarations. In contrast, $1.7 billion has been obligated for Hurricane Matthew. Furthermore, HMGP funding for FMAGs could be considered an investment because the projects they fund can help save recovery costs for future disasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 1233: Additional Hazard Mitigation Activities46", "paragraphs": ["DRRA Section 1233 authorizes recipients of hazard mitigation assistance to use the assistance to reduce the risk of earthquake damage, hardship, loss, or suffering for areas in the United States affected by earthquake hazards.

In contrast, an earthquake prediction would provide a date, time, and location of a future earthquake.", "The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-307 ) removed statutory language referencing the goal of earthquake prediction, substituting instead the goal of issuing earthquake early warnings and alerts. Since 2006, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), together with several cooperating institutions, has been working to develop a U.S. earthquake early-warning system. According to the USGS, the goal is to create and operate such a system for the nation's highest-risk regions, beginning with California, Oregon, and Washington. Other seismically active western states, such as Alaska, also may eventually be incorporated into an early-warning system, and possibly a region in the Midwest known as the New Madrid Seismic Zone.", "The authority provided in DRRA Section 1233 could help improve the U.S. early-warning capability because it addresses many of the components for earthquake detection (e.g., seismometers, the instruments that detect shaking), location (e.g., GPS receivers and infrastructure for more precise mapping of where shaking will occur), and improvements to the connected regional networks of seismometers and geodetic instruments. Part of the challenge in implementing an effective earthquake early-warning system is communicating the timing and location of dangerous shaking once the earthquake occurs.

Individuals and households often need to use multiple sources of assistance to fully recover from a major disaster. If the assistance exceeds their unmet disaster needs, then the assistance is considered a \"duplication of benefits.\" Stafford Act Section 312(a)\u00e2\u0080\u0094Duplication of Benefits prohibits the \"financial assistance to persons, business concerns, or other entities suffering losses as a result of a major disaster or emergency ... [for] which he has received financial assistance under any other program or from insurance or any other source.\" Stafford Act Section 312(c) states that the recipient of duplicative assistance is liable to the United States and that the agency that provided the duplicative assistance is responsible for debt collection. The federal duplication of benefits policy is intended to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of program assistance.", "44 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7206.191 provides procedural guidance known as a \"delivery sequence\" to prevent the duplication of benefits between federal assistance programs such as FEMA's Individuals and Households Program and the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Disaster Loan Program, state assistance programs, other assistance programs (e.g., volunteer programs), and insurance benefits (see Figure 1 ). An organization's position within the delivery sequence determines the order in which it should provide assistance and what other resources need to be considered before that assistance is provided. The regulation requires individuals to repay all duplicated assistance to the agency providing the assistance based on the delivery sequence hierarchy that outlines the order assistance should be provided. Critics have argued that the delivery sequence lacks specificity. For example, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Community Development Block Grant\u00e2\u0080\u0094Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program, which is often duplicated with other assistance sources, is not listed in the delivery sequence.", "However, in addition to prohibiting duplication of benefits, Stafford Act Section 312 also stipulates that assistance cannot be withheld. Section 312(b)(1) states:", "this section shall not prohibit the provision of federal assistance to a person who is or may be entitled to receive benefits for the same purposes from another source if such person has not received such other benefits by the time of application for federal assistance and if such person agrees to repay all duplicative assistance to the agency providing the federal assistance.", "The delivery sequence, therefore, is not rigid\u00e2\u0080\u0094it can be broken in certain cases. The most common example is when adhering to the delivery sequence prevents the timely receipt of essential assistance. In some cases, assistance can be provided more quickly by an organization or agency that is lower in the sequence than an agency or organization that is at a higher level. For example, SBA disaster loans can generally be processed more quickly than FEMA grants; CDBG-DR grants take longer still because CDBG-DR disaster funding generally requires Congress to pass an appropriation. Once appropriated, the funding is usually released to the state in the form of a block grant, which is then disbursed by the state to disaster survivors.", "The underlying rationale for providing assistance when it becomes immediately available instead of rigidly adhering to the delivery sequence is to make sure disaster survivors receive aid as quickly as possible. Advocates of this view argue that preventing duplication of benefits is of secondary importance\u00e2\u0080\u0094it can be rectified and recouped later. This practice, however, has led to problems, particularly for individuals and households. In some cases, the federal government may fail to identify the duplication. In others cases, it may take a prolonged period of time to identify the duplication and the recoupment notification that they owe money to the federal government may come as a surprise to disaster survivors who did not realize they exceeded their allowable assistance. In some cases they may have spent all of the assistance on recovery, and repaying duplicative assistance constitutes a financial burden to the disaster survivor. ", "One of the most significant changes instituted by DRRA Section 1210 is that it prohibits the President from determining loans as duplicative assistance provided all federal assistance is used toward loss resulting from an emergency or major disaster under the Stafford Act. This arguably removes SBA disaster loans from the delivery sequence. However, the rulemaking on this policy has not been issued. Thus, it remains to be seen how this provision of DRRA will be implemented.", "Finally, DRRA Section 1210(a)(5) requires the FEMA Administrator, in coordination with relevant federal agencies, to provide a report with recommendations to improve \"the comprehensive delivery of disaster assistance to individuals following a major disaster or emergency declaration.\" The report must include (1) actions planned or taken by the agencies as well as legislative proposals to improve coordination between agencies with respect to delivering disaster assistance; (2) a clarification of the delivery sequence; (3) a clarification of federal-wide interpretation of Stafford Act Section 312 when providing assistance to individuals and households; and (4) recommendations to improve communication to disaster assistance applicants, including the breadth of programs available and the potential impacts of utilizing one program versus another."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 1239: Cost of Assistance Estimates; Section 1232: Local Impact192", "paragraphs": ["DRRA Section 1239\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cost of Assistance Estimates and Section 1232\u00e2\u0080\u0094Local Impact both require FEMA to review and initiate a rulemaking to update the factors considered when evaluating a governor's request for a major disaster declaration, including how FEMA estimates the cost of major disaster assistance. They also require FEMA to consider anything that may affect a local jurisdiction's capacity to respond to a disaster. Section 1232 in particular requires FEMA to give greater consideration to severe local impact or recent multiple disasters.", "Both sections address the way FEMA has made major disaster recommendations to Presidents. FEMA uses factors about the severity of the incident (including how the state was affected by the incident) to assess the state's need for federal assistance. The estimated cost of assistance (also known as the per capita threshold) has been a key factor used by FEMA to evaluate the disaster's severity and to determine if the state has the capacity to handle the disaster without federal assistance. Two thresholds are used for estimated cost of assistance: (1) $1 million in public infrastructure damages and (2) a formula based on the state's population (according to the most recent census data) and public infrastructure damages. Based on these thresholds, FEMA has generally recommended that a major disaster be declared if public infrastructure damages exceed $1 million and meet or exceed $1.50 per capita.", "The underlying rationale for using a per capita threshold is that state fiscal capacity should be sufficient to deal with the disaster if damages and costs fall under the per capita amount. However, concerns related to relying on the per capita threshold include that:", "the per capita threshold may be difficult to reach for some states. For example, a rural area in a highly populated state may be denied federal disaster assistance because damages and costs do not exceed the per capita threshold; these incidents still warrant federal assistance because they overwhelm local response and recovery capacity in spite of not exceeding the statewide threshold; and the application of the per capita threshold is inequitable because the same incident may affect multiple states but only result in a major disaster declaration for some states by virtue of differences in state population. ", "Pursuant to DRRA Section 1239, within two years of DRRA's enactment (i.e., by October 5, 2020), FEMA is required to initiate a rulemaking to update the factors considered when evaluating a governor's request for a major disaster declaration, including how the cost of assistance is estimated, as well as other impacts on the jurisdiction's response capacity. As part of the review and rulemaking, FEMA may consider whether the per capita threshold is an appropriate mechanism for evaluating capacity, and additional information, such as the results of the 2020 U.S. Census, may factor into the final rule. DRRA Section 1232 also requires FEMA to adjust agency policy and regulations to grant greater consideration to severe local impact or recent multiple disasters, which may enable jurisdictions that struggle to reach the per capita threshold to provide evidence supporting the request for a major disaster declaration as no single factor is dispositive and the determination to grant a request for a major disaster is at the President's discretion.", "FEMA currently uses nine factors to evaluate a state or territory's request for a major disaster declaration (see Table 2 ). To some, these factors entail a more nuanced evaluation of major disaster requests by assessing both damages and state and local resources. However, it appears that the per capita threshold is still being applied to determine the \"amount and type of damages caused by the incident.\" If that is the case, per capita damages may still figure more prominently than other factors\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as local impacts\u00e2\u0080\u0094when making major disaster declaration recommendations to the President."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 1219: Right of Arbitration196", "paragraphs": ["DRRA Section 1219 amends Stafford Act Section 423\u00e2\u0080\u0094Appeals of Assistance Decisions to add a right of arbitration.

Prior to DRRA, the appeal process outlined in the Stafford Act only provided a way for FEMA to review its own decisions, and did not include a way for applicants to bring claims before an independent arbiter.

In the interim, FEMA has stated that it will rely on the Public Assistance Appeals and Arbitration Under the Disaster Recovery Reform Act fact sheet and the CBCA's Interim Fact Sheet .

The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's DRRA Report states that the CBCA panel provides a faster resolution, citing that arbitration was used as a tool for resolving disputes following both Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy to facilitate recovery. FEMA, however, in an earlier version of its Public Assistance Arbitration fact sheet stated that the arbitration process often takes years to arrive at a resolution.

Additionally, the arbitration process may be costly as there are fees associated with the panel, experts, attorney's fees, and other fees, which are the responsibility of the parties, including both the applicant and FEMA. According to the Senate HSGAC's DRRA Report , the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that \"implementing this provision would cost $4 million over the 2019-2023 period\" based on information provided by FEMA on the expected number of arbitration requests. It is unclear, however, whether the evaluation of the cost of implementing this provision included considerations such as the individual cost of the project being arbitrated, the complexity of the project, and the nature of the dispute. Congress may consider tasking the Comptroller General of the United States with conducting a review of the arbitration process to evaluate its effectiveness, including whether arbitration expedites the disaster recovery process and if it is cost effective.
