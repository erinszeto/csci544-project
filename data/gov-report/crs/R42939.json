President Thein Sein, with the support of Burma's Union Parliament, has implemented a number of political and economic reforms, to which the Obama Administration has responded by waiving or easing sanctions.", "Although the presidential waivers effectively lift the sanctions, they do not revoke or remove the sanctions, which can be reimposed at any time. Various recent developments in Burma have sparked a general reexamination of U.S. policy towards Burma, and a discussion of whether U.S. sanctions continue to be an effective means of achieving policy goals or effecting change in Burma. However, the continuation of serious human rights abuses has raised questions about the extent to which there has been significant political change in Burma, and if the easing of sanctions has been warranted.", "The United States is nearing the limits of steps it can take to ease Burma sanctions without Congress passing new legislation. Thus, President Obama may approach Congress about the selective repeal or removal of one or more of the current sanctions on Burma. The 113th Congress allowed some of the sanctions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 to expire on July 26, 2013, when it did not pass an annual renewal resolution. The 113th Congress may consider either the imposition of additional sanctions or the removal of the remaining sanctions on Burma, depending on the conduct of the Burmese government and other developments in the country.", "The current U.S. sanctions on Burma were enacted, for the most part, due to what the U.S. government saw as a general disregard by the SPDC for the human rights and civil liberties of the people of Burma. Burma-specific sanctions began following the Burmese military's violent suppression of popular protests in 1988, and have continued through several subsequent periods in which Congress perceived major human rights violations in Burma. The result is a web of overlapping sanctions with differing restrictions, waiver provisions, expiration conditions, and reporting requirements.", "Existing U.S. sanctions on Burma are based on various U.S. laws and presidential executive orders. They can be generally divided into several broad categories, such as visa bans, restrictions on financial services, prohibitions of Burmese imported goods, a ban on new investments in Burma, and constraints on U.S. assistance to Burma. This report provides a brief history of U.S. policy towards Burma and the development of U.S. sanctions, a topical summary of those sanctions, and an overview of actions taken to waive or ease those sanctions by the Obama Administration. The report concludes with a discussion of actions taken by the 112th Congress and options for the 113th Congress.", "In addition to the targeted sanctions, Burma may be subject to certain sanctions specified in U.S. laws addressing various functional issues, such as the use of child soldiers, drug trafficking, human trafficking. In many cases, the type of assistance or relations restricted or prohibited by these provisions is also addressed under Burma-specific sanction laws.

The Burma-specific laws and E.O.s were issued between 1990 and 2012, often in response to actions on the part of Burma's ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), that were considered sufficiently egregious to warrant the imposition of sanctions.

For example, President Clinton issued Presidential Proclamation 6925 on October 3, 1996, denying entry into the United States of \"persons who formulate, implement, or benefit from policies that impede Burma's transition to democracy, and the immediate family members of such persons.\" On May 2, 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry terminated Presidential Proclamation 6925, while leaving other laws and presidential decisions restricting the provision of visas to certain Burmese nationals in place. Similarly, President Bush issued Pres idential Determination No. 2009- 11 on January 15, 2009, providing a limited waiver of some of the sanctions in the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, stating that doing so was \"in the national interest of the United States.\" President Obama issued Presidential Determination No. 2012-15 on September 14, 2012, waiving the restrictions on U.S. assistance to Burma under Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 ( P.L. 107-228 ) by determining that doing so was in the \"national interests of the United States.\" References to the relevant presidential documents are discussed later in the report under the specific type of sanction affected or altered by the documents. ", "The E.O.s sanctioning Burma rely on the authority vested in the President by the Constitution, the five Burma sanctions laws, and the following laws:", "The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1997, or IEEPA ( P.L. 95-223 ; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)\u2014authorizes the President to impose certain types of international trade or financial sanctions to deal with a threat to national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States; and The National Emergencies Act, or NEA ( P.L. 94-412 ; 50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)\u2014authorizes the President (under certain conditions) to declare a national emergency.", "To carry out and execute the authority conveyed by the IEEPA, the President must declare a national emergency by invoking the NEA. Invocations of the IEEPA are subject to annual renewal requirements. Section 301 of U.S.C. Title 3, Chapter 35 allows the President to delegate authority (under certain conditions) to other government officials to carry out responsibilities on behalf of the President. In most cases, this has been either the Secretary of State or the Treasury Secretary. President Obama gave official notice to Congress on May 2, 2013, that he was continuing for another year the international emergency with respect to Burma, and renewing the provisions of E.O. 13047, E.O. 13310, E.O. 13448, E.O. 13464, and E.O. 13619 which are still in force.", "The implementation of the Burma-specific sanctions instituted by the preceding laws and E.O.s, and that have been delegated to the Treasury Secretary, is governed by Part 537 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). These Burmese sanction regulations cover the import ban, the prohibition of the provision of financial services, and the prohibition of new investments in Burma. Other portions of the CFR cover some portions of Burmese-specific sanctions. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent U.S. Sanctions Policy", "paragraphs": ["Current U.S. policy towards Burma can be characterized as the balancing of bilateral engagement and the maintenance of an assortment of political and economic sanctions. The stated intent of U.S. policy is to persuade and/or pressure Burma's Union Government to release all political prisoners from detention and advance the nation's transition to a representative, democratically elected civilian government that will respect the human rights of the people of Burma, including its ethnic minorities. Since Burma's former ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), formally transferred power to a mixed military/civilian government in March 2011, Burma's Union Government and Union Parliament have implemented a number of political reforms that the Obama Administration sees as progress towards the fulfillment of U.S. objectives in Burma. ", "The Obama Administration's strategy was previously described as an \"action for action\" approach. In an April 4, 2012, press briefing, two unnamed senior Administration officials gave some indication of the current principles underlying current Burma policy. The first principle is \"to send a clear signal of support for the reform process and reformers.\" The second principle is to remove the \"bluntness\" of the existing sanctions and refocus them onto \"the regressive elements, the corrupt elements, the elements that are not looking forward and consistent with reform going forward.\" ", "However, an unnamed senior state department official provided a slightly different formulation for the Obama Administration's approach to U.S. policy towards Burma following the May 2013 announcement to terminate Presidential Proclamation 6925 and renew the IIEEPA emergency:", "[L]et me first say a few words about our Burma policy and our specific actions today. From our perspective, Burma continues to make important progress in areas of concern to the United States.... We'll continue political engagement and technical and capacity-building assistance to Burma's reform efforts. We've also eased many sanctions. We've done so working very closely with Congress to reflect our move from quite general broad restrictions to more calibrated engagement. And with the calibration, we target those who persist in hindering the country's democratic transition. But it's a fundamentally different approach to Burma than in past years. So the steps today acknowledged the important changes the Government of Burma has made, and encourage and empower the government and the people of Burma to continue on the path of political and economic reform. ", "Since the autumn of 2011, the Obama Administration has taken steps to terminate or waive many of the sanctions on Burma in an effort to foster further reforms in Burma and support individuals identified as being generally supportive of political and economic reforms. Secretary Clinton announced plans to ease certain sanctions during her historic trip to Burma in late 2011, the first made by a U.S. Secretary of State since 1955. Another easing of sanctions was announced following Burma's April 2012 parliamentary by-elections. More relaxations of sanctions were announced to coincide with the visits of President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi to the United States in September 2012. Subsequent changes in the sanctions regime were made in October and November 2012. As previously mentioned, Secretary Kerry terminated the visa ban in Presidential Proclamation 6925 on May 2, 2013. ", "A major element of the Obama's Administration's efforts to foster reforms in Burma has been the utilization of presidential authority to waive or terminate some of the existing political and economic sanctions on Burma. Although the presidential waivers effectively lift the sanctions, they do not revoke or remove the sanctions, which can be reimposed at any time. Table 1 summarizes the sanction actions authorized to date, as well as which sanctions remain in effect. Details of each presidential waiver are discussed in the relevant sections below. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brief History of U.S. Sanctions on Burma", "paragraphs": ["U.S. sanctions on Burma are the result of a general, but uneven decline in U.S. relations with Burma and its military, the Tatmadaw, after World War II and continuing until the establishment of the Union Government. For the most part, the decline was due to what the U.S. government saw as a general disregard by the Burmese military for the human rights and civil liberties of the people of Burma. However, part of the tensions between the Tatmadaw and the United States can be attributed to a failure to address Burma's internal security concerns in the early years after its independence. ", "During World War II, the United States utilized Burma as a base of operations against Japanese forces in China and Southeast Asia, engendering generally cordial relations with Burma's civilian and military leadership. Following the war, the former British colony of Burma became an independent nation, led by a civilian government. The new nation became a member of the United Nations in 1948, was a founding member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1952\u2014with the full support of the United States. The United States and Burma also established full diplomatic relations. ", "Relations between the two nations began to sour following World War II for various reasons. First, Burma was increasingly frustrated by U.S. reluctance to resolve the status of displaced Kuomintang (KMT) soldiers operating out of northeastern Burma against the newly established People's Republic of China (PRC). In 1953, U.S. economic assistance to Burma temporarily ceased in part because of the friction over these KMT soldiers. Second, Burma's civilian government proved to be unstable, due in part to various ethnic-based militia groups operating in the country, and in part due to a 1962 coup d'\u00e9tat staged by the military under the name of the Burmese Socialist Programme Party (BSPP). The new military government chose to foster closer ties to the PRC, a decision that the United States did not like. Third, the military government also demonstrated a general lack of respect for the human rights of its citizens, clamping down on opposition groups calling for a return to civilian rule. ", "Despite the cooling of relations, U.S. policy towards Burma remained relatively normal. The United States accepted Burma as one of the original beneficiaries of its Generalized System of Preference (GSP) program in 1976. It also granted Burma Most Favored Nation (MFN, now referred to as Normal Trade Relations, or NTR) status, and supported the provision of developmental assistance by international financial institutions. There were also close military-to-military relations (including a major International Military Education and Training [IMET] program) until 1988. ", "The implementing of sanctions on Burma did not begin until after the Tatmadaw brutally suppressed a peaceful, popular protest that has become known as the 8888 Uprising. Starting in the fall of 1987, popular protests against the military government sprang up throughout Burma, reaching a peak in August 1988. On August 8, 1988, the military quashed the protest, killing and injuring an unknown number of protesters. In the aftermath of the event, the military regrouped and the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) assumed power. ", "Three days following the crackdown, the Senate passed S.Res. 464 , condemning the killings and mass arrests, supporting a return to democracy in Burma, and calling on the Reagan Administration to raise the issue of human rights and reconciliation with Burmese officials. On September 7, 1988, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 529 condemning the killing of unarmed protesters, paying tribute to the people of Burma and their struggle for democracy, and calling on the executive branch to review assistance programs in Burma. The Reagan Administration responded on September 23, 1988, by suspending all U.S. aid to Burma, including counternarcotics programs, and stopping all arms sales\u2014starting the gradual progress of sanctions on Burma. On April 13, 1989, President George H. W. Bush issued Presidential Proclamation 5955, amending the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and suspending preferential treatment.", "After assuming power, SLORC announced that it intended to expedite the return to civilian rule by holding parliamentary elections to form a Pyithu Hluttaw (Union Assembly) on May 27, 1990. On September 27, 1988, SLORC released a new law governing the registration of political parties, and on May 31, 1989, it issued a new law governing the upcoming parliamentary election. Although 235 political parties registered for the election, only 4 parties won more than 10 of the 485 contested seats. In a surprise to many, the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, received 59.9% of the valid votes and won 382 seats, while SLORC's political party, the National Unity Party, received 21.2% of the vote, but only 10 seats. ", "SLORC and Burma's military were shocked by the election results, and refused to allow the Union Assembly to meet. Instead, the Burmese military arrested and detained many of the opposition leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi (who was under detention prior to the election). Protests, led by Buddhist monks and university students, were brutally suppressed. SLORC declared martial law. ", "Congress responded to the post-election crackdown by including Burmese sanction language in the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-382 ), which it passed on August 20, 1990. Section 138 of the law granted the President the authority to impose \"such economic sanctions upon Burma as the President determines to be appropriate, including any sanctions appropriate under the Narcotics Control Trade Act of 1986.\" A version of the act which passed the Senate by a vote of 92-0 would have prohibited all imports from Burma. ", "As previously noted, President Bush had already suspended Burma's eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program on April 13, 1989. President Bush also designated Burma as a drug-producing and/or drug-trafficking country under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 on February 28, 1990, which required the United States to oppose loans to Burma by international financial institutions. After the passage of Customs and Trade Act of 1990, the Bush Administration invoked the law's authority on August 5, 1991, and refused to renew the Bilateral Textile Agreement with Burma, which had lapsed on December 31, 1990.", "During the 1990s, Congress considered a number of bills and resolutions calling for additional sanctions on Burma. Most of those measures failed to emerge from committee, with a few notable exceptions. On April 30, 1994, Congress passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 ( P.L. 103-236 ) which amended the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and withheld a portion of U.S. contributions to international organizations with programs for Burma, including the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), but excluding the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Language restricting U.S. funding for UNDP if it conducted programs in Burma was included in legislation up to FY2008, but not since then. ", "In July 1995, the Free Burma Act of 1995 ( S. 1092 ) was introduced, which would have placed a broad range of sanctions on Burma, including a ban on U.S. investment and assistance, the suspension of GSP privileges and normal trade relations, the prohibition of all imports of Burmese goods, travel restrictions to and from Burma, and U.S. opposition to all multilateral assistance. According to some scholars, the severity of the sanctions in this bill was sufficient to persuade SLORC to release Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest on July 10, 1995. ", "Even after the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, Congress approved new sanctions on Burma in Section 570 of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997 ( P.L. 104-208 ), including a cessation of all non-humanitarian assistance, a ban on the issuance of entry visas for Burmese government officials, and instructions for U.S. representatives for international financial institutions to vote against loans or funding to Burma. On October 3, 1996, President Clinton issued Presidential Proclamation 6925, suspending visas for \"persons who formulate, implement, or benefit from policies that impede Burma's transition to democracy, and the immediate family members of such persons.\" In addition, the law required the President to prohibit new investments in Burma by U.S. persons. On May 20, 1997, President Clinton released E.O. 13047 banning all new investments in Burma. ", "Since 2000, additional bills and resolutions have been introduced in Congress seeking to apply more sanctions on Burma. In October 2000, identical bills were introduced in the House and the Senate ( H.R. 5603 and S. 3246 ; 106 th Congress) that would have banned all textile and apparel imports from Burma. In the spring of 2001, similar bills ( H.R. 2211 and S. 926 ; 107 th Congress) were introduced that would have \"prohibited the importation of any article that is produced, manufactured, or grown in Burma.\" However, Congress did not pass any new sanction legislation until after the spring 2003 crackdown on opposition parties (which included the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders), when it approved the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-61 ). Similarly, Congress did not pass the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act until the SPDC crushed a nationwide protest initiated by Buddhist monks in the autumn of 2007\u2014the so-called \"Saffron Revolution.\" After the protests had been quashed, the SPDC arrested and imprisoned many of the leaders, and defrocked and relocated a number of the Buddhist monks involved in the protests. ", "The George W. Bush Administration did not take significant action on Burma until after the attacks on the Burmese opposition in the spring of 2003 and the passage of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (BFDA). Using authority granted by the BFDA and other laws (see \" Summary of Burma-Specific Sanctions \"), President George W. Bush issued E.O. 13310, E.O. 13448, and E.O. 13464 on July 28, 2003, October 18, 2007, and April 30, 2008, respectively. ", "From the preceding overview, some distinct patterns emerge in the history of U.S. relations with Burma. First, despite the general decline in relations following World War II, the imposition of sanctions did not begin until after the suppression of the 8888 Uprising in 1988. Second, subsequent U.S. sanctions were generally imposed after Burma's military had severely violated the human rights and civil liberties of its political opponents and/or the Burmese people. Third, Congress has been more proactive in pushing for the imposition of sanctions on Burma than the White House. Fourth, it is unclear if the imposition of sanctions had a demonstrable effect on the SPDC or its predecessors. Fifth, it is equally unclear if the absence of U.S. sanctions on Burma would have led to an improvement in the political situation in Burma.

This prohibition extends to correspondent or payable-through accounts maintained for other foreign banks when such accounts are used to provide banking services to Burmese banks indirectly. The Department of the Treasury repealed the special measures against Myanmar Mayflower Bank and Asia Wealth Bank effective October 1, 2012.
