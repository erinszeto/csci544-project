However, the OSLTF arguably plays a backup role in terms of response funding during many oil spills. The responsible party for an oil spill often provides the primary source of response (i.e., cleanup) funding, and the federal government may recover costs or damages paid from the OSLTF. Thus, the financial impact to the trust fund could be minimal if the majority of its payments are reimbursed by the responsible parties. Nonetheless, the liability of responsible parties may be limited under certain conditions.

Opponents of the resource's development often use the term \"tar sands,\" which arguably carries a negative connotation. Proponents typically refer to the material as oil sands. Some federal government resources refer to the deposits as \"tar sands,\" some use \"oil sands,\" and some have used both terms. In its documents evaluating the Keystone XL pipeline, the Department of State refers to the material as oil sands. EPA has followed suit in its letters to the Department of State concerning the pipeline's environmental impacts. In general, this report uses the term \"oil sands\" to describe the deposits in the ground and \"oil-sands-derived crude oil\" to describe the material imported into the United States. The use of this term is not intended to reflect a point of view but to adopt the term most commonly used by the primary executive agencies involved in recent oil sands policy issues. ", "These terms generally refer to a mixture of sand, clay and other minerals, water, and bitumen. The bitumen component of this mixture is a form of crude oil that has undergone degradation over millions of years. After oil producers separate the bitumen from the mixture, it is very dense and highly viscous (i.e., resistant to flow), having the consistency of molasses at room temperature. This property lends itself well to making asphalt: Bitumen deposits have been mined since antiquity for use as sealants and paving materials.", "In recent decades, the natural bitumen in oil sands\u2014particularly deposits in Alberta, Canada\u2014has been extracted to generate substantial quantities of crude oil and related substances. The Alberta deposits are estimated to be one of the largest accumulations of oil in the world, contributing to Canada's third-place ranking for estimated proven oil reserves (behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia). Canadian production of oil-sands-derived crude oil has increased dramatically in recent years. If approved and constructed, the Keystone XL pipeline would add to existing cross-border pipelines in transporting oil-sands-derived crude oils from Alberta into the United States.", "Companies developing Alberta's oil sands resources process or dilute the natural bitumen in order to transport it via pipeline. This processed/diluted bitumen falls into three general categories:", "1. Upgraded bitumen, or synthetic crude oil (SCO) is produced from bitumen at a refinery that turns the very heavy hydrocarbons into a lighter material. 2. Diluted b itumen (Dilb it) is bitumen that is blended with lighter hydrocarbons\u2014typically natural gas condensates\u2014to create a lighter, less viscous, and more easily transportable material. Dilbit may be blended as 25% to 30% condensate and 70% to 75% bitumen. 3. Synthetic bitumen (Synbit) is typically a combination of bitumen and SCO. Blending the lighter SCO with the heavier bitumen results in a product that more closely resembles conventional crude oil. Typically the ratio is 50% synthetic crude and 50% bitumen, but blends\u2014and their resulting properties\u2014may vary significantly.", "Crude oil imports from Canada accounted for the largest percentage (43%) of imports by nation (based on 2015 data). In 2005, the United States imported approximately 217 million barrels of oil-sands-derived crude oils from Canada.

Policymakers may consider whether there is a rationale for exempting certain types of crude oils from the excise tax. On the other hand, some may contend the equity concern is overstated, considering the tax is relatively small (9 cents per barrel in 2017) compared to the recent per-barrel prices for crude oil. Although the price of crude oil fluctuates, over the past 10 years (2006-2015), the price of imported crude oil averaged about $85 per barrel (in 2015 dollars).", "At present, it is unclear to what degree importers of oil-sands-derived crude oils are paying the OSLTF excise tax. For example, ExxonMobil recently stated that it paid the excise tax on its oil-sands-derived crude oil that was involved in the 2013 pipeline spill in Arkansas. Moreover, the IRS memorandum stated that \"crude oil and/or petroleum products that are comingled with tar sands are subject to the excise tax on petroleum imposed by \u00a7 4611.\" This statement suggests that the bitumen component in dilbit would not be subject to the tax, while the non-bitumen component would. As mentioned above, the ratio of these components may vary: Dilbit typically includes a mixture of bitumen (70%-75%) and a non-bitumen component (25%-30%), often natural gas condensate. ", "Assuming most importers are not paying the OSLTF excise tax for imported oil sands, the difference in scope could lead to situations in which expenditures from the trust fund are used to clean up spilled oil that was not subject to the tax supporting the trust fund. ", "The OSLTF arguably plays a backup role in terms of response funding during many oil spills. Although the trust fund is available to support oil spill cleanup efforts, the responsible party for an oil spill often provides the primary source of response (i.e., cleanup) funding. The federal government has the statutory authority to direct response activities, including those of the responsible party. Moreover, OPA Section 1015 authorizes the Attorney General (at the request of the Secretary of Homeland Security) to recover costs or damages paid from the OSLTF. Thus, the financial impact to the trust fund could be minimal if the majority of its payments are reimbursed by the responsible parties. This was the case with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. ", "However, OPA provides liability limits (or caps) for responsible parties. These limits vary by oil spill source. For example, onshore facilities, including pipelines, have a liability limit for response costs and applicable damages (e.g., natural resource damages and specific economic damages). The Coast Guard issued a final rule in November 2015 that increased this limit from $350 million to $634 million. ", "Liability limits may be an issue at the Enbridge pipeline spill in Michigan. As noted above, Enbridge recently estimated that the company's response costs could reach approximately $1.2 billion, well above the liability limit for an onshore facility. OPA allows responsible parties to seek reimbursement from the trust fund if a party's response costs and damages exceed its liability limit. ", "However, the limits are conditional. First, the liability limits do not apply to situations involving acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Second, liability limits do not apply if the violation of a federal safety, construction, or operating requirement proximately caused the spill. Third, parties must report the incident and cooperate with response officials to maintain their liability caps.", "Therefore, if a party's liability limit remains valid, the OSLTF could effectively pay\u2014up to a per-incident cap of $1 billion\u2014for response costs and applicable damages above a responsible party's liability limit.

As noted above, such a scenario may not substantially impact the OSLTF unless the federal government were unable to recover the trust fund's costs from a responsible party (or parties). Regardless, the different definitions raise a potential equity concern. ", "The IRS interpretation of the definition of \"crude oil\" is based on a statement from a committee report from 1980 that was repeated in 1986. At that time, U.S. deposits of oil sands were known but not extracted on a commercial scale for energy purposes. This remains the case today, although some parties are expected to begin operations to extract deposits in Utah.", "Canadian oil sands accounted for a relatively minor proportion of Canadian crude oil production (0.6%) in 1980. However, Canadian oil sands production has steadily increased since that time. Moreover, the 1980 committee report specifically exempted \"synthetic petroleum, e.g., shale oil, liquids from coal, tar sands\" from the definition of \"crude oil.\" At that time, virtually all Canadian oil sands production involved mining operations that subsequently upgraded the bitumen to \"synthetic crude oil\" before transporting it to the United States. In more recent years, Canadian production of oil sands has included in situ operations that have predominantly employed the process of blending the bitumen with diluents to facilitate transport. Some may assert that blended bitumen would not be considered \"synthetic petroleum,\" but others may argue that blended bitumen would still be considered \"liquids from tar sands.\" Further, some Canadian mining operations have also begun to blend bitumen for transport as opposed to upgrading.", "Policymakers may choose to reexamine the rationale for excluding particular materials from the definition of \"crude oil\" in the context of the IRC. The tax code's definition of \"domestic crude oil\" may also be subject to reassessment if U.S. oil sands resources become commercially viable for energy purposes. "], "subsections": []}]}}
