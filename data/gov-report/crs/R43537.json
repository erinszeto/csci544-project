Stafford Emergency Relief and Disaster Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288, as amended) authorizes the President to issue declarations for incidents ranging from destructive, large-scale disasters to more routine, less damaging events. Declarations trigger federal assistance in the forms of various response and recovery programs under the Stafford Act to state, local, and tribal governments. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the primary funding source for disaster response and recovery.", "Funds from the DRF are used to pay for ongoing recovery projects from disasters occurring in previous fiscal years, meet current emergency requirements, and as a reserve to pay for upcoming incidents. The DRF is funded annually and is a \"no-year\" account, meaning that unused funds from the previous fiscal year (if available) are carried over to the next fiscal year. In general, when the balance of the DRF becomes low, Congress provides additional funding through both annual and supplemental appropriations to replenish the account.", "The federal government provides a significant amount of money to state and local governments each year for emergency and major disasters. For example, Congress provided roughly $120 billion for Hurricane Katrina and $60 billion for Hurricane Sandy recovery. Even in years with relatively few major disasters, it is not uncommon for the federal government to annually appropriate between $2 billion and $6 billion to help pay for recovery projects. Studies and analyses of disasters indicate that there has been an uptick in the number of major disasters declared each year. In addition, scholars of disaster policy and other experts such as climatologists expect disasters to increase in both frequency and in costs in the near future.", "Federal disaster assistance expenditures are influenced by both external and internal factors. External factors that increase federal spending on disaster costs include increases in the frequency and magnitude of weather related events, and increases in population size and development\u2014especially in coastal and other flood prone areas. Internal factors also influence how much assistance is provided and include disaster assistance policies that have evolved over time that have expanded the federal role in emergency and major disaster declarations such as altering declaration criteria and adjusting the federal cost-share for response and recovery.", "Congressional interest in disaster assistance has always been high given the amount of money provided to states and localities, but also because of increasing disagreements over the appropriate role of the federal government in providing assistance. Other congressional concerns include the use of supplemental appropriations to pay for disaster relief, offsetting expenditures for disaster assistance, and whether some of the federal burden for disaster assistance should be shifted to states and localities.", "This report describes the declaration process and the types of declarations that can be issued under the Stafford Act: (1) emergency and major disaster declarations, and (2) Fire Management Assistance Grants. The report also examines how the DRF is financed.

Others argue that the federal government should increase the amount of funding provided to states and localities for emergency and major disaster declarations. Still others argue that policy options that reduce federal costs for emergency and major disaster declarations or reduce the number of supplemental appropriations needed (or both) should be pursued. Policy proposals that could help achieve these ends include:", "appropriating more funds for the DRF to reduce the need for supplemental funding, restructuring the budget procedures for disaster assistance, creating alternative funding methods such as a rainy-day fund or a contingency fund, reducing federal costs by eliminating unrelated spending in disaster funding bills, altering policies that would limit the number of declarations issued each year, and converting some or all disaster assistance to disaster loans.", "This report concludes with policy questions that may help frame future discussions concerning federal emergency and disaster relief.", "This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of the Disaster Relief Fund", "paragraphs": ["The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), sometimes referred to as the President's Disaster Relief Fund, is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The DRF is the main account used to fund a wide variety of disaster assistance programs that provide grants and other forms of support to assist state, local, and tribal governments, as well as certain nonprofit entities during disaster recovery. The DRF is also used to fund Mission Assignments. Mission Assignments are used by FEMA to task and reimburse other federal entities that provide direct assistance during emergency and major disaster declarations. The DRF functions as a reserve for potential, future incidents, as well as an account to pay for ongoing projects to recover from past disasters.", "The majority of assistance provided by the federal government in response to emergency and major disaster declarations is funded through the DRF. The DRF, however, is not used to fund the federal response to every type of incident. In general, funds from the DRF are released after the President has issued an emergency or major disaster declaration pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-288 , as amended, hereinafter the Stafford Act). Incidents that are not declared under the Stafford Act are either handled by states and localities without federal assistance, or the assistance is provided by another federal entity under its own authority using its own funding mechanism. For example, the Small Business Act authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to issue disaster loans to households and businesses in response to certain types of incidents. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also offers several permanently authorized programs to help farmers recover financially from a natural disaster, including federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), and emergency disaster loans.", "While not specifically authorized in statute, the DRF has been used to fund recovery projects for over four decades. Rather than an authorized account, the DRF is the product of legislation and federal policies that can be traced to the post-World War II era. Prior to that time, disaster response activities were funded primarily through local efforts and voluntary groups. In cases where the federal government did offer assistance, the needs of disaster victims and affected communities were funded on an as-needed basis through appropriations that were then allocated, pursuant to the legislation, by executive branch administrators and, ultimately, the President.

Emergency declarations are often made when a threat is recognized (for example, before a hurricane makes landfall) and are intended to supplement and aid the coordination of state and local efforts prior to the event, such as evacuations and protection of public assets.

Local governments must then request assistance from the state if responding to (or recovering from) the incident is beyond their capacity. Similarly, when a state is overwhelmed by an incident, the state governor may elect to request assistance from the federal government. Federal assistance is contingent on the gubernatorial request because the Stafford Act stipulates that the governor of an affected state must formally ask the President to issue an emergency or major disaster declaration.", "A President's declaration triggers the allocation of funds from the DRF, and the funding may be distributed from any one, or any combination, of three categories of disaster aid:", "1. Individual Assistance. Individual Assistance (IA) includes disaster housing for displaced individuals, grants for needs not covered by insurance, crisis counseling, and disaster-related unemployment assistance. 2. Public Assistance. Public assistance (PA), which is FEMA's largest funded program, helps communities absorb the costs of emergency measures such as removing debris and repairing or replacing structures such as public buildings, roads, bridges, and public utilities. 3. Hazard Mitigation. FEMA funds mitigation measures to prevent or lessen the effects of a future disaster through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.", "Even if the President issues an emergency or major disaster declaration, not all persons or entities affected by a disaster are eligible for disaster assistance.

While the President has the sole authority to issue an emergency or major disaster declaration, the determination to issue a FMAG declaration can be rendered either by the President or FEMA. In many instances they are issued by the FEMA Regional Director in coordination with FEMA headquarters. A FMAG declaration authorizes various forms of federal assistance, such as equipment, personnel, and grants to any state or local government for the control, management, and mitigation of any fire on public or private forest land or grassland that might become a major disaster. FMAG declarations are relatively modest in cost when compared to emergency declarations and major disaster declarations. A review of declarations under the Fire Management Assistance Grant Program shows the most expensive year was 1998, in which 53 declarations were made, accounting for obligations of roughly $105 million.

Figure 2 provides a list of major disasters that have cost more than $500 million from FY1996 to FY2013.", "Congressional concern over the number and amount of supplemental appropriations needed to fund disaster assistance has led to congressional debate concerning how the DRF should be budgeted, and whether the federal government is providing too much or too little assistance.

Prior to P.L. 112-25 , the Budget Control Act of 2011 (hereinafter the BCA) the following data points were used to determine budget requests for the DRF: (1) the available appropriation in the DRF; (2) the monthly average of \"normal,\" non-catastrophic disaster costs paid from the DRF; (3) the monthly average of catastrophic incident costs; and (4) the estimated monthly \"recoveries\" of unobligated funds. ", "1. Available Appropriation. The available appropriation was a combination of prior-year funds that are carried over, the current fiscal year annual appropriation, and any supplemental appropriations. 2. DRF Monthly Average. The calculation for the DRF monthly average was based on a five-year rolling average of the cost of \"normal,\" non-catastrophic disasters. Normal, non-catastrophic disasters were, and continue to be, defined by FEMA as incidents that cost less than $500 million. The rationale of excluding large events from the calculation is discussed later in this report. 3. Monthly Cost Estimates for Catastrophic Events. Estimates obtained from the field on pending (still open) disaster projects were routinely used in calculating monthly cost estimates. 4. Estimated Recoveries. Estimated recoveries represent the recovery of obligated funds that have not been used. This could include duplication of benefit funds as well as long-term projects for PA or mitigation that either were not finished, or were completed at a lower cost.", "The end-of-fiscal-year projection was estimated by subtracting the cumulative DRF monthly averages and cost estimates for incidents from the available appropriation. Then, the cumulative recoveries were added back to the available balance. The DRF end-of-fiscal-year estimate was then revised on a monthly basis taking into consideration the actual obligations that were recorded in lieu of the monthly estimates, and new estimates submitted for \"open\" incidents. ", "Based on the above methodology, the average annual budget request submitted for the DRF from FY2000 to FY2011 was roughly $2 billion. The average spend-out rate for the DRF over that same period was $350 million per month, or $4.2 billion a year. It could be argued that without resources beyond the request and regular appropriation, the DRF would have faced a shortfall in its budget in an average operating year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budgeting for the DRF after the BCA", "paragraphs": ["The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (hereinafter the BBEDCA), as amended by the BCA, limits\u2014or caps\u2014the budget authority available for discretionary programs each fiscal year through FY2021.

The allowable adjustment to the discretionary cap for disaster relief is not solely for the DRF. This allowable adjustment can be changed and there are adjustments each fiscal year by no more than the average funding provided for disaster relief over the previous 10 fiscal years\u2014excluding the highest and lowest years\u2014plus any amount by which the prior year's appropriation was below the maximum allowable cap adjustment for that year. The actual adjustment is determined during the appropriations process.", "FEMA reports that the BCA necessitated the development of a new, two-part approach to accounting for disaster-related activity, with one approach for major disasters and another for all other DRF activity:", "Essentially, requests for DRF funding for FEMA's Stafford Act programs and disaster support activities fall into two categories: disaster relief cap adjustment and base/non-major disasters. Funding requested under the disaster relief cap adjustment is for major disasters declared pursuant to the Stafford Act and designated by the Congress as being for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of the BBEDCA, as amended by the BCA. Funding requested under the base/non-major disasters category includes Emergencies, Pre-disaster Surge Support, Fire Management Assistance Grants and activities that are non-disaster specific, such as Disaster Readiness Support (DRS) activities (e.g., distribution centers, reservist training, etc.). ", "The funding request for major disasters is based on FEMA's spending plans for all past declared major disasters. The non-catastrophic funding request is based on a revised approach that uses a 10-year average for non-catastrophic events. FEMA argued that using a 10-year average of costs as opposed to the previous use of a 5-year average of costs \"provides a more accurate projection of non-catastrophic needs since it normalizes the effects of outlier years.\" ", "As shown in Table 2 , FEMA's new, two-part approach to accounting for disaster-related activity has resulted in higher Administration budget requests for DRF funding. For example, as mentioned previously, from FY2000 to FY2011, the average annual DRF budget request was $2 billion and the average annual spend-out rate was $4.2 billion. The Administration requested almost $6.1 billion for the DRF for FY2013 ($5.481 billion for the disaster relief cap adjustment and $608 million for base/non-major disasters) and nearly $6.2 billion in FY2014 ($5.626 billion for the disaster relief cap adjustment and $570.5 million for base/non-major disasters). The enactments for those years were $7 billion and $6.2 billion respectively. ", "It appears that the allowable adjustment has allowed the DRF to be funded at historically high levels in recent years without supplementals (with the exception of the Sandy supplemental). However, this mechanism will expire, along with the caps, after FY2021. Some might question whether the problem of underfunding the DRF before the BCA will reoccur. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DRF Monthly Report", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the BCA, Congress has passed additional legislation enabling it to exercise greater control over federal disaster assistance funding. For example, since Hurricane Katrina, a number of measures have been passed requiring FEMA to publish status reports on the DRF. P.L. 109-62 requires the Inspector General of DHS to conduct audits and investigations for Hurricane Katrina response and recovery activities and for the Secretary of DHS to provide (at a minimum) a weekly report to the Committees on Appropriations detailing the allocation and obligation of funds for Hurricane Katrina.

The report also provides Mission Assignment obligations by agency. The requirements established by PKEMRA have since been reauthorized through various appropriations laws. ", "Perhaps one of the most useful aspects of the DRF report to policy makers is the DRF Appropriations Summary (see Figure 3 for an example). Since the passage of the BCA, the summary report now divides funding information into \"Major Declarations\" and \"Base\" categories (costs associated with every other activity funded through the DRF\u2014such as support activities, emergency declarations, and FMAGs) and provides information on how much funding was received for the DRF through annual and supplemental appropriations.

In addition, in some cases DRF funds are disbursed before an insurance company pays for damages. In such cases the recipient must pay back the amount provided by the insurance company. These too are considered recoveries.", "In the past there have been occasions when the DRF was near depletion. In an effort to keep the DRF solvent, FEMA implemented what is known as Immediate Needs Funding (INF) guidance. INF allows FEMA to divert funds from long-term projects to focus on immediate, lifesaving response and recovery efforts. The INF guidance stayed in effect until the DRF was replenished. FEMA typically steps up its efforts in identifying recoveries when INF guidance is implemented because retrieving recoveries has been an effective stopgap measure when the account has been low. Over the last two or three years, however, FEMA has become more adept at identifying recoveries in its day-to-day operations. As a consequence, FEMA may not be able to rely on as many recoveries in the future implementation of INF guidance.

In addition, supplemental appropriations for disasters may result in unnecessarily high funding levels, as early damage estimates may overstate actual needs; and supplemental appropriations for disasters provide a vehicle for non-germane provisions in the legislation that may not pass on their own, or make the appropriation legislation contentious, thus slowing down the delivery of federal disaster assistance.", "Advocates of the use of supplemental disaster assistance would argue that:", "the timing and severity of disasters cannot be anticipated and appropriating a relatively large sum of funds through the regular, annual appropriations process may require Congress to reduce funding for other programs to pay for an unknown, and possibly non-existent, future event; the President is authorized to unilaterally determine when federal assistance is made available after a major disaster incident. Congress retains authority to control federal spending by voting on supplemental appropriations. In essence, the use of supplemental appropriations for disasters enables Congress to express its own preferences in disaster assistance; DRF balances may be subject to transfer or rescission, which may carry an additional negative consequence if a large disaster were to take place after the funds have been withdrawn.

Furthermore, the balance for a rainy-day fund would increase during periods in which there are few or relatively small disasters.

For example, Congress appropriated roughly $120 billion for Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts and $60 billion for Hurricane Sandy.

Funds from the contingency fund would only be disbursed under certain conditions or incidents. For example, there have been discussions concerning the addition of a new category of disaster declaration known as a \"catastrophic declaration\" for events characterized by extraordinary devastation. Historic events that might qualify for a catastrophic declaration are the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina. A catastrophic declaration might be used for a nuclear bomb explosion, a tsunami hitting a highly populated area, or an immense and destructive earthquake, among others. The contingency fund could be the funding mechanism for catastrophic incidents.", "On the other hand, some might question the feasibility of a contingency fund. For one, the appropriation amount for a contingency fund capable of paying for an incident such as Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Sandy would be significant. In addition, large supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance have rarely been contentious because there is great a deal of sympathy toward disaster victims. It may be more difficult to pass a large appropriation in the absence of an incident\u2014particularly in light of the federal deficit. Large-scale disasters are infrequent incidents.

The current per capita amount used by FEMA to make recommendations is $1.32. Essentially, the estimated amount of public property damages caused by the incident is divided by the state's population. In general, if that amount exceeds $1.32 per person (in that state) FEMA will make a recommendation to the President that a major disaster declaration should be issued.

The DHS Inspector General pointed out that if the inflation adjustment had been occurring over that 13-year period, from 1986 to 1999, fully 36% fewer disasters would have qualified for a presidential declaration based on that factor. ", "The actual public announcement of factors used in considering a declaration did not become public until 1999. Until then, all of that information had been within the \"pre-decisional\" part of the process in the executive branch. That is not to say FEMA was not using the per capita amount in its considerations, only that the process was not widely known or understood as it presently is. As the DHS Inspector General noted, FEMA could have been raising that amount gradually since 1986. It is worth noting that when FEMA discussed such proposals (e.g., per capita figures gradually increasing) with Congress, the result was an amendment to the Stafford Act prohibiting the preclusion of a geographic area from receiving assistance solely by virtue of an arithmetic formula or sliding scale based on income or population.

The GAO report was a comprehensive review of FEMA's declaration criteria factors. GAO recommended that FEMA \"develop more objective and specific criteria to assess the capabilities of state and local governments to respond to a disaster\" and \"consider replacing the per capita measure of state capacity with a more sensitive measure, such as a state's total taxable resources.\"", "The state's Total Taxable Resources (TTR) were developed by the Department of the Treasury. GAO reported that TTR:", "is a better measure of state funding capacity in that it provides a more comprehensive measure of the resources that are potentially subject to state taxation. For example, TTR includes much of the business income that does not become part of the income flow to state residents, undistributed corporate profits, and rents and interest payments made by businesses to out-of-state stock owners. This more comprehensive indicator of state funding capacity is currently used to target federal aid to low-capacity states under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration's block grant programs. In the case of FEMA's Public Assistance program, adjustments for TTR in setting the threshold for a disaster declaration would result in a more realistic estimate of a state's ability to respond to a disaster.", "It could be argued that the use of TTR would conflict with the prohibition against the use of arithmetic formulas established by Congress. However, just as FEMA's per capita measurement is one of several factors considered and not the \"sole\" determinant of a declaration, GAO stated that TTR would not violate Section 320 because TTR could also be used with other criteria such as those identified in regulations. Thus, some could contend that TTR could fill a similar role with perhaps more accuracy.

The panel would then make recommendations to the President whether the circumstances of the incident were worthy of federal assistance based on their assessment.", "Some might argue that the use of an expert panel would make decisions about whether to provide assistance more objective. Others might argue that the use of a panel may slow down the declaration process and impede the provision of important assets and resources.

Some may contend, however, that efforts should be undertaken to reduce disaster costs by shifting more of the costs to the state and local levels by adjusting cost-shares.

The second column of Table 3 represents federal obligations and supplemental appropriations that have been provided for selected incidents.

However, for the purposes of Table 3 and Figure 4 it is assumed that the federal share is 75%. If the federal share for disaster assistance was reduced by 10% (see third column), federal assistance would be reduced by a total of $21.5 billion. If the federal share was reduced by 25% (see column 4), federal assistance would be reduced by a total of $53.9 billion (nearly enough to offset the federal costs for Hurricane Sandy).

Another option would be to make the cost-share arrangement not subject to administrative adjustment. Instead, the cost-share could only be adjusted through congressional action.", "While some might contend that adjusting the federal cost-share would be an effective mechanism for reducing federal disaster costs, others might argue doing so would be burdensome to states and localities.

In light of stated concern with the federal deficit, the increased federal involvement has raised policymaking questions concerning how disaster relief should be equitably funded. Some of these questions include the following:", "The model for emergency and disaster response is built on the premise that emergencies and disasters are local. Requests for assistance from the next level of government are made only if the lower unit of government is overwhelmed. Some would argue that some incidents funded by the federal government do not meet this requirement. An example might be snow removal or repairs after minor flooding. Is the federal government funding emergency and major disaster declarations that do not meet the criterion of the states being overwhelmed before requesting assistance? Are states using federal funding for disaster relief to protect their own budgets? Should federal disaster relief be subject to thresholds and maximums? For example, an emergency or major disaster might not receive federal funding unless damage estimates reach a certain level. While the current system does use a per capita amount, that level could be increased. As another example, the total amount of federal relief for an event could be capped at a certain amount. After this level has been reached, the state would then be responsible to pay for the rest of recovery. Should the state's fiscal capability factor into disaster relief? In 1986, FEMA proposed measures to reduce the amount the agency contributed toward disaster relief. One of the proposals argued that funding allocations should be made according to each state's ability to fund its own disaster relief. The determination would be based on a comparison of the state's per capita income with the national per capita income. The calculation would then be used to create a sliding scale for assistance. States capable of funding their own disaster relief would receive limited or no assistance. In contrast, struggling communities would be eligible to receive more federal assistance. Is federal assistance to states and localities unintentionally creating a disincentive for states and localities to prepare for emergencies and major disasters? Some may argue that federal funding for disaster relief through regular annual appropriations has become entrenched to the point that it has contributed to unintended consequences. For example, it has been argued that some states do not properly fund mitigation measures because there is a presumption that federal funding is virtually guaranteed should an emergency or major disaster occur. Those advocating this position could arguably point out that federal involvement in disaster relief will continue to increase and that in order to be fiscally responsible, changes should be made in the way in which disaster relief is funded. Others may claim the function of the federal government is to help states in their time of crisis. From this perspective, withholding or limiting the amount of funding a state could receive for an incident would be neglectful of that state's needs. As mentioned earlier, funding the DRF at a higher level through annual appropriations may give some the perception that the funds are not being used and could therefore be subject to rescissions or transfers. If larger appropriations for the DRF witnessed since the enactment of the BCA continue, will there be a temptation to transfer unobligated funds to other disaster assistance programs not authorized by the Stafford Act? For example, could the funds from the DRF be used to fund drought relief programs provided by the United States Department of Agriculture, or to fund fire assistance provided by the Department of the Interior? Would subsidizing other assistance programs negate the benefit of having a larger appropriation?", "These and other questions may be raised should Congress elect to debate the past and future funding of disaster relief.
