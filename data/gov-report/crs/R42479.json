Project approval and the receipt of federal funds are conditioned on the project sponsor (e.g., a local public works or state transportation agency) meeting certain standards and complying with federal law. Activities necessary to demonstrate compliance with those requirements may be completed at various stages of project development. Although the names of each stage may vary from state to state, project development generally includes the following: planning, preliminary design and environmental review, final design and rights-of-way acquisition, construction, and facility operation and maintenance.", "When there is debate over the time it takes to complete federal highway projects, the environmental review stage has been a primary focus of congressional attention concerning legislative options to speed project delivery. The current process includes activities necessary to demonstrate that all potential project-related impacts to the human, natural, and cultural environment are identified; effects of those impacts are taken into consideration (among other factors such as economic or community benefits) before a final decision is made; the public is included in that decision-making process; and all state, tribal, or federal compliance requirements applicable as a result of the project's environmental impacts are, or will be, met.", "Compliance requirements depend on site-specific factors, including the size and scope of the project, and whether and to what degree it may affect resources such as parks, historic sites, water resources, wetlands, or urban communities. For all proposed federal-aid highway projects, however, some level of review will be required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a74321 et seq.). Broadly, NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of an action before proceeding with it and to involve the public in the decision-making process.", "The time it takes to complete the NEPA process is often the focus of debate over project delays attributable to the overall environmental review stage. However, the majority of FHWA-approved projects require limited documentation or analyses under NEPA. Further, when environmental requirements have caused project delays, requirements established under laws other than NEPA have generally been the source. This calls into question the degree to which the NEPA compliance process is a significant source of delay in completing either the environmental review process or overall project delivery. Causes of delay that have been identified are more often tied to local/state and project-specific factors, primarily local/state agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or late changes in project scope. Further, approaches that have been found to expedite environmental reviews involve procedures that local and state transportation agencies may implement currently, such as efficient coordination of interagency involvement; early and continued involvement with stakeholders interested in the project; and identifying environmental issues and requirements early in project development.", "Bills in the House and Senate (the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act of 2012 (H.R. 7) and Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21; S. 1813)) would reauthorize DOT programs.

Broadly, for federally funded highway projects, it involves two separate, but related processes\u2014preparing appropriate documentation required under NEPA; and identifying and demonstrating compliance with any additional state, tribal, or federal environmental requirements applicable to that project.", "For a given project, how NEPA and other environmental compliance requirements must be demonstrated will largely depend on the degree to which the proposed project would have adverse effects on communities, natural or cultural resources (e.g., wetlands, endangered species habitat, historic sites, parks, or recreation areas), or special status land (e.g., farmland, floodplains, or coastal zones). Compliance with those requirements may include obtaining a permit, approval, study, or some level of analysis or consultation from an agency outside DOT.", "NEPA was intended, in part, to ensure that federal agencies would consider the environmental impacts of an action among other factors (e.g., economic or community benefits) in the federal decision-making process. NEPA has two primary aims\u2014to assure that federal agencies consider the environmental effects of their actions before proceeding with them and to involve the public in the decision-making process. ", "NEPA does not require an agency to elevate environmental concerns above other factors in the overall federal decision-making process. If the adverse environmental effects of a proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated, an agency is not constrained by NEPA from deciding that other project benefits outweigh the environmental costs and moving forward with the action. In contrast, other requirements applicable to federal-aid highways may dictate or somehow affect the outcome of a project decision. For example, other federal laws may require the selected project alternative to be the one with the least impact to a particular resource, prohibit FHWA approval of a project alternative that uses certain resources, require certain mitigation measures to limit a project's impacts, or require that certain activities take place in accordance with certain criteria (e.g., as specified in a permit or approval)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Environmental Reviews and Project Delays", "paragraphs": ["Required elements of the environmental review process, particularly compliance with NEPA, will have an effect on project development. For example, before DOT can approve a project and allow final project design, property acquisition, or project construction to proceed, the project sponsor must appropriately document compliance with NEPA and complete any investigation, review, or consultation necessary to demonstrate compliance with other applicable environmental requirements. Further, it is DOT policy to use the NEPA compliance process as a mechanism to balance transportation decision making by taking into account the potential impacts on the human and natural environment and the public's need for safe and efficient transportation.", "State and local transportation agency officials and other stakeholders with an interest in transportation improvement generally acknowledge that elements of the environmental review process provide important protections to the human, cultural, and natural environment. However, those officials also sometimes argue that completing the process can be difficult and time-consuming. Some have argued, for example, that the time it takes to complete required NEPA documentation and supporting analysis or to obtain required input or approval from outside agencies can delay completion of federally funded transportation projects.", "It is generally not disputed that the time it takes to complete the environmental review process for federally funded highway projects can take months or even years. What is unclear is the degree to which elements of the environmental review process directly or routinely delay project delivery. Determining the time it takes to complete activities associated with the environmental review process, or delays directly attributable to those activities, is difficult for several reasons including, but not limited to: ", "Limits to available data . There is no centralized source of data regarding highway project delivery. States generally do not track project development time from planning to construction. States generally do not attempt to isolate elements of the environmental review process, which may overlap with preliminary project planning, design, or engineering activities. Further, there is no standard measure for determining when a project or the environmental review process, in particular, is completed \"quickly\" or would be considered \"delayed.\" The influence of local factors on project delivery. The environmental review process may start, stop, and restart for reasons unrelated to environmental issues. Local and state issues have been shown to have the most significant influence on whether a project moves forward relatively quickly or takes longer than anticipated. Those issues include the project's level of priority among others proposed in the state; changes in funding availability; and local controversy or opposition to the project (which may or may not be connected to environmental issues). The v ariation in project type and complexity. The wide range of projects approved under programs administered by FHWA (e.g., bridge repair versus major new highway construction) do not easily allow an \"apples to apples\" comparison of the time it takes to complete the environmental review process or factors that may delay it. Anecdotal evidence regarding projects identified as \"delayed\" have involved multiple, complex causes of delay (including local issues) unique to that project, not a single cause that may be commonly applicable to other projects. Variation among state requirements and implementation processes . The effect of requirements under federal law may be difficult to isolate since local, state, or tribal requirements and procedures will also affect how environmental compliance requirements are implemented. State DOTs implement their project delivery process differently, depending on factors specific to their state and its needs. For example, some states may implement unique design and contracting processes that expedite project delivery that other states do not. Time \" saved \" cannot be gauged. Depending on the scope and complexity of the project, more time spent addressing environmental issues in the project planning and preliminary design stage may result in faster completion of final design and project construction (when delays may require actions that take more time and money to address). Time may also be saved when adverse project impacts that could lead to local opposition to the project are identified and addressed during the early stages of project development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Tying Project Delays to NEPA Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Transportation agency officials and project sponsors have broadly identified environmental compliance requirements as a common source of frustration in completing the project development process. However, limits to and contradiction in available data make it difficult to clearly identify specific causes of delay that are directly and routinely attributable to specific elements of environmental compliance. Identifying a distinct root cause of a delay will arguably be necessary before effective \"solutions\" (procedures that would result in faster project delivery) can be identified. That is, knowing that a delay occurred may be irrelevant if it is not determined why the delay occurred. An understanding of why is useful in identifying a solution that directly addresses a problem's underlying cause.", "Determining why a project was delayed may be difficult or may be attributable to multiple, interrelated factors. Generally, the more complex the project, the more complex the potential cause(s) of delay. For example, compared to a maintenance or repair project, a major new construction project will require more extensive review, documentation, or analysis to demonstrate compliance with NEPA and other applicable environmental requirements. However, the following factors call into question the degree to which NEPA alone is a significant source of project delay in overall project development:", "The majority of projects require limited review under NEPA. The majority of FHWA-approved projects (approximately 96%) involve no significant environmental impacts and, hence, require limited documentation, analysis, or review under NEPA. Compliance with DOT's \"NEPA regulations\" extend s beyond what is required under NEPA. DOT's \"Environmental Impact and Related Procedures\" prescribe the policies and procedures to ensure that FHWA-approved projects will comply with NEPA as well as requirements established under Title 23 applicable to Federal-aid Highways (e.g., provisions applicable to the consideration of adverse economic, social, and environmental effects (under \u00a7109(h)), public hearings (\u00a7128), and preservation of parklands (\u00a7138)). The NEPA compliance process is used to demonstrate compliance with all applicable environmental review requirements . It is DOT policy that any investigation, review, or consultation necessary to demonstrate compliance with applicable environmental requirements be completed within the context of the NEPA process. This use of NEPA as an \"umbrella\" compliance process can blur the distinction between what is required under NEPA and what is required under separate authority.", "Transportation agency officials asked to identify sources of frustration or delay in completing the environmental review process most commonly cite compliance requirements applicable to the protection of parklands, historic sites, wetlands, or threatened or endangered species. The potential root cause of delay in complying with those requirements could be attributable to a wide range of project-specific factors (e.g., incomplete permit applications, challenges in obtaining multiple approvals or permits for a complex project, or disagreement with a resource agency over appropriate methods to mitigate project impacts).", "Both existing law and regulations implementing NEPA include explicit directives and requirements intended to streamline the NEPA process. Included among those requirements are procedures intended to coordinate efficient agency interaction and cooperation, reduce NEPA-related paperwork and duplication of effort (e.g., documentation and analysis that may be required by similar state, tribal, or federal requirements or from one stage of project development to the next), and integrate the consideration of environmental compliance issues in a project's planning stage. Barriers to efficiently implementing existing requirements may be project-specific or involve issues that may be difficult to address by simply amending or eliminating existing federal requirements.", "This is not to suggest that there are not instances where preparation of documentation and analysis required under NEPA is not time-consuming or may contribute to delays in project delivery. However, it is unclear whether or what additional federal requirements may be implemented to expedite the NEPA process. Conversely, it is not clear whether the elimination of certain NEPA-specific requirements may expedite project delivery or would alter the framework for coordinating an already complex compliance process, resulting in additional project delay. For a given project, whether changes to the NEPA process might result in faster project delivery will likely depend on the project's scope and complexity; the degree to which it is affected by \"local\" factors (e.g., state funding or project priorities); and compliance requirements applicable to the project, in addition to those under NEPA.

The debate rarely recognizes the issues that led Congress to enact the requirements that now make up that process. Requirements included within the environmental review process, and procedures to demonstrate compliance with them, have evolved over the past 50 years. However, many of the requirements that are subject to particular scrutiny today were enacted between 1966 and 1972.", "During the 1950s and 1960s, the public was becoming increasingly aware of and concerned about the impacts that human activity were having on the environment. Increasing attention turned to the effect that federally funded programs and projects were having on the human, cultural, and natural environment. One federal program that generated particular concern was the development and construction of the Interstate Highway System.", "The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (P.L. 84-627) authorized and provided revenue sources for the construction of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (commonly known as the Interstate Highway System, Interstate System, or the Interstate). The Interstate System is a network of limited-access roads including freeways, highways, and expressways forming part of the National Highway System of the United States. Construction of the Interstate System took approximately 35 years and resulted in a network of roads and bridges that currently includes over 45,000 miles of rural highways, suburban and urban freeways, and bridges.", "Although the connection of rural, urban, and suburban communities resulted in a host of economic and cultural benefits, construction of the Interstate System also brought certain adverse impacts to both the human and natural environment. Those impacts were seen particularly in the construction of the urban freeways. Planning for such projects often involved locating freeways within available open space or where land acquisition costs were relatively low. \"Available open space\" often meant historic sites, parks, or recreation areas. Adverse impacts to those resources from highway projects drew increased attention from newly formed stakeholder groups with an interest in environmental protection and historic preservation.", "Project planning that involved lower land acquisition costs often meant property acquisitions in densely populated, working-class or high-poverty neighborhoods. Resulting urban freeway projects had a disproportionate impact on the urban poor. One such example involved a segment of I-95 north of Miami. The route selected by local transportation officials cut through the inner-city community of Overtown, a once-thriving African-American community known as the \"Harlem of the South.\" A 2009 FHWA report discussing lessons learned in complying with environmental requirements describes the project as follows:", "In 1957, the Overtown community was almost decimated by the development of the I-95 and I-395 freeways. The constructed roadway had a disastrous impact on the economic and social structure of the community. The community continues to shoulder the lingering effects of those negative impacts, and as a result there is also persistent anger towards and distrust of [the Florida Department of Transportation].", "Opposition to other urban freeway projects led to \"freeway revolts\" spearheaded by newly established environmental and social justice groups. Freeway revolts took place in cities like Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, Reno, and San Francisco.

Several requirements (applicable primarily to activities that take place during the project planning, preliminary design, and environmental review phases of development) reflect concern over the effects of urban freeway construction (discussed above), including the following:", "Directive to establish guidelines to assure c onsider ation of adverse project impacts ( 23 U.S.C. \u00a7109(h)) . Directed DOT to establish guidelines to assure that possible adverse, economic, social, and environmental effects of proposed highway projects and project locations were fully considered during project development, and that final project decisions be made in the best overall public interest, taking into consideration the costs of eliminating or minimizing adverse effects to air, noise, and water pollution; destruction or disruption of man-made and natural resources; aesthetic values, community cohesion, and the availability of public facilities and services; adverse employment effects, and tax and property value losses; and injurious displacement of people, businesses, and farms. Directive to establish n oise standards ( 23 U . S.C. \u00a7109(i)) . Directed DOT to establish standards for highway noise levels compatible with different land uses. DOT cannot approve plans and specifications for any proposed federal-aid project unless it includes adequate measures to implement those noise standards. As implemented under DOT regulations, a project may be required to demonstrate compliance with applicable standards through an analysis of traffic noise impacts and, when necessary, to implement noise abatement measures. Public hearing s requirements ( 23 U . S.C. \u00a7128). For a proposed project bypassing or going through any city, town, or village, a state transportation department is required to certify that it held or afforded the opportunity for public hearings; considered the economic and social effects of the project location, and its impact on the environment; and considered the consistency of the project with local planning goals and objectives. Preservation of parklands requirements ( 23 U . S.C. \u00a7138). More commonly referred to as \"Section 4(f)\" requirements, DOT is prohibited from approving a project that uses publicly owned (local, state, or federal) parks and recreation areas, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and publicly or privately owned historic sites of national, state, or local significance. DOT may approve a project that uses a 4(f) resource only if there is no prudent and feasible alternative to do otherwise, and that use includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the resource.", "Of the requirements specifically applicable to Federal-aid Highways, the preservation of parklands requirements may have the greatest effect on highway project development and delivery. Projects that would use a 4(f) resource require an evaluation analyzing project alternatives (including location and design shifts) that avoid the resource. To be approved by FHWA, the evaluation must show that alternatives that would not use the resource would result in \"truly unique problems,\" resulting in costs or community disruption of extraordinary magnitude. This test is often referred to as the \"Overton Park Criteria,\" after a court case in the 1970s in Memphis, TN. In approving the use of a 4(f) resource, FHWA must also consider the significance and importance of the resource itself.", "SAFETEA amended Section 138 to allow for the use of a 4(f) resource if that use can be proven to have de minimis impacts to the resource. Generally, de minimis impacts would result from the use of minor amounts of a particular resource. Such a determination requires concurrence from an official with jurisdiction over the resource. For example, for a transportation project adjacent to a publicly owned park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge, FHWA would be required to consult with, as appropriate, agencies within the Department of the Interior (e.g., the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, or the Bureau of Indian Affairs) or state or local park authorities. For historic sites, a de minimis impacts determination must be based on criteria established under the National Historic Preservation Act applicable to uses that will have no \"adverse effect\" on the site (16 U.S.C. \u00a7470f). The determination must receive concurrence from the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and, if appropriate, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP). ", "Compared to other environmental requirements likely applicable to federal-aid highway projects, Section 4(f) is unique in its limits on the use of a protected resource. Most requirements intended to protect communities or specific natural or cultural resources allow for adverse project impacts if those impacts are sufficiently identified and considered in the decision-making process. Some requirements may specify that a project implement certain mitigation measures or be implemented in accordance with an approval or permit from an agency responsible for protecting that resource. An outright prohibition on the use of a particular resource, except for de minimis impacts or under extraordinary conditions, is not common to other environmental requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements Applicable to \"Federal Actions\"", "paragraphs": ["In the 1960s Congress debated legislative options to address potential adverse impacts associated with federal actions. An action may be deemed \"federal\" based on the role that a federal agency plays in a project's approval or funding.

Responsibility could be assumed for environmental reviews required under NEPA, or any federal law, for one or more highway projects within the state. As a condition of assuming federal authority, Congress required the state to waive its right to sovereign immunity against actions brought by citizens in federal court and consent to the jurisdiction of federal courts.

Those objections have centered largely around DOT's requirement applicable to rights-of-way (ROW) acquisitions in states that choose to assume federal authority under NEPA. As discussed earlier, one of NEPA's primary aims is to ensure that federal agencies consider the impacts of their actions before proceeding with them. The NEPA process cannot simply document a decision that has already been made. This requirement means that federal funds cannot be used for ROW acquisitions (an action that could indicate that a final project decision has been made) before the NEPA process is complete. Currently, states may make ROW acquisitions using state funds on an at-risk basis. That is, they may purchase land using state funds, but risk losing future federal funding for that purchase if the project ultimately involves an alternative that does not use that property. By assuming DOT's authority, a state would assume federal agency-level responsibility to comply with NEPA. DOT has found that would mean, in its capacity as a federal agency, the state would be precluded from making such advanced ROW acquisitions. ", "Some have argued that the loss of a state's ability to make at-risk ROW acquisitions has been a disincentive to states that may otherwise want to assume federal authority under NEPA. However, when the fear of taking on federal liability and subjecting the state to the jurisdiction of federal court were primary reasons that states did not want to assume NEPA authority, it is unclear how states could be protected from potential judicial review if they are allowed to complete a transaction that could appear to violate one of NEPA's primary goals. Although state DOTs may be willing to accept that risk, a state legislature may not, particularly when an incentive for a state to assume the federal role under NEPA is to eliminate FHWA's oversight of the NEPA process (e.g., FHWA's legal sufficiency review of an EIS)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Environmental Assessments (EAs)", "paragraphs": ["The third category of NEPA document is an EA.

In making that determination, multiple activities and decisions occur from the time a tribal or state DOT, metropolitan planning organization, or local program agency (such as a municipal public works agency) identifies a transportation-related need and a project addressing that need is constructed. ", "Each stage of project development is initiated and completed largely at the local, tribal, or state level, with ultimate project approval at the federal level\u2014from FHWA for federally funded highway projects. Although the names and details of each step may vary from state to state, they generally include project planning, preliminary design and environmental review, final design and right-of-way acquisition, and project construction. Activities common to each phase of the project development process, including maintenance activities that may take place after project construction, are described in Table 5 . The table also identifies potential environmental compliance obligations that may occur in each stage of project development.", "Frequently, \"environmental review\" is considered synonymous with \"NEPA compliance.\" That is not the case. However, completion of the NEPA compliance process and the overall environmental review process are linked by DOT's requirement that a project cannot be approved and subsequent stages of project development cannot proceed until the project sponsor appropriately documents compliance with NEPA and other applicable environmental requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Measuring Stages of Project Development", "paragraphs": ["There are distinct activities associated with each stage of project development. However, the following factors make it difficult to estimate the time it takes to complete each stage:", "Most state and local transportation agencies do not maintain a centralized source of data tracking the time it takes to complete transportation projects. Further, there is no acceptable measure of when a project is delivered in a timely manner versus delayed. A project or a stage of its development may be considered \"delayed\" if it took the project sponsor longer than anticipated. Most state and local transportation agencies do not attempt to extract and measure the time it takes to complete individual activities attributable to a single stage of development (e.g., activities categorized distinctly as applicable to \"environmental review\"). Further, tracking that data may be difficult since elements of one phase may overlap with another (e.g., project planning activities may include elements of environmental review) and a distinct start and end point of individual activities may be difficult to identify. Project development may start, stop, and restart for reasons unrelated to environmental compliance. For example, EIS preparation may begin with publication of a NOI, but preparation may stop and restart due to changes in state priorities, funding availability, or a host of other issues unrelated to NEPA. In such cases, the time between issuing a NOI and ROD are an inaccurate measure of the NEPA process. Differences between state DOT project development processes make it difficult to establish a nationally applicable measure of project development stages. Also, the influence of tribal- or state-specific environmental compliance requirements makes it difficult to isolate the time it takes to comply with federal requirements.", "Considering these points, it is difficult to determine either the time it takes to meet specific elements of the environmental review process (e.g., NEPA compliance or agency consultations under the Endangered Species Act) or the degree to which completing the process delays project delivery. Further, it is not possible to assert, with any degree of accuracy, broad, nationally applicable values to the time it takes to complete the environmental review process. For example, there are no data available to substantiate a statement such as \"environmental compliance accounts for X% to Y% of surface transportation project development time,\" or \"compliance with NEPA or Clean Water Act permitting requirements delays X% to Y% of projects for X to Y months/years.\" Instead, it may be possible to determine \"bridge reconstruction or rehabilitation in state A takes from X to Y months/years\" if state A is one that tracks such information.", "Also, it may be generally stated that the time it takes to deliver larger, more complex or controversial projects takes longer to complete than is typical for the majority of FHWA-approved highway projects (e.g., maintenance and rehabilitation projects). In addition to taking longer to complete due to their potential cost, size, and complexity, they will likely require compliance with more state, tribal, and federal requirements and may generate more public interest or opposition.", "In 2002, the General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report that attempted to determine the typical amount of time it takes to complete overall project delivery as well as individual phases of project development for certain federally funded highway projects. Data for this report were compiled based on the professional judgment of FHWA staff, staff of state departments of transportation, and transportation associations. According to FHWA, planning, gaining approval for, and constructing federally funded major highway projects that involved new construction typically took from nine to 19 years from planning to construction. FHWA estimated that the preliminary design and environmental review phase for those projects typically took from one to five years, depending on the complexity of the design and possible environmental impacts that must be considered. It was noted that projects studied in the GAO report included those that would typically require an EIS and represent a small percentage of federally funded projects. It was also noted that, while there are many reasons new highway construction projects may take a long time to complete, most studies on project delivery focused only on the timely resolution of environmental issues to improve project completion times, rather than examining all aspects of project development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Causes of Delay in Completing Environmental Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Although the extent to which the environmental review process may delay project delivery is unclear, it is generally not disputed that the time it takes to demonstrate compliance with environmental requirements can be time-consuming, particularly in cases where EIS preparation is required. Also, while transportation agency officials may cite elements of the environmental review process as a source of frustration or delay, it is not clear what specific environmental compliance requirements currently and routinely lead to project delays or the root cause of those delays. For example, a common complaint among transportation agency officials is that outside agencies (including FHWA review and approval of the final NEPA documents) do not provide necessary input or approval in a timely way. However, there is little information available that clearly indicates why that may be the case on anything other than a project-specific level.", "Few studies have looked at the root causes of project delay directly attributable to the environmental review process. Available studies have looked at a limited number of major new construction projects that required an EIS. By their nature, those projects involve unique project-specific issues and are likely to involve complex design, engineering, and compliance issues. Causes of delay for those projects more likely represent the exception and not the rule.", "A 2003 FHWA study that attempted to identify causes of delay in completing EISs was unable to identify common factors or conditions that directly or indirectly affected the time it took to complete the NEPA process. Although timing varied by broad geographic region, it did not seem to vary in relation to the majority of other variables considered (e.g., the presence of certain \"controversial issues\" or the required participation of agencies outside DOT). Instead, it was observed that the time it took to complete the NEPA process may have been more affected by external social and economic factors associated with broad geographic regions of the country.", "Subsequent, albeit limited, study data and anecdotal evidence regarding individual projects also point to factors external to environmental reviews as those most likely to delay the process. In particular, causes of delay in completing environmental reviews arise primarily from potentially overlapping local and project-specific issues including, but not limited to, the following:", "Local issues \u2014the project's level of priority among others proposed in the state; changes in funding availability; concerns of local property owners; or opposition to the project (which may or may not be connected to environmental issues).

If a project is delayed by requirements under those laws, that delay may be attributable to project-specific issues.", "Efforts to identify specific problems or causes of delay in meeting requirements other than NEPA have found differing perceptions among resource agency and transportation agency officials. For example, in completing its obligations as part of the environmental review process, resource agencies have identified poor communication, problems with the project's alternative analysis, being given incorrect or incomplete information, disagreements or differences of opinion among agencies, or environmental or biological issues associated with the project.

Among the principles identified was the \"Cost-Time Relationship,\" under which, the study found,", "More time spent in design identifying problems will reduce construction time and result in a shorter overall project time. A widely recognized principle is that spending more monies during planning and design will reduce the time and cost required for construction by avoiding unforeseen conditions, reducing to a minimum design errors and omissions, and developing schemes that will support the most efficient approach to construction. In the design phase, the opportunity to make decisions to influence the final project cost is greatest.

That event was the reconstruction of the I-35 bridge in Minneapolis after its August 1, 2007, collapse. A new bridge opened just over a year later on September 18, 2008. The timing of that bridge reconstruction led to the question \"Why can't all projects be completed that quickly?\"", "The answer to this question can be found, in part, in an FHWA study that examined how the key elements of the environmental review process were completed after a bridge collapse. A primary factor cited in the study was that, in the wake of an emergency, the major causes of surface transportation project delay are absent. The \"major causes of delay\" identified were a lack of funding or priority in the state for the project; local controversy; interested stakeholder or local opposition; or insufficient political support. Other potential causes of delay could still apply to emergency projects, including issues with the projects' complexity, poor consultant work, or the environmental review process.", "The FHWA study looked at the Minnesota bridge collapse as well as other projects that involved bridge reconstruction after a collapse.

However, the efficiency of that agency interaction did not begin with this project. FHWA observed that staff from state and federal agencies involved in the environmental review process had worked collaboratively on past projects. The agencies established lines of communication and understood the tasks and concerns of each other's agencies. Those existing relationships led to a quick response among those agencies after the bridge collapse.
