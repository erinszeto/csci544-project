This has involved public awareness campaigns; providing public health services, including information and access to contraceptives; publishing materials about STIs; and funding organizations to provide sexual education. The federal approach to teen pregnancy prevention has often reflected prevailing public views about sexuality and the role that the federal government should play in the private lives of its citizens. ", "Since the early 1980s, the federal government has supported programs that have an exclusive focus on preventing teen pregnancy. Discussion about these programs has often focused on the type of approaches to pregnancy prevention they should take. Some policymakers and other stakeholders in the teen pregnancy prevention field have contended that teens should not engage in sex before marriage to avoid unplanned pregnancies and protect against STIs. Further, they support the idea that teenagers need to hear a single, unambiguous message that sex outside of marriage is harmful to their physical and emotional health. This approach is sometimes referred to as \"abstinence-only,\" and more recently as \"sexual risk avoidance.\" ", "Other stakeholders have prioritized an approach that provides broad information to teenagers to help them make informed decisions about whether to engage in sex, and about using contraceptives if they do. They contend that such an approach allows young people to make choices regarding abstinence, gives them the information they need to set relationship limits and resist peer pressure, and provides them with information on the use of contraceptives and the prevention of STIs.", "Congress has authorized and provided funding for programs that take one or both of these approaches to preventing teen pregnancy. Of the current programs, the Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education and the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education programs focus exclusively on abstaining from premarital sex. The PREP program requires most grantees to place \"substantial emphasis on both abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy among youth and sexually transmitted infections.\" The TPP program does not necessarily focus on any one approach, and some grantees use multiple program models to meet the various needs of youth. For example, a TPP program grantee in South Carolina uses an evidence-based model that provides abstinence-only education and other evidence-based models that have broader approaches. ", "The general public appears to support educating teenagers about both abstinence and contraception. A nationally representative telephone survey conducted in 2017 for Power to Decide, an organization focused on preventing unplanned pregnancy, found that about 8 out of 10 adults believe teens should receive more information about abstinence and birth control and protection from sexually transmitted infections.

P.L. 111-117 also authorized the TPP program and required it to use models that are proven effective through rigorous evaluation in reducing teen pregnancy and related outcomes. Despite the connection to the TPP program, the review is intended to more broadly inform the teen pregnancy prevention field. ", "The TPP Evidence Review seeks to identify which teen pregnancy prevention models have been shown to be effective based on studies from the past 20 years. The review team prioritizes studies of programs based on whether they include youth ages 19 and younger and are intended to address teen pregnancy outcomes through some combination of educational, skill-building, or psycho-social interventions. The first review covered research released from 1989 through January 2010. Subsequent reviews have since been conducted on an annual or biannual basis to incorporate new research, including newly available evidence for programs that were previously reviewed.", "These studies must have one statistically significant impact on at least one of five areas: (1) sexual activity, (2) number of sexual partners, (3) contraceptive use, (4) STIs or HIV, and (5) pregnancies. In addition, the studies must examine impacts of programs using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental impact study designs. For the studies that meet these initial criteria, reviewers assign each one a rating of high, moderate, or low quality based on whether it uses RCTs and quasi-experimental design, has relatively low attrition, controls for differences between the treatment and comparison groups, and meets certain other criteria.", "After its latest round of studies, the TPP Evidence Review includes 41 evidence-based program models. Evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs are varied and approach the problem from different frameworks. HHS categorizes the evidence-based models based on certain key features. For example, three of the models use an abstinence-only approach and some of the models incorporate information about abstinence. Other models focus on sexual health education, youth development, clinic-based services, and/or youth with certain histories (e.g., youth who are incarcerated). Programs differ based on their outcomes, settings (e.g., schools, clinics, homes, afterschool programs), session length and duration over time, and target population (e.g., males, females, African American youth, Hispanic youth, low-income youth, rural youth).

In response, HHS undertook a multi-year evaluation that included a study of how grantees in four states implemented abstinence education programs and a separate study that rigorously evaluated whether grantees' programs had impacts on teen sexual abstinence and related outcomes. The programs targeted youth in elementary and middle school and engaged them as part of the school setting, including in afterschool programming. Each youth participated for more than 50 hours. The study tracked outcomes for youth four and six years after they were enrolled in it. The impact evaluation found that youth who received abstinence education under the program did not have different outcomes than youth in the control group. They were no more likely than their peers in the study to have abstained from sex."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Sexual Risk Avoidance Education Program", "paragraphs": ["As noted, federal funding has supported abstinence-only education through the Community-Based Abstinence Education program (FY2001 through FY2009) and the Competitive Abstinence-Only program (FY2012 through FY2015).
