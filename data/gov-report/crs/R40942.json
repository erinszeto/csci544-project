Individuals will be required to maintain minimum essential coverage, which includes eligible employer coverage, individual coverage, grandfathered plans, and federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, among others. Employers are not explicitly required to provide health benefits, although certain employers with more than 50 employees may be required to pay a penalty if either (1) they do not provide insurance, under certain circumstances, or (2) the insurance they provide does not meet specified requirements.

Individuals will only be eligible to enroll in an exchange plan if they are not enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, or acceptable employer coverage as a full-time employee.

According to the CBO, the gross 10-year cost of the exchange subsidies ($464 billion), increased federal Medicaid and CHIP outlays ($434 billion), and tax credits for small employers ($40 billion) will total $938 billion. These costs will be partially offset by $150 billion over the 10-year budget window, from four sources: net revenues from the excise tax on high-premium insurance plans ($32 billion); penalty payments by uninsured individuals ($17 billion); penalty payments by employers whose workers received subsidies via the exchanges ($52 billion); and other budgetary effects, mostly on tax revenues, associated with the expansion of federally subsidized insurance ($48 billion). Taking into account these offsets, the net cost of the coverage provisions, according to the CBO analysis, would be $788 billion over 10 years.

Excluding coverage for preexisting conditions refers to the case in which an applicant for coverage is offered a health insurance policy but that policy does not provide benefits for certain medical conditions.)

In addition, the Labor Secretary is authorized to adopt regulatory standards or to issue orders that a person engaged in the business of providing insurance through a MEWA is subject to the laws of the state in which such person operates. PPACA also allows the Labor Secretary to issue cease and desist orders against certain MEWAs if it appears to the Secretary that the alleged conduct of the MEWA is fraudulent, creates an immediate danger to the public safety or welfare, or is causing or can be reasonably expected to cause significant, imminent, and irreparable public injury."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wellness Programs Offered by Employers/Private Insurers", "paragraphs": ["While the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits group health plans and group health insurance issuers from imposing higher premiums or contributions among \"similarly situated\" participants based on certain health-related factors, it does allow the provision of premium discounts, rebates, or reduced cost-sharing for enrollee participation in wellness programs. Among other provisions related to wellness programs, PPACA codifies an amended version of the HIPAA wellness program regulations. Consistent with current regulation, the law indicates that wellness programs that do not require an individual to satisfy a standard related to a health factor as a condition for obtaining a reward (or do not offer a reward) would not violate HIPAA, so long as participation in the programs is made available to all similarly situated individuals. However, if any of the conditions for obtaining a reward under a wellness program are based on an individual meeting a certain standard relating to a health factor, the program must meet additional requirements. Among these requirements, the reward must be capped at 30% of the cost of the employee-only coverage under the plan, but the Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury would have the discretion to increase the reward up to 50% of the cost of coverage if the increase is determined to be appropriate. Further, this type of wellness program must be reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease. A program complies with this requirement if it has a reasonable chance of improving the health of, or preventing disease in, participating individuals and it is not overly burdensome; is not a subterfuge for discriminating based on a health status factor; and is not highly suspect in the method chosen to promote health or prevent disease. PPACA also requires the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor, to establish a 10-state pilot program no later than July 1, 2014, in which participating states must apply the wellness program provisions to health insurers in the individual market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Report on Self-Insured Plans and Study of Large Group Market", "paragraphs": ["PPACA requires that not later than one year after enactment, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of Labor prepare an annual report, using data collected from the Form 5500 on self-insured group health plans, including plan type, number of participants, benefits offered, funding arrangements, benefit arrangements, assets, liabilities, contributions, investments, and expenses. The law also requires that the Secretary of HHS, not later than one year after enactment, conduct a study of the fully insured and self-insured group health plan markets, to compare the characteristics of employers, health plan benefits, financial solvency, capital reserve levels, and the risks of becoming insolvent\u2014and to determine the extent to which new insurance market reforms are likely to cause adverse selection in the large group market or to encourage small and midsize employers to become self-insured.", "Appendix A.

The PPACA term \"immediate\" refers to the legal effective date of the provision.

For example, the administrative simplification provision is effective on enactment, but this sets in motion a series of implementation steps culminating in health plans certifying their use of the newly developed standards by December 31, 2015.

States are permitted to increase the percentages, but the Secretary may adjust the state percentage for the individual market if it is determined that the application of 80% would destabilize the market.
