About one-half of this assistance was provided through congressionalex gratia payments. (1) TheCompact of Free Association, which established the Marshall Islands as a \"freely associatedstate,\" (2) extended $150million for nuclear test-related compensation as part of a \"full and final settlement\" (3) of claims. Under Section 177(Article IX) of the Compact, additional compensation may be requested by the RMI, if loss ordamages to persons or property arose or were discovered that could not reasonably have beenidentified as of the effective date of the agreement and if such injuries rendered the provisions of theCompact \"manifestly inadequate.\" In September 2000, the Marshall Islands government submittedto the United States Congress a Changed Circumstances Petition requesting additional compensationpursuant to the Compact. The Petition requests compensation for personal injury awards, propertydamages (loss of use, restoration costs, and hardships suffered), health services infrastructure, ahealth care program, radiation exposure monitoring, and other programs. ", "The Petition justifies its claims of \"changed circumstances\" largely upon \"new andadditional\" information since the Compact's enactment -- declassified Department of Energy recordsin the early 1990s that indicated a wider extent of radioactive fallout than previously known ordisclosed and scientific findings that reduced the levels at which exposure to radiation was deemedsafe. As a result of, and in addition to, the above findings, the Petition and accompanying materialsargue that higher than expected health consequences and costs of health care and environmentalcleanup, as well as lower than expected investment returns from the Nuclear Claims Fund, constitutechanged circumstances. Furthermore, according to the Petition's supporting arguments, the NuclearClaims Fund constituted a provisional, \"political settlement\" rather than a final determination basedupon a conclusive scientific assessment of costs. The Petition contends that the U.S. Congressagreed to retain its authority, through legislation to approve the Compact ( P.L. 99-239 ), toappropriate additional compensation should the need arise.

(8) "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of Analysis", "paragraphs": ["The following sections summarize selected key issues related to the Changed CircumstancesPetition . These issues are analyzed in depth in subsequent sections of the report. The Petition'spersonal injury claims and health care requests are modeled after U.S. programs for compensatingradiation-exposed individuals, and based upon scientific studies establishing the areas of theMarshall Islands in which residents likely have been exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivecontamination. A National Cancer Institute (NCI) study, discussed below, provides support for theneed for compensation. However, as noted below, there is some dispute regarding the portion of theRMI population that has been exposed to radiation from the nuclear weapons tests. ", "The Petition's request for compensation to conduct further environmental restoration is basedon a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cleanup standard, and the RMI assertion that thecontamination is more widespread than previous surveys had found. The issue of whether the EPA'sstandard should apply to the cleanup of the Marshall Islands, as well as disagreement over the extentof contamination, are summarized here and examined later in the report. A significant amount ofthe property claim in the Petition is based on the claimants' \"loss of use\" calculations. This reportprovides an assessment of the methodology employed by the claimants in calculating \"loss of use.\"", "Test-Related Cancer Estimates. The NCI inSeptember 2004 estimated that nuclear testing would result in about 530 additional lifetime cancersamong the 14,000 Marshall Islands residents exposed to the testing. NCI also estimated that about5,600 cancers would have occurred in that population without the fallout exposure. Because thecancers caused by testing cannot be distinguished from cancers that would have occurred anyway,all victims of certain types of cancers are being compensated. NCI estimates that about half thecancers expected in the exposed population have yet to be diagnosed, so additional compensationclaims are likely.", "\"Loss of Use\" Methodology. In general, themethodology used by the NCT to estimate the value of the lost use of the claimants' property isconsidered to be reasonable and appropriate. For several reasons, however, the specific applicationof the methodology -- much of the critical data used, many of the assumptions, and certain statisticalprocedures applied (i.e., the sampling technique and the regression model) -- result in past and futureloss-of-use estimates that appear to be overstated, which leads to possibly excessive total damagesclaimed and awarded by the NCT. The main problem is with the use of inflated average rents peracre, which are estimated by applying an exponential regression model to unrepresentative sampledata that reflect RMI government-influenced rents, rather than competitive, free-market rents. Thiscan lead to an overestimate of not only past loss-of-use, but because estimated rents is a criticalvariable used as an input into future-loss-of-use calculations, a possible overestimate of futureloss-of-use as well. ", "The methodology also 1) assumes that more land is lost to use, and for longer periods thanis actually the case, 2) undervalues the rentals on alternative atoll habitation, and 3) assumes thatrecipients of rental proceeds, as consumers and savers, would have saved 100% of the rentalproceeds. Each of these assumptions can lead to an overestimate of past loss of use. ", "Cleanup Standards. The RMI argues that a morerecent U.S. radiation protection standard warrants further cleanup in the Marshall Islands. However,the Bush Administration contends that the standard applied to past cleanup efforts there remainsunchanged and that levels of contamination remain safe according to this standard. For cleanuppurposes, the RMI has adopted the standard established by the EPA for the cleanup of radioactivecontamination at Superfund sites in the United States. This standard limits annual exposure to 15millirems of radiation above natural background levels from all sources. The ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, P.L. 96-510 , reauthorized by P.L. 99-499 ) established the Superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites in the UnitedStates to a degree that would be safe for the intended land use of the site. EPA issued its 15 milliremstandard in 1997 as a non-binding guideline for the cleanup of Superfund sites, 11 years after the1986 Compact with the Marshall Islands. This 15 millirem standard is more stringent and morerecent than the 100 millirem standard established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that wasused to determine the degree of cleanup in past efforts in the Marshall Islands.", "The RMI argues that the 15 millirem standard is the same level of public protection that isprovided in the United States and that it therefore should be applied to the cleanup of the MarshallIslands. However, the 15 millirem standard is not an enforceable federal regulation. As noted above,it is an EPA recommended guideline that is applied on a case-by-case basis, depending on thefeasibility of attaining it at a particular site. Although there is some precedent for applying the 15millirem standard to certain nuclear weapons sites in the United States, such sites generally arecleaned up to DOE's less stringent standard of 100 millirems, which has been used in the MarshallIslands for past cleanup, as noted above. Consequently, the RMI's claim that the 15 milliremstandard would apply to the cleanup of the Marshall Islands if it were done in the United States todayis not necessarily the case. The Bush Administration advocates the continued use of DOE's 100millirem standard and argues that further cleanup is not necessary, citing medical tests indicating thatdoses of radiation among the population are already below this amount.", "Contaminated Areas. In addition to the issue ofwhether a more recent radiation protection standard warrants further cleanup, there is disagreementregarding the extent of contamination. There have been numerous surveys of radioactivecontamination in the Marshall Islands since nuclear weapons tests ceased. Residents of the islandshave expressed longstanding concern as to whether these surveys have identified all contaminatedareas. The most exhaustive survey of contamination was performed in 1994. The survey found thatthe greatest contamination was in the northernmost islands not inhabited at that time, and that thelevel of radioactivity in occupied areas was safe. The RMI has disagreed with these findings andclaims that the extent of contamination and health risks were understated. The Bush Administrationsupports the findings of the 1994 survey and argues that further cleanup is not warranted to protectthe residential population. However, if some of the more contaminated northern islands are to beresettled or used for agricultural purposes, further cleanup could be necessary to prevent the risk ofexposure, depending on the concentration of radioactivity deemed safe. ", "Litigation Involving Inhabitants of the RMI. Inthe early 1980s, fourteen different groups of litigants representing approximately 5,000 inhabitantsof the Marshall Islands brought cases in the United States Court of Claims against the United Statesto recover damages said to result from nuclear weapons testing. The litigants were from threedifferent groups: inhabitants of the Bikini Atoll, inhabitants of the Enewetak Atoll, and inhabitantsof atolls and islands that were not used as atomic test sites. The court made separate preliminaryfindings regarding each of these. In the case involving Bikini Atoll inhabitants, the court found thata claim of a takings in violation of the Fifth Amendment and of breach of an implied-in-fact contractsurvived a motion to dismiss based, among other things, on a statute of limitations bar. In the caseinvolving the inhabitants of the Enewetak Atoll, it was held that a breach of contract claim surviveda motion to dismiss, as did a takings claim by the plaintiffs who were not on the Bikini or Enewetakislands. Subsequently, the Compact of Free Association was implemented between the United Statesand RMI, and the Nuclear Claims Tribunal was established under Section 177 of that agreement. TheCourt of Claims then concluded that it was premature to address the question of whether thisalternative procedure was adequate to provide compensation for the litigants, and so it dismissed thecases. The RMI argues that the court decision left open the possibility of further compensation --beyond that provided by the Compact.

According to thePetition, when the Compact and Section 177 Agreement were written, most nuclear test injuries anddamages were attributed to the Bravo hydrogen bomb test of 1954. In the early 1990s, the UnitedStates government declassified information that revealed the yields of the other 66 weapons tests.

Prior to the late 1990s, most scientific studies assumed a safe level of exposureto be 100 mrem per year above background levels of radiation (external plus internal doses). Whenthe Compact was agreed upon, the accepted dose limit was 500 mrem per year. The EPA's 15 mremstandard, adopted by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal, would imply higher cleanup costs and at leastnine additional atolls that were exposed to dangerous levels of radioactive fallout. The BiologicalEffects of Ionizing Radiation Committee, 1990 (BEIR V) asserted radiation exposure to be almostnine times as damaging as that estimated by the 1972 Committee (BEIR I).

The main problem is with theuse of inflated average rents per acre, which are estimated by applying an exponential regressionmodel to unrepresentative sample data that largely reflect government-influenced rents rather thancompetitive, free-market levels. (54) This leads to an apparent overestimate of not only pastloss-of-use, but because estimated rents is a critical variable used as an input into future-loss-of-usecalculations, also to an overestimate of future loss-of-use as well.

According to the NCT, this rental value represents an estimate of the rents thatthe U.S. government should have paid (but were not fully paid, according to the claimants) to theatoll residents, as proprietors, for the use of their land. Compensation is based on estimated rentalvalues, in lieu of land asset values, because the underlying assumption is that the U.S. Governmentdid not \"take\" or purchase the land but instead used it, with the consequence that the inhabitants wereunable to use it. There is generally a close mathematical relationship between rentals and landvalues. ", "Loss-of-use includes not only the period when the United States tested the nuclear bombs --roughly the period from 1946 to 1958 -- but the period during which the islands remain unsafe dueto continued dangerous levels of radiation contamination, which, for some of the islands at least, isroughly the period from 1958 to 2027.

However,when the Enewetak people were allowed to return on October 1, 1980, they were allowed to safelyuse only 646.82 acres of the atoll -- 1,305.78 acres continued to be off limits due to dangerous levelsof radioactive contamination. Thus, past loss-of-use includes the estimated rents on this 1,305.78acres from October 1, 1980, to May 16, 1996, which is the date of the Hallstrom Group's appraisalreport. For Bikini, past loss-of-use is the estimated rental value of all the atoll (the 1,889.36 acres)from March 7, 1967 to November 18, 1997, when the Bikini appraisal report is dated.

Future loss-of-use begins on the day after the damage estimates were reported (May 17, 1996, forEnewetak; November 19, 1997, for Bikini) and continues until such time as the claimants areestimated to be allowed to return to a safe homeland (May 16, 2026, for Enewetak; November 18,2027, for Bikini). The value of future loss-of-use is calculated as the present discounted value of theestimated annual rents over this time period.", "More specifically, for Enewetak, future loss-of-use is the value of projected foregone rentalincome on the 1,305.78 acres from the period from May 17, 1996 to May 16, 2026, (which is theestimated date that the 1,305.78 acres of Enewetak atoll will be sufficiently decontaminated to permitits safe use); for Bikini, future loss-of-use is from November 19, 1997 to November 18, 2027 (whichis the estimated date that the Bikini islanders will have full use of their atoll once again). These datesof return were determined by the NCT. Each year's projected rentals -- again the product of estimated average rents per acre and the projected (or assumed) lost acreage -- is discounted at the assumeduniform nominal interest rate of 8%. Average rents per acre are assumed to start at $4,105 forEnewetak, and $4,167 for Bikini, and to remain constant for each year throughout the forecastperiod. (Each of these rates is the rate projected in the final year of the past loss-of-use estimates,as discussed above.)", "Assessment of the Methodology. In general, themethodology used by the NCT to estimate the value of the lost use of the claimants' property isviewed as reasonable and appropriate, although, as discussed below, the specific assumptions, data,and statistical procedures can produce inflated loss-of-use estimates. ", "If there was a contract (either implied or explicit) for the lease of Enewetak and Bikini atollswhich was not adequately paid for; or, if there was no contract -- if the United States is responsiblefor the inability of the Enewetakians and Bikinians to use their land -- the appropriate methodologywould be to estimate the dollar value of that loss-of-use or, equivalently, the value of the U.S.government's use. This would be the sum of the present (compounded) rental value of past rents andthe present (discounted) value of projected future rents, as was done in the NCT reports. These rentalvalues would be the fair market average rents per acre times the relevant acreage for the length oftime that it was rendered unuseable as a result of U.S. government activities. Indeed, the modelunderlying the methodology -- the capital asset pricing model -- is rooted in sound economic andfinancial theory, and the methodology itself is standard methodology used by economists, as wellas the courts, in solving similar problems. ", "Furthermore, the NCT's methodology attempts to adjust each year's estimated rentals owed(this might be called the gross rentals) for 1) any rentals previously paid by the U.S. government, 2)the value of alternative accommodations (living arrangements) provided and financed by the U.S.government, and 3) the interest that would have been earned on these rentals. In estimating pastloss-of-use, hundreds of actual lease transactions from two distant atolls in the RMI are sampled toestimate average rents per acre for each year -- a critical variable upon which both past and futureloss-of-use estimates (and, therefore, the total damages awarded) are based. In the estimation of thefuture loss-of-use, the methodology appropriately attempts to estimate the value of such loss-of-useas the present discounted value of projected rentals up to the date of return. ", "For several reasons, however, the specific application of the methodology -- much of thecritical data used, some of the assumptions, and certain statistical procedures applied (i.e., thesampling technique and the regression model) -- produce past and future loss-of-use estimates thatappear to be overstated, which leads to possibly excessive total damages claimed and awarded bythe NCT. The main problem is with the past loss-of-use estimates, but since these are carried overinto future loss-of-use calculations, those estimates appear to be inflated as well. ", "Overestimates of Past Lost Use. Past loss-of-usedamages appear to be overstated for several reasons. First, and foremost, the methodology usesinflated estimates of average rents per acre, a critical variable used as an input into both past- andfuture-loss-of-use calculations. To estimate average rents per acre, the methodology uses anonrandom sample of average rents per acre from lease transactions from distant atolls which maynot reflect the rents on Enewetak and Bikini. Further, the sample rent data largely reflect rents setby government decree rather than as the equilibrium of supply and demand for the use of land in acompetitive real estate market (which is the underlying assumption of the type of model used toestimate loss-of-use). Since 1979, the RMI cabinet has established above market rentals ongovernment involved leases -- which represent the vast majority of lease transactions in the RMI.On January 1, 1979 the official government rental was established at $2,500/acre; On October 1,1989 the rate was increased to $3,000/acre. The official rate is a benchmark for all other leases, and,in effect, establishes a \"rent floor\" for all other lease transactions. Almost all land and buildings areleased at this official rate. During the 1970's average rents, which were probably still high due toU.S. government leases, averaged $597/acre according to the Darroch report and $511/acreaccording to the Hallstrom report.", "A second reason for overstated past loss-of-use, is that the methodology applies anexponential regression model to the inflated average rents sample data, data biased by the $2,500 and$3,000 per acre official rates. In effect, the official government rents of $2,500 and $3,000 per acrefor recent years makes it appear that the overall trend of rents since 1946 is exponential, whichfurther compounds the upward bias in the estimated average rents per acre, and thus overestimatespast loss-of-use. In reality, rents reflect values, either agricultural land values or urban land values,which fluctuate based primarily on economic circumstances.", "A third reason for the upward bias in the loss-of-use estimates pertains to the quantity of landthat is assumed to be denied the people of Enewetak and Bikini. Even though some portions of theaffected atolls were completely destroyed or pulverized by the nuclear testing -- 182.46 acres ofEnewetak (9.34% of the atoll's land acreage) and 69.67 acres of Bikini (3.69% of the land acreage)-- the methodology assumes that they were not. The result is that land that no longer exists continuesto earn inflated rents at compound interest through 2026 for Enewetak and 2027 for Bikini. Giventhe equivalency between the value of land and the rentals earned on that land, the appropriatemethodology would compensate the landowners for the value of the destroyed portions of the twoatolls, determined at the time of destruction plus interest. Such value would be based upon reliable estimates of average rentals that would then be capitalized to determine a market value. This\"present value\" would then be adjusted for the time value of money up to the time that the claimwould be awarded.", "Fourth, the assumption is made that the rental value of alternative properties provided to theclaimants by the U.S. government (the use gained for these substitute living quarters on Ujelang andRongerik) is generally only 58% of the average rents times the land area of Ujelang in the case ofEnewetak; and either 75% or 58% times the amount of land on Rongerik and Kili in the case ofBikini. (61) While thededuction for value of alternative habitation is viewed as fair and appropriate, the assumption thatthe average rentals were a fraction of those on the Enewetak and Bikini atolls is problematic. Notonly does this carry over the upward bias from the prior calculations -- the estimation of foregonerents on the Enewetak and Bikini atolls -- but it is inconsistent with the estimating assumptions, perthe instructions of claimant's counsel and the NCT, that the methodology will not base value oneconomic use, such as production of copra or potential for nuclear storage. (62) Also, there is evidencethat the value of alternative domiciles might have been greater due to the investment of the UnitedStates in building houses and other infrastructure.", "The NCT methodology also makes some assumptions regarding the timing of denied use, inthe case of Bikini atoll, that raises the loss-of-use damage estimates. In particular, it assumes thatthe Bikinians' loss-of-use was continuous and there was no return. On March 7, 1946, 167 Bikiniislanders (the inhabitant proprietors) were evacuated, but some of the Bikinians returned to twoislands of the atoll (Bikini and Eneu islands) from June 1, 1969, to July 31, 1978. While it is true thatthey returned to a contaminated island, internal consistency in the methodology requires that thereturn be counted as such. The implication for the loss-of-use estimation is that the rentals on thesetwo occupied islands of the atoll would be lower or zero owing to this contamination, and that thevalue of their stay on alternative atolls should not be deducted from the overall rental. ", "Finally, the methodology to estimate past lost use assumes that the lessors of the affectedRMI atolls would have invested 100% of the rental proceeds in 30-year Treasury bonds. Thisassumes that the islanders would have saved 100% of the rental proceeds. A more realisticassumption would be that they would invest a fraction of the rental proceeds equal to the assumedsavings rate, and that they would have consumed the remainder. The amount saved based on thiscalculation would have been invested or saved in a savings account, or even in U.S. Treasury bonds,at some appropriate interest rate. (63) ", "Overestimates of Future Lost Use. With respectto future loss-of-use, CRS finds again that the present discounted value methodology is generallyappropriate, but that the estimated dollar amounts are inflated or overstated. The primary reasonthat future loss-of-use is overstated is that the procedure carries over into the calculation of projectedfuture rents the inflated estimates of average rents per acre from the past loss-of-use. Thus, forEnewetak, rents for 1997-2026 are projected to be the same as for 1996 ($4,105/acre); for Bikini,rents for 1998-2027 are the same as for 1997 ($4,167/acre).

However, the Bush Administrationargues that federal funding to pay this claim is not warranted, asserting that radiation protectionstandards applied to past cleanup efforts have not become stricter, the area of known contaminationhas not changed, and radiation doses are currently safe according to recent medical tests.", "The following sections discuss the Tribunal's decision on additional compensation forenvironmental restoration, the IAEA's policy on environmental cleanup, the cleanup standardproposed by the RMI, variables that would determine whether the standard that the RMI wishes touse would be applied to the cleanup if it were performed in the United States, the BushAdministration's viewpoint on the cleanup standard, and disagreement between the RMI and theBush Administration regarding the known area of contamination.", "Tribunal Decision on Additional Compensation. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal recommended that the United States pay additional compensation of$251.5 million to the people of Bikini Atoll for environmental restoration of contaminated lands. The total estimated cost of the restoration is $360.5 million. The Tribunal agreed to a lower amountbecause of adjustments made from $109 million in compensation already paid by the United Statesin prior years. The Tribunal also recommended $91.7 million in additional compensation to thepeople of Enewetak Atoll for environmental restoration. The total estimated cost of the restorationof this atoll is $101.7 million. The Tribunal agreed to $10 million less than this amount, againbecause of adjustments made from compensation already paid by the United States in past years.", "The award decisions for both atolls are based on the estimated costs of: 1) removing andreplacing some of the contaminated soil; 2) disposing of excavated soil by using it as a sealed fillerto construct a causeway between various islands; and 3) treating and monitoring the remainingcontaminated soil with potassium, which in other locations has proven to be effective in blockingthe uptake of radioactivity by food crops. The RMI reports that the cost estimates for the aboveactivities were calculated based on data from DOE.", "The RMI estimated the cleanup costs using a standard U.S. methodology for selectingremedial and disposal actions from a variety of alternatives, ranging from the least to the greatestpotential cost. For example, the RMI chose a potentially more cost-effective combination of soilremoval and potassium treatment, rather than the possibly more costly option of removing allcontaminated soil. (65) For disposal of removed soil, the RMI considered the more costly option of shipping thecontaminated material to the closest disposal facility in the United States, but selected the sealedcauseway alternative to provide a less costly means of local disposal that also would provide aninfrastructural benefit to the local population.", "IAEA Policy on Environmental Cleanup. Issuedin November 2003, IAEA's current policy on environmental cleanup applies to contaminationresulting from past discharges or disposal of radioactive materials, nuclear accidents or other events,and nuclear weapons tests, (66) such as those that the United States conducted in the MarshallIslands during the 1940s and 1950s. In its petition for additional compensation from the UnitedStates, the RMI argues that more stringent U.S. standards warrant further cleanup. In support of itsargument, the RMI's petition refers to the \"position\" of the IAEA that \"....policies and criteria forradiation protection of populations outside national borders from releases of radioactive substancesshould be at least as stringent as those for the population within the country of release.\" (67) ", "The above statement is from an IAEA policy on transboundary radiation exposure, releasedin 1985 as part of the Agency's safety series. (68) Allan Richardson, a scientific consultant who assisted the RMIin the preparation of its petition, also referred to the above 1985 policy in his testimony before theHouse Resources Committee on May 11, 1999, in support of his argument that more stringent U.S.cleanup standards should be applied in the Marshall Islands. (69) However, this policyprimarily applied to situations in which a nuclear facility located close to the border of another nationreleased radiation that resulted in exposure to foreign populations across borders, rather than to thecleanup of contamination from past nuclear tests or other events. ", "The IAEA published over 100 policy documents in its safety series through 1996, includingthe above 1985 policy. Since that time, the IAEA has superseded these documents with a new series,consolidating and revising many of its former documents. (70) The IAEA released its current policy document onenvironmental cleanup in November 2003, as noted above. It consolidates many of the policies fromthe former safety series, but it does not include a policy on cleanup of contamination outside nationalborders.", "The IAEA's current safety standards for radioactive discharges do include a policy ontransboundary exposure similar to the above 1985 policy, recommending that \"radiation protectionof populations outside national borders from discharge of radioactive substances should be at leastas stringent as those for the population within the country of discharge.\" (71) This policy applies to ongoing activities ranging from the operation of nuclear reactors and reprocessing facilities tomedical and research purposes, but not to past events, such as nuclear weapons tests. (72) ", "The IAEA's current policy on the cleanup of radioactive contamination states objectives forprotecting public safety, recommends a framework for individual nations to establish their own legaland regulatory requirements to achieve these objectives, and provides guidance for the developmentand implementation of remedial actions. Cleanup in contaminated areas is recommended if thecumulative annual dose of radiation from all sources, including natural background levels, wouldexceed 10 millisieverts (1,000 millirems or 1 rem). (73) The IAEA guidance specifies that this amount would \"normallybe assessed as the mean dose for an appropriately defined critical group.\" (74) However, the IAEA policydoes not specify the quantity of individuals or demographics that would constitute a group for thepurpose of measuring a mean dose. How to define a dosage group would be left to the discretionof each nation, and whether to perform cleanup and to what degree would depend on each nation'slegal requirements.", "Neither the former nor the current series of safety standards is legally binding on MemberStates, including the United States, except in situations in which the IAEA is involved in a specificaction at the request of a Member State. To clarify this matter in its current safety series, the IAEAincluded language in the preamble to each policy document stating that, \"The IAEA's safetystandards are not legally binding on Member States but may be adopted by them, at their owndiscretion, for use in national regulations in respect of their own activities. The standards arebinding on the IAEA in relation to its own operation and on States in relation to operations assistedby the IAEA.\"", "As such, the IAEA's safety policies constitute recommended guidelines for protecting humanbeings from exposure to potentially harmful levels of radiation, rather than legally binding orenforceable requirements. Consequently, it appears that IAEA safety policies do not bind the UnitedStates to a certain degree of cleanup at sites within or outside its borders, including the MarshallIslands, as long as the IAEA is not involved in carrying out specific actions at the request of eithernation. To apply IAEA policy to the cleanup of the Marshall Islands therefore appears to be a policydecision, rather than a legal requirement.", "Cleanup Standard Proposed by the RMI. Federalradiation protection standards are not uniform in the United States, but vary in stringency amongregulatory agencies, and are specific to certain sources and circumstances. (75) The degree of cleanup thatthe RMI wishes to perform is based on an EPA cleanup standard that limits annual radiationexposure from all sources to 15 millirems. This standard establishes the \"reasonable maximumexposure\" of radiation for an individual above the local natural background level, which EPA deemswould be safe without resulting in harmful biological effects. The IAEA's recommended standardof 1 rem of cumulative annual exposure for an \"appropriately defined group\" is not comparable toEPA's standard or DOE's 100 millirem standard, discussed below, as these latter two standards limitexposure to individuals above natural background levels.", "Further, these exposure standards do not limit the concentration of radioactivity in soil,groundwater, or surface water. Rather, the allowable concentration to attain an exposure limit woulddepend on the potential pathway of human exposure resulting from the intended land use. Consequently, the degree of cleanup can differ significantly from site to site. Relatively littlecleanup may be required if the potential for exposure were minimal. Conversely, more cleanup maybe necessary if there were greater likelihood of exposure. The RMI has based the degree of cleanupthat it has planned on the possible risk of exposure from residential and agricultural use on the twoatolls.", "EPA issued its 15 millirem standard in 1997 in an agency guidance document. This guidancerecommends safe levels of human exposure to determine the degree of cleanup at Superfund sitesin the United States where radioactive contamination is present. (76) To date, EPA has notproposed this standard in federal regulation, and it is not legally enforceable or binding in the UnitedStates. However, EPA issued the standard based on an enforceable federal regulation, whichrequires a degree of cleanup that would result in a cancer risk of no greater than 1 in 1 million, oras much as 1 in 10,000 in certain circumstances. (77) ", "Applicability of Standards to Marshall IslandsCleanup. The RMI asserts that EPA's 15 millirem standard should be used todetermine the degree of cleanup in the Marshall Islands, arguing that this standard would apply tothe cleanup if it were being done in the United States. However, this is not necessarily the case. Ifthe Marshall Islands were a U.S. territory, DOE presumably would be responsible for the cleanupthere. (78) DOE's generalstandard for cleanup at former nuclear weapons production and test sites specifies an annualindividual limit of 100 millirems of exposure to radiation. DOE has not promulgated an enforceableregulation for this standard, but has specified it in a non-binding, internal \"order.\" (79) DOE reports that it hasused this standard to determine the degree of past cleanup efforts in the Marshall Islands. The BushAdministration asserts that this standard should continue to be used to determine whether additionalcleanup is necessary.", "The stringency of DOE's cleanup standard is equivalent to the degree of protection providedby the standard that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) promulgated in 1991 for protectionof the public from radiation released from the operation of nuclear facilities that it licenses, such ascivilian nuclear power plants. (80) The NRC's more stringent standard of 25 millirems for cleanupapplies to the facilities that it licenses for operation, (81) but not to DOE nuclear weapons sites which are not under thejurisdiction of the NRC. ", "Although DOE's general cleanup standard is 100 millirems, there is precedent for theDepartment voluntarily agreeing to EPA's 15 millirem standard for cleanup of contaminated soil onat least two former nuclear weapons production sites: Hanford in Washington State, and Rocky Flatsin Colorado. Such decisions are made on a site-specific basis, as would be the case for the cleanupof contaminated soil in the Marshall Islands if it were a U.S. territory under the jurisdiction of DOE. The outcome of such a decision is uncertain and would depend on numerous factors, including theextent and cost of cleanup that would be required to prevent exposure to a more stringent degree thanthe 100 millirem limit that DOE prefers. Consequently, it is uncertain whether the 15 milliremstandard would be applied to the cleanup of the Marshall Islands, if the cleanup were being done inthe United States.", "The extent of cleanup necessary to attain the 15 millirem standard at Hanford and RockyFlats likely would be significantly less than in the Marshall Islands on a proportional basis, becausethe land uses at Hanford and Rocky Flats are significantly more restrictive in terms of public access. Consequently, there would be less likelihood of human exposure. Therefore, a greater concentrationof radioactivity could remain in the soil and still prevent annual exposure from exceeding 15millirems at these two sites. Rocky Flats will serve as a National Wildlife Refuge with humanaccess limited to refuge personnel and visitors in certain areas. Hanford is not planned forunrestricted use, but it will continue its function as a waste treatment and disposal facility into theforeseeable future, even after cleanup is complete. Neither site is planned for residential oragricultural use, as the RMI intends for contaminated areas in the Bikini and Enewetak Atolls. ", "The application of the15 millirem standard to the cleanup of Hanford and Rocky Flats doesnot necessarily set a precedent for removing radioactive soil to the degree that the RMI wishes. Some therefore may argue that a 15 millirem standard has been applied to cleanup in the UnitedStates to the extent that the degree of cleanup necessary to achieve it is practical. Others mayadvocate that the 15 millirem standard should be applied in all cases to protect human health,regardless of the degree of cleanup that would be needed to limit exposure to that level. The BushAdministration opposes the use of the 15 millirem standard in the Marshall Islands and advocatesthe continued use of the 100 millirem standard, discussed below.", "Bush Administration Viewpoint on Marshall Islands CleanupStandard. In the State Department's report, the Bush Administration argues that the100 millirem standard is the level of protection that is generally applicable in the United States, andthat the United States therefore should not pay for cleaning up the Marshall Islands to a morestringent level. However, the report also acknowledged that \"There are multiple U.S. federalstandards applied to various cleanups that cover a wide range of doses but in general, they tend tocontrol doses to as far below the 1 mSv [100 millirems] per year limit as is practical.\" (82) Both the EPA and NRCcleanup standards are more stringent and more recent than the 100 millirem standard that theAdministration advocates. Although the NRC standard does not apply to nuclear weapons test sites,the EPA standard could be applied to the cleanup of test sites in the United States at DOE'sdiscretion. The State Department report did not explain the Administration's rationale for notapplying EPA's stricter standard to the cleanup of the Marshall Islands.", "In advocating the use of the 100 millirem standard, the Administration did not present analternative cost estimate in the State Department report to conduct additional environmental cleanupin the Marshall Islands. Presumably, an estimate is not provided because the Administration arguesthat no cleanup is necessary to attain that level of protection. The Administration asserts thatmedical tests indicate current human doses of radioactive isotopes in the Marshall Islands typicallydo not result in internal exposure in excess of15 millirems above local natural background levels. These tests measure radioactive material that the human body has absorbed. The Administrationargues that the actual dose of radiation absorbed by those tested does not exceed the 15 milliremstandard that the RMI wishes to use for cleanup, and is far less than the 100 millirem standard thatit recommends, and concludes that additional remediation in the Marshall Islands is therefore notnecessary.", "Disagreement Regarding Areas of Contamination. There have been numerous surveys of radioactive contamination in the Marshall Islands sincenuclear weapons tests ceased. Residents of the islands have expressed longstanding concern as towhether these surveys have identified all contaminated areas. The RMI commissioned theNationwide Radiological Survey in 1994, which was funded by the United States. (83) Many have noted thissurvey as being the most comprehensive effort to examine levels of radioactivity in soil on islandspotentially affected from past fallout, including Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik Atolls.", "The findings of this survey were that levels of radioactivity rise with increasing latitude,identifying the greatest contamination in the northernmost islands. Based on the survey's findings,an independent scientific advisory panel concluded that the level of radioactivity in areas inhabitedat that time did not pose a significant health risk, but that some cleanup likely would be necessaryfor certain islands if they were to be resettled or if foods grown on them were to be consumed. TheRMI disagreed with these findings based on criticisms regarding accuracy, completeness of data, andcredibility of the authors, and claimed that more contaminated areas do exist that pose a health risk. In response, the advisory panel supported the survey's findings, which were upheld by scientific peerreview.", "The RMI continues to dispute the findings of the 1994 survey, and asserts that potentiallyharmful contamination is present across a greater area and at lower latitudes, warranting furthercleanup. The RMI's petition for compensation for Enewetak Atoll advocated that morecontamination surveys are needed to fully identify all areas in need of cleanup to protect theresidential population. The Tribunal's compensation decision included $4.5 million to fund suchsurveys, as part of the estimated cost of environmental restoration. The Tribunal's compensationdecision for Bikini Atoll did not specify the costs to perform additional surveys of contamination onthose islands.", "The Bush Administration supports the findings of the 1994 survey and argues that cleanupof a broader area is therefore not needed to protect the residents of the islands. However, theAdministration appears to base its conclusion on the assumption that unoccupied areas withradioactive contamination would not be resettled. The Administration has acknowledged that certainareas in the northern atolls are contaminated to a degree that warrants restrictions on land use, stating\"....some islands may never be suitable for communities or food gathering and should remain offlimits....\" (84) At thesame time, the Administration indicated that \".... most historically inhabited islands in the northernatolls could be resettled under specific conditions.\" (85) However, it did not specify what those conditions might be, orwhether the concentration of radioactivity and potential pathways of exposure were examined todetermine if cleanup would be necessary to allow resettlement.", "If resettlement in currently unoccupied areas were to occur, cleanup may be necessary if thedegree of contamination would result in annual exposure to radiation in excess of either the 100millirem or 15 millirem standard, depending on the concentration of radioactivity and pathway ofexposure. Continuing efforts to understand the human health effects of radioactive contaminationin the Marshall Islands also possibly could reveal that remediation is necessary to protect theresidents in currently occupied areas. For example, if ongoing medical tests administered by theDepartment of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory were to reveal that radiation dosesare higher in currently settled areas than present data suggest, decisions could be needed as towhether remediation may be warranted, even if access to unoccupied areas remained restricted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Issues(86)", "paragraphs": ["Litigation Involving Inhabitants of the RMI. Inthe early 1980s, fourteen different groups of litigants representing approximately 5,000 inhabitantsof the Marshall Islands brought cases in the United States Court of Claims against the United Statesto recover damages said to result from United States nuclear weapons testing. (87) The litigants were fromthree different groups: inhabitants of Bikini Atoll, inhabitants of Enewetak Atoll, and inhabitants ofatolls and islands that were not used as atomic test sites. The Court handled the three different groupsseparately, with the cases in the third category being consolidated. Although these cases were allultimately dismissed for the reasons discussed below, there are indications that at least some of thelitigants are seeking to file suit again.", "At the time the cases were filed in the United States Court of Claims, the United States andthe government of the emerging Republic of the Marshall Islands were negotiating the Compact ofFree Association. The cases were suspended for a time to avoid interference with the negotiations,and when the litigation was allowed to resume, the government moved to dismiss. In the caseinvolving Bikini Atoll inhabitants, (88) the court held that the plaintiffs had stated claims sufficient toinvoke the jurisdiction of the court, (89) that the sovereign immunity of the United States had been waivedas to the claims, and that at least some of plaintiff's claims would appear to survive a statute oflimitations bar. (90) While making no findings as to the validity of the claims, the court allowed the plaintiffs to moveforward on the theory that there had been takings in violation of the Fifth Amendment (91) and breaches of animplied-in-fact contract that arose between the people of Bikini and the United States. (92) ", "In the case involving the inhabitants of the Enewetak Atoll, it was determined that the statuteof limitations barred the taking claims of the Enewetak people, that certain other claims were withoutmerit, but that the complaint had stated a breach of contract claim within the jurisdiction of thecourt. (93) The Court heldthat the claim that there was a breach of an implied-in-fact contract between the inhabitants and theUnited States was not barred by sovereign immunity, and that such claims were sufficient to compela denial of a motion to dismiss. (94) ", "In the consolidated cases involving plaintiffs who were not on the Bikini or Enewetakislands, it was decided that the complaints of an unlawful taking were within the jurisdiction of thecourt and were not barred by the statute of limitations. (95) Further, the United States' motion to dismiss was denied as tothe takings claims, (96) although it was allowed as to all other claims of these plaintiffs. (97) ", "Around the time of these rulings, the Compact of Free Association was agreed to by theUnited States and RMI. A plebiscite approving the agreement was held, and a Joint Resolution toimplement the Compact was passed by Congress. (98) Section 177 of the Compact provides that the United Statesaccepts responsibility for compensation owing to the citizens of the Marshall Islands as a result ofnuclear testing between June 30, 1946, and August 18, 1958. This section further provides thatcompensation shall be determined based on a separate agreement with RMI.", "Pursuant to Section 177, this separate agreement between RMI and the United States wasnegotiated, establishing a Nuclear Claims Tribunal to provide for the settlement of nuclear testingclaims. In conjunction with these provisions, however, Article XII of the Section 177 Agreementprovided that (1) all claims related to the nuclear testing program shall be terminated; (2) no courtof the United States shall have jurisdiction to entertain claims relating to the nuclear testing program;and (3) any such claims pending in the courts of the United States shall be dismissed. Based on theseprovisions, the United States again filed motions to dismiss the various cases. This time, it arguedthat the claims were now non-justiciable because they involved a political question relating to theforeign affairs powers of the United States, and because the Section 177 Agreement divested thecourt of subject matter jurisdiction.", "In response to this motion, plaintiffs made a number of arguments, some of which wererejected by the Court of Claims and subsequently by the United States Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit. (99) Forinstance, the plaintiffs argued that while the Compact had been agreed to by the United States andRMI, the United Nations had not agreed to terminate the trust relationship between the United Statesand the Trust Territories, and that the plaintiffs' rights could not be terminated without this approval.The Court of Claims, however, rejected this argument. (100) Various other legal arguments made by the plaintiff were alsorejected. (101) ", "The Court, however, declined to reach a number of other issues. One such argument madeby the plaintiffs was related to the concept of \"espousal.\" Espousal occurs when the government ofone country asserts the private claims of its nationals against another sovereign. (102) In such cases, it isestablished international practice to settle these claims by international agreements. Here, the newlyformed RMI appears to have \"espoused\" the claims of its citizens against the United States fordamages from nuclear testing, and then settled those claims under the Section 177 agreement.", "As part of the settlement of the espoused claim, RMI agreed to waive the legal rights of itscitizens to bring suit in the United States for such damages. Normally, such actions by a sovereignwould be sufficient to extinguish claims against another nation. However, the plaintiffs raised anargument that this waiver was not valid as to them, because the injury occurred before the claimantswere citizens of RMI. (103) This argument is called the \"continuous nationality\" rule, aprinciple of international law which provides that a state does not have the right to ask another stateto pay for damages to its citizens if they were not its citizens at the time of the loss or damage. (104) The rationale behindthis doctrine is to prevent persons from obtaining citizenship in one state in order to use that nation'spowers of espousal to pursue their claims against another state. Under this argument, RMI lackedthe legal capacity to espouse plaintiffs' claims, and so the claims would not have been settled by theimplementation of the Compact. (105) ", "This issue was analyzed by the Court of Claims in considering whether the Bikini Atollplaintiffs could continue their law suit. The court, however, distinguished the facts of the cases fromthat doctrine. The issue, the court indicated, was not whether naturalized citizens could bring claimsfrom a forum that they had chosen for their convenience. Rather, the issue was whether theinhabitants of an area which was under differing forms of government could be adequatelyrepresented by the existing government. The court indicated that the question of whether the\"continuous nationality\" rule should be applied to an emerging state seeking to espouse claimsarising before its creation was a novel and unexplored area in international law. Consequently, thecourt deferred a decision on this issue, deciding the case on other grounds. (106) Thus, if these casesare again pursued, it seems likely that this issue would be explored further.", "Such an exploration might consider the genesis of the \"continuous nationality\" rule. The ruleis considered to be an outgrowth of the broader international law rule that a state may not espousea claim on behalf of someone who is not its national. The \"continuous nationality\" rule merelyprovides that this general rule must be satisfied both at the time of injury and continuouslythereafter. (107) However, it is not clear that the doctrinal basis for this latter rule is strong as regards the instant case.First, the \"continuous nationality rule\" appears related to the traditional reluctance of nations toespouse claims of individuals with whom they have little or no connection. That rationale may notbe strongly applicable in the instant case, as the majority of the injured parties are likely to have beencitizens of RMI since that state's inception. Second, the doctrine appears to arise from variousrestrictive interpretations of bilateral treaties. For instance, where a treaty establishing a claimscommission did not define when a person becomes a national, it was assumed that the partiesintended for that term to be construed narrowly to exclude persons who were not nationals when aninjury occurred. Here, however, RMI and the United States clearly intended the espousal specifiedin the Compact to extend to the plaintiffs. (108) Consequently, it is not clear how a court would apply the\"continuous nationality\" doctrine to an interpretation of the Compact.", "The Court also considered the argument that limiting the jurisdiction of the court fromconsidering the plaintiffs' case was in violation of the Constitution. Under this argument, a blanketwithdrawal of access to a judicial forum deprives plaintiffs of all judicial remedies for violation oftheir constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment, which in itself gives rise to a taking ofplaintiffs' causes of action in violation of the Fifth Amendment. (109) The United Statesresponded, however, by noting that the Tribunal established by the Section 177 Agreement provideda \"reasonable, certain and adequate provision for compensation\" (110) of the taking. ", "The Court of Claims concluded that, in light of the Section 177 Agreement, it was prematureto address the above arguments, and that the question of whether the alternative procedures providedby Congress were adequate would be dependent upon the amount and type of compensation. Thus,whether the settlement provided \"adequate\" compensation could not be determined at that time.Consequently, because the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims had been withdrawn by the Congress,the court dismissed the case.", "Finally, it should be noted that if the plaintiffs from these cases file suit again, it is likely thatthe United States would argue that the case represented a political question, and should be resolvedby the Executive Branch, not the courts. (111) The political question doctrine, first recognized in Marburyv. Madison, (112) stands for the tenet that certain political questions are by their nature committed to the politicalbranches and to the exclusion of the judiciary. The application of this doctrine in this context,however, is unclear. It is true that the Supreme Court has made sweeping statements that allquestions touching foreign relations are political questions. (113) However, the issuein the instant case does not relate directly to the United States' relationship to a foreign country, butrather with the relationship of the United States to persons previously under its stewardship. Further,the issue before the Court is not the legitimacy of the Compact with RMI, but is interpretation. (114) Consequently, theultimate shape of the United States' political question argument in this situation is unclear.", " Appendix A.
