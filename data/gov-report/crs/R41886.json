The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) received primary responsibility for the reliability of the bulk power system from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. FERC subsequently designated the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as the \"Electric Reliability Organization\" (ERO) with the responsibility of establishing and enforcing reliability standards. Compliance with reliability standards for electric utilities thus changed from a voluntary, peer-driven undertaking to a mandatory function. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) later added requirements for \"a reliable and secure electricity infrastructure\" with regard to Smart Grid development. NERC is also responsible for standards for critical infrastructure protection (CIP) which focus on planning and procedures for the physical security of the grid. Self-determination is a key part of the CIP reliability process. Utilities are allowed to self-identify what they see as \"critical assets\" under NERC regulations. Only \"critical cyber assets\" (i.e., as essential to the reliable operation of critical assets) are subject to CIP standards. FERC has directed NERC to revise the standards so that some oversight of the identification process for critical cyber assets was provided, but any revision is again subject to stakeholder approval. While reliability standards are mandatory, the ERO process for developing regulations is somewhat unusual in that the regulations are essentially being established by the entities who are being regulated. This may potentially be a conflict of interest, especially when cost of compliance is a concern, and acceptable standards may conceivably result from the option with the lowest costs. Since utility systems are interconnected in many ways, the system with the least protected network potentially provides the weakest point of access.", "Cybersecurity threats represent a constantly moving and increasing target for mitigation activities and mitigation efforts could likewise spiral upward in costs. Recovery of costs may present a major challenge especially to distribution utilities and state commissions charged with overseeing utility costs. EISA only requires states to consider recovery of costs related to Smart Grid systems. FERC has jurisdiction over the bulk power grid, and cannot compel entities involved in distribution to comply with its regulations. Recoverability from a cyber attack on the scale of something which could take down a significant portion of the grid will likely be very difficult, but maintaining a ready inventory of critical spare parts in close proximity to key installations could quicken recovery efforts from some types of attack. The electricity grid is connected to (and largely dependent on) the natural gas pipeline, water supply, and telecommunications systems. Technologies being developed for use by the Smart Grid could also be used by these industries. Consideration could be given to applying similar control system device and system safeguards to these other critical utility systems."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Electricity is vital to the commerce and daily functioning of United States. The electrical grid of the United States consists of all the power plants generating electricity, together with the transmission and distribution lines and their associated transformers and substations which bring power to end-use customers. Electric power generation in the United States is currently dominated by the use of combustible fuels, such as coal and natural gas, or from biomass. These fuels are burned to produce steam in boilers which is used to turn turbine-generators which produce electricity. Nuclear power uses heat from the decay of radioactive elements to produce steam. However, electricity can also be generated directly by wind turbines, solar power, geothermal energy, and hydropower. Figure 1 illustrates the phases of the electric power production process. Electricity from large central station power plants is routed to a step-up transformer which raises the voltage so the power can be sent over high-voltage transmission lines to step-down transformers in substations which then transfer this energy at lower voltages via distribution lines to industrial, commercial, and residential users.", "Generally, electricity must be used as soon as it is produced because large amounts of electricity cannot be easily stored. ", "Originally, the individual company systems were not linked, but with greater electricity demand came the necessity of sharing generation resources. This sharing of generation resources required an interconnection of separate company systems to enable power sales and transfers. These aggregated power systems form three major \"interconnections\"\u2014the Eastern and Western interconnections, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which includes most of the state of Texas. Within these interconnections are reliability regions, and a number of balancing authorities which \"integrate resource plans ahead of time, maintain load-interchange generation balance\" within a balancing authority area, and \"support interconnection frequency in real-time.\" The grid also connects the many publicly and privately owned electric utility and power companies in different states and regions of the United States (and in Canada and Mexico).", "Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-617 ) which allowed non-utility power producers into wholesale power markets (e.g., for the sale of electricity to entities other than the end-user of power). The passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 ) served to further promote greater competition in the bulk power markets. As a result, in many parts of the United States, the electric power industry began to transition from highly regulated, local monopoly companies which generated, transmitted, and distributed electricity to end-use customers, to a business in which power generation is competitive while the industry's transmission and distribution functions are still highly regulated. While the federal government regulates the electric power transmission function and wholesale power markets, regulation of the distribution function of the electric power business is still largely carried out by state government agencies.", "Much of the infrastructure which serves the U.S. power grid is aging. The average age of power plants is now over 30 years; most of these facilities were originally designed to last 40 years. Electric transmission and distribution system components are similarly aging, with power transformers averaging over 40 years of age, and 70% of transmission lines being 25 years or older. As components of the system are retired, they are replaced with newer components often linked to communications or automated systems.", "With changes in federal law, regulatory changes, and the aging of the electric power infrastructure as drivers, the grid is changing from a largely patchwork system built to serve the needs of individual electric utility companies to essentially a national interconnected system capable of accommodating massive transfers of electrical energy between regions of the United States. The modernization of the grid to accommodate today's power flows, serve reliability needs, and meet future projected uses is leading to the incorporation of information processing capabilities for power system controls and operations monitoring. The \"Smart Grid\" is the name given to the evolving electric power network as new information technology systems and capabilities are incorporated. While these new components may add to the ability to control power flows and enhance the efficiency of grid operations, they also potentially increase the susceptibility of the grid to cyber (i.e., computer-related) attack since they are built around microprocessor devices whose basic functions are controlled by software programming and subject to manipulation over a network.", "The information processing attributes which make the smarter grid attractive are the very same attributes which can increase the vulnerability of the electric power system and its critical infrastructure to a potentially devastating cyber attack. The potential of the Smart Grid to revolutionize the ways power is generated and used is great, but so too are the potential risks if not sufficiently addressed.", "The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) ( P.L. 110-140 ) defined the attributes of a Smart Grid and plans for its development. The potential for a major disruption or widespread damage to the nation's power system from a large scale cyberattack has increased focus on the cybersecurity of the Smart Grid. While a nation-state might have the resources and capability to create widescale disruption of the U.S. grid (to create economic disorder or as part of a physical attack), terrorists or hackers are less likely to have the sophistication or resources necessary to inflict damage on a national scale. But the possibility of collaboration between terrorists and hackers could increase the capability of these groups to launch network-based cyberattacks against critical U.S. infrastructure.", "Among the issues for Congress is whether the existing requirements of current law adequately assure the cybersecurity and reliable operation of the U.S. electricity grid today (and the Smart Grid of tomorrow). This report will look at issues key to these determinations, discussing the scope and point of application of regulations, and where the overall responsibility rests for the cybersecurity of the grid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Attributes of a Smart Grid", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) summarized its view of the potential of the Smart Grid by the year 2030 as:", "\u2026 a fully automated power delivery network that monitors and controls every customer and node, ensuring a two-way flow of electricity and information between the power plant and the appliance, and all points in between. Its distributed intelligence, coupled with broadband communications and automated control systems, enables real-time market transactions and seamless interfaces among people, buildings, industrial plants, generation facilities, and the electric network. ", "A \"smarter\" grid is gradually being introduced as upgrades to the systems and components of the power generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. Substation and distribution substations are being automated with superior switching capabilities to enhance current flows and control of the grid. Devices called \"phasor measurement units\" are also being added to substations to make time and location-specific measurements of transmission line voltage, current, and frequency (i.e., synchrophasor measurements made 30 times per second instead of data measured once every two to four seconds by current industrial control systems) providing better tools to improve power system reliability. DOE's strategic plan targets the deployment of 1,000 phasor measurement units by 2013. ", "Advanced meters are being introduced in some utility markets which can offer customers the ability to leverage demand response regimes and technologies, and potentially benefit from the interactive features of the Smart Grid by shifting their energy use to off-peak hours. ", "Expectations vary of what a Smart Grid could accomplish, and the estimated costs of a system rise with the increased scope and attributes of a system. Some see the Smart Grid as only an enhancement of today's existing transmission and distribution systems focused on improving the reliability and efficiency of the grid. Others see the Smart Grid of the future as an integrated system spanning the nation from coast to coast, able to seamlessly combine distributed resources and central power stations across the three major interconnections of the U.S. grid. Under such a vision, distributed and renewable energy resources could be efficiently integrated into the grid, with power from (for example) intermittent wind generation channeled by sensors and intelligent electronics from multiple widely dispersed sites to where power is needed anywhere on the grid. Figure 2 shows a possible configuration of a Smart Grid system illustrating components of an interconnected, two-way intelligent network, and distributed and central station sources of power. The efficiency and economy of all grid operations could conceivably be optimized by similarly harnessing all power generation to take advantage of a wide range of generation and storage resources across the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defining Cybersecurity for the Smart Grid", "paragraphs": ["A prolonged disruption of energy from the grid was described in a report for the Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure as an event which would seriously affect every infrastructure, with the possibility of a cyberattack causing such damage considered as a possibility.", "The widespread and increasing use of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for control of energy systems provides increasing ability to cause serious damage and disruption by cyber means. The exponential growth of information system networks that interconnect the business, administrative, and operational systems contributes to system vulnerability.", "EISA gave the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) the role of coordinating the development of a framework to enable the development of the Smart Grid in a safe and secure manner, and NIST issued its first guidelines for cybersecurity of the Smart Grid in 2010. Because cybersecurity threats were perceived as \"diverse and evolving,\" NIST advocated a defense-in-depth strategy with multiple levels of security because no single security measure could counter all types of threats. The key to NIST's suggested approach is the determination of risk (i.e., the potential for an unwanted outcome resulting from internal or external factors, as determined from the likelihood of occurrence and the associated consequences) as quantified by the threat (e.g., event, actor or action with potential to do harm), the vulnerability (e.g., weakness in the system), and the consequences (e.g., physical impacts) to the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities of the Smart Grid", "paragraphs": ["A smarter grid is largely the result of the modernization of the grid. Most sectors of business and industry have gone from the analog age of knobs and dials to the digital age of sensors and electronic displays in the recent past, and that process is now reaching into the nation's electric power infrastructure. Part of the delay has been due to the long-lived nature of the capital assets which make up the industry. The power plants and other expensive components of the grid can function for many productive years if maintenance of the systems is kept up. However, much of the delay in modernization has been due to cost concerns, as many electric utilities seek to manage expenses by delaying replacement of aging systems as long as possible.

SCADA systems are a well-known application of remote IC used to monitor and control electric transmission system components.", "While cyber-intrusions into the U.S. grid have been reported in recent years, no impairment or other damage has been publicly reported as a result of the attacks. By exploiting loopholes in cybersecurity, cyberattackers could breach the privacy of customers power usage data and access large numbers of meters, perhaps sending deliberately misleading information to the grid. This could potentially overload systems or cause grid operators to respond to false readings. However, concerns exist as to the potential damage that could result in the future from malware left behind by such intrusions or doorways created in systems which could be exploited. The revelation of the complexities of the Stuxnet worm and the alleged targeting of the control systems of a nuclear power plant in Iran have raised additional concerns about the vulnerability of electric power systems worldwide.", "The Stuxnet worm reportedly affected the logical decision making functions of the control systems of one particular type of manufacturing facility. Theoretically, Stuxnet-like malware could be adapted to impair other types of process or control systems in malicious or unpredictable ways.

At the heart of smart meters are semiconductor chips which allow data about energy use to be sent wirelessly to the electric distribution company, and which potentially allows the meter to control the flow of power to customers. The security of the encrypted information in the communications protocol used by many of these devices has been questioned in the past, and questions have been raised about the effectiveness of efforts to patch identified flaws. The primary consideration in the choice of wireless protocol by semiconductor providers seems to be cost of the system, a criteria which is not always compatible with cybersecurity goals for secure communications.

The reliable operation of semiconductor and microprocessor-based devices is based on the low-level firmware controlling the device's basic functions. Firmware in the form of fixed machine-language binary code is found in almost all the electronic devices making up smarter grid products such as programmable controllers and programmable logic arrays. If a hacker or cybercriminal gained access to such devices (especially during the manufacturing process), a section of code could be covertly inserted in the device and activated in such a way as to impair its functioning in a reliable manner.

Occasionally, severe space weather results in a huge eruption of particles which can be particularly disruptive to electric power systems, and induce ground currents powerful enough to actually melt the copper windings of electric power transformers. The last major solar flare eruption in 1989 caused blackouts across the Canadian province of Quebec for nine hours. But even greater storms can occur perhaps every 100 or more years. The first major eruption of this size was observed in 1859. It destroyed much of the world's telegraph infrastructure of the time.

As such, FERC's responsibility for the reliability of the grid and related ratemaking authority allow the Commission to discover issues and authorize utilities to recover the jurisdictional portion of costs related to grid critical infrastructure protection upgrades. FERC recognizes that EISA does not make Smart Grid standards mandatory, nor does EISA give it authority to make or enforce such standards. FERC has jurisdiction over the bulk power system, but this currently excludes authority over the nation's electric distribution systems where much of the smarter grid will be deployed. The Commission appears to view its reliability mandate under EISA as giving it the authority to adopt Smart Grid standards which will be applicable to all electric power facilities and devices with Smart Grid features, including those at the distribution level. FERC further ties cybersecurity to reliability by proposing a \"harmonization\" of each Smart Grid protocol and reliability standard developed.

As new devices and systems are being developed for the Smart Grid, so too is the array of infrastructure elements which must potentially be protected. This is a key concern for utilities, as the resources which may have to be applied to cybersecurity concerns could likewise spiral upward in growth and costs. Utilities may understand how a smarter grid can enhance their efficiency and reliability, and the need for cybersecurity safeguards. Commercial and industrial customers may also see potential benefits in Smart Grid-enabled programs (such as demand response), and it is likely they will fund a significant portion of smarter grid improvements through rates. But at present very few consumers at the residential level seem to understand the potential of the Smart Grid, or have reason to believe it can do anything for them except increase rates. One recent study expects cybersecurity spending to represent approximately 15% of total Smart Grid capital investment between 2010 and 2015 (with total investment estimated to be $1.5 billion in North America).", "Smart Grid enhancements across the United States may vary by utility, state, region, and regulatory jurisdiction. Recovery of costs may present a major challenge especially to distribution utilities and state commissions charged with overseeing utility costs. When faced with such decisions, the perception of the potential risks to the utility's local system will likely bear on what costs the utility's ratepayers should pay. EISA requires states only to consider recovery of costs related to Smart Grid systems. FERC has jurisdiction over the bulk power grid, i.e., transmission and wholesale rates in interstate commerce. FERC cannot compel entities involved in distribution to comply with its regulations. Since distribution utilities are regulated by state or local public utility commissions, Smart Grid investments will likely require approval by these jurisdictions.

Security of customer information in wireless applications, and how personal data characteristics (such as customer usage information) can be protected are issues often mentioned in discussions of the Smart Grid and cybersecurity. Encryption of data (with limited decryption for data checking), and aggregation of data at high levels to mask individual usership have been mentioned as ways to protect the identity of individual customers. Limiting the amount of data to just information needed for billing purposes has been suggested as a remedy to the potential for misuse of data. Real-time monitoring of these networks may alert system operators to suspicious activities. But even these methods might not be enough to guard against a sophisticated intruder if data security is taken for granted. The development of Smart Grid standards for electric utilities and their partners governing the collection and use of customer data may be a possible next step.

But customer-specific data stored in home area networks (HANs), or customer-specific data communicated between the HAN and distribution utility (or load aggregator) must be secure to protect the privacy of information. The advent of electric vehicles may offer another potential payload of data on customer movement and habits, if data collected or stored is not restricted to electricity consumption for billing purposes.

Damage to the fossil fuel delivery networks would likely impair operation of central station generating plants, depending on how much of an inventory of fuel is stored on-site. This greater diversity of resource options would likely further enhance the Smart Grid's expected improvement in reliability due a greater diversity of resource options, joining together these newer elements with traditional power stations in the power grid of the future. But the characteristics that these elements bring to the system could be considered in the design of CIP standards and protocols.", "Although this report has focused on cybersecurity aspects of a smarter electrical grid, technologies being developed for use by the Smart Grid could also be used by natural gas pipeline, water supply, and telecommunications systems.

Consideration could be given to applying similar control system device and system safeguards to these other vital utility systems. The electricity grid is connected to (and largely dependent on) these other resource and communications providers as the vast majority of power production today needs water for steam generation or natural gas for fuel. Similarly, natural gas pipelines use many electrically powered compressors to maintain pipeline pressure and move gas through the system, and the nation's water systems is a notable consumer of electricity for distribution and supply purposes. These interdependent systems are also vulnerable to natural hazards such as earthquakes and tornadoes.
