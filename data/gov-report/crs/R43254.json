The Court has also ruled that gender stereotyping is a form of discrimination on the basis of sex. Therefore, if a student who is gay or transgender is being harassed because of a failure to conform to gender stereotypes, such harassment is prohibited by Title IX.

If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is [President] L.B.J.\" The defendant was arrested and charged with violating 18 U.S.C. Section 871(a) for \"knowingly and willfully ... [making a] threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States.\" The Court held that, although the federal statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad, the defendant's statement was protected because it was not a \"true threat.\" The Court found that the content of Watts's statement, the context in which the statement was made, and the audience's reaction to the statement were all supportive of Watts's claim that he engaged in protected \"political hyperbole.\" The Court recognized that \"true threats\" should not be afforded First Amendment protection, and stated, \"What is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.\"", "Watts did not establish a bright-line test for distinguishing a true threat from protected speech. As such, lower courts have created varying tests for determining whether speech rises to the level of a true threat. The main point of contention among the appellate courts is whether the focus of a \"true threat\" test should be on the speaker or the listener. Some courts evaluate the existence of a threat by determining whether the speaker should reasonably have foreseen his words to be threatening, while others rest the determination on whether a reasonable recipient would be threatened by the statement.", "Based on these principles, it is possible that anti-bullying laws or policies could be deemed constitutionally deficient if the prohibited behavior does not rise to the level of a \"true threat\" under most circumstances. This analysis, however, may differ depending on whether the challenged language is contained in a state statute or school policy.", "In the school context, school officials who use anti-bullying policies to take disciplinary action against students may face legal challenges based on the First Amendment. While students generally retain the protections of the First Amendment, these protections may not always mirror the constitutional protections afforded in other contexts. For example, in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District , the Court held that student expression may be regulated only if it would substantially disrupt school operations or interfere with the rights of others. ", "In Tinker , students wore black armbands to school to protest the United States' involvement in Vietnam, despite knowledge that such action was in violation of school policy. The students were asked to remove the armbands, and upon their refusal were suspended until they came to school without the armbands. The Court held that the wearing of armbands for the purpose of expressing different viewpoints is the type of symbolic act within the protection of the First Amendment. Specifically, the Court ruled that \"First Amendment rights, applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment, are available to teachers and students. It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of expression at the schoolhouse gate.\"", "The Court subsequently refined the Tinker rationale as it applies to verbal expression or \"pure speech.\" In Bethel School District 403 v. Fraser , the Court ruled that school officials had the authority to discipline a student for violating school rules by delivering a lewd speech at a school assembly. Shifting its focus from the students' rights articulated in Tinker , the Court instead emphasized the school's duty to inculcate habits and manners of civility and teach students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior. In addition, the Court noted the importance of protecting minors from vulgar, lewd, or indecent language. As such, the Court concluded that the nomination speech had a disruptive effect on the education process, and that it was up to school officials to determine what manner of speech in the classroom or in school assembly is appropriate.", "While it is undisputed that the First Amendment does not protect \"offensive\" speech while on school grounds, courts are less clear when the speech occurs off school premises. For example, in J.S. v. Bethlehem Area School District , an 8 th grader created a website that contained derogatory remarks regarding a math teacher and a principal. Most of the website was devoted to ridiculing the math teacher, comparing her to Adolph Hitler and making fun of her physical appearance. In addition, the site contained a solicitation for contributions to pay for a \"hit man.\" School officials subsequently expelled the student, citing the extreme emotional distress suffered by the math teacher and the disruption the website caused at the school. The student argued that his website was protected speech.", "In reviewing the case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided two issues: (1) whether the student's speech constituted a true threat; and (2) whether the Tinker and Fraser standards permit a school district to discipline a student for off-campus speech. In addressing the \"true threat\" issue, the court determined that, although the website was in extremely poor taste, it was not a \"true threat.\" Specifically, the court stated that \"[w]e believe that the [w]ebsite, taken as a whole, was a sophomoric, crude, highly offensive and perhaps misguided attempt at humor or parody. However, it did not reflect a serious expression of intent to inflict harm,\" as the site focused primarily on the teacher's physical appearance, utilizing cartoons, hand drawings, and a reference to Adolph Hitler.", "The court then addressed whether First Amendment jurisprudence permitted the school to discipline a student for off-campus speech. It dismissed the argument that the website was off-campus speech beyond the school's jurisdiction. Specifically, the court stated that \"[w]e find there is a sufficient nexus between the [w]ebsite and the school campus to consider the speech as occurring on-campus.\" The court made this determination because the student had accessed the site at school, showed it to a fellow student, and informed other students about the site. The court then reasoned that school officials could punish the student under the Tinker or Fraser standard \u2014under the Fraser standard because the speech on the website was vulgar and highly offensive, and under the Tinker standard inasmuch as the website caused a substantial disruption of school activities. ", "Ultimately, court rulings in this area tend to depend on the circumstances that arise in a given case, with courts sometimes upholding a school's disciplinary actions and other times ruling in favor of a student's right to free speech."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fourteenth Amendment: Due Process", "paragraphs": ["Another constitutional constraint that legislators and school administrators may face when drafting legislation or school policies aimed at curtailing bullying is the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause provides that \"[n]o State shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.... \" Under the due process clause, criminal statutes that lack sufficient definiteness or specificity may be held \"void for vagueness.\" A governmental regulation or statute may be declared void if it fails to give a person adequate warning that his or her conduct is prohibited or if it fails to set out adequate standards to prevent arbitrary and/or discriminatory enforcement. ", "Indeed, a statute may be so vague or threatening to constitutionally protected activity that it can be pronounced unconstitutional on its face. For example, in Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville , a unanimous Court struck down as facially invalid a vagrancy ordinance that punished:", "dissolute persons who go about begging, ... common night walkers, ... common railers and brawlers, persons wandering or strolling around from place to place without any lawful purpose or object, habitual loafers, ... persons neglecting all lawful business and habitually spending their time by frequenting houses of ill fame, gaming houses, or places where alcoholic beverages are sold or served, persons able to work but habitually living upon the earnings of their wives or minor children.", "The Court found the statute facially invalid, as it failed to provide fair notice or require specific intent to commit an unlawful act. The Court concluded that the statute permitted arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions, provided police officers too much discretion, and criminalized activities that are normally innocent.", "When evaluating the constitutionality of anti-bullying laws or policies, the courts may apply these due process principles. For example, in Flaherty v. Keystone Oaks School District , a student filed a lawsuit after being disciplined for posting on an online message board devoted to high school volleyball. A federal district court held that the breadth of student handbook policies pertaining to discipline and technology was overreaching, thus violating students' free speech rights. In addition, the court held that the policies were unconstitutionally vague in definition and as applied. ", "The court found the school policies unconstitutionally overbroad for several reasons. First, the policies were not referred to or incorporated in the student handbook. In addition, the policy \"authorizes discipline where a student's expression that is abusive, offending, harassing, or inappropriate, interferes with the educational program of the schools.\" This standard, concluded the court, did not comply with the Tinker requirement that discipline should be reserved for those circumstances that cause a substantial disruption to school operations.", "Finally, the court noted that even if it did not find the policy overbroad, it would find the student handbook policies unconstitutionally vague, as the terms \"abuse, offend, harassment, and inappropriate\" were not defined in any significant manner. In addition, the court found the policies not only vague in definition but also in application. The court noted that school personnel had varying interpretations of the policies. As such, the court concluded that the policies were vague enough to result in arbitrary enforcement. Therefore, the court concluded that the student handbook policies did not provide the student with adequate warning of proscribed conduct.", "Ultimately, when drafting legislation or school policies to combat student bullying, legislators and school administrators must consider the constitutional constraints imposed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, such officials must ensure that statutes and school policies are narrow enough not to infringe upon protected speech and specific enough not to be found unconstitutionally vague."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
