CRC entered into force in September 1990, and has been ratified by 195 countries, making it the most widely ratified human rights treaty in the world.

The Clinton Administration signed the Convention in February 1995, but did not submit it to the Senate primarily because of strong opposition from several Members of Congress. The George W. Bush Administration opposed CRC and expressed serious political and legal concerns with the treaty, arguing that it conflicted with U.S. laws regarding privacy and family rights. The election of President Obama in 2008 focused renewed attention on the possibility of U.S. ratification. For the past several years, the Administration has stated that it supports the goals of the Convention and that the decision to pursue ratification of CRC is being determined through an interagency policy review.", "Issues for Congress", "The question of U.S. ratification of CRC has generated contentious debate. Opponents argue that ratification would undermine U.S. sovereignty by giving the United Nations authority to determine the best interests of U.S. children. Some are also concerned that CRC could interfere in the private lives of families, particularly the rights of parents to educate or discipline their children. Moreover, some contend that CRC is an ineffective mechanism for protecting children's rights. They emphasize that countries widely regarded as abusers of children's rights, such as China and Sudan, are party to the Convention. On the other hand, supporters of U.S. ratification hold that CRC's intention is not to circumvent the role of parents but to protect children against government intrusion and abuse. Proponents emphasize what they view as CRC's strong support for the role of parents and the family structure. They also hold that U.S. federal and state laws generally meet the requirements of CRC, and that U.S. ratification would strengthen the United States' credibility when advocating children's rights abroad.", "Perhaps more than other human rights treaties, CRC addresses areas usually considered to be primarily or exclusively under the jurisdiction of state or local governments, including education, juvenile justice, and access to healthcare.

Many believe that parents should be able to raise their children in a way that reflects their morals and values without interference from outside parties, and some have argued that under CRC parental responsibility exists only in the context of its role in furthering the independent choices of children. Moreover, CRC opponents argue that U.S. ratification would encourage children to disregard parental authority, possibly leading them to file complaints against or sue their parents. Such actions, they argue, would undermine parental rights and give children inappropriate influence over their own lives.", "In particular, some Convention opponents are concerned about how the CRC Committee may interpret the Convention's provisions on the \"best interest of the child,\" which is referenced in several articles, including 3, 9, 18, and 40. Critics maintain that allowing a U.N. Committee to interpret what is in the best interest of U.S. children severely undermines the role of U.S. parents to determine how to raise, educate, and discipline their children. Opponents have also taken issue with other CRC provisions that, in their view, could be interpreted to undermine parental rights and responsibilities:", "Privacy \u2014Article 16(1) states, \"no child shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy.\" Some have interpreted this to mean that parents may not have the right to search their children's rooms or be notified if a child is arrested or undergoes an abortion. Freedom of expression \u2014Article 13(1) provides that the child shall have the \"right to freedom of expression,\" including \"freedom to seek, receive, and impact information and ideas of all kinds.\" Some contend that this could be interpreted to allow children to speak their minds at all times, regardless of parental authority or discipline. Freedom of thought, conscience, and religion \u2014Some maintain that Article 14(1), which states that \"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion,\" might give children the right to object to their parents' religious beliefs or training. Access to information \u2014Article 17 states that States Parties shall ensure that \"the child has access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources.\" Some interpret this to mean that children have a right to access any type of information regardless of their parents' preferences, including television, books, and other sources they find objectionable. Education \u2014Critics assert that Article 28(1), which states that States Parties recognize \"the right of the child to education,\" could lead to the government or CRC Committee mandating public schooling or interfering with the right of parents to home-school or send their children to private school. Some are concerned that Article 29(1), which addresses elements that shall be included in a child's education, could lead to government interference in private school and home-school curricula. Corporal punishment \u2014Article 19(1) states, \"no child should be subjected to physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation,\" at school or by a parent or legal guardian. Some interpret this to mean that parents may not be allowed to discipline their children though corporal punishment, such as spanking. Freedom of association\u2014 Some are concerned that Article 15(1), which calls on States Parties to \"recognize the rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom of peaceful assembly\" could give children the right to associate with people that his or her parents do not approve of, including cults or gangs.", "Supporters of the Convention emphasize that it was established not to circumvent the role of parents but to protect children against government intrusion and abuse. They contend, for example, that Article 16 on the child's right to privacy is meant to protect children not from their parents but from government intrusion into the child's or family's privacy. Similarly, proponents maintain that Article 13 on a child's right to freedom of expression is intended to protect children from states that undermine parental authority by denying children the right to artistic, religious, or other forms of expression. Some also make a similar argument regarding Article 14 on a child's right to thought, conscience, and religion. In their view, the Article is not meant as a means for children to challenge their parent's religion or discipline, but to protect children from state interference in these areas, particularly if children are separated from their families. Some supporters have cited the experiences of Jewish children during the Holocaust and the plight of Christian children in China as examples of instances where children should be protected from government actions regarding religion. ", "Similarly, supporters emphasize that CRC provisions on children's access to information (Article 17) and freedom of association (Article 15) are meant to protect children not from parental authority, but from government intrusion in these areas. CRC supporters also note that provisions that address a child's right to education (Articles 28 and 29) are not intended to undermine the role of parents in choosing a child's education. Rather, they are meant to establish and protect children's rights in countries with poor or unbalanced educational systems. In some countries, for example, girls are forbidden or discouraged from receiving an education. In such cases, supporters argue, ratification of the Convention could play a role in ensuring equal access to education for both girls and boys.", "Many CRC advocates also emphasize what they view as the Convention's strong support for the role of parents and the family structure. They contend that CRC's provisions\u2014including those regarding education, corporal punishment, and references to the \"best interest of the child\"\u2014should be balanced with what many perceive as the Convention's overall emphasis on the important role of parents in raising their children. Proponents support this view by citing Article 7, which states, \"as far as possible, the child has a right to be known and be cared for by his or her parents,\" and Article 3, which states:", "States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents , legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her [emphasis added].", "Supporters also emphasize the Convention's references to the role of the family and parents in 18 other articles, as well as the CRC preamble, which states that the family is \"the fundamental group of society,\" and recognizes, \"the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment.\" Advocates further assert that there is no language in the Convention that allows for prosecutions, lawsuits, or investigations of parents or guardians. Any such actions, they argue, would be based on existing U.S. laws rather than CRC provisions or recommendations of the CRC Committee.", "To alleviate concerns regarding parental rights, some have suggested that if the United States were to ratify CRC, it may wish to include RUDs addressing the issue. When considering ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Elimination on All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), for instance, the Clinton Administration proposed a \"private conduct\" reservation which stated that the United States \"does not accept any obligation under the Convention to regulate private conduct except as mandated by the Constitution and U.S. law.\" Some have also suggested including RUDs that specifically address parental rights.

Ultimately, in the interest of compromise and to allow for the maximum number of ratifications, CRC drafters agreed to not address the issue in the main articles of the Convention. The intent was to leave the text purposefully vague so that ratifying countries could interpret the provisions to align with their own domestic law and policies on abortion. For example, the Convention's definition of a child as \"every human being below the age of eighteen years\" intentionally does not set a lower age limit, leaving the States Parties to determine where life begins. This intentional ambiguity allows countries to apply their own interpretations to other provisions that address children's rights, particularly Article 6, which recognizes that \"every child has the inherent right to life,\" and states that States Parties shall ensure \"to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.\" Nevertheless, some States Parties to CRC, including China, France, Luxembourg, and Tunisia, attached reservations to CRC stating that Article 6 should not interfere with national legislation and policies regarding abortion.", "The preamble of CRC has also raised some questions regarding the Convention's position on abortion. It specifically mentions the needs of the child before birth, stating \"the child ... needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth.\" Some maintain that this statement implies that CRC protects the rights of the so-called \"unborn,\" which could require States Parties to outlaw abortion. Though the preamble is not an operational paragraph of the Convention, some experts emphasize that under international law the preamble to a treaty could be relevant to its interpretation. Others contend, however, that preambular statements do not carry the same force as articles of the Convention. The legislative history of CRC indicates that the drafters did not intend for the preambular sentence to protect the rights of children before birth. That sentence, which was originally included in the Declaration on the Rights of the Child, was reportedly included as a compromise during negotiations on Article 1 that sought to define a \"child.\" CRC drafters were concerned that it could be interpreted as protecting the rights of the \"unborn,\" and in the official record of the negotiation included a statement clarifying that the preambular paragraph did not intend to prejudice States Parties' interpretation of Article 1 on the definition of a child or any other CRC provisions.", "The United States generally agreed that the draft Convention should not aim to \"institutionalize\" a particular point of view on abortion because doing so would make the Convention \"unacceptable from the outset to countries espousing a different point of view.\" During negotiations on the Convention text, the U.S. delegation insisted that CRC must be worded in such a way \"that neither proponents nor opponents of abortion can find legal support for their respective positions in the draft Convention.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Family Planning", "paragraphs": ["Some CRC opponents are concerned that Article 24, which focuses on the right of the child to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health, could require parents to make or expose their children to family planning choices that contradict their values.

Similarly, some argue that it could allow children access to contraceptives without the knowledge of, or permission from, their parents.", "Supporters of U.S. ratification argue that CRC provides for States Parties to make their own interpretations and decisions regarding family planning education and services. They emphasize that Article 24(2)(f) allows for States Parties to take \" appropriate [emphasis added] measures ... to develop family planning education and services\" thereby leaving it to individual countries to interpret what is appropriate in the context of their national policies and laws.

They point out that countries with a wide range of family planning policies have ratified the Convention\u2014including China, the Holy See (Vatican), Canada, Ireland, and the Philippines. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Effectiveness of the Convention", "paragraphs": ["A significant area of debate among CRC supporters and opponents is the effectiveness of the Convention, particularly in countries that have already ratified it. Some critics agree with CRC's overall goal of protecting children's rights internationally, but they do not believe that the treaty is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. As evidence of this, they emphasize that countries that many regard as abusers of children's rights\u2014including Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and China\u2014are party to the Convention. Similarly, some argue that instead of helping children, ratification of CRC may serve as a facade for governments that abuse children's rights.", "Critics have also asserted that reservations and declarations that some countries attached to the Convention are at odds with the purpose of the treaty, possibly undermining its intent and effectiveness. A number of Islamic countries, for example, attached reservations stating that the Convention would not apply to provisions that they deem incompatible with Islamic Shari'a law or values. Some are concerned that the ambiguity of such reservations could allow for broad interpretations of the Convention's provisions, particularly in the area of child marriage and education for girls. Other States Parties also included reservations that aim to apply CRC only when it is compatible with domestic laws. Holy See (the Vatican), for example, included a reservation stating that the application of the Convention [should] be \"compatible in practice with the particular nature of the Vatican City State and of the sources of its objective law.\" Other countries, such as Sweden and Norway, have objected to the inclusion of these reservations. When filing their own reservations and declarations, they state that the reservations of some countries \"may cast doubts on the commitments of the reserving state [to the Convention].\"", "Supporters of CRC contend that it has enhanced children's rights in a number of countries that have ratified the Convention. Human Rights Watch, for example, reports that many countries have used CRC as a basis for enhancing existing legislation and improving children's rights. Similarly, a 2004 U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) review of 62 States Parties to CRC found that more than half of the countries studied had incorporated Convention provisions into their domestic laws, and nearly one-third of the countries had incorporated provisions into their national constitutions. UNICEF also reports that CRC played a role in establishing over 60 independent human rights institutions for children in 38 countries. Ultimately, however, supporters generally acknowledge that while progress has been made, many countries still have a long way to go in implementing the Convention. The 2004 UNICEF review, for instance, found that while high-level political commitment to CRC is essential to developing new laws to protect children's rights, social change will occur only when high-level commitment is matched by \"effective law enforcement, allocation of adequate resources and the engagement of all levels of society.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Convention as an Instrument of U.S. Foreign Policy", "paragraphs": ["Many CRC supporters hold that ratification of the Convention would strengthen U.S. credibility abroad and give the United States additional fora in which to pursue the advancement of children's rights. Specifically, they argue that U.S. non-ratification leads foreign governments to question the sincerity of the United States in addressing children's rights, thereby hindering the ability of U.S. diplomats to advocate child rights in countries with poor human rights records. They contend that many countries view the United States as hypocritical because it expects other countries to comply with international standards that it does not itself follow. Some, for example, point to U.S. statutes that require U.S. foreign assistance to be subject to a country's compliance with \"internationally recognized human rights.\" Further, some argue that U.S. ratification would provide the United States with an opportunity to influence international laws and standards in the area of children's rights. They maintain that the United States, with its history of democracy and policies that respect children, could share its experience and expertise with other countries that aim to protect children's rights.", "Opponents of CRC argue that the United States is the international leader in advancing children's rights and that U.S. non-ratification does not impact its ability to advocate children's rights to foreign governments. They maintain that the United States has demonstrated its commitment to children by ratifying the Optional Protocols to the Convention and by implementing laws and policies that protect and preserve the rights of children in the United States. Some critics of ratification also contend that CRC and, more broadly, other international human rights treaties, are designed for countries with lesser human rights traditions. They argue that U.S. laws far exceed the standards established in such agreements, and that ratifying the treaties would not benefit U.S. citizens. Moreover, some are reluctant to leave the question of U.S. obligations under international treaties to other countries\u2014particularly those with low human rights standards. Critics have also expressed concern that U.S. ratification of CRC and other human rights treaties could be used as a basis for unfounded political criticisms of the United States in international fora."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
