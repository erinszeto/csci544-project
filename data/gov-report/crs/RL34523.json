Potential critics may argue that if a function under consideration for insourcing is currently being performed by contractor personnel and an A-76 competition is required, an agency might not have sufficient resources to perform the tasks associated with a public-private competition.", "Section 737 of P.L. 111-8 prohibits using funds appropriated by this act or any other act for the announcement or commencement of a public-private competition or study that involves activities currently being performed by federal employees. This provision does not apply to public-private competitions in progress. In its report on H.R. 7323 , the House Committee on Appropriations explained that the \"one-year moratorium on new A-76 studies\" would provide \"the new [presidential] Administration ... an opportunity to review and develop Federal workforce policies.\" In the absence of additional information, the meaning of \"Federal workforce policies\" is unclear in this context. Nevertheless, the moratorium could provide an opportunity for gathering data on the disposition of federal employees whose work was outsourced as a result of public-private competitions, or conducting an independent study of the savings and costs associated with public-private competitions. Opponents of this provision might assert that the moratorium will adversely affect the amount of savings that results from completed competitions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cuba Sanctions141", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy toward communist Cuba has consisted largely of efforts to isolate the island nation through comprehensive economic sanctions, including prohibitions on U.S. financial transactions\u2014the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR)\u2014that are administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).", "Restrictions on travel have been a key and often contentious component of U.S. efforts to isolate the Cuban government by denying it access to U.S. currency. The regulations do not ban travel itself, but place restrictions on any financial transactions related to travel to Cuba. Over the years, there have been numerous changes to the CACR regarding family travel. In March 2003, the regulations were eased to allow such travel to visit relatives within three degrees of relationship to the traveler (e.g., great-grandparents and second cousins). In June 2004, however, the restrictions were tightened to allow family travel only to visit immediate family once every three years for a period not to exceed 14 days. Permission from OFAC was required through a specific license. Previously, OFAC allowed family travel under a general license, which meant that there was no need to obtain special permission from OFAC.", "Under U.S. sanctions, some U.S. commercial agricultural exports to Cuba have been allowed since 2001 pursuant to the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, or TSRA (Title IX of P.L. 106-387 ). However, there are numerous restrictions and licensing requirements for these exports. For instance, exporters are denied access to U.S. private commercial financing or credit, and all transactions must be paid for in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. The Administration tightened sanctions on Cuba in February 2005 by further restricting how U.S. agricultural exporters may be paid for their product. OFAC amended the CACR to clarify that the term \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba means that the payment is to be received prior to the shipment of the goods. This differs from the practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods, a practice that had been utilized by many U.S. agricultural exporters to Cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001. U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress strongly objected to this \"clarification\" on the grounds that the action constituted a new sanction that violated the intent of TSRA, and could jeopardize millions of dollars in U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. Then OFAC Director Robert Werner maintained that the clarification \"conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade.\"", "Since 2001 Cuba has purchased almost $2.7 billion in agricultural products from the United States. Overall U.S. exports to Cuba rose from about $7 million in 2001 to $404 million in 2004. U.S. exports to Cuba declined in 2005 and 2006 to $369 million and $340 million, respectively, but increased to $447 million in 2007. In 2008, U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba rose to $718 million, far higher than in previous years, in part because of the rise in food prices, but also because of increased Cuban needs in the aftermath of several hurricanes and tropical storms that severely damaged Cuba's agricultural sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Action", "paragraphs": ["From 2000-2007, either one or both houses of Congress included provisions in the annual Treasury Department appropriations bill that would have eased U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba (especially on travel and on U.S. agricultural exports), but none of these provisions were enacted. The Bush Administration regularly threatened to veto legislation if it included any provision weakening sanctions on Cuba. In 2007, both the House-passed and Senate Appropriations Committee-reported versions of the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill, H.R. 2829 , contained language that would have eased Cuba sanctions, but ultimately Congress dropped these provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ).", "In 2008, the House Appropriations Committee version of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill for FY2009, H.R. 7323 , contained three provisions in Title VI that would have eased restrictions on the sale of U.S. agricultural exports and on family travel. Section 621 would have prohibited funds in the act from being used to administer, implement, or enforce new language in the Cuban embargo regulations added on February 25, 2005 (31 CFR Part 515.533) that requires that U.S. agricultural exports must be paid for before they leave U.S. ports. With regard to family travel, Section 622 would have allowed for such travel once a year, while Section 623 would have expanded such travel by a person to visit an aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or first cousin. The committee's report to the bill, H.Rept. 110-920 , would have required the OFAC to provide detailed information on OFAC's Cuba-related licensing and enforcement actions.", "The Senate version of the FY2009 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill, S. 3260 , as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 14, 2008 ( S.Rept. 110-417 ), included three provisions easing Cuba sanctions. Section 618 (identical to Section 621 in the House version of the bill) would have prohibited funds in the act from being used to restrict payment terms for the sale of agricultural goods to Cuba. Section 619 would have eased restrictions on travel relating to the commercial sale of agricultural and medical goods to Cuba by allowing for such travel under a general license. Section 620 would have prohibited funds from being used to administer, implement, or enforce family travel restrictions that were imposed by the Bush Administration in June 2004.", "None of the Cuba provisions in S. 3260 or H.R. 7323 were included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2009 ( P.L. 110-329 ), which continued FY2009 appropriations for the Treasury Department through March 6, 2009 (at FY2008 levels).", "In 2009, however, the 111 th Congress included three provisions easing Cuba sanctions in Sections 620-622 of Division D of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 ( H.R. 1105 / P.L. 111-8 ) that was signed into law on March 11, 2009. (The provisions were identical to the Cuba provisions in the Senate version of the FY2009 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill, S. 3260 .) The provisions ease restrictions on family travel and travel for the marketing and sale of U.S. agricultural and medical exports to Cuba, and also were intended to ease payment provisions for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, although as discussed below, the Treasury Department's interpretation of this provision mitigated its practical effect. The joint explanatory statement to P.L. 111-8 also requires the Department of the Treasury to prepare a report within 90 days on the steps that it is taking to assess OFAC's allocation of resources for investigating and penalizing violations of the Cuba embargo with respect to the numerous other sanctions programs it administers. As part of the report, the Treasury Department is directed to provide detailed information on OFAC's Cuba-related licensing on its enforcement of the Cuba embargo.", "Travel for the Marketing and Sale of Agricultural and Medical Goods. Section 620 amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations for travel to, from, or within Cuba under a general license for the marketing and sale of agricultural and medical goods. Such travel had required a specific license from OFAC, issued on a case by case basis. On March 9, 2009, Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner stated in a letter published in the Congressional Record that the regulations issued pursuant to this provision \"would provide that the representatives of only a narrow class of businesses would be eligible, under a new general license, to travel to market and sell agricultural and medical goods.\" The Secretary also maintained that \"any business using the general license would be required to provide both advance written notice outlining the purpose and scope of the planned travel and, upon return, a report outlining the activities conducted, including the persons with whom they met, the expenses incurred, and business conducted in Cuba.\" On March 11, 2009, OFAC maintained that it would implement this provision in the coming weeks and promulgate regulations authorizing travel under the general license for the marketing and sale of agricultural and medical goods.", "Family Travel. Section 621 prohibits funds from being used to administer, implement, or enforce family travel restrictions that were imposed by the Bush Administration in June 2004. As noted above, those 2004 restrictions allowed family travel only to visit immediate family (grandparents, grandchildren, parents, siblings, spouses, and children) once every three years for a period not to exceed 14 days. Under the 2004 restrictions, a specific license was required from OFAC for such travel, and the authorized amount that family travelers could spend while in Cuba was limited to $50 a day. On March 11, 2009, OFAC provided guidance on its implementation of this omnibus provision that reinstated the authorization for family travel to Cuba that existed prior to the June 2004 restrictions. OFAC issued a general license authorizing family travel once every 12 months for an unlimited length of stay, and increased daily expenditure limits for family travelers to the same as all other authorized travelers to Cuba (State Department maximum per diem rate for Havana, currently $179 a day). The new general license also provides for an expanded definition of \"close relatives\" to mean any individual related to the traveler by blood, marriage, or adoption, who is no more than three generations removed from that person (e.g., great-grandparents and second cousins). Specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis for additional visits during the 12-month period or for travel to visit a close relative who is not a national of Cuba.", "Payment of Cash in Advance. Section 622 prohibits funds in the Act from being used to administer, implement, or enforce an amendment to the Cuban embargo regulations issued on February 25, 2005, requiring that U.S. agricultural exporters using the \"cash in advance\" payment mechanism for selling their goods to Cuba must be paid in cash for their goods before the goods leave U.S. ports. As noted above, TSRA requires either the \"payment of cash in advance\" for such exports (or financing by third country financial institutions), but does not provide a definition of cash in advance. Prior to the February 2005 amendment to the Cuban embargo regulations, U.S. exporters could be paid for the goods before they were unloaded in Cuba. OFAC guidance on the implementation of this provision states that TSRA's statutory provisions remain in place that agricultural exports to Cuba be either paid for by \"cash in advance\" or financed using a third-country bank. Secretary of the Treasury Geithner provided additional guidance on the implementation of this provision in a letter published in the Congressional Record that states that, \"exporters will still be required to receive payment in advance of shipment.\" This appears to continue the Bush Administration policy imposed in February 2005. Given the Secretary's interpretation, it appears the omnibus provision will have little, if any, practical effect. While the Secretary's response ameliorated the concerns that several Senators had regarding the provision, it also triggered concerns by other Senators who maintained that the Secretary's action ignores the legislative intent of the Cuba provisions to ease restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
