{"id": "R42707", "title": "Unemployment Compensation (UC): Eligibility for Students Under State and Federal Laws", "released_date": "2013-04-01T00:00:00", "summary": ["The recent economic recession and subsequent recovery period has produced one of the most challenging labor markets in recent decades. Many workers lost their jobs during this time period, as others were just entering the market for the first time. As a strategy to cope with the difficult employment situation, many individuals entered school to acquire skills to become more competitive, while others never left, remaining in school to postpone the employment search. However, due to the prolonged nature of the recovery, many students and workers remain jobless and struggle to find work. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, in February 2013, approximately 12.0 million workers remained jobless, of which almost 3.5 million individuals aged 16 to 24 were unemployed.", "Those that have gone back to school, and have now graduated, still face a competitive job market, and may need to search for work for a prolonged period of time. According to BLS data, in June 2012, there were approximately 3.4 unemployed workers for every available job, and almost 40% of the unemployed have been jobless for more than six months. Because of this economic climate, Congress has been interested in not only job creation and how students are coping with the competitive job market, but whether they are receiving income support during times of unemployment in order to cope.", "Unemployment Compensation (UC) is a joint federal-state program that provides income support payments to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Federal law sets out broad guidelines with regard to how the UC program operates and how it should be administered. State laws establish eligibility criteria for who qualifies for the program. In the case of a student who becomes unemployed, eligibility would depend on how their respective state treats students within the UC system.", "Most states disqualify students from UC benefits while they are in school or disqualify individuals from UC benefits if they leave work to attend school. This is typically due to the presumption that students would be unavailable for work during the time that they are in school. However, exceptions and variations exist from state to state. Many workers who lost their jobs and remain in school may be eligible for UC benefits depending on their circumstances and how their respective states treat students.", "This report describes these state variations in further detail and how states consider students within the framework of their own unique UC programs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["With the official end of the most recent recession in June 2009, congressional interest remains heightened with regard to job creation and the income security of the workers in this country. Traditionally, the path to high wage growth and secure employment for workers has been to pursue and complete education through vocational schools, post-secondary schools, or other institutions. However, employment prospects remain dim for the growing number of recent graduates. Many young workers who have lost their jobs or are still in school face challenges such as unemployment, or if they have a job, underemployment. In February 2013, among individuals aged 16 to 24 in the United States, the unemployment rate was 16.3%.", "Workers who have lost their job through no fault of their own often rely on Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits for income support during periods of unemployment. Current graduating students, as well as recent graduates from years past, may have worked during previous periods, or worked while they were attending school. If they earned sufficient wages to qualify for UC benefits, they may be eligible to receive this form of income support if they became subsequently unemployed (depending on state considerations). However, students who worked previously, or are concurrently working and attending school, may face barriers and impediments to their UC claims once they are unemployed. ", "This can occur in a number of ways. For example, a student could be attending school full-time, while also working full-time in covered employment, and then lose his or her job. In addition, a worker could have a job in covered employment, and also start school, and subsequently lose his or her job. In both cases, the individual may apply for UC benefits, but the eligibility for those benefits may differ according to the governing state.", "Many states disqualify workers from UC benefits for school attendance, although some states make exceptions for certain students, typically those receiving approved training or training under Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAA) program, which provides federal assistance to workers adversely affected by foreign trade.

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) administers the federal portion of the UC system, which operates in each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The UC program is financed by federal taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under the State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). In addition to establishing how the UC program is financed, these laws also establish certain criteria for UC eligibility. ", "Federal law excludes few positions or types of workers from coverage (with certain exceptions such as the self-employed or others as noted below). Because federal law provides broad guidelines for UC coverage, eligibility, and determination, specifics of each UC program are left to the determination of each state. Although general similarities exist between states, each state establishing its own criteria results in essentially 53 different UC programs. ", "State laws and program regulations determine UC benefit eligibility, payments, and duration. Generally, UC benefits are available to eligible workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and are willing, able, and available to work. In addition, UC eligibility is typically based on attaining qualified wages and employment covered in a 12-month period (called a base period) prior to unemployment. All states require a worker to earn a certain amount of wages or to work a certain period of time (or both) within the base period to be monetarily eligible to receive any UC benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recently Unemployed Graduates", "paragraphs": ["Nothing in federal law precludes recent graduates from receiving UC benefits if unemployed. However, the likelihood of a recent unemployed graduate receiving UC benefits is low. Recent college graduates and younger individuals may not be receiving UC benefits for a number of reasons, but basic criteria noted above often dictate eligibility. Generally, to be eligible for UC benefits, a recent graduate would need to have worked in covered employment, earned sufficient wages in his or her base period, and left his or her work involuntarily.", "In February 2013, the unemployment rate for individuals 16 to 24 years of age was 16.3%, with about 3.5 million individuals in this age group unemployed in the United States. Moreover, during that month, individuals 24 years of age or under received 8.9% of total UC benefits yet made up 29.1% of the unemployed population. Although younger workers generally earn lower wages and would likely therefore receive less return in UC benefits, this difference is substantial. Approximately 1 in 10 unemployed workers aged 16 to 24 receives unemployment insurance. Moreover, recent testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress suggested that individuals graduating from college during a large recession are likely to face reduced earnings that persist for up to 10 years compared with graduates during a boom economy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Unemployment Tax Act Eligibility Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["UC benefits are financed through employer taxes that are established by federal and state law. Federal taxes on employers are provided under the authority of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), whereas state taxes are provided under the authority of the State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). Federal law defines which jobs a state UC program must cover and provides broad guidelines concerning benefit eligibility, in order for the state's employers to avoid paying the maximum FUTA tax rate on each employee's annual pay.

The typical presumption behind this policy is that students are unable or unavailable to accept full-time work while in school. Workers must have established wages prior to receiving UC benefits, and the sufficiency of earned wages often depends on the part-time or full-time status of their job. States vary in how they establish definitions of a student, as well as whether they distinguish between part-time and full-time students for the purposes of UC benefits eligibility.

For example, school personnel who only work during the academic year would not be eligible for UC benefits during the summer period. In this case, personnel are not eligible for compensation during the entire period between the regular but non-successive academic years or terms. This denial also applies to vacation or holiday periods within school years or terms.", "The report further discusses how states treat students in two circumstances: whether they qualify for UC benefits while attending school (e.g., a student loses his or her job while in school) or whether they qualify for UC benefits if leaving work to attend school."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Eligibility While Attending School", "paragraphs": ["Most states disqualify students from UC benefits while they are attending school. States' policies tend to presume that students will be unavailable for full-time work because school hours often overlap with standard work hours.

However, if certain conditions are met, some states may allow students to remain eligible for UC benefits. ", "Exceptions to disqualification for UC benefits vary considerably. Almost 45% of states allow students to remain eligible for UC benefits if school attendance does not interfere with the ability and availability to accept suitable work or the student can demonstrate that he or she is seeking and able to accept full-time work. In addition, almost one-third of states allow students to qualify while in school if they are attending an approved training program or can demonstrate that they are willing to quit school or adjust class hours if suitable work is offered. A few states have stricter UC eligibility requirements and do not provide exceptions for students to qualify for UC benefits. Conversely, a few states have little restriction on UC eligibility for students attending school. Table 1 shows the variation among the states. ", "As Table 1 shows, just three states (Alabama, New York, and South Carolina) do not provide an exception to benefits disqualification if attending school. Many state UC programs will consider students eligible if certain conditions are met, namely through the combination of availability for work or seeking full-time work, or if the student is attending appropriate training.

Finally, a few states do not disqualify students from UC benefits for leaving work to attend school. Table 2 shows variation among the states.", "As Table 2 shows, most states disqualify students if they leave their jobs to attend school.
