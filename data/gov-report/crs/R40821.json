Health reform legislation, America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 (H.R. 3200), was introduced in the House on July 17, 2009, and ordered reported by the Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 31, 2009. H.R. 3200 proposes sweeping reforms of the health care delivery system, which are described in the three major components of H.R. 3200 designated Divisions A, B, and C. Division A, \"Affordable Health Care Choices,\" focuses on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, and providing financial assistance to certain individuals and, in some cases, small employers. Division B, \"Medicare and Medicaid Improvements,\" proposes modifications to the largest two health insurance programs to make them consistent with the changes proposed in Division A and to amend other provisions in existing federal statute. Division C, \"Public Health and Workforce Development,\" would amend and expand existing health professions and nursing workforce programs.", "This report summarizes the 34 Medicaid provisions in Division B of H.R. 3200. Due to the breadth of the changes proposed in H.R. 3200, some provisions of Divisions A and C also could affect Medicaid, but these are not Medicaid-specific. Division B also introduces a number of technical changes intended to improve quality of care, reduce federal and state expenditures, and address coverage gaps. The Division B provisions would introduce changes or new provisions to Medicaid eligibility; benefits; financing; waste, fraud, and abuse; payments to territories; demonstrations and pilot programs; and other miscellaneous Medicaid components. A major provision in Division B would expand Medicaid eligibility for traditional and non-traditional (mostly childless adults) beneficiary categories to 133\u2153% of the Federal Poverty Level. States would receive 100% federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) matching rates for these expanded beneficiary categories for two fiscal years (FY2013-FY2014) and then 90% thereafter (FY2015 and beyond). Another eligibility expansion would permit states the option of covering extremely high prescription drug expenditures for individuals already eligible for Medicaid when their incomes exceeded customary levels. Under benefits, Medicaid programs would be required to cover preventive services, receive higher FMAP rates to cover translations or interpretation services, and tobacco cessation products would be removed from Medicaid's excluded drug list.", "There are a number of financing changes that would affect Medicaid under H.R. 3200, including reducing Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments by $10 billion by FY2019, increasing prescription drug rebates, and extending prescription drug discounts to Medicaid-managed care enrollees. There are a number of additional waste, fraud, and abuse provisions affecting Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). These provisions include requirements to deny payment for health care acquired conditions, require new Medicaid Integrity Program evaluations and reports, increase the amount of time states would have to repay overpayments to one year when the overpayments were due to fraud, and require states to implement a national correct coding initiative, similar to the Medicare program. Under H.R. 3200, spending caps for the territories would be increased, and a series of demonstrations would be approved for Medicaid, including a medical home program, an accountable care organization program, and a program for stabilization of emergency medical conditions by privately owned or operated mental disease institutions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Status of House Legislation", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 3200 , America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, as introduced on July 14, 2009, was referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, Education and Labor, Oversight and Government Reform, and the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.

Medicaid's financial requirements place limits on the maximum amount of assets and income individuals may possess to participate in Medicaid. Additional guidelines specify how states should calculate these amounts. The specific asset and income limitations that apply to each eligibility group are set through a combination of federal parameters and state definitions. Consequently, these standards vary across states, and different standards apply to different population groups within states. ", "Of the approximately 50 different eligibility \"pathways\" into Medicaid, some are mandatory while others may be covered at state option. Examples of groups that states must provide Medicaid to include pregnant women and children under age six with family income below 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL), and poor individuals with disabilities or poor individuals over age 64 who qualify for cash assistance under the SSI program. Examples of groups that states may choose to cover under Medicaid include pregnant women and infants with family income exceeding 133% FPL up to 185% FPL, and \"medically needy\" individuals who meet categorical requirements with income up to 133% of the maximum payment amount applicable under states' former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs based on family size. \"Childless adults\" (nonelderly adults who are not disabled, not pregnant and not parents of dependent children), for example, are generally not eligible for Medicaid, regardless of their income.", "H.R. 3200 makes several changes to Medicaid eligibility.

In creating their Medicaid plans, states must conform to federal rules and guidance. Whenever states make changes to their Medicaid program, they must update their state plans by submitting a state plan amendment, which is also subject to review and approval by CMS.

This includes processes directed at reducing improper payments, as well as activities to prevent, detect, investigate, and ultimately prosecute health care fraud and abuse. More specifically, program integrity ensures that correct payments are paid to legitimate providers for appropriate and reasonable services for eligible beneficiaries. Medicaid and CHIP program integrity are often limited to issues of fraud and abuse by providers (as well as beneficiaries) and efforts to curtail these problems.

Operation of MFCUs and MMIS activities are matched at 75%, although the federal match is 90% for certain startup expenses.
