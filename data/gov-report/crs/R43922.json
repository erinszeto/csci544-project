This report provides a general overview of FEHB. It describes the structure of FEHB, including eligibility for the program and coverage options available to enrollees, as well as premiums, benefits and cost sharing, and general financing of FEHB. The report also describes the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in administering the program.", "Eligible individuals include federal employees, retirees, and their family members. As of calendar year 2014, Members of Congress and certain congressional staff are no longer eligible to enroll in plans offered under FEHB as employees but may be eligible to enroll in retirement. Coverage options available to eligible individuals include individual or family coverage in an approved health benefits plan. Beginning in calendar year 2016, individuals have a third coverage option: self plus one coverage for themselves and one eligible family member. Generally, available health benefits plans fall into two broad categories: fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs). FFS plans tend to be available nationwide, and HMOs tend to be locally available. Premiums are shared between the federal government and the employee or retiree. Benefits and cost sharing vary among FEHB plans, but all plans must cover basic services such as hospital and physician care and may require cost sharing in the form of deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. FEHB financing includes government contributions to premiums, contingency reserves in the U.S. Treasury to offset unexpected increases in costs, and administrative expenses incurred by OPM.", "The report also discusses how FEHB interacts with the United States Postal Service (USPS) and with Medicare as well as the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) on FEHB. Like most federal agencies, the USPS offers health insurance to its employees through FEHB. However, collective bargaining rights and prefunding obligations for retiree health costs make the USPS unique among federal agencies with regard to health benefits. Most federal employees or retirees aged 65 or older are automatically entitled to Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance, or HI). They also may choose to enroll in Medicare Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI) and Part D (prescription drug coverage). For individuals covered under an FEHB plan, Medicare is the primary payer, meaning it pays for benefits first, and FEHB is the secondary payer. The ACA established new requirements for FEHB plans in some cases. In others, it had no meaningful effect. For example, the requirement to provide coverage to children up to the age of 26 on their parent's plan was a new requirement for plans, but many plans were already meeting the ACA requirement not to deny coverage based on preexisting conditions.", "For information on the current plan year, such as premiums and cost sharing in FEHB and the most recent open season (the period each year during which individuals can enroll or change health plans), see CRS In Focus IF10324, The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program: Open Season for the 2016 Plan Year."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Basics of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program is the largest employer-sponsored health insurance program in the country.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) administers the program. (For more detailed information on OPM's role, see the Appendix .) OPM has statutory authority to contract with health insurance carriers that offer insurance coverage for comprehensive medical services and to prescribe regulations to carry out that authority.

These health plans are often combined with tax-advantaged accounts such as health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) or health savings accounts (HSAs). These accounts are designed to help enrollees save for future health care expenses, and both the health plan and the enrollee can make contributions to them, in the case of HSAs. The combination of CDHPs or HDHPs and tax-advantaged accounts is intended to help control costs by exposing enrollees to more risk for their health care expenditures. Generally, enrollees in health plans with tax-advantaged accounts have higher cost sharing (the amount an enrollee pays out of pocket, which includes deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments) than in other types of plans but pay lower premiums. They also tend to have greater flexibility in spending their health care dollars. For example, contributions to an HSA can be used to cover medical expenses that are not usually covered by a health plan, such as the costs of eyeglasses or contact lenses. HSAs can also be used to pay for cost sharing including deductibles. In addition, in CDHPs or HDHPs, enrollees have the flexibility to use providers in or out of the plan's network, although they may pay more for services when using an out-of-network provider.

", "Another option available to FEHB enrollees who are eligible for Medicare is a Medicare Advantage Plan (sometimes called Part C). Medicare Advantage Plans are private plans that contract with Medicare to provide Part A and Part B coverage. Retirees or former spouses enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B may suspend their FEHB coverage to enroll in a Medicare Advantage Plan (e.g., a Medicare HMO or regional PPO), with the option to reenroll in FEHB during open season. They can reenroll sooner if they involuntarily lose coverage or move out of their Medicare Advantage Plan's service area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordinating Medicare Benefits with FEHB", "paragraphs": ["When a retiree enrolled in Medicare also has coverage under FEHB, Medicare's coordination of benefits policy specifies that Medicare is the primary payer and FEHB is the secondary payer. This means that Medicare pays first and then FEHB pays for care not covered by Medicare (assuming that care is covered under the FEHB policy). As the secondary payer, FEHB may cover an enrollee's Medicare deductibles and coinsurance for care covered by both programs. For retirees (or their spouses) over the age of 65 who do not have either Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B (or both), FEHB is the primary payer. For individuals who have Part A but choose not to take up Part B, FEHB is the primary payer for Part B services but Medicare is the primary payer for Part A services.", "When FEHB is the primary payer, the FEHB plan pays hospitals and physicians based on Medicare rates. The benefit payment for inpatient hospital services is equivalent to what Medicare Part A would have paid for those services; that is, the amount of the Medicare payment (before the Medicare deductible, coinsurance, and lifetime limits are applied) reduced by any FEHB deductible, coinsurance, or co-payment that is the responsibility of the FEHB enrollee or any hospital readmission penalty. Hospitals may not collect, from either the FEHB program or retirees, more than the amount determined to be equivalent to the Medicare payment. The benefit payment for physician services is the lower of the amount that Medicare Part B would have paid for those services or the actual billed charges. The payment is then reduced by any FEHB deductible, coinsurance, or co-payment that is the responsibility of the FEHB enrollee.

Table 1 shows the proportion of those retirees with coverage in Medicare Part A and the proportion who chose to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, by type of plan over time. Although Medicare Part A is an entitlement, enrollment in Medicare Part B is voluntary. The proportion choosing to enroll in Part B varies depending on how eligible individuals receive their benefits, either through a FFS plan or an HMO.", "Of those retirees enrolled in an HMO plan in FY2013, roughly 56% had coverage under both Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. That rate was higher, at about 86%, for retirees receiving benefits through a FFS plan. As shown in Table 1 , the proportion of retirees with coverage under both Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B has declined over time, from about 92% to about 86% in FFS plans and from about 63% to about 56% in HMO plans. In contrast, coverage rates for Part A alone have increased. ", "Various actors have shown interest in encouraging FEHB beneficiaries to enroll in Medicare Part B to reduce FEHB spending. For enrollees who choose not to take up Part B, FEHB pays for services that Medicare otherwise would have paid for because Medicare is the primary payer when a beneficiary is enrolled in both programs. In its annual call letter for the 2016 plan year, OPM encouraged health plans to submit proposals that will allow members to maximize benefits under FEHB and Medicare. OPM noted that some health plans offer cost-sharing reductions for members who enroll in Part B. In addition, there has been congressional interest in encouraging Part B enrollment. Recent legislation to reform the USPS included enrollment in Part B as a condition of obtaining health coverage in retirement for USPS retirees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Impact of the Affordable Care Act", "paragraphs": ["The ACA passed in 2010 and included a number of provisions that established new requirements for all private health plans, including FEHB health plans. For example, the new law allowed all adult children (including those who are married) to enroll in or remain on their parents' plan until the age of 26. However, many ACA provisions had no meaningful effect on FEHB because many FEHB plans already met the requirements established under the law, such as the provision that people with preexisting conditions cannot be denied health coverage.", "In some cases, how an ACA provision could impact FEHB is unknown. For example, it is unclear how many FEHB health plans could be subject to the ACA's excise tax on high-cost health plans, often referred to as the Cadillac tax , which goes into effect in 2020. In addition, the employer mandate could result in penalties to FEHB, starting in 2015, if any full-time federal worker obtains a subsidy for health insurance on the exchange. The employer requirements and penalty will be phased in\u2014the requirement will apply to large firms with 100 or more full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in 2015 and employers with 50 or more FTE employees in 2016.", "OPM has published guidance on implementing ACA provisions, and in some cases it has expanded the scope of those provisions. For example, although most FEHB plans do not impose annual limits on what they will pay for essential health benefits, some plans had established such limits prior to passage of the ACA. Beginning in plan year 2013, OPM directed all FEHB plans to eliminate annual limits on essential health benefits.

The FEHB statute establishes the basic rules for benefits, enrollment, and participation, among other general requirements, while still allowing OPM broad authority to implement regulations, contract with plans, establish benefits, and administer the program. In general, OPM, federal agencies, and the health insurance carriers each have defined roles in FEHB. ", "OPM is authorized to contract with health insurance carriers; approve health plans for participation in the program; negotiate with carriers about benefit and premium levels; determine the times and conditions for open seasons during which eligible individuals may elect coverage or change plans; make information available to employees concerning plan options; apply administrative sanctions to health care providers that have committed certain violations; and administer the program's financing. OPM is responsible for maintaining the funds that hold contingency reserves for the plans and the fund that receives premium payments from enrollees and federal agencies, from which premiums are disbursed to participating plans. ", "OPM supervises all health insurance activities for retirees. It determines whether retiring employees or survivor retirees meet the requirements to continue health insurance coverage; takes the action necessary to terminate, accept, or continue enrollment; oversees the automatic deduction of premiums from monthly annuity checks and credits the premiums, along with the applicable government contribution, to the proper account; processes all enrollment changes; notifies affected carriers of enrollment changes; and keeps enrolled retirees advised of rate and benefit changes within their plan.

Each spring, that annual negotiation process begins when OPM sends all health plans a call letter to advise them on goals and procedures for negotiating contracts for the following calendar year and to request that participating health plans submit their benefit and rate proposals for the next year. The call letter includes any changes in the services OPM seeks to make available for federal workers and retirees, as well as notification of services that OPM discourages. ", "Next, OPM reviews proposals for rates (premiums) for the fee-for-service (FFS) plans in relation to many factors, including the cost of covered services, managed care initiatives, a plan's past experience, health care utilization patterns of the enrolled group, and health care cost inflation in general. Pursuant to the negotiations, OPM and the plans (including both FFS plans and health maintenance organizations, or HMOs) agree to specific terms and conditions that each party is obligated to meet in the next contract year. Descriptions of both covered and excluded services are incorporated into the final contracts, and the plans print brochures describing the benefits and costs according to a standard format specified by OPM. The brochures are binding statements of benefits and exclusions that plans must follow as parties to FEHB contracts. OPM then announces an open season (which generally runs for one month, beginning in early November).", "OPM prints and distributes to personnel offices and retirees a guide describing the major features and premiums for all participating plans.

For FFS or preferred provider organization plans, the sample includes federal members only. The CAHPS survey consists of a set of standardized health plan performance measures that evaluate members' satisfaction with their health plans. Independent vendors certified by the National Committee for Quality Assurance administer the surveys. OPM sets CAHPS requirements for the plans each year, which include instructions to send OPM a copy of any survey results.
