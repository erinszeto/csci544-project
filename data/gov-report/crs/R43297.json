Working together with CBP, the CPSC attempts to identify shipments that are likely to contain consumer products which violate import provisions that the agency enforces. The CPSC also determines whether to admit certain consumer products offered for import into U.S. customs territory. Importers of products manufactured outside of the United States must certify that finished products comply with all rules, bans, standards, or regulations applicable to the product under any act enforced by the CPSC.", "The export of consumer products from the United States to foreign countries may also be subject to regulation by the CPSC.

These obligations are found in several international agreements to which the United States is party, including the multilateral World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement), as well as bilateral and regional U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs). Among other things, the TBT Agreement establishes rules pertaining to the promulgation of technical regulations by central government bodies like the CPSC, including rules concerning nondiscrimination, transparency, and reliance on international standards as a basis for regulations. U.S. FTAs also contain additional obligations for certain parties with regard to transparency.

The CPSC may also prohibit the export for sale of certain consumer products from the United States to foreign countries. In addition, the CSPC is responsible for promulgating and enforcing certain mandatory product safety rules, bans, and standards. The CPSC relies on voluntary standards issued by other bodies \"whenever compliance with such voluntary standards would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standards.\" However, in some circumstances, the CPSC promulgates its own regulations or Congress enacts a standard.

For example, it tasked the CPSC with developing a plan for sharing information with CBP in order to identify shipments of violative consumer products. In April 2010, the CPSC and CBP signed a memorandum of understanding in which the CBP agreed to allow the CPSC to use shipment data in its Automated Commercial System to evaluate imports for safety risks. In October 2010, the CPSC signed a memorandum of understanding with CBP and several other federal agencies in which the parties agreed to share information about the safety of products imported into the United States through an interagency Import Safety Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center.

Higher costs could lead these manufacturers to raise the prices of their products.

Thus, the registration requirement could potentially be a requirement affecting the products' internal sale or purchase that is covered by Article III:4. ", "With respect to (2), it is unclear whether the registration requirement results in less favorable treatment for imported products as compared to like domestic products. On the one hand, as indicated above, the requirement could lead to higher prices for imported products on the internal market, subjecting them to less favorable treatment by denying them \"effective equality of competitive opportunities.\" On the other hand, the fact that like domestic and imported products are treated differently does not automatically mean that imported products are treated less favorably. It could be argued that H.R. 1910 merely \"levels the playing field\" for domestic products by making the foreign manufacturers of imported products subject to legal liability just as domestic manufacturers are.

On the other hand, H.R. 1910 could be characterized as simply \"leveling the playing field\" for domestic products and not as treating imported products any less favorably.", "If H.R. 1910 is adopted and later found to violate the requirements of the GATT, the United States could potentially justify the registration requirement under the exceptions provided at Article XX(b) and (d) of the GATT. Both of these exceptions may require the complaining Member to identify possible alternative measures available to the defending Member that would be consistent\u2014or at least less inconsistent\u2014with the GATT. If a measure is provisionally justified under Article XX(b) or (d), it must also satisfy the Article XX chapeau."], "subsections": []}]}}
