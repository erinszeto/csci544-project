One part of the risk management strategy is to conduct screening at multiple points in the immigration process, beginning well before travelers arrive at U.S. POEs.

Low-risk travelers may be eligible for expedited admissions processing, while higher-risk travelers are usually subject to more extensive secondary inspections.", "As part of its dual mission and in support of its broader mandate to manage the U.S. immigration system, DHS also is responsible for implementing an electronic entry-exit system at POEs. Congress required DHS' predecessor to develop an entry-exit system beginning in 1996, but the implementation of a fully automated, biometric system has proven to be an elusive goal. The current system collects and stores biographic entry data (e.g., name, date of birth, travel history) from almost all non-citizens entering the United States, but only collects biometric data (e.g., fingerprints and digital photographs) from non-citizens entering at air or seaports, and from a subset of land travelers that excludes most Mexican and Canadian visitors. With respect to exit data, the current system relies on information sharing agreements with air and sea carriers and with Canada to collect biographic data from air and sea travelers and from certain non-citizens exiting through northern border land ports; but the system does not collect data from persons exiting by southern border land ports and does not collect any biometric exit data. Questions also have been raised about DHS' ability to use existing entry-exit data to identify and apprehend visa overstayers.", "The inspections process and entry-exit system continue to be perennial issues for Congress and a number of questions persist.

These policy goals are inherently in tension, as efforts to identify and interdict illegal entrants inevitably challenges, and may delay, the smooth flow of legitimate travelers.", "The Supreme Court has long held that Congress has absolute authority to control immigration by establishing rules for the admission, exclusion, and deportation of non-citizens. Some of the first federal laws, the so-called Aliens and Seditions Acts of 1798, authorized the President to arrest and/or deport any alien who represented a danger to the United States. And while Congress during most of the 19 th century generally favored open admissions to the sparsely populated country, a series of laws beginning in 1875 excluded several classes of aliens, including criminals and prostitutes, aliens from certain countries and regions, anarchists, communists, and aliens engaged in espionage, among others.", "Thus, while the specific issues in U.S. immigration law have evolved over time, a core policy goal has always been to prevent the entry of aliens who threaten U.S. interests . For the last several decades, these threats, or enforcement priorities, have fallen within three broad categories:", "Unauthorized immigration . Since 1980, the estimated unauthorized population in the United States has increased from about 2.5 million to about 11.7 million people. Between one-third and one-half of these aliens are believed to have entered lawfully through a POE and over-stayed their visas. An unknown proportion of illegal entrants also passed through POEs, either concealed in a vehicle or by using fraudulent documents. One enforcement priority at POEs, therefore, is to prevent these unlawful entries. Transnational crime . CBP officers performing immigration inspections are the primary line of defense against certain illegal flows, including in particular most illegal drug flows other than marijuana. Immigration inspectors also seek to arrest known smugglers and other criminals at POEs. International terrorism . National security concerns have loomed large in immigration policy in the years since the 2001 Al Qaeda attacks against the United States (the 9/11 attacks). All 19 of the 9/11 hijackers entered the United States legally through POEs, and constraining terrorist travel is now recognized as a critical defense against terrorist attacks within the United States. ", "Yet while most people would agree that terrorists, criminals, and immigration violators are appropriate enforcement targets, no consensus exists about how to prioritize these threats because the likelihood of each type of illegal entry is unknown, and because the potential consequences of these threats are subjective and difficult to measure. The likelihood of each of these threats occurring also varies by geography and mode of entry. For example, certain types of illegal migrants may be more likely to travel by bus or car across the southern border, smugglers may favor other distribution routes, and terrorists may be likely to reach the United States by air and/or at northern border POEs. Threat actors also may seek to counter enforcement efforts by adapting their behavior to avoid such patterns.", "Enforcement must be balanced by a second overarching goal: the facilitation of legal flows. With international tourism directly accounting for over $200 billion in 2012 (almost 1% of U.S. gross domestic product), travel facilitation supports the U.S. economy. Smooth processing at POEs also streamlines travel for the tens of millions of U.S citizens returning from international trips each year, and may improve Americans' experiences abroad through reciprocal arrangements. In addition, immigration agents at POEs define visitors' first impressions of America and the U.S. government, and therefore play an important diplomatic role.", "Enforcement and travel facilitation are fundamentally in tension because efforts to identify and interdict unlawful travelers tend to impede the flow of the entire admissions queue, and efforts to expedite the line may increase the risk that an illicit traveler is overlooked. Thus, in addition to questions about how to prioritize diverse threats, Congress and DHS must decide how to balance enforcement and the facilitation of legitimate travel. Is it better to admit one illegal actor, or to delay the admission of 1,000 lawful travelers? How should Congress and DHS weigh the benefits of more robust enforcement against the costs to commerce, privacy and civil liberties, and related concerns? ", "In an effort to reduce border wait times without compromising border security, CBP's response to these questions emphasizes \"risk management.\" In general, risk management refers to a process for assessing the risks associated with potential threats and calibrating the enforcement response to the estimated gravity of the threat. In the case of immigration inspections, risk management involves screening travelers at multiple points in the immigration process to distinguish between low- and high-risk travelers. Low-risk travelers may be eligible for expedited admissions processing through the Visa Waiver Program and/or trusted traveler programs, while higher-risk travelers may be subject to more extensive secondary inspections. Unauthorized migrants at POEs may be subject to expedited removal and other types of immigration enforcement (see \"The Immigration Inspections Process\").

Expedited removal : Pursuant to INA \u00a7235(b), an alien arriving at a POE without documents or with fraudulent documents and who does not indicate a fear of persecution may be subject to \"expedited removal\" (ER). Under this provision, an alien may be formally removed by order of a CBP officer without appearing before an immigration judge and without being eligible for certain forms of relief. Aliens removed by ER are subject to the same penalties as aliens removed under INA \u00a7240. Criminal arrest : CBP may arrest individuals (including U.S. citizens) at land, sea, and air POEs on the basis of an outstanding federal, state, local, or tribal criminal warrant; in response to a suspected violation of federal immigration-related crimes; or in response to a suspected violation of other federal border-related crimes, including smuggling crimes.", " Table 2 describes selected immigration enforcement outcomes at ports of entry for FY2005-FY2013. As Table 2 indicates, there is no clear, sustained trend in three categories of interest: the overall number of aliens denied admission during this period has fluctuated between about 253,000 aliens in FY2005 and about 195,000 aliens in FY2012; the number of aliens issued a notice to appear (i.e., placed in standard removal proceedings) has fluctuated between about 15,000 aliens in FY2005 and about 24,000 aliens in FY2007 and FY2013 (consistently between 6 and 12% of aliens denied admission); and the number of persons arrested on criminal charges or warrants has fluctuated between about 23,000 and 28,000.", " Table 2 also reveals two apparent trends in enforcement outcomes at POEs. First, the number of aliens permitted to withdraw their applications for admission has fallen steadily from about 96,000 in FY2005 to about 52,000 in FY2013. According to CBP, this reduction is explained, at least in part, by a 2008 OFO directive permitting officers to exercise discretion in certain cases where applicants for admission are technically inadmissible due to a minor documentary deficiency, such as a recently expired passport or nonimmigrant visa. In such cases, aliens may be permitted to correct their documentation and reapply for admission at a later date and time without being required to formally withdraw an application for admission.", "Second, the number of aliens placed in expedited removal fell by about one-third between FY2005 and FY2009 (from about 55,000 to about 38,000), and has remained roughly flat since that time. It is not clear whether the initial drop in ER cases reflected a policy change, a change in the demographics of arriving aliens, or a statistical anomaly. Overall, the data in Table 2 do not appear to reflect a significant shift at POEs toward \"high consequence\" enforcement outcomes (i.e., an increase in the proportion of removable aliens facing criminal charges and/or formal removal). This trend stands in contrast to enforcement trends between ports of entry, where the Border Patrol has more systematically implemented CBP's Consequence Delivery System."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Random Compliance Examination (COMPEX) Program", "paragraphs": ["CBP's Random Compliance Examination (COMPEX) program was established by the legacy U.S. Customs Service in 1999 to gather information about the effectiveness of the passenger inspections process, and CBP expanded the program after the creation of DHS to also encompass more general immigration and agricultural inspection activities. The program selects a random sample of vehicles and air passengers who would be cleared for admission to the United States during primary inspection, and subjects the sample to a detailed secondary examination. CBP counts violations detected in the sample of otherwise-cleared travelers to estimate the number of undetected violations. ", "In FY2012, CBP reports that the COMPEX program was operational at 19 commercial airports representing over 80% of traveler volume, and at 105 land POEs representing over 94% of private vehicle volume. The program conducted over 640,000 random secondary inspections, including 184,000 air passengers and 456,000 vehicles at land POEs. Overall, a very small percentage of travelers in the sample were found to have committed a major violation.", "Theoretically, the COMPEX program offers a powerful tool to estimate illegal flows and CBP's effectiveness rate at POEs. Whereas developing accurate and reliable estimates of illegal flows and of the effectiveness of enforcement between POEs is notoriously difficult because of uncertainty about the number of unobserved inflows, detailed secondary inspections on a sample of inflows at POEs should produce an accurate count of violations within this group. And as long as the sample is statistically valid, CBP could use COMPEX results to estimate total illegal inflows and the apprehension rate at POEs.", "On the other hand, COMPEX is limited in some respects as a tool for describing illegal immigration flows. One limitation is that the program covers air passengers and personal vehicles at land POEs, but does not cover sea passengers, pedestrians at land POEs, or most cargo operations. Second, while a CBP officer may order the collection of biometric data as part of a COMPEX secondary inspection, such data is not collected systematically. As a result, while the program likely detects certain types of illegal migration through POEs (i.e., unauthorized immigrants hidden within passenger vehicles), COMPEX is not designed to detect certain other illegal inflows (i.e., unauthorized immigrants hidden within cargo containers or unauthorized immigrants using fraudulent documents or documents belonging to another person\u2014not to mention flows of legal visitors who eventually overstay a nonimmigrant visa). ", "A third limitation is that while COMPEX is designed to produce a statistically valid estimate of the overall number of POE violations, the program is not designed to measure violations within specific subcategories of flows, including the subcategory of illegal migration. In addition, while sampling at land POEs is based on the random assignment of cases through the TECS system, sampling at airports is based on the manual selection of cases by port managers and senior officers, which may introduce sample bias. Reportedly, COMPEX inspections also may be suspended at certain ports and certain times in order to speed processing times. For all of these reasons, it is not possible, based on COMPEX findings, to draw reliable inferences about total illegal inflows through POEs.", "A final concern about COMPEX is that information about the program has not been widely available. CBP considers such information law-enforcement sensitive, and does not publish information about COMPEX results or methodology; Congress has never held a public hearing on the program; and it has never been the subject of an extensive Government Accountability Office (GAO) study.

When passengers arrive whose travel originated in one of the aforementioned countries\u2014including U.S. citizens\u2014they are escorted to a separate area for additional screening. The travelers fill out an extensive questionnaire, and have their temperature taken. Staff from the CDC is present at these airports to assist with the screening. Travelers without febrile illness or symptoms of Ebola will be monitored two times a day by state and local health departments for 21 days from their departure from West Africa. These travelers are also given a kit that contains a tracking log, a pictorial description of Ebola symptoms, a thermometer, and a wallet card with information on whom to contact if they have symptoms that can be presented to a health care provider if necessary.

As discussed elsewhere, two limitations of the current system are that most people entering the United States by land POEs only provide biographic data (i.e., do not provide biometric data), and that DHS may not have a fully reliable system for overstay analysis (see \"Entry-Exit System: Implementation\"). DHS reportedly has made progress with respect to real-time overstay analysis, but did not publish estimated overstay rates that had been expected in 2013. In addition, even when DHS identifies potential visa overstayers in its dataset, the department has limited ability to track down and remove such overstayers.", "Arguably, the biggest questions about the entry-exit system concern the collection of exit data. No exit data are collected from persons leaving through southern border land ports; and data collection at other ports is limited to biographic data, is not always based on machine-readable data, and relies on information sharing with Canada and with air and sea carriers. DHS reportedly believes that the biographic information sharing generally meets its needs for purposes of exit tracking at an acceptable cost, and CBP has indicated, for purposes of immigration screening, that \"[w]hile biometric information is growing in importance, the vast majority of data available for use at the POEs is biographical.\" At the same time, DHS has also argued that strengthening biographic data collection is a necessary precursor to biometric data collection, and views a biographic system as a desirable long-term goal for the entry-exit system. Members of Congress concerned with exit tracking may focus on the following questions:", "Are biographic data adequate for entry-exit tracking, or should biometric exit data collection be viewed as a priority? If biographic data are adequate, would an upgrade to machine-readable biographic data represent an improvement over the status quo? Is information-sharing using data provided by airlines and by Canada an acceptable model for exit data, of should DHS collect exit data directly? If information-sharing is acceptable, can a similar model be implemented on the U.S.-Mexico border , or does the Southern border require a different approach? If information-sharing is not acceptable, what additional infrastructure and personnel are required (and at what cost) for CBP to collect universal exit data?", "The 114 th Congress is considering legislation that would require the completion of the entry-exit system. The Secure Our Borders First Act of 2015 ( H.R. 399 ) would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit an implementation plan to execute a biometric exit data system. The bill would create a six-month pilot program to test the biometric exit system, which would precede the implementation of the roll out of the program. The bill sets forth staggered deadlines for full implementation of the exit system but would require full implementation of the system within five years of enactment.

Visa overstayers enter legally on temporary (nonimmigrant) visas but fail to depart before the visa expires. Unauthorized immigrants enter through ports of entry by using fraudulent documents (including counterfeit or altered documents, and legitimate documents that do not belong to them) or by evading inspection, for example by being hidden inside a vehicle. ", "A potentially important question for Congress, particularly in light of the ongoing debate about immigration reform, is how much unauthorized immigration occurs through POEs ? A 2006 study estimated that 40-50% of unauthorized immigrants in the country at the time were visa overstayers, and this study remains the most recent reliable public estimate. In addition, interviews conducted with current and former unauthorized migrants in 2009 found that one out of four illegal entrants from Mexico had entered illegally through a port, either hidden in a vehicle or using borrowed or fraudulent documents, and that aliens attempting illegal entry through a POE were half as likely to be apprehended as those crossing between the ports.", "DHS has not published an estimate of the total number of visa overstayers in the United States or of the rate of illegal immigration through POEs, though the department reportedly plans to report on visa overstayers, as noted elsewhere. The department reportedly does not have plans to produce an estimate of illegal flows through POEs, and the COMPEX program is not currently designed to produce such an estimate (see \"Random Compliance Examination (COMPEX) Program\"). The program likely could be modified\u2014primarily by increasing sample size\u2014to produce such an estimate if Congress viewed such modifications as a priority, though CBP reportedly does not support such a change. ", "Recent border security bills have targeted a greater share of resources to enforcement between ports of entry than to inspections and enforcement at POEs (see \"Port of Entry Infrastructure and Personnel\"). Some legislation in the 113 th Congress focused on enforcement between the ports. For example, S. 744 would require DHS to develop a strategy to achieve \"effective control\" of Border Patrol sectors between ports of entry, but does not establish goals or metrics for enforcement at the ports. On the other hand, the Border Security Results Act of 2013 ( H.R. 1417 ), as reported by the House Homeland Security Committee, would establish POE enforcement metrics, though it would not authorize new enforcement measures.

For any given volume of incoming travelers, both the flow rate (or \"service level\") and the time spent on inspections are a positive function of the number of CBP officers on duty and the number of active travel lanes. Conversely, according to a 2008 GAO report, infrastructure weaknesses increased the risk that vehicles could enter the United States without inspection; and staffing shortages contributed to morale problems, fatigue, lack of backup support, and safety issues, \"increasing the potential that terrorists, inadmissible travelers, and illicit good could enter the country.\" GAO revisited these concerns in 2011 and reported that DHS was taking steps to address GAO's recommendations regarding staffing and infrastructure, but that CBP faced challenges in developing POE performance metrics. CBP's Workload staffing model identifies a need for 3,811 additional CBP officers at POEs in FY2014, and the Administration's FY2014 budget proposal included a request for 3,477 additional officers.", "To some extent, the Office of Field Operations (OFO) competes for resources with CBP's Border Patrol and with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Border Patrol has grown about three times faster than OFO in the post-9/11 period. Similarly, S. 744 , would direct CBP to more than double the number of Border Patrol agents on the southwest border, while only authorizing a 16% increase in OFO officers. Other bills in the 113 th Congress would augment POE staffing, however.", "Recent fiscal pressures have been a barrier to POE personnel increases. As mentioned, during the FY2014 budget process, the Administration proposed to hire 3,477 additional CBP officers (about half through increased appropriations and half through fee increases), but Congress approved a slower personnel growth, with half the proposed funding. Congress also authorized a pilot program in the FY2013 appropriations bill that permitted CBP to enter into public-private partnerships (PPPs) with certain localities and permitted the private sector to fund improvements in border facilities and port services, including by funding additional CBP officers and underwriting overtime hours. In its FY2014 budget, the Administration proposed expanding the pilot program by permitting CBP to accept donations to expand port operations. Approving the Administration's request, Congress extended the pilot program in the FY2014 DHS appropriations bill. The current pilot program permits CBP to accept donations to expand port operations, among other things.

Trusted traveler programs are designed to facilitate legal flows by allowing low-risk, known travelers to be exempted from certain screening and inspections and also to enhance security by allowing CBP officers to focus greater attention on higher-risk flows. The benefits of trusted traveler programs should increase with scale because moving more travelers into expedited lanes speeds overall processing times, and fewer unknown travelers mitigates the \"needle in the haystack\" challenge of enforcement at POEs. Thus, legislation in the 113 th Congress would promote membership in trusted trade programs.", "Congress and CBP confront certain obstacles to expanding trusted traveler programs, however. One of the main incentives CBP can offer trusted travelers is to reduce the likelihood of secondary inspections; but doing so may encourage mala fide actors to enroll in these programs to game the system. In addition, at land POEs, travelers only benefit from an expedited inspections process if they are also able to take advantage of dedicated NEXUS or SENTRI lanes (i.e., so that the entire queue is subject to expedited processing). But CBP has limited capacity to add and extend dedicated lanes because many ports are located in urban areas with limited space for expansion, though the agency has addressed this problem, to some extent, by using \"active lane management\" systems that adjust lane assignments based on real-time demand.
