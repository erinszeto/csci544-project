In 1987, Congress moved from a program of federal grants for municipal pollution abatement facilities to a state revolving loan fund (SRF) arrangement in which states would be expected to contribute an amount equal to at least 20% of SRF capitalization funding. The SRFs were expected to remain as a continuing and stable source of funds for construction of treatment facilities. And, Congress specified that certain administrative and policy requirements (including Davis-Bacon) were to be annexed from the core statute and would apply to treatment works \"constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995\" with SRF assistance. By October 1994, under the 1987 amendments, it was expected that federal appropriations for SRFs would end.", "After 1987, Congress variously reconsidered the CWA and the SRF program but made no further authorizations. It did, however, contrary to expectation when the 1987 legislation was adopted, continue to appropriate funds for SRF pollution abatement projects. Thus, a conflict arose. Did the administrative and policy requirements associated with federal funding (inter alia, the prevailing wage requirement) continue to apply? If so (or if not), upon what legal foundation? In 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that prevailing wage rates (Davis-Bacon) would no longer be required on SRF projects. The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), AFL-CIO, protested.", "What happened after 1994 is not entirely clear: that is, whether prevailing rates were actually paid. In the spring of 2000, EPA reversed its position and came to conclude that Davis-Bacon did indeed apply. Following notice in the Federal Register (and review of submissions from interested parties), EPA entered into a \"settlement agreement\" with the BCTD. It would enforce DBA rates on CWA projects effective July 1, 2001. But then EPA moved the effective date back, to late summer\u2014and, then, to October. Thereafter, it seems, EPA was silent.", "During recent years, Congress has increasingly considered funding mechanisms other than direct appropriations for public construction: e.g., joint federal and state revolving funds, loan guarantees, tax credits, etc. This report is a case study of the application of DBA requirements to one such mechanism, the CWA/SRFs.

The SRFs were to be jointly funded by the federal government and the states with loans to be made (and repaid) in cyclical fashion. The legislation included a provision mandating that construction work performed with SRF assistance would be covered by the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act (DBA): a 1931 statute requiring payment of not less than the locally prevailing wage on certain federal (and, later, federally assisted) construction work.", "By the mid-1990s, this system was expected to have changed. Once the SRFs were in place, federal funding for these waste water treatment facilities would pass through the SRFs on a revolving basis. It was assumed that by the mid-1990s, the transition would be complete and that no further federal appropriations would be needed. However, a federal presence would continue through the SRFs as funds were recycled through loans and repayment.", "In practice, matters evolved somewhat differently. Although no additional authorizing legislation was adopted after 1987, Clean Water Act appropriations, contrary to stated expectations , continued. Given continuing federal funding, some have argued, federal requirements governing administration of the program (including labor standards) should remain in place. Others have sought to set aside the various federal requirements, including the CWA Davis-Bacon provision.", "Debate over Davis-Bacon coverage under the CWA/SRF program is ongoing, and has been the subject of several policy shifts on the part of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). First. In 1995, EPA ruled that Davis-Bacon no longer applied to CWA/SRF projects. Second. In the spring of 2000, EPA reversed itself and, entering into a settlement agreement with the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, affirmed that the act would be applied to such projects effective July 1, 2001. Third. EPA then set back the effective date for Davis-Bacon coverage to the fall of 2001, perhaps reversing itself once more. Thereafter, EPA seems to have remained silent on the issue.", "This report deals neither with environmental/water quality issues nor with the Davis-Bacon Act, per se, but, rather, with the intersection of two statutes and the regulatory complexities that have resulted. It suggests the evolution of the Davis-Bacon provision of the Clean Water Act and traces the conflict (1994-2008) as to whether DBA wage standards should/do still apply to CWA/SRF projects. Finally, it poses questions of policy: How did the dispute develop, how has it been resolved (if, indeed, it has been), and how might similar conflicts be avoided?

Gradually, on an ad hoc basis, the pollution abatement program became more ambitious with federal aid to states and local governments. In 1972, the various initiatives and requirements were drawn together in a more coherent manner. Other amendments followed. In 1987, the most recent amendments, Congress made changes both with respect to policy and funding.", "The Davis-Bacon Act (1931) had a two-fold thrust: to promote stability within the construction industry and to protect construction workers from a downward spiral in wages and working conditions. In 1935, Congress broadly restructured the Davis-Bacon Act, reducing the coverage threshold from $5,000 to $2,000 and extending the scope of the act to \"construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and decorating, of public buildings or public works\" to which \"the United States or the District of Columbia is a party.\" Gradually (and with increasing frequency after the mid-1950s), Davis-Bacon provisions were added to statutes in which the work was made possible through federal grants, loans, and other financial arrangements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Linking Davis-Bacon to the Clean Water Act", "paragraphs": ["Conflict developed early on between federal and state responsibilities.

When Congress, instead, nearly doubled the size of the program, the President vetoed the legislation and his veto was sustained.

Representative John Blatnik (D-MN), chair of the Subcommittee on Rivers and Harbors, stated that this was not an unusual practice since similar provisions already applied \"to contracts for school, hospital, housing and airport projects constructed with Federal-aid funds.\" The municipal wastewater pollution abatement program, it was explained, would be a partnership between the federal government and state or local entities. Davis-Bacon coverage does not appear to have been contentious. Representative James Wright (D-TX) observed: \"If we were to oppose the payment of prevailing standard wages, then would this not mean that we favored the payment of substandard wages? Surely,\" he added, \"the Congress does not wish to take that position.\" Though other aspects of the legislation were subject to extended debate, no one seemed seriously to dispute the requirement for DBA coverage.", "Senate consideration of the 1961 legislation appears to have been no more controversial where Davis-Bacon coverage was concerned. The concept was endorsed by Labor Secretary Arthur Goldberg and by organized labor. Although it was opposed by the Chamber of Commerce, the provision seemed uncontentious, as debate shifted largely to technical and fiscal aspects of pollution control.", "With the House and Senate in agreement, Davis-Bacon was not an issue in the conference report. Congress appeared to accept the premise that federal funding for pollution abatement projects, even when made available through assistance to states and local entities on a matching basis, should include, as a corollary, Davis-Bacon coverage. (See P.L. 87-88.)", "Through the next few years, Congress variously modified the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA). Though Davis-Bacon had high visibility during the 1960s, it does not appear to have been an issue in the context of pollution abatement legislation. FWPCA amendments in 1965 retained the DBA requirement and added \"anti-kickback\" provisions. During Senate hearings on the program in 1971, Davis-Bacon was mentioned only in passing; and when, the following year, Congress restructured the act with passage of P.L. 92-500, the Davis-Bacon and \"anti-kickback\" provisions remained in place. Notwithstanding authorization of substantial expenditures for construction of state and local wastewater treatment facilities under the 1972 legislation, stable and adequate funding would continue to be an issue through the next decade.

However, questions arose concerning management of such a program: how much (or how little) local control ought to be allowed. Ravan suggested a gradual phasing out of existing requirements. He opined that \" the first use of the money out of the revolving fund might very well carry with it the requirements\" of the existing program. (Italics added.) He continued, \"I believe there also must come a day, hopefully, as quickly as possible, when the States would be given absolute flexibility for utilization of these funds....\" Robert Perry of the Water Pollution Control Federation was more expansive. \"Treat moneys that have been used and then paid back to a fund as State revenues,\" he urged. \"Remove the requirement that they be treated as Federal funds ad infinitum.\"", "Different versions of the CWA amendments were passed by the House and Senate during the summer of 1985, but in neither body did labor standards appear to be an issue. For nearly a year, the legislation laid dormant until, during the spring of 1986, conferees met and began what became a protracted process of negotiation. The thrust of the pending proposals ( S. 1128 , H.R. 8 ) seemed clear: that is, that at some point in the near future, federal appropriations (and authorizations) would cease and construction of treatment facilities would rest on the SRFs.", "The conference report, filed in October 1986, included (as part of the legislation) a 10-paragraph section titled \"SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS\" that laid out the continuing administrative practices that would apply to \"treatment works ... which will be constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995 with funds directly made available by capitalization grants.\" Among those requirements, it was specified that Section 513 of the CWA (the Davis-Bacon provision) would continue to be applied \"in the same manner as [it had been applied to] treatment works constructed with assistance under title II\"\u2014namely, the former direct federal grants program. The House approved the report (408 yeas to 0 nays), as did the Senate (yeas 96 to 0). There appears to have been no other discussion of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage language.

What requirements, if any, would remain in place?", "In fact, the federal phase-out would not be total for the SRFs rested upon federal \"seed money.\" Had there been no federal funding (no seed money), there would have been no state revolving funds. But, there were ambiguities. Representative Arlan Stangeland (R-MN), for example, observed:", "Federal moneys made available for these funds would be subject to certain restrictions on their use, as are moneys provided through the Construction Grant Program. As these moneys are repaid into the fund, the restriction on how the funds can be used would be eliminated, thereby allowing the States greater flexibility and freedom....", "Mr. Stangeland did not specify the \"restrictions\" he had in mind. Was this flexibility with respect to the types of projects and the priorities to be assigned? Or, did it imply that the states would be free to utilize the SRFs without restraint? It was clear that the SRFs would serve federally specified purposes and in a federally specified manner. Congress quickly approved the legislation.", "In late January 1987, consistent in his opposition, President Reagan vetoed the measure. While endorsing pollution abatement, he focused upon \"the Federal deficit\u2014and the pork-barrel and spending boondoggles that increase it.\" Local sewage treatment facilities, he affirmed, were \"historically and properly ... the responsibility of State and local governments.\" He raised no objection to Davis-Bacon, per se.", "On February 3 and 4, 1987, the House and Senate voted to override the President's veto.

The statute did not say that Davis-Bacon coverage would cease after 1995 (when authorization would have terminated) nor did it specify that Section 513 (Davis-Bacon) and the other enumerated requirements would not apply to recycled (repaid) funds. It carried the program up to FY1995 and then was silent, making no reference to the first use concept where the Davis-Bacon Act was concerned.", "The issue of continuing DBA coverage for the SRF program appears to have sparked concern neither during the closing days of the 99 th Congress nor early in the 100 th Congress. But, there may have been continuing ambiguities.", "The legislation projected a direct federal role in the SRFs (continuing appropriations) until FY1995.

The entire project could be grandfathered-in and wholly subject to Davis-Bacon; or, once 1994 had been reached, coverage could cease. Or coverage might be associated with each contract or sub-contract, depending upon the date on which a contract was entered into or on which the work commenced. Could a worksite be fragmented, part covered and part exempt?", "How were the various agencies to distinguish between covered and non-covered funding? Construction grants under Title II had always required DBA coverage; but with federal funds now going first to SRFs (capitalization grants) and then being loaned out to local entities, would DBA still apply in the absence of a specific policy from the Congress.

But, by that point, a number of things had changed. Concern with wetlands and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and non-point source pollution had become the key issues, especially the former. The Reagan Administration had given way to the Bush Administration and EPA Administrator William Reilly now acknowledged a municipal pollution abatement need \"into the indefinite future.\" He stated that the costs of abatement were rising and that the states and municipalities \"are very often not in a position to meet the many federal requirements we are imposing.\" These problems may have overshadowed concern about prevailing wage standards except, perhaps, from the standpoint of keeping costs down.", "Though specific proposals were avoided for the moment, it became increasingly clear that the federal government would not be able to make a clean break from federal funding and to independent and self-sustaining SRFs. Interest groups, associated with pollution abatement, began to call for more federal funding. Such calls for federal dollars were accompanied with appeals for enhanced flexibility: fewer strings, less federal control. States, it was argued, \"should be allowed to maintain the flexibility to establish priorities ... and to deploy available funds for the most pressing problem on a timely basis.\" Continued capitalization by the federal government \"through FY1994 and beyond ,\" it was asserted, \"is essential.\" Appeals for \"increased Federal funding\" were coupled with pleas for relief from the \"administrative burdens and regulatory roadblocks\" of the l987 legislation, including the Section 602(b)(6) specific requirements .", "In early 1992, Senator Chafee reminded his colleagues that \"[u]nder current law, there is to be no Federal role, no additional Federal dollars, after 1994.\" \"That date is now in sight,\" he pointed out, and \"... it is time to reconsider that decision.

The Baucus/Chafee bill would not have terminated the federal role in construction of treatment plants. Rather, it would have created a series of new categorical grant programs to be placed under the SRF umbrella.

The success of this program derives from the flexibility of the SRF model....\"", "With a view to prospective legislation of the 110 th Congress, Ward affirmed that there are \"a number of specific program changes that we would want to see included in CWSRF reauthorization....\"", "Jim Stutler, representing the National Utility Contractors Association (NUCA), noted that there \"are several policy issues that will no doubt be debated during the legislative process\" but urged the committee \"to focus on the big picture.\" Stutler continued: \"...the impasse over prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act has stymied this legislation for too long.\" He continued: \"...NUCA represents both union and non-union contractors\" and \"Davis-Bacon is not an issue of contention for our members.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A New Bill Introduced (H.R. 720)", "paragraphs": ["On January 30, Representative James Oberstar (D-MN) introduced H.R. 720 , the \"Water Quality Financing Act of 2007.\" The bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, marked-up and promptly forwarded to the full Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Subcommittee and Committee Action", "paragraphs": ["In the subcommittee (January 31, 2007), Davis-Bacon again became an issue.

However, a new provision was added: Section 602(b)(17) . The committee report explained:", "\"New Section 602(b)(17) requires the application of the Davis-Bacon requirements for the construction of treatment works carried out in whole or in part with assistance made available from state revolving loan funds under Title VI, funds from section 205(m) of the Act, or both. This amendment authorizes the application of the prevailing wage requirements to construction projects carried out with any financial assistance from the state revolving fund, whether the source of assistance originates from Federal capitalization grant funds, state matching funds, repayments to the fund, interest payments, or other sources of income to the state revolving fund, and whether the character of the assistance is through loans, loan guarantees, or other types of assistance authorized by section 603(d).\"", "The report continued. \"By establishing the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirement for the construction of treatment works, the Committee continues its long-standing practice of ensuring the application of Davis-Bacon where Federal funds are provided for construction....\" It added: \"For the Clean Water SRFs, the most significant source of revenue in the state revolving funds is the Federal capitalization grant. As Congress has done in 63 separate instances for Federally-funded construction, the Davis-Bacon Act should apply to the reauthorization of the Clean Water SRFs.\"", "The committee went on to discuss the varied rationale for support of the Davis-Bacon Act: to \"attract more experienced and better trained workers,\" workers who \"are often more productive than workers with less training and experience,\" that Davis-Bacon work results often \"in the completion of construction projects ahead of schedule,\" \"reducing the overall cost of the project,\" and \"offsetting any increased costs due to higher hourly wage rates.\"", "Conversely, Representative John Mica (R-FL), together with several others, suggested a strong opposition. Mr. Mica stated that the bill \"represents an important step forward for clean water\" but \"it also takes a significant step backwards by mandating and expanding upon the past application of Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements in the SRF program.\" Davis-Bacon, he stated, would add \"to the cost of public construction\" and have a disproportionate impact on \"small, rural, and disadvantaged communities, which can least afford to pay the higher cost of projects.\" He stated that the act was \"discriminatory\" in that \"[f]ew small and minority-owned firms can afford to pay the higher wages that the Davis-Bacon Act requires.

Thus, she suggested that the Member from Texas \"instead reverts to attacking a portion of this legislation that is vital to workers across America, the Davis-Bacon Provisions.\" Castor noted that \"it has become all too familiar from the other side of the aisle to attack workers across America.\" She then affirmed that", "\"[i]t is our policy, in fact, it is Congress's long-standing continuing tradition of applying prevailing wage requirements to federally funded construction projects. Studies have shown that by attracting more experienced, better-trained workers, that wage requirements lead to higher productivity and they reduce overall costs, which offset any higher wages.\"", "Castor argued that Davis-Bacon \"protects communities by ensuring that wage determination\" is based \"solely on the local workforce costs\"\u2014the locally prevailing wage rate. Further, she argued, with Davis-Bacon in place, oftentimes \"projects come in under budget and on time.\"", "Throughout floor consideration of H.R. 720 , Davis-Bacon was of continuing interest with Members, some taking strong positions either for or against the statute. As discussion moved on to amendments, Representatives Baker and Steve King (R-IA) proposed an amendment. King explained: \"... really all this amendment does is it just stops the expansion of the Davis-Bacon, and it says we are not going to move this Davis-Bacon into a revolving fund.\" Baker added with respect to Davis-Bacon: \"It will make the compliance of the rules for rural and lower income communities much more difficult to achieve. Compliance with the Davis-Bacon provisions,\" he stated, \"is a difficult and cumbersome task.\" Speaking against the Baker/King amendment was the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. Oberstar, who noted the difference between a union wage and a prevailing wage. \"This Davis-Bacon provision is [a] prevailing [wage], not [a] union wage.\" Oberstar added: \"It is the prevailing local wage.\"", "On a roll-call vote, the Baker/King amendment was defeated: 140 ayes to 280 noes.
