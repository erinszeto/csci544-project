Additionally, the new House Rules placed more restrictions and requirements on the acceptance from outside private sources of travel expenses for \"officially connected\" travel by Members and staff. Such restrictions are designed specifically to further limit the participation and involvement of lobbyists, foreign agents, or their clients in such travel events, and to provide for more transparency and disclosures of any such travel. With the passage of the \"Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007\" ( P.L. 110-81 , September 14, 2007), further ethics provisions applicable to House Members and staff were adopted."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The House of Representatives amended its internal Rules on January 4, 2007, with the adoption of H.Res. 6 , to apply greater restrictions, more transparency, and further regulation concerning the acceptance by Members and staff of \"gifts\" from outside, private sources, including specifically \"gifts\" of travel-expense reimbursements or payments provided by lobbyists, foreign agents, or their clients. Additional changes to internal House Rules on \"ethics\" were made by the \"Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007,\" P.L. 110-81 , September 14, 2007 ( S. 1 , 110 th Congress).", "Under the new House Rules, in a similar manner as under the former Rules, no gifts from outside, private sources may be accepted by Members and staff unless expressly permitted by one of the provisions of the House Rules. Thus, gifts from all outside, private sources continue to be restricted and limited, with several important exceptions. Gifts with a value of under $50 may still be accepted, other than from lobbyists, foreign agents and their clients; and gifts from relatives and personal friends may continue to be accepted and exchanged. In addition, the 23 specific exceptions to the gift prohibition listed in the House Rules continue to be in force. The exception for reasonable and necessary expenses for some \"officially connected\" travel is also still provided, and Members and staff may continue to accept such travel expenses from many private sources, other than lobbyists, foreign agents, and certain of their clients, but with several additional restrictions, including more detailed disclosure of such travel.

Under the former Rules, this exemption had allowed Members and staff to receive a gift, such as a meal, a bottle of liquor or wine, or a ticket for entertainment, that did not exceed $49.99, even if such gift was from a lobbyist. Under the new House Rules, however, the under-$50 exception for gifts no longer applies if the gift is from a \"registered lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal or from a private entity that retains or employs registered lobbyists or agents....\" Members and staff may thus no longer accept most free meals paid for by lobbyists, foreign agents, or their clients (under this $50 de minimis exception), and may no longer accept tickets to sporting or entertainment events provided by lobbyists, foreign agents, or their clients, unless they pay full face value for the ticket."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gifts of Tickets and Passes: Valuation", "paragraphs": ["When Members and staff are allowed to accept gifts of tickets and passes to sporting or entertainment events under the $50 exception, or when they reimburse for the full value of the ticket, the \"value\" of the ticket or pass will now be determined by the actual \"face value\" printed on the ticket.

The extent of travel allowed was for four days for domestic travel, and seven days for international travel (excluding travel days), and certain disclosures of the travel and expenses were required to be made within 30 days of the end of the trip.

In addition, the convenience and ease for a Member of Congress to take such a flight, and the special \"access\" to Members such flights provided for corporate officials and lobbyists, regardless of the amount of reimbursement from official or personal funds for the flights, concerned reformers worried about the normal gratitude that such special favors for Members might engender and the potential resulting undue influence on the Member's judgment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Rule", "paragraphs": ["Under the new House Rules, Rule XXIII, cl. 15, Members and staff are now prohibited from using any funds, whether personal funds, campaign funds, or official funds, to pay for or reimburse the expenses of traveling on a private or corporate aircraft.

It appears that under existing exceptions to the gift rule, however, Members and staff can still fly on a private, corporate aircraft when the Member or staffer is to be involved in a permissible outside, business endeavor, or in employment discussions with a prospective private employer which owns the aircraft, when the private company or prospective employer normally would make such aircraft available to one involved in the business endeavor, or to one being interviewed or otherwise seeking employment. Similarly, if an aircraft is owned by an individual who provides a flight on the \"basis of personal friendship\" to a Member or staffer, then a flight can be accepted under such exception (with approval from the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct when the value of the flight would be in excess of $250).
