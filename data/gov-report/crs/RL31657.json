These bills have always been strongly supported by advocates for the mentally ill and have had broad, bipartisan support in Congress. Although employers and health insurance groups opposed the legislation in the past because of concern that it would drive up costs, the provisions in S. 558 now have their support. Expanded parity legislation was introduced in the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses, but each time it failed to pass.", "Private health insurers often provide less coverage for mental illnesses than for other medical conditions. Historically, health plans have imposed lower annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage, limited treatment of mental health illnesses by covering fewer hospital days and outpatient office visits, and increased cost sharing for mental health care by raising deductibles and copayments. The lack of parity (i.e., equivalence) in part reflects insurers' concerns that mental disorders are difficult to diagnose, and that mental health care is expensive and often ineffective. However, the 1999 Surgeon General's report on mental health concluded that mental illnesses are largely biologically based disorders, like many other medical conditions. It found that effective treatments exist for most mental disorders.", "Differences in insurance coverage of mental illnesses and other medical conditions are also the result of economic factors. Studies indicate that demand response of mental health patients to reduced cost sharing is approximately twice as large as that observed in general medical care. Partly as a consequence, insurers impose higher cost sharing for mental health. Insurers have also restricted mental health coverage to protect themselves against adverse selection (i.e., the tendency for plans with generous mental health coverage to attract patients with mental illnesses that are costly to treat). Health plans frequently subcontract management of the mental health component of their benefits to specialized managed behavioral health care organizations (MBHOs). Recent studies have shown that there is no significant increase in mental health costs to the insurer when parity is implemented in the context of managed care. Despite this finding, introduction of managed behavioral health care, and passage of state parity laws, mental health coverage continues to be subject to more limitations and higher cost sharing than coverage of other illnesses. Some analysts argue that parity alone is not sufficient to guarantee equal access to quality care and equal financial protection for people with mental disorders.", "Twenty-eight states have laws that mandate full-parity mental health coverage, though these laws do not apply to self-insured group plans. In 1996, Congress enacted the Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA), which is more limited in scope and does not compel insurers to provide full-parity coverage. For group plans that choose to offer mental health benefits, the MHPA requires parity only for annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage. Group plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing requirements on their mental health coverage.

The President identified unfair treatment limitations placed on mental health benefits as a major barrier to mental health care. Historically, private health insurers have provided less coverage of mental illnesses compared to other medical conditions. For example, health plans have imposed lower annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage, limited treatment of mental health illnesses by covering fewer hospital days and outpatient office visits, and increased cost sharing for mental health care services. Under full parity, a plan must use the same treatment limitations and financial requirements in its mental health coverage as it does in its medical and surgical coverage.", "The New Freedom Commission endorsed mental health parity in its final report, issued on July 22, 2003. \"The commission strongly supports the President's call for federal legislation to provide full parity between insurance coverage for mental health care and physical health care,\" the report said, in reference to the President's April 2002 address.", "In 1996, Congress enacted the Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA), which established new federal standards for mental health coverage offered by group health plans. However, the MHPA is limited in scope and does not compel health plans to offer full-parity mental health coverage. It requires group health plans that choose to provide mental health benefits to adopt the same annual and lifetime dollar limits on their coverage of mental and physical illnesses. Plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limitations or cost sharing requirements on their mental health coverage. Lawmakers recently reauthorized the MHPA through December 31, 2008.", "Senators Domenici and Wellstone introduced full-parity legislation ( S. 543 ) in the 107 th Congress; the measure saw some action but failed to pass.

An identical House bill ( H.R. 953 ) was introduced by Representatives Kennedy and Ramstad. No legislative action was taken on either bill.

Their efforts to combat discrimination received a boost with the release of the 1999 Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health. The report reviewed the extensive scientific literature on mental health and concluded that mental illnesses were largely biologically based disorders like many other medical conditions. It also found that the efficacy of mental health treatments is well documented, and that effective treatments exist for most mental disorders. Proponents of mental health parity highlight the high costs to society of untreated and undertreated mental illness. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimated that the direct treatment costs of mental illness in 2001 totaled $85 billion. This does not include the economic costs of lost productivity due to illness, lifetime lost productivity, and other indirect costs.", "Employer and health insurance associations oppose parity legislation because of concerns that it will drive up costs. Parity supporters refute those claims, pointing to recent studies that indicate that full parity can be implemented without substantial cost increases within the context of comprehensively managed behavioral health care.", "Twenty-eight states have passed laws mandating full-parity mental health coverage. Except Wyoming, all other states have enacted legislation that requires health plans to provide certain specified mental health benefits, but not necessarily full parity. However, employers who have self-insured plans (i.e., the employers pay physicians and hospitals directly) are not bound by state insurance regulations.", "This report briefly summarizes the economic forces that help explain the persistent limitations on mental health coverage in conventional, fee-for-service (indemnity) health plans. It also discusses issues relating to the feasibility of parity under managed care. In the past decade managed care has transformed the delivery of mental health care services. Employers and health plans now frequently contract out administration of their mental health benefits to specialty managed behavioral health care organizations. The report then reviews state mental health parity legislation and compares the Senate and House versions of the latest full-parity legislation ( S. 558 and H.R. 1424 ) in the 110 th Congress. It concludes with a discussion of some of the key issues in the ongoing congressional debate on mental health parity and discusses why parity may not be enough to provide equivalent financial protection and access to quality care for persons with mental disorders.", " Appendix A provides a side-by-side comparison of the key provisions in the engrossed versions of S. 558 and H.R. 1424 .

In the 1960s, the role of state governments in mental health began to diminish as alternative forms of outpatient and community-based care gradually replaced institutional care. The mental health system over time started to resemble the general health care system, financed by a combination of private and public insurance. However, private insurance coverage for mental health care no longer included some of the nonmedical services provided by state institutions, such as accommodation and employment. In addition, mental health coverage tended to be more restrictive than the coverage for physical illnesses and surgery and include a higher level of cost sharing. The lack of parity in insurance coverage in part reflected insurers' concerns that the costs of mental health care were high and unpredictable. Insurers argued that mental disorders were difficult to define, and that treatments involving long-term, intensive psychotherapy and extended hospital stays were expensive and often ineffective.", "Although stigma has played and continues to play an important role in the mental health care debate, differences in insurance coverage of mental illnesses and other medical conditions are also the result of important economic factors. Studies of indemnity insurance have found that the moral hazard problem is more pronounced for mental health care than it is for general medical care. Moral hazard refers to the tendency for patients to demand more services as the price they pay for those services declines. While health insurance, in general, creates incentives for overuse by insulating patients from the total costs of care, research shows that the demand response to reduced cost sharing in mental health care is approximately twice as large as that observed in general medical care. The result has been for insurers to impose higher cost sharing for mental health care.", "Insurers have also restricted their mental health coverage to protect themselves from adverse selection. Adverse selection refers to the tendency for health plans with generous coverage provisions to attract sick (i.e., high-cost) enrollees. The evidence suggests that adverse selection may be an especially powerful force in mental health care. Studies indicate that individuals with mental illness select health plans that offer more generous mental health coverage. Such behavior can create a strong economic incentive for health plans to reduce their attractiveness to users of mental health care.", "While competition among plans to avoid enrolling high-risk individuals may represent a good strategy for an individual plan, health economists argue that it is wasteful and inefficient for the health insurance system as a whole. Competition among indemnity insurance plans is seen as an important factor in reducing the level of coverage for mental health care. During the 1970s and 1980s, this argument was used to justify federal and state mandated benefit laws that required insurers to cover minimum levels of mental health care (see below). Some health economists claim that parity can improve the efficiency of insurance markets by reducing wasteful forms of competition that are the result of adverse selection. These commenters note that requiring parity for mental health benefits establishes a uniform \"floor\" of mental health coverage across all plans. Supporters of parity maintain that studies show that implementing parity through managed mental health care will not lead to a significant increase in costs to the insurers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Managed Behavioral Health Care", "paragraphs": ["The movement to establish parity for mental health care has been fueled by changes in the scientific understanding of mental illness and the rapid increase in managed behavioral health care (i.e., mental health and substance abuse treatment). Recently revised estimates suggest that about 15% of the adult U.S. population (approximately 30 million individuals) are affected by a clinically significant mental disorder in any given year. Clinicians are often able to diagnose mental illness with precision, and effective treatments now exist for many psychiatric conditions. Some studies show that the effectiveness of treatments for major mental disorders, which typically involve a combination of medication and psychotherapy, often match or exceed the effectiveness of common treatments for physical illness. As noted earlier, proponents of parity argue that untreated and undertreated mental illness has a major impact on the economy and costs employers tens of billions of dollars annually in lost productivity.", "Health plans frequently subcontract, or carve out, to managed behavioral health care organizations (MBHOs) the management of the mental health (and substance abuse) component of their benefits package. Over the past few years, behavioral carve-outs have become central to the delivery and payment of mental health care. Nearly three-quarters of Americans with health insurance are covered by managed health benefits. SAMHSA has published a report that explores the current design and administration of mental health coverage. The report lays out the necessary components of an adequate mental health benefit by examining the evidence-base for particular benefits; effect on access, utilization, and costs; the components of a cost-effective mental health benefit package; and the effects of benefits administration on effectiveness.", "Managed care is changing the way in which mental health services are provided. Whereas conventional fee-for-service insurance controls the demand for services primarily through cost sharing (e.g., deductibles, co-payments) and treatment limitations, MBHOs influence the treatment decisions of mental health care providers through a variety of techniques, including financial incentives, greater emphasis on preventive medicine, development of treatment protocols, and prior authorization of certain services. Cost sharing and coverage limits assume less importance under managed care, which seeks to control moral hazard by internal rationing methods, rather than having to rely on demand-side cost sharing.", "The introduction of managed mental health care can reduce spending and in some cases increase plan usage. For example, Pacific Bell lowered its mental health expenditures by 13% when it implemented managed behavioral health care in the early 1990s. The cost reduction was not attributable to decreased initial access to care. The number of persons using any mental health care actually increased following the change. Instead, the cost reduction was the result of fewer outpatient sessions per patient, a reduced likelihood of inpatient admission, a reduction in the length of stay for those admitted as inpatients, and significantly lower costs per unit of service delivered. Massachusetts saw a 25% decline in behavioral health care costs for state employees as a result of introducing managed care in 1993.", "Studies also suggest that MBHOs are able to control the costs associated with mental health parity. In 1996, estimates of the cost of implementing full parity ranged as high as 11% of the total health care premium, which led Congress to limit parity-level benefits in the MHPA. But those estimates did not adequately reflect the impact of managed care and increased use of psychotropic drugs and short-term psychotherapeutics on controlling costs. More recent studies in states that have enacted full-parity laws for mental health coverage provided by managed care plans found that premium increases have been modest. Magellan Health Services, the nation's largest MBHO covering nearly 70 million individuals, reported that it had yet to see a premium cost increase of more than 1% as a result of implementing state mental health parity legislation.", "At a 2001 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation workshop on the costs of mental health parity, actuaries, economists, and government officials discussed the assumptions and methods used in calculating parity cost estimates. There was broad agreement among the workshop participants that the baseline level of mental health spending has decreased significantly as a result of changes in clinical practice (e.g., use of psychotropic drugs and short-term psychotherapies) and the growth of managed care. Baseline mental health spending is often represented by the share of the total health insurance premium spent on mental health services without parity. Changes in premium costs that result from parity are then expressed as a percentage change in baseline. Workshop participants were also in agreement that managed care has had an important affect on the impact of parity laws. Managed care plans have responded to the expansion of benefits under parity by tightening their internal controls on the use of mental health services so as to dampen any increase in demand and premiums."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Mental Health Parity Laws19", "paragraphs": ["States began to address inequities in mental health coverage in the 1970s. More than a dozen states enacted laws requiring health plans operating within the state to offer a specific set of mental health benefits. While these mandated-benefit laws increased coverage, they had important limitations. They seldom provided catastrophic coverage against the financial risk of severe mental illness and they did not apply to self-insured employers, which are exempt from state regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).", "In 1991, Texas and North Carolina became the first states to enact mental health parity legislation. Both state laws were limited in their scope and applied only to insurers that covered state and local government employees. By 1996, when federal parity legislation was enacted (see below), a total of seven states had passed laws that required certain specified state-regulated health plans to provide full-parity mental health coverage. Since then, more than a dozen other states have passed similar legislation, bringing to 28 the total number of states that now mandate mental health coverage with full parity.", "State laws that mandate full-parity mental health benefits vary in the types of health plans covered and also in the types of mental illnesses they cover. In 15 states, the laws apply both to group health plans and to the individual health insurance market, whereas in another 9 of these states they apply only to group plans. In the remaining four states, the laws apply only to state-employee plans. In 12 of the states with full parity laws, the laws apply to the treatment of all the conditions listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). The other parity laws restrict coverage to specified \"serious\" or \"biologically based\" mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder). About one-third of the state parity laws exempt small employers, typically those with 50 or fewer employees.", "In addition to the 28 states that have enacted full parity legislation, 6 states have passed laws mandating a certain minimum level of mental health benefits (but not full parity). Fourteen other states have passed so-called mandated offering laws, under which covered plans that choose to offer mental health coverage must provide a specified minimum level of benefits. The bills currently introduced in the House and Senate are mandated offering laws. See Appendix B for a summary of state parity laws.", "New Jersey, which in 1999 enacted a full parity law that covers both group plans and the individual market, recently passed legislation that requires individual carriers to offer a policy with minimum mandated mental health benefits. Those benefits include coverage for 90 days of inpatient treatment with a $500 copayment per inpatient stay, and 30 days of outpatient treatment with a 30% coinsurance. The new law does not replace the existing full parity mandate, but is intended to provide individuals with a less expensive alternative to a policy with full-parity coverage. The aim of the law is to allow individuals who might otherwise not be able to afford a policy with full parity to purchase insurance coverage. Texas has also enacted new legislation that allows for the sale of less expensive health insurance policies without state mandates for the treatment of mental illness.

It requires equivalence in only one area: catastrophic coverage.

GAO surveyed 863 employers in 26 states without full parity laws. While 86% of the employers reported compliance with the MHPA, a majority of these plans (87%) restricted their mental health coverage in other ways. For example, about two-thirds of MHPA-compliant plans covered fewer outpatient visits and hospital days for mental health treatment than for other medical treatment. Surveys by the Labor Department and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found similar results.", "Many plans that had to increase annual and lifetime dollar limits to comply with the MHPA reportedly introduced other more restrictive mental health design features to mitigate the financial impact of the law's more generous dollar limits. Despite concerns about the MHPA's effect on claims costs, only 3% of employers surveyed by GAO reported that their costs had increased, and less than 1% of surveyed employers dropped their mental health coverage altogether following the law's enactment. It is difficult to gauge the impact of the MHPA's increased dollar limits, however, because many plans took steps to counter increases in claims costs by restricting mental health coverage in other ways.", "Though limited in its scope, the MHPA nevertheless appears to have added momentum to the passage of state parity laws.

On the other hand, S. 558 's parity provisions apply only to conditions that the health plan chooses to cover. Both bills would extend parity to in-network and out-of-network mental health benefits. Both bills also exempt small employers with 50 or fewer employees. In an effort to address some of the concerns of the health insurance industry, H.R. 1424 includes language permitting employers and health plans to manage mental health benefits and cover only those treatment services that are medically necessary.

The first difference is that the Senate version would allow insurance companies to determine which mental illnesses they cover, whereas the House version would require coverage for all mental illnesses (see discussion below).

But groups representing employers and the health insurance industry strongly oppose the legislation on the grounds that it will add significantly to the dramatically rising costs of health care. They argue that employers cannot afford to spend more money on health insurance coverage for their employees in the current economic climate. They contend that parity costs would likely take the form of increased cost sharing for all covered benefits, reductions in other health care coverage, and/or the elimination of health coverage entirely, which would lead to an increase in the number of uninsured.", "Proponents of parity legislation counter that full parity does not significantly increase costs under managed care. They argue that parity can in fact reduce costs to employers by improving productivity and reducing absenteeism. Furthermore, they claim that full-parity coverage lowers overall health care expenditures by eliminating the need for medical care and emergency room visits that result if mental illnesses are left untreated. Some large employers have reported that parity in mental health benefits has had a net positive financial impact. As an example, they cite Delta Airlines. Delta increased mental health benefits for its 69,000 employees in 1994, when it switched to managed care. Use of mental health services increased but costs remained flat.

They believe that federal parity legislation should cover only serious mental illnesses or illnesses that have been shown to be related to the biological functioning of the brain (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), as do many state laws. S. 558 , which covers only mental illnesses that are specifically included by the health plan, has the support of employers and health insurers. Critics of H.R. 1424 claim that extending coverage to all the mental disorders listed in the DSM-IV opens the door to dubious complaints of less serious problems by the \"worried well.\" They object to providing coverage for many of the conditions that are classified as mental disorders in the DSM-IV (e.g., academic skills disorders, sexual desire disorders) because they are not seen as medically significant.", "Parity supporters view opposition to providing coverage of all DSM-IV disorders as stemming, in part, from stigma and the mistaken belief that mental illness does not have a physiological basis. They claim that restricting mental health coverage to a few specified psychiatric conditions is no different than having medical benefits that cover only serious physical disease such as cancer and heart disease. They argue that covering all the DSM-IV disorders is unlikely to lead to abuse or inflated costs for two reasons. First, H.R. 1424 does not prevent plans from managing mental health benefits through such practices as utilization review, preauthorization, the application of medical necessity and other appropriateness criteria, and through the use of provider networks. Second, the DSM-IV establishes a threshold for diagnosis by requiring evidence of \"clinically significant impairment or distress.\" Any claims for treatment of a patient with a mental health condition that was not serious enough to meet that threshold could be excluded on the basis of medical necessity. Advocates of mental health parity also assert that restricting coverage to a few major mental illnesses is penny-wise and pound-foolish.

A recent analysis of the 2002 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Educational Trust (KFF/HRET) Employer Health Benefits Survey found that overall 98% of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance had coverage for mental health care. However, 74% of those covered workers were subject to an annual outpatient visit limit, and 64% were subject to an annual inpatient day limit. The proportion of covered workers subject to annual mental health day and visit limits appears to have increased over the past few years. In contrast, the survey found only 22% of covered workers had higher cost sharing (i.e., copayment or coinsurance) for mental health benefits. This suggests that health plans are relying less on higher cost sharing as a means of limiting the use of mental health services.", "The 2002 KFF/HRET survey data indicate that about one-third of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance receive their mental health care through carve-outs. Surprisingly, the investigators found relatively little difference in the nominal mental health benefits (i.e., the treatment limitations and cost sharing requirements spelled out in the insurance contract) under carve-outs versus integrated health plans. Carve-outs and integrated plans had similar limitations on the number of inpatient days and outpatient visits. There was also no significant difference in the percentage of covered workers with higher cost sharing for outpatient mental health services in carve-outs compared to integrated plans.", "Given that MBHOs incorporate supply-side utilization controls rather than relying solely on cost sharing and benefit limits to lower demand, one might expect them to expand mental health benefits while maintaining control over costs. But the KFF/HRET survey data indicate that carve-outs continue to impose special limits and substantial cost sharing on mental health. Some researchers hypothesize that a lack of employer education about the cost advantages of behavioral mental health care management, minimal risk sharing under many carve-out contracts, or a single-minded focus on cost containment could explain why mental health benefit limitations persist. Lingering concerns about adverse selection could also play a role in the persistence of benefit limits.", "Overall, the 2002 KFF/HRET survey findings suggest that mental health parity may be difficult to establish without broader (i.e., federal) parity laws. State parity laws have a limited impact because they do not cover self-insured plans. ERISA exempts self-insured plans from state regulation. About 52% of covered workers are in a self-insured plan, according to the KFF/HRET survey."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Protection and Access to Quality Care", "paragraphs": ["Mental health analysts often argue that parity laws are an important step in improving the efficiency and fairness of insurance coverage for mental illness. But many are concerned that parity in nominal benefits for mental health care, by itself, is not sufficient to guarantee equal access to high-quality care and equal levels of financial protection for people with mental disorders. For one thing, many mental health services do not have any counterpart in general medical care and are, therefore, unaffected by parity legislation because they do not have to be included in covered benefits. Private insurance usually does not cover day-hospital care, psychosocial rehabilitation, or residential treatment programs, all of which are seen as effective components of mental health care. Moreover, health plans do not cover supervised housing or employment for patients with chronic mental health conditions. Proponents of parity maintain that taking a broader view of access to quality mental health care means encompassing a variety of social-welfare services.", "Advocates for the mentally ill worry that behavioral health carve-outs may not provide patients with all the appropriate and medically necessary care. While managed behavioral health care has proved effective at controlling the costs of full parity, patient advocates are concerned about management decisions that may result in across-the-board reductions in treatment without regard to clinical circumstances. MBHOs are under pressure to contain costs. The internal management processes that they use to ration treatment are difficult to regulate. Even under federal and state parity laws, MBHOs still retain wide latitude to manage coverage and control access to mental health care in order to achieve cost-control goals. Managed care contacts, with their complex internal rationing devices, are more remote from regulation than the traditional fee-for-service contracts.", "MBHOs maintain that by lowering costs and offering parity-level benefits, patients have greater access to treatment at an earlier point in the development of their illness. This, in turn, they hold, results in less suffering and lower costs associated with that treatment. Moreover, they point to studies that have shown that early, effective treatment of mental illness leads to lower medical costs generally, lower disability costs, and less absenteeism in the workplace. But critics of behavioral carve-outs contend that the managed care tools employed by MBHOs are widening the gap between a plan's nominal benefits and the care actually received by patients. In contrast to using a primary care physician as the gatekeeper to more specialized care, which is a model commonly employed in managed care, MBHOs use a larger range of techniques to manage mental health care (e.g., concurrent utilization review by clinical care managers) and use a different mix of providers and services.", "The American Psychiatric Association and the American Medical Association (AMA) have criticized carve-outs as discriminatory because they separate behavioral health care from \"mainstream\" health care rather than integrating the two, thus reinforcing the notion that behavioral health is somehow different from other medical conditions.", "Results of the 1996-1998 Health Care for Communities (HCC) national survey relate to analysts' concerns about the impact of parity on access to quality mental health care. The HCC survey concluded that state parity laws have had no discernible impact on the overall use of mental health services. The survey suggested that utilization of mental health care was no higher in parity states than in states without such laws. HCC researchers said their survey supports the view that the insurance market has responded to parity laws by increasing the management of care in order to control costs. They analyzed the self-reported unmet needs among respondents seeking treatment for mental health and substance abuse problems. When unmet needs was defined as delays in receiving treatment or receiving less treatment than desired, significantly more respondents in managed care reported unmet needs than those enrolled in indemnity insurance. However, when unmet needs was defined as obtaining no care, those in managed care reported unmet needs less often. According to the HCC researchers, results of the survey reinforce concerns about the impact of parity on access to quality health care.", "A recent study of the implementation of Vermont's 1998 parity law also found that the increased use of managed care, while helping make health care more affordable, may have reduced access and utilization for some services and beneficiaries.

Managed care was an important factor in controlling costs following implementation of parity. Before the parity law took effect, BCBSVT provided MH/SA services mainly through indemnity contracts. After parity, most BCBSVT members received those services through a managed care carve-out and reported a decline both in the likelihood of obtaining mental health treatment and in the average number of outpatient visits. Kaiser/CHP, which had managed care prior to the parity law, increased the use of partial hospitalization treatment and group therapy and reduced the use of inpatient treatment. Overall, MH/SA spending fell by 8-18% after parity was implemented, despite lower consumer out-of-pocket costs and higher limits on the use of MH/SA care.", "Finally, parity helps only people who have health insurance.
