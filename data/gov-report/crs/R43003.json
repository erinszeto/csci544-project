The impasse originated in 1980, when an amendment to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) excluded CCRs from regulation as a hazardous waste, pending further study by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). That study was required to identify adverse effects on human health and the environment, if any, of CCR disposal and use before determining whether the materials should be subject to hazardous waste requirements.", "For over 30 years, EPA has gathered information, conducted studies, solicited input from state agencies, industry, and the public, and evaluated existing state and federal regulatory programs to determine whether the management of CCRs warranted regulation as a hazardous waste. In June 2010, EPA proposed its most recent regulatory determination for public comment. In that proposal, EPA included two options to regulate CCRs, which were immediately controversial. In the wake of EPA's proposal, the House passed two CCR bills that embodied a new approach to creating state programs to regulate a solid waste under RCRA. Similar legislation was introduced in the Senate, but the chamber took no action. The 113th Congress may consider legislation patterned after the bills considered in the 112th Congress.", "This report identifies key elements of that new approach and compares it to existing RCRA solid waste management programs. The report concludes that there are significant differences between the two. Under the new approach, EPA would have no formal role in creating state programs to regulate CCRs (though an informal one may evolve). Further, in contrast to existing RCRA programs, EPA would not be directed to establish regulations applicable to disposal facilities or to approve of state programs to implement those regulations. Instead, states that opt to implement a CCR Permit Program would be expected to establish regulations applicable to \"CCR structures\" based on program specifications included in the bills. In contrast to existing state waste management programs created under RCRA, such an approach would", "Allow individual states to define key terms (e.g., \"CCR structures\"). Hence, program applicability could vary from state to state, depending on how each state defines those terms. For example, a \"CCR landfill\" could be defined to include only land disposal units that receive CCRs or may include large-scale fill operations at construction sites (a common use of CCRs that may pose risks similar to landfilling). Establish no explicit deadlines for the issuance of permits or for facility compliance with applicable regulations, allowing individual states to establish such deadlines\u2014although a court might impose deadlines if it determines a state has unreasonably delayed. Require EPA to identify any deficiencies in a state's CCR Permit Program. However, it cannot be predicted what program elements EPA would regard as a \"deficiency,\" or when EPA would make such an evaluation. Require EPA to implement a CCR Permit Program for any state that chooses not to do so or fails to remedy a program deficiency identified by EPA.", "State regulations adopted under RCRA (e.g., municipal solid waste landfill regulations) have been required by Congress to be those necessary to meet a national \"standard of protection\" (e.g., \"protect human health and the environment\"). In contrast, state regulations applicable to CCR structures that would be applied by a CCR Permit Program created under this new approach would not explicitly be required to do so. Each state arguably could apply its own standard of protection. The absence of an explicit statement in the bills has implications for how EPA might exercise its authority in the event of absent or deficient state action.", "Given the potential for similar legislation to be proposed in the 113th Congress, and as a result of the complexities inherent in creating a regulatory program using a new legislative approach (that specifies new roles for states and EPA), this report provides additional background information and expands on an earlier CRS analysis."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["On October 14, 2011, the House passed the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act ( H.R. 2273 ). On August 2, 2012, the Coal Ash Recycling and Oversight Act of 2012 (S. 3512) was introduced in the Senate. Each bill would have amended the Solid Waste Disposal Act\u2014more commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a76901 et seq.). The House subsequently incorporated the provisions of the Senate bill in Title IV of H.R. 3409, the Stop the War on Coal Act, passed in the House on September 12, 2012. The bills would have created a framework that states could use to create permit programs for the \"management and disposal\" of coal combustion residuals (CCRs, also referred to generally as \"coal ash\"). In states that did not create a program that met program specifications included in the proposed amendment, or in other specified circumstances, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would have been required to implement a program.", "Each bill would have added to Subtitle D of RCRA a new Section 4011, Management and Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals. Compared to H.R. 2273 , the Senate-introduced bill (S. 3512 and Title IV of H.R. 3409) included more detailed provisions applicable to the program. However, the approach to creating state permit programs was largely the same in each bill. That approach is unique within RCRA. As a result, state permit programs implementing regulations applicable to CCR disposal, created in accordance with statutory permit program specifications, would differ from other permit programs created in RCRA.", "Legislation addressing CCRs may be considered in the 113 th Congress. Analysis of selected elements of the legislation considered during the 112 th Congress is provided in this report as background for future legislation that may take a similar approach. That approach, proposed in the 112 th Congress, was to create state programs to regulate a particular type of waste (CCRs) using as its framework existing federal-state programs to regulate municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. For that existing program, pursuant to directives in Subtitle D of RCRA, EPA promulgated federal regulatory criteria applicable to owners and operators of MSW landfills; states adopted those federal criteria and implemented them using a permit program; and EPA approved each state permit program, based on EPA's determination of whether each program was adequate to ensure facility compliance with baseline federal regulatory criteria. Further, as explicitly required by Congress, the federal criteria promulgated by EPA, applicable to MSW landfills, were required to be those necessary to \"protect human health and the environment.\"", "The approach used in the 112 th Congress bills would not have provided an explicit mandate that EPA or the states promulgate regulations applicable to CCR disposal facilities. Instead, the proposed Section 4011 would itself list Permit Program Specifications that individual states would be required to apply to \"CCR structures.\" Using this approach to creating largely state-based programs, it is difficult to determine in advance how such statutory specifications may be interpreted by each state.", "The proposed amendment would also have provided no explicit authority for EPA to directly enforce regulatory criteria applicable to CCR disposal units (short of EPA running a CCR Permit Program for a state). Such authority provided to EPA in other parts of RCRA (and in some other pollution control laws) has generally served as an incentive to states to adopt and implement federal regulatory criteria. The absence of such authority makes it difficult to anticipate the degree to which EPA may encourage states to adopt and implement a program to regulate CCRs that would comply with the Permit Program Specifications and other relevant provisions in the proposed Section 4011.", "The bills considered in the 112 th Congress were proposed in the wake of a June 2010 proposal by EPA to regulate CCRs.

The report also describes selected elements of RCRA Subtitles C and D, relevant to both EPA's proposal to regulate CCRs and the legislative proposals to create state programs to regulate CCRs.", "This report looks primarily at how state programs to regulate CCRs may be developed and implemented by a state according to directives in the bills proposed in the 112 th Congress; it does not attempt to identify detailed requirements that may be applied by a state regulatory program. Accordingly, the report does not compare provisions in House and Senate bills proposed in the 112 th Congress or provide detailed analysis of provisions in those bills, except to the extent that individual provisions may be relevant to the regulatory program a state may develop and implement to regulate CCRs.", "Federal criteria applicable to MSW landfills were promulgated in 1991. State efforts to adopt the federal criteria and implement them according to an EPA-approved permit program have been largely complete for more than 15 years. In comparing the proposed approach to regulate CCRs to the now-mature and already EPA-approved state programs to regulate MSW landfills, where relevant, this report provides information regarding those existing programs as they have been implemented (e.g., with regard to enforcement authorities that EPA could have exercised, but did not). Also, to simplify the discussion in this report, potential programs to regulate CCRs are discussed in the present tense (e.g., references to programs that \"may be\" or \"could be\" created and implemented by states refer to programs that may or could have been created pursuant to bills proposed in the 112 th Congress).", "Since the most recent bill passed by the House adopted provisions in the Senate bill, unless otherwise noted, any reference to \"the bills,\" \"the proposed amendment to RCRA,\" or \"Section 4011\" refers to S. 3512/Title IV of H.R. 3409 , proposed in the 112 th Congress. Provisions included throughout the bills use the term \"CCR permit program\" to refer to state programs to regulate CCRs. The proposed amendments to RCRA would not create a \"permit program,\" per se (see discussion in \" Provisions Relevant to Potential State CCR Permit Programs \"). Instead, selected provisions in the bills would form a framework that states could use to create programs to regulate CCR management (i.e., its use or disposal). To distinguish between \"permit programs\" as they have been previously created in RCRA and programs that could be created pursuant to the approach taken in the proposed bills, use of the phrase \"CCR Permit Program\" will mean a program that could be developed, adopted, or implemented by or for a state according to provisions in proposed Section 4011.

Requirements applicable to solid waste disposal facilities are generally promulgated by states pursuant to state laws applicable to solid waste management. State regulations applicable to waste disposal facilities may vary depending on the issues specific to the type of waste received at that facility. For example, requirements applicable to a landfill that receives construction and demolition debris would be tailored to address waste management issues that may be different from requirements applicable to a landfill that accepts industrial solid waste.", "A state permit \"program\" is the body of authorities, activities, and procedures that the permitting authority uses to implement and enforce regulations applicable to a solid waste disposal facility.

Since all states currently have waste management laws in place, a new permit program may be created by amending existing laws to specify the entity required to operate using a permit and authorize the appropriate state agency to promulgate regulations applicable to the permittee. Once the regulations are promulgated, the authorized state agency would generally be required to take measures necessary to ensure that the newly regulated waste disposal facility operates in compliance with applicable requirements.

Under RCRA Subtitle D, however, states have primary authority to regulate nonhazardous solid wastes. EPA's role in the regulation of solid waste under Subtitle D has largely been to promulgate criteria applicable to sanitary landfills as necessary to identify and eliminate open dumps, prohibited under RCRA. Amendments to RCRA in 1984 required EPA to revise the sanitary landfill criteria to apply to facilities that may receive hazardous household wastes. EPA subsequently defined these facilities in regulation as municipal solid waste, or MSW, landfills.", "The creation of state programs to regulate MSW landfills involved two different but related elements\u2014the promulgation of federal regulatory criteria applicable to owners and operators of MSW landfills (at 49 C.F.R.

In RCRA, directives from Congress to EPA to promulgate regulations have included a broad directive that those regulations must meet a minimum \"standard of protection.\" The standard of protection has been \"to protect human health and the environment.\" Permit programs created under RCRA, adopted and implemented by a state, have been expected to ensure that waste disposal facilities, operating in compliance with the federal regulatory criteria, will not pose a risk to human health.", "When states began to implement the federal MSW landfill criteria, states had a certain degree of flexibility in adopting the regulations according to state-specific conditions. However, EPA approval of a state permit program to implement the MSW landfill criteria was dependent on whether EPA determined that the state's program was \"adequate\" to ensure MSW landfill compliance with regulations that met the baseline federal standard of protection. The ultimate objective of the regulatory program was the same nationwide (i.e., to achieve a baseline standard of protection), but details regarding how each state may achieve that objective varied from state to state.", "Under the Constitution, Congress has no power to compel states to exercise their sovereign authority. Thus, pursuant to pollution control laws administered by EPA (or any other laws), Congress may not require states to adopt federal regulations or require states to implement certain requirements using a permit program. However, Congress has authorized EPA to promulgate and enforce certain regulations, while simultaneously providing for conditions under which a state may be authorized or approved to adopt and enforce those regulations. Given the options of allowing EPA to enforce a federal standard at facilities in the state or adopting and enforcing the regulations themselves, states generally choose the latter.", "To provide states with an incentive to adopt the federal criteria and implement them using a permit program, Subtitle D included provisions that specified narrow conditions under which EPA could directly enforce the federal regulatory criteria. More specifically, EPA was authorized to enforce the federal standards from 18 months after the MSW landfill criteria were finalized to the point at which a state adopted a program approved by EPA as adequate to enforce the federal criteria. For this purpose, EPA was explicitly authorized to use its inspection and federal enforcement authorities under Subtitle C, Sections 3006 and 3007.

However, as authorized under Subtitle C, EPA has taken enforcement actions against individual TSDFs in states authorized to implement federal Subtitle C requirements.", "In contrast to such programs where EPA has primary oversight and enforcement authority, EPA's authority to directly enforce the MSW landfill criteria was framed narrowly. Now that all states have approved permit programs to implement the MSW landfill criteria, EPA has no effective authority to step in and enforce federal regulatory criteria at an individual MSW landfill.

A unique element of the proposed amendment to RCRA would be the creation of a permit program absent a directive to EPA to promulgate standards applicable to the entity potentially regulated pursuant to the program. That is, the proposed bills include no explicit directive (to states or to EPA) to promulgate regulatory criteria or standards that would apply directly to owners and operators of disposal facilities that receive CCRs. Instead, minimum program requirements specify that the CCR Permit Program \"shall apply\" selected MSW landfill criteria to owners and operators of structures. According to that precondition, it is arguably implied that states that choose to adopt and implement a permit program would promulgate regulations applicable to \"CCR structures.\" Regulations that would ultimately apply to owners and operators of CCR structures would depend on each state's interpretation of the criteria listed among the proposed Permit Program Specifications.", "Although the purpose of the proposed amendment to RCRA was the creation of state permit programs to implement regulations applicable to CCR disposal, apart from using MSW landfill criteria and selected other minimum requirements that must be applied by the CCR Permit Program, there were few requirements applicable to the permit program itself.

Compared to other programs created under federal pollution control laws, this is an approach\u2014possibly complex in practice\u2014to creating a regulatory program that does not clearly distinguish the purpose of federal regulations that meet a minimum standard of protection from permit programs used to implement and enforce those regulations.", "Creation of a state program to regulate a particular type of waste, according to statutory provisions in federal law, without detailed federal regulations or guidance, would be a novel approach in RCRA. That a RCRA program has never been authorized or established by Congress using such an approach does not mean that this new approach would not meet a particular objective.

Since the proposed program to regulate CCRs was intended to be state-implemented, this report focuses primarily on elements of a regulatory program that may be created, adopted, and implemented by a state according to program specifications included in the proposed amendment. In comparing that proposed program to the existing program to regulate MSW landfills, there are various ways the programs could differ\u2014with regard to implementation and enforcement. The report compares three program elements: (1) the flexibility provided to states in implementing the proposed Permit Program Specifications; (2) the standard of protection state regulations may provide; and (3) EPA's potential role in program implementation. This report explains existing federal-state programs to regulate MSW landfills, as well as risks EPA has identified as specific to the management of CCRs.", "With regard to potential state regulations applicable to CCR structures, as noted above, a CCR Permit Program created pursuant to the proposed bills would be required to apply several minimum requirements and selected MSW landfill criteria to CCR structures. A state may promulgate regulations according to its interpretation of those statutory provisions and how those criteria cited should be applied to CCR structures in the state.", "In federal pollution control laws, ambiguities are subject to EPA (and potentially court) interpretation. In contrast, any ambiguities or requirements not specified in the proposed CCR bills would be subject to state (and potentially court) interpretation. For example, criteria that must be applied to CCR structures using a CCR Permit Program include selected MSW landfill criteria\u2014primarily the technical criteria such as operational and design criteria and groundwater monitoring requirements. However, program specifications do not include criteria comparable to \"general\" standards in the MSW landfill criteria. Those general standards define \"applicability\" (to whom the regulations apply), specify deadlines for facility compliance, and clarify requirements applicable to existing versus new facilities, among other elements. Since those standards are necessary to implement a program, states would likely include them in their own CCR Permit Program. State inclusion of those criteria would likely vary from state to state.", "Decisions regarding the applicability of state regulations and compliance deadlines that existing facilities would be required to meet would be particularly relevant in determining the degree to which a state program may protect human health from risks specific to CCR disposal. In listing Permit Program Specifications, however, the bills did not explicitly require a CCR Permit Program to apply criteria to CCR structures that would be intended to achieve a specific standard of protection. If promulgated in accordance with existing state solid waste management laws, regulations applicable to CCR structures may meet standards of protection determined by each state, in accordance with that state's interpretation of potential risk to human health from CCR disposal. Such an approach to regulating a waste differs from existing state programs to regulate MSW landfills\u2014programs adopted and implemented by each state to assure that each regulated MSW landfill will comply with regulations designed to meet a baseline level of protection.", "EPA's oversight role in state implementation of a CCR Permit Program, pursuant to the approach in the proposed bills, would be substantially different from EPA's typical role in the oversight of permit programs created in federal pollution control law. Pursuant to the bills, in a state that chooses to implement a CCR Permit Program, EPA would be required to provide notice to a state regarding \"deficiencies\" in its program, with regard to certain program elements. For example, EPA would be required to notify and provide states with an opportunity to remedy deficiencies if, at any time, EPA determines the state is not implementing a CCR Permit Program that meets Permit Program Specifications delineated in the bills. Since those specifications do not include an explicit deadline for fully implementing the program (e.g., issuing permits and assuring facility compliance with applicable regulations), it cannot, as a practical matter, be determined in advance when EPA might evaluate state programs for deficiencies. However, once a state began implementing a CCR Permit Program, EPA could review that state's program at any time; could potentially find certain program elements deficient; and, within a narrow range of conditions specified in the bills, would then be required to implement a CCR Permit Program.", "The bills' requirement that EPA identify certain state program elements that may be \"deficient\" involves the use of a term not found in the RCRA statute, and thus lacking a history of interpretation. As a result, it is difficult to anticipate how EPA would respond to such a mandate. In contrast, with regard to existing state programs to regulate MSW landfills, Congress required EPA to determine whether each state program was \"adequate.\" EPA subsequently interpreted that mandate to mean that it was required to determine whether each state program was adequate to ensure that regulated facilities would operate in compliance with regulatory criteria that met a baseline level of protection. Unlike \"deficient,\" the term \"adequate\" now has decades of agency interpretation providing a mature understanding of its precise meaning for evaluating state programs.", "Some have argued that by requiring EPA to implement a CCR Permit Program for a state under specific conditions, the bills would provide EPA with authority to backstop state programs. Under current law, the term \"backstop authority\" is not formally defined in statute or regulation, and whether EPA is said to have backstop authority or not has no legal consequence. Nonetheless, the term has been widely used to refer to explicit authority provided to EPA to enforce standards at individual facilities in a state authorized by EPA to implement and enforce federal standards. Reference to EPA backstop authority has been made with regard to RCRA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act. For example, under RCRA Subtitle C (42 U.S.C. \u00a76928(a)), EPA is authorized to enforce standards of performance at individual facilities in a state even after the agency has authorized the state to implement and enforce such standards. Section 111(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a77411(c)) provides EPA with comparable enforcement authority.

The Kingston release also brought attention to the fact that the management of CCRs is essentially unregulated at the federal level.", "EPA found that many state solid waste management programs adequately regulate CCR landfills, but identified gaps in those programs with respect to the regulation of CCR surface impoundments (particularly existing surface impoundments).

Many of the measures reduce risks that may be broadly applicable to the operation or design of other types of waste disposal facilities, such as MSW landfills. However, EPA identified other protective measures that would address risks specific to the management of CCRs. In particular, EPA found that surface impoundments pose a significant risk of contaminant leaching when CCRs are placed in an unlined unit, but that risk can be largely eliminated through the use of a composite liner system. Surface impoundments also pose a risk of structural failure. Given the potentially large volume of liquid waste impoundments may contain, structural failure could result in a catastrophic release of coal ash slurry. The potential for structural failure could be minimized by various means, including ensuring that the units meet certain design standards and are inspected regularly.", "CCR disposal facilities are currently subject to limited federal regulation. Instead, they are regulated by individual states. In a continuing effort to determine whether CCRs should be subject to federal requirements established under RCRA, EPA has gathered data on CCR use and disposal for more than 30 years. In the past 10 years, EPA has found that states appear to be regulating CCR landfills to a greater extent than they had in the past. However, based on available data, EPA determined that a majority of states with CCR surface impoundments did not appear to require facility owner/operators to implement protective measures typically deemed necessary to protect human health from risks associated with contaminant migration. As a result of potential risks tied to CCR management, documented cases of damages attributed to improper disposal practices, and concern over potential gaps in state regulatory programs to regulate CCRs, particularly surface impoundments, EPA determined that national standards were needed to protect human health from risks specific to CCR management (i.e., its disposal and certain uses).", "EPA options to regulate CCRs, however, are limited under its current authorities in Subtitles C and D. Pursuant to the Bevill exclusion, CCRs are explicitly excluded from the Subtitle C requirements, unless or until EPA determines that such requirements are warranted (EPA efforts with regard to directives included in the Bevill Amendment are summarized in Appendix C ). Accordingly, EPA has two options: (1) it could determine, reversing previous rulings, that hazardous waste regulation is warranted for CCRs, and promulgate regulations under Subtitle C, or (2) it could promulgate standards applicable to CCR landfills and surface impoundments under its Subtitle D authority (as necessary to allow states to enforce the prohibition on open dumping under RCRA Subtitle D).", "On June 21, 2010, EPA proposed for public comment two options to regulate CCRs pursuant to those Subtitle C and D authorities. Under the Subtitle C option, EPA would reverse a previous regulatory determination to exempt CCRs from the hazardous waste requirements and, instead, list the material as a \"special waste.\" Subtitle C requirements applicable to CCR management would include strict standards applicable to CCR land disposal. EPA assumed that power plants that dispose of CCRs on-site would continue to do so, but would upgrade their facilities as necessary to ensure compliance with land disposal standards applicable to owners and operators of TSDFs\u2014standards that EPA tailored to address issues specific to CCRs. Pursuant to its existing authorities under Subtitle D, EPA's second regulatory option would be to promulgate national standards applicable to landfills and surface impoundments that receive CCRs. The proposed standards are structured similarly to regulatory requirements applicable to MSW landfills, supplemented to reflect requirements specific to the management of CCRs (discussed in \" Proposed EPA Standards to Address Risks Specific\u00a0to\u00a0CCR\u00a0Management \").", "According to EPA, if implemented as proposed, each regulatory option would result in a similar level of protection. However, each option would result in regulatory programs with a substantially different scope and potential for enforcement. Adoption and enforcement of the Subtitle C \"cradle to grave\" regulations would involve stricter waste management standards implemented at a higher cost to both industry and state waste management agencies. Implementing the Subtitle D option would establish standards applicable only to owners and operators of CCR landfills and surface impoundments (i.e., it would create a regulatory program applicable only to the CCR \"grave,\" not every stage of CCR management). In contrast to its broad authority to enforce Subtitle C requirements, EPA could promulgate the Subtitle D standards, but would have limited authority to enforce them. If finalized, EPA could encourage states to adopt and enforce the Subtitle D standards, but would have no authority to enforce the standards directly.", "Selected elements of EPA's proposed Subtitle C and D requirements, applicable specifically to waste disposal units that may receive CCRs, are summarized in Table 1 .", "EPA's proposal drew comments from industry groups, environmental and citizen groups, state agency representatives, individual citizens, and some Members of Congress. Although public comments varied, opposition to the Subtitle C option was largely due to concerns that it would be costly to implement to both states and industry; be too restrictive; stigmatize the material by labeling it \"hazardous,\" adversely affecting its potential for reuse; and restrict uses of the material that involve land-based applications of CCRs, due to the land disposal restrictions applicable to hazardous wastes.", "Opposition to the Subtitle D option stemmed from various concerns, many of which were centered on EPA's lack of authority to directly enforce the standards\u2014authority that would likely be necessary to encourage states to adopt and enforce them.

That it would be created using a new approach does not mean that it cannot achieve its intended purpose. Its purpose is broadly stated as \"to facilitate recovery and beneficial use, and provide for the proper management and disposal\" of CCRs. In accordance with that purpose, it would appear that CCR Permit Programs would be intended to result in the \"proper management\" of CCRs, but not restrict beneficial uses of CCRs. The bills would establish a framework that states could use to create programs to regulate CCR disposal, allow states flexibility to develop and implement the program, and specify some level of EPA oversight after states are implementing the program. Such a program would be comparable to existing state programs to implement and enforce standards necessary to ensure facility compliance with RCRA's open dumping prohibition.", "Based on the construction of the proposed amendment (e.g., listing specific MSW landfill criteria that CCR Permit Programs must apply) and statements available in the legislative history, it may be assumed that state adoption and implementation of a CCR Permit Program, created pursuant to the proposed bills, are intended to result in state programs to regulate CCR disposal similarly to existing state programs to regulate MSW landfills. The creation of the latter involved a somewhat complex evolution of RCRA. In particular, federal-state programs to regulate MSW landfills were created pursuant to the 1984 amendments to RCRA Subtitle D that revised existing requirements applicable to RCRA's prohibition on open dumping.", "Under Section 4011 in the proposed bills, states would create CCR Permit Programs using statutory criteria drawn from regulatory criteria previously created pursuant to RCRA. However, proposed Section 4011 includes no provisions that would explicitly require either EPA or states to promulgate regulations directly applicable to owners and operators of disposal facilities that receive CCRs (regulations the permit program would be expected to implement). Instead, the Permit Program Specifications would cite selected existing federal regulatory criteria applicable to MSW landfills (in 40 C.F.R. Part 258) and five requirements drawn from EPA's June 2010 Subtitle D proposal that a CCR Permit Program would be required to apply. According to that precondition, it is arguably implied that states choosing to adopt and implement a CCR Permit Program would promulgate regulations applicable to \"CCR structures.\" Regulations promulgated by a state that would ultimately apply to owners and operators of CCR structures would depend on each state's interpretation of the criteria listed among the proposed Permit Program Specifications (though EPA and possibly court review would impose a check on unreasonable state interpretations).", "As proposed, apart from the potential for EPA to issue guidance or technical assistance, state CCR Permit Programs would likely be created with no involvement from EPA\u2014with regard to either required elements of the program itself or the regulations that would be implemented by the permit program. In contrast to other RCRA permit programs, EPA would have a substantially different role in program implementation and enforcement.", "By way of comparison, existing state programs to regulate landfills that receive MSW involved the following actions by EPA and states with regard to program creation, implementation, and enforcement:", "EPA revised existing regulatory criteria applicable to sanitary landfills to apply to owners and operators of MSW landfills. In the regulations promulgated by EPA, they are defined as minimum national criteria to ensure protection of human health and the environment. Owner/operators of MSW landfills were required to comply with the criteria within two years. Within 18 months after EPA promulgated the MSW landfill criteria, states were required to adopt and implement a permit program to implement the criteria or risk EPA enforcement of the criteria at facilities in the state. States either adopted the federal criteria exactly or used them as a model to create their own requirements applicable to MSW landfills. EPA determined whether state programs were adequate to ensure facility compliance with the federal criteria. That is, state regulations applicable to MSW landfill owner/operators and their programs to enforce those standards were required to be adequate to ensure that owner/operator compliance with the state requirements would not pose a threat to human health from risks common to waste disposal (e.g., contamination of groundwater above levels determined to be safe for humans). From the deadline for a state to adopt and implement a permit program (18 months after EPA promulgated the MSW landfill criteria) until that state had an approved (\"adequate\") permit program in place, EPA was authorized to directly enforce the federal regulatory criteria at facilities in the state. By providing EPA with authority to enforce federal criteria, states were encouraged to adopt, implement, and enforce the federal criteria. Once a program was approved by EPA, states had primary authority to implement and enforce their own program to regulate MSW landfills. EPA had limited authority to intervene.", "A CCR Permit Program would draw from selected elements of existing state programs to regulate MSW landfills, but with different roles for states and EPA and a different timetable for program implementation (the required elements of the CCR Permit Program are discussed in \" Proposed CCR Legislation Amending RCRA ,\" below). Not later than six months after bill enactment, each state would be required to notify EPA whether it will adopt and implement a CCR Permit Program. Not later than three years after bill enactment, participating states would be required to submit to EPA certification that their CCR Permit Programs meet the Permit Program Specifications delineated in proposed Section 4011(c). Based on both explicit and implicit directives in the proposed amendment to RCRA, EPA and state roles and authorities to create, implement, and enforce requirements applicable to CCR structures appear to be as follows:", "Participating states would interpret provisions in Section 4011, particularly the Permit Program Specifications, and develop regulations based on their interpretation. There is no explicit directive in the bills that the requirements applied via the permit program be those necessary to protect human health (i.e., meet a federal standard of protection). Requirements adopted by the state would likely meet a state-determined standard of protection. States would determine when owner/operators would be required to comply with the requirements implemented via the permit program and when they would issue permits. Participating states would certify that they have a program in place within three years of enactment of proposed Section 4011, including a legal certification that the state has \"fully effective statutes or regulations necessary to implement a coal combustion residuals permit program that meets the [statutory] specifications.\" States would presumably promulgate regulations applicable to CCR structures. Deadlines for compliance and details regarding program applicability would not be known until states promulgate regulations that would be implemented by the permit program. EPA would be required to notify states if they did not meet the deadlines to notify the agency whether they intended to implement a program, or to submit to EPA their program certification. At any time after a state is implementing a CCR Permit Program (e.g., is issuing permits and enforcing permit conditions), EPA would be required to identify and notify a state of any deficiencies in meeting the Permit Program Specifications. EPA would not be explicitly required to identify as a program \"deficiency\" program elements outside the required Permit Program Specifications (e.g., compliance deadlines or details regarding program applicability that may be included in state regulations or in state procedures to implement those regulations), and arguably could not. If a state fails to remedy program deficiencies identified by EPA within the time frame negotiated between the state and EPA, the agency would be required to implement a permit program for a state. The time frame for that could vary depending on the compliance deadlines established by the state. If EPA did implement a CCR Permit Program in a state, it is not clear whether the agency would be obligated to implement and enforce state requirements or EPA would promulgate federal criteria necessary to implement the CCR Permit Program, in accordance with its broad authority to promulgate regulations necessary to carry out its functions under RCRA.", "Under this construct, EPA and state roles would be substantially different in developing, implementing, and enforcing requirements applicable to CCR structures compared to their respective roles and authorities to implement and enforce requirements applicable to MSW landfills. Also, CCR Permit Programs created pursuant to proposed Section 4011 would be implemented in accordance with program definitions (e.g., \"deficiencies\"), procedures (e.g., EPA review of state programs to identify program deficiencies at any time after states are implementing the program, rather than determining program adequacy to ensure compliance with a federal standard), and standards of protection (e.g., a presumption that states would develop programs according to a state-determined standard) that differ from other permit programs implemented by states under RCRA.", "Congress may create a permit program for any constitutionally authorized purpose. By drawing primarily from the existing federal regulations applicable to MSW landfills, state adoption of a CCR Permit Program appears to be intended to result in state implementation of programs to regulate CCRs comparable to existing state programs to regulate MSW landfills.

In developing the amendments, Congress recognized that an explicit exemption from the Subtitle C requirements did not mean that disposal of those wastes did not pose potential risks to human health and the environment. For example, household waste is exempt from Subtitle C requirements. However, in its amendments to RCRA, Congress recognized that disposal facilities that accept such waste may need to comply with standards that were more detailed than the broad criteria applicable to sanitary landfills. Rather than subject household waste to the full gamut of \"cradle to grave\" Subtitle C regulations, Congress took an approach that could be implemented under Subtitle D. That approach resulted in more detailed regulations than those applicable to sanitary landfills, and included a stronger enforcement mechanism to ensure consistent state conformance with the national standards.", "HSWA amended Subtitle D to add Section 4010, in which Congress directed EPA to study the extent to which the Subtitle D guidelines and criteria applicable to solid waste management and disposal facilities, including landfills and surface impoundments, were adequate to protect human health and the environment from groundwater contamination. Within three years, EPA was required to report the results of its study to Congress, as well as any recommendations the agency made based on the study findings. Further, EPA was required to revise the sanitary landfill criteria to apply to facilities that may receive hazardous household wastes. Congress explicitly required EPA to revise the existing sanitary landfill criteria to be", "those necessary to protect human health and the environment and may take into account the practicable capability of such facilities. At a minimum such revisions for facilities potentially receiving such wastes should require ground water monitoring as necessary to detect contamination, establish criteria for the acceptable location of new or existing facilities, and provide for corrective action as appropriate.", "Once EPA promulgated the revised criteria, each state was required to \"adopt and implement a permit program or other system of prior approval and conditions, to assure that each solid waste management facility within such state which may receive hazardous household waste ... will comply with the [the newly revised] criteria.\"", "EPA was required to determine whether each state developed an adequate permit program.

The landfill criteria and required elements of an \"adequate\" permit program were developed and implemented using data and information gathered over a more than 20-year period.

A state program that met the requirements in the SIR would be expected to be adequate to assure facility compliance with the MSW landfill criteria.", "EPA did not intend the SIR to be a rigid set of criteria. States could regulate MSW landfills based on the federal MSW landfill criteria exactly, or could allow owners and operators to use site-specific alternative approaches to meet the federal performance standards (i.e., to protect human health and the environment). In providing a certain degree of flexibility, the SIR allowed states to adopt regulations that may not have been identical to the MSW landfill criteria. All state programs approved by EPA, however, were determined to be adequate to assure facility compliance with standards protective of human health and the environment.", "EPA's determination of state program adequacy was also relevant to the agency's potential to directly enforce the MSW landfill criteria. Specifically, HSWA's new Section 4005(c) added the following provisions that specify the narrow set of conditions under which EPA would be authorized to directly enforce the open dumping prohibition at facilities subject to the MSW landfill criteria:", "In any state that EPA determined did not adopt a program adequate to assure facility compliance with the MSW landfill criteria, EPA could use authorities available in Sections 3007 and 3008 in Subtitle C (\"Inspection\" and \"Federal Enforcement\" provisions in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a76927 and 6928) to directly enforce the open dumping prohibition at MSW landfills in that state. Since the inspection and federal enforcement authorities cited apply explicitly to the management of hazardous waste, an additional provision specifies that, when drawing upon the federal enforcement authorities (\u00a76928), the term \"requirements of this subchapter\" in Subtitle C would be deemed to include criteria \"promulgated by the Administrator under Sections 6907(a)(3) and 6944(a)\" of RCRA (i.e., the MSW landfill criteria), and the term \"hazardous wastes\" in the inspection provisions (\u00a76927) would be deemed to include \"solid waste at facilities that may handle hazardous household wastes\" (i.e., MSW landfills).", "Absent the above provisions, EPA has no authority to directly enforce the federal MSW landfill criteria or, likely, provide states with incentive to adopt and enforce the federal criteria.

Legally, EPA could have directly enforced the federal MSW landfill criteria at any MSW landfill in a state without an EPA-approved program. However, EPA never did so.

As discussed, EPA proposed two alternative regulations based on its existing statutory authorities in RCRA under Subtitles C and D. EPA's determination to regulate CCRs under either subtitle stems from directives included in the Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980 (P.L. 96-482). That amendment to RCRA includes provisions commonly referred to as the Bevill Amendment or Bevill Exclusion, which are found in several RCRA subtitles, but primarily under Subtitle C. (As noted, information regarding the Bevill amendment provisions and EPA's response to directives in those amendments is provided in Appendix C .)", "Under the Bevill provisions, \"fly ash waste, bottom ash waste, slag waste, flue gas emission control waste, and other byproduct materials generated primarily from the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels\" (i.e., CCRs) were explicitly excluded from the Subtitle C requirements, pending a determination by EPA of whether such regulation was warranted. EPA's June 2010 proposal was part of the agency's ongoing effort to gather data necessary to determining whether regulating CCRs under Subtitle C is warranted. To make that determination, included among the Bevill amendment provisions, EPA was directed to prepare a detailed and comprehensive study on the adverse effects on human health and the environment, if any, of the disposal and use of CCRs. Among the study criteria, EPA was required to identify", "the source and volumes of CCRs generated annually, methods of disposal and use, the potential danger, if any, to human health and the environment from those methods, and documented cases in which danger to human health or the environment from surface runoff or leachate has been proved.", "In determining whether CCRs should be subject to Subtitle C requirements, EPA also used federal regulatory criteria applicable to the identification and listing of hazardous waste. Of relevance to CCRs would be whether the waste could be identified and specifically listed by EPA as hazardous waste based on its toxicity. When making that determination, EPA must consider a range of factors, some of which are similar to the study data included in the Bevill amendment. Additional factors include data regarding the nature and concentration of toxic constituents present in the waste; plausible types of improper management to which the waste could be subjected; the potential for toxic constituents to degrade and migrate from the point of deposition under plausible management conditions; and regulation by other government agencies or regulatory programs intended to address health or environmental hazards posed by a waste or toxic constituent in that waste.", "Using those various criteria, EPA determined that the material is generated in large volumes annually (e.g., approximately 130 million tons in 2011); that it contains more than 40 toxic constituents, including antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, and selenium; and that those constituents can degrade and migrate from the point of deposition under certain conditions.", "EPA identified common methods of disposal and use, potentially regulated under RCRA, that resulted in documented cases of damages that could cause human health concerns. Those management methods include disposal in landfills, accumulation in surface impoundment ponds, and use in land applications equivalent to landfill disposal such as the placement of large volumes of CCRs on land for use as structural or embankment fill (e.g., to contour the land at a construction site or raise a roadbed). Using EPA's quantifiable groundwater risk assessment data and information from documented CCR damage cases, EPA identified various pathways in which humans may be exposed to toxic constituents in CCRs at levels high enough to cause health concerns. The pathways under which exposure would most likely occur include the following:", "contaminant leaching and migration off-site when CCRs are deposited in an unlined unit (e.g., a landfill, surface impoundment, sand pit, quarry, construction site); direct, uncontrolled discharge or release of liquid waste to surface water, as in the structural failure of a surface impoundment (e.g., the Kingston release) or as a result of run-on/runoff across the deposition site during rain/flood events; and fugitive dust emissions, when fine particulates in dried ash become airborne, as at landfills or large-scale fill operations.", "Of those pathways, risk to human health was highest from contaminant leaching and migration to surface and groundwater. EPA found that risk was largely eliminated through the use of a composite liner.", "Leading up to its 2010 proposal, EPA attempted to determine the extent to which", "owners and operators of individual facilities may have implemented necessary protective measures, and state regulatory programs may require protective measures to control risks EPA identified as associated with CCR disposal and use.", "Based on the limited data available to EPA, the agency determined that owners and operators of CCR landfills and surface impoundments are likely to install liners and groundwater monitoring systems in new CCR disposal units, but that the majority of disposal units were likely to be older and lacked liners and groundwater monitoring. Using data gathered in 2004, EPA determined that 31% of the CCR landfills and 62% of the CCR surface impoundments lacked liners, and 10% of the CCR landfills and 58% of the CCR surface impoundments lacked groundwater monitoring.", "EPA found that the majority of states appeared to regulate CCR landfills adequately, but that there appeared to be gaps in state regulatory oversight of surface impoundments. The latter may be regulated under a state's dam safety program (intended to control risks related to the unit's structural integrity), but not necessarily a state's solid waste management program (intended to control risks specific to contaminant spread related to the land-based accumulation of liquid waste). For example, a 2009 survey of states found that among survey respondents, more than 60% of states required neither liners nor groundwater monitoring for surface impoundments (67% and 61%, respectively). EPA noted that the survey results are \"particularly significant as groundwater monitoring for these kinds of units is a minimum for any credible regulatory regime.\" The majority of states responding to the survey also did not have siting controls, inspection, or structural integrity requirements for surface impoundments\u2014requirements necessary to minimize the potential of a structural failure.", "EPA further noted, however, that it lacks details regarding the manner and degree to which states are regulating the disposal and use of CCRs. To address potential gaps (i.e., to establish regulations applicable to CCR disposal and use in states that are not already regulating CCRs in a manner that protects human health), EPA's June 2010 proposal was intended to create a national standard to regulate CCRs destined for disposal. In its Subtitle D option, EPA would add to 40 C.F.R. Part 257, \"Standards for the Receipt of Coal Combustion Residuals in Landfills and Surface Impoundments.\" Those standards would apply to solid waste disposal units, defined as follows:", "CCR landfill \u2014disposal facility or part of a facility where CCRs are placed in or on land and that is not a land treatment facility, a surface impoundment, an underground injection well, a salt dome formation, a salt bed formation, an underground mine, a cave, or a corrective action management unit. For purposes of this part, landfills also include piles, sand and gravel pits, quarries, and/or large-scale fill operations. Sites that are excavated so that more coal ash can be used as fill are also considered CCR landfills. CCR surface impoundment \u2014facility or part of a facility that is a natural topographic depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of CCRs containing free liquids, and which is not an injection well. Examples of CCR surface impoundments are holding, storage, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons. CCR surface impoundments are used to receive CCRs that have been sluiced (flushed or mixed with water to facilitate movement), or wastes from wet air pollution control devices, often in addition to other solid wastes.", "Those definitions were proposed by EPA based on findings in its groundwater risk assessment and its documentation of CCR damage cases related to CCR management in such units (see definitions of selected relevant terms applicable to waste disposal facilities under the \"General Standards\" listed in Table A-2 ).", "To identify minimum national standards for the safe disposal of CCRs, EPA's June 2010 Subtitle D regulatory option drew primarily from the existing criteria applicable to MSW landfills under 40 C.F.R. Part 258. According to EPA, the MSW landfill criteria provide a comprehensive framework for all aspects of the disposal of wastes such as CCRs in land-based units. Further, based on its experience with the requirements, EPA stated its belief that the MSW landfill criteria represent a reasonable balance between \"ensuring the necessary protection from risks of CCR disposal and the practical realities of facilities' ability to implement the criteria.\"", "EPA tailored and supplemented the MSW landfill criteria to address threats to human health specific to CCR management. For example, the existing MSW landfill criteria were developed to be implemented in the context of a permitting program, where an overseeing authority evaluates the requirements and can adjust them, as appropriate, to account for site-specific conditions. Because there is no corresponding guaranteed permit mechanism under its Subtitle D regulatory option, EPA integrated selected regulatory criteria from 40 C.F.R. Part 265. Those criteria were for \"interim status\" hazardous waste TSDFs\u2014requirements designed to apply to owners and operators of such facilities during the interim period between promulgation of the final hazardous waste regulations and the implementation of permit programs used to ensure facility compliance with those regulations. Also, EPA asserted that selected requirements applicable to TSDFs were particularly relevant in developing the proposed standards for surface impoundments, since the MSW landfill criteria did not address risks from contaminant spread associated with the accumulation of liquid waste, since criteria applicable to the management of liquid wastes are not included under 40 C.F.R. Part 258.", "The MSW landfill criteria also do not address structural integrity issues associated with the accumulation of coal ash slurry (risks from a catastrophic release of liquid waste). To address such risks, selected proposed standards for CCR surface impoundments were modeled on the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations in 30 C.F.R. Part 77. In particular, EPA drew from the MSHA mine safety standards for \"water, sediment, or slurry impoundments and impounding structures\" at 30 C.F.R. \u00a777.216. EPA's decision to draw from the MSHA standards was based on its belief that records compiled by MSHA for its rulemaking (for 30 C.F.R. Part 77) and the agency's 40 years of experience in implementing those requirements provided evidence that similar requirements, applied to CCR surface impoundments, will prevent a catastrophic release of CCRs from surface impoundments, as occurred at TVA's facility in Kingston, TN, and will generally meet RCRA's mandate to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.", "Taking these various issues into account, EPA's Subtitle D regulatory option reflects the framework of MSW landfill criteria (e.g., general requirements, location restrictions, operating and design criteria), but includes selected criteria drawn from MSHA standards and standards applicable to hazardous waste TSDFs, necessary to protect human health from risks unique to CCR management. The proposed standards include criteria EPA deemed necessary to control contaminant leaching and migration, particularly from the disposal of noncontainerized liquid waste, a large-scale release due to the structural failure of a surface impoundment pond, or the release of coal ash dust to the air. The following standards are among those intended to address concerns associated specifically with CCR disposal:", "New disposal units (landfills and surface impoundments) would be required to be placed above the natural water table, and could not be located in wetlands, within 200 feet of a fault zone, or in a seismic impact zone. New or existing disposal units could not be located in an unstable area (e.g., a location susceptible to natural or human-induced events or forces capable of impairing the integrity of the unit). Existing facilities in an unstable area would be required to close within five years. New disposal units would be required to be constructed with a composite liner. Within five years, existing surface impoundments would be required to have solids removed and be retrofitted with a composite liner. All units would be required to comply with the groundwater monitoring requirements within one year of the effective date of a final rule; new CCR units must have groundwater monitoring systems installed before CCRs could be disposed of in the units.

Those definitions have included sufficient detail to allow a potentially regulated entity (the owner/operator of a particular waste disposal facility) to determine whether or what regulations may apply to their waste management activities.

Instead, the agency has noted that some states do not currently have effective regulatory or permitting programs to manage CCR disposal and use (particularly with regard to the management of CCRs in surface impoundments and uses comparable to landfilling). It is not necessarily a question of a state's ability. Instead, it may be a difference in interpretation between states and EPA regarding standards necessary to ensure protection of human health.

Further, in its June 2010 proposal, EPA did not use the MSW landfill criteria, alone, to provide a similar level of protection for the disposal of CCRs in landfills and surface impoundments. EPA used the MSW landfill criteria as the framework for its June 2010 Subtitle D proposal. However, to meet the necessary standard of protection required under RCRA, and to address risks identified by EPA in the statutory directive included in the Bevill amendment provisions ( Appendix C ), EPA's proposal included detailed criteria necessary to address risks associated with the disposal of dry CCRs in a landfill (defined to include large-scale fill operations) and liquid slurry in surface impoundments (a category of disposal unit explicitly excluded from the definition of MSW landfills).", "As noted in the \" Provisions Relevant to Potential State CCR Permit Programs \" section, in addition to selected MSW landfill criteria, the proposed Permit Program Specifications include five provisions that appear to be drawn from EPA's proposed standards applicable to CCR disposal units. Those provisions are not, however, comparable in scope or in detail to the regulatory criteria proposed by EPA under its June 2010 Subtitle D regulatory option. Still, since selected provisions in the bills are drawn from EPA's June 2010 proposal, it appears that a CCR Permit Program would be intended to address certain risks associated with CCR disposal.

However, when permit programs have been required to be implemented under RCRA in the past, it has been with the specific intent of assuring that waste disposal facilities will operate in compliance with baseline federal regulatory criteria that meet an explicit standard of protection. Those existing federal criteria were designed to address gaps in the protection of human health that may occur as a result of gaps in state regulatory programs. In its June 2010 proposal, EPA's primary objective was to address gaps in state programs to regulate CCRs by establishing national standards that would achieve a minimum level of protection from risks specific to CCR disposal and use.", "Generally, it would be during the rulemaking process, under the Administrative Procedure Act, that EPA would provide its analysis of risk assessment data, studies, reports, and various other data used to determine regulatory criteria that it (EPA, in conjunction with state agencies and other interested stakeholders) determined are those necessary to achieve a certain national standard of protection. In its proposal to regulate CCRs, various stakeholders have disagreed with EPA's assessment of what criteria should be applied to CCRs. The administrative process, however, provides some transparency regarding how EPA arrived at its determination. It also provides a forum through which stakeholders can provide their views and supplement data EPA may draw from to form a final decision. The analytical process and technical basis for determining how and why certain requirements were selected or excluded (primarily those found in 4011(c)) in the proposed CCR Permit Program are not clear.", "Questions regarding the potential standard of protection intended to be achieved by state programs to regulate CCRs are also raised when the purpose of existing state programs to regulate MSW landfills is compared to the purpose of the proposed CCR Permit Program.

Once a state is implementing a permit program, EPA would have a role in states that fail to remedy program deficiencies, but the extent of EPA's role would depend on how EPA interprets its obligation to implement a permit program.", "EPA's authority with regard to state program elements found to be \"deficient\" involves the use of a term not found in the RCRA statute, and thus lacking a history of interpretation. It is difficult to anticipate how EPA would interpret this authority, but there appear to be at least three options:", "In the first and most limited option, EPA would implement only the deficient components of a state's program. Thus, EPA might implement part of the program while the state implements other parts of the program, as occurs in other elements of RCRA. Alternatively, EPA could implement the state's entire program, with the deficient components corrected. In a second interpretation (which might apply not only in cases of identified deficiencies but also where a state decides not to implement a program at all), EPA would promulgate its own program applicable to CCR structures. In this case, the agency's regulations would be required to consist of the Permit Program Specifications in Section 4011(c), as EPA interprets those specifications. A third interpretation envisions a more proactive role for EPA. In this interpretation, rather than wait to make decisions regarding deficiencies after the fact, the Administrator might issue guidance before the states implement their programs, informing the states in advance how to avoid having CCR Permit Program elements deemed deficient. Anticipating criticism that such guidance would constitute regulations in disguise, the Administrator might actually issue regulations, using her authority under Section 2002 of the existing RCRA statute, which allows her to \"prescribe, in consultation with Federal, State, and regional authorities, such regulations as are necessary to carry out [her] functions under this Act.\"", "In this third scenario, the need to interpret statutory provisions, coupled with the authorities already given to EPA in RCRA, might inadvertently create something like the agency's traditional regulatory role, rather than limiting it. In this regard, it may be worth noting that EPA has already\u2014in its June 2010 proposal\u2014done much of the work of writing such regulations or guidance: it has identified the CCR management practices that it wants to address, the standards it would set, and the time frames that it considers adequate for compliance. That work might be adapted to guide the process of identifying deficiencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Pursuant to RCRA Subtitle D, EPA has been required to promulgate regulations specific to certain types of waste disposal facilities. EPA and state agency roles in implementing and enforcing those regulations were largely established in RCRA's comprehensive amendments to the Solid Waste Disposal Act in 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. One set of regulations promulgated by EPA, the criteria applicable to MSW landfills, is in 40 C.F.R. Part 258. EPA's involvement in the creation of state programs to adopt, implement, and enforce those criteria evolved during the 1990s, but largely ended in the early 2000s, when state programs deemed adequate by EPA were in place in all U.S. states and territories. These now-mature state MSW programs reflect a variety of state approaches, but share common elements. For example, those programs have similarities with regard to the following:", "Regulations \u2014the federal MSW landfill criteria at 40 C.F.R. Part 258 are those EPA determined (as part of a public rulemaking process) are necessary to protect human health and the environment from risks specific to the management of MSW in landfills; baseline federal criteria were applied to owners and operators of regulated units within two years of EPA promulgating the regulations, regardless of when states adopted the regulations or created a permit program to implement them; many states used the federal regulatory criteria as a model for their own regulations, in most cases modifying existing programs to meet the federal criteria; individual state regulations applicable to MSW landfills could vary, as long as facility compliance with those regulations would meet the baseline federal level of protection. Permit programs \u2014state permit programs were intended to ensure facility compliance with regulations applicable to owners and operators of MSW landfills; state programs were approved by EPA based on its determination that they were adequate to ensure facility compliance (according to requirements specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 239); all states are currently implementing permit programs approved by EPA. Enforcement \u2014EPA could directly enforce the federal MSW landfill criteria in any state that EPA determined did not have an adequate permit program; EPA has never exercised its authority to directly enforce the federal criteria, but concern over the possibility that EPA could do so likely served as an incentive to states to adopt and implement permit programs that would be deemed adequate by EPA; EPA could potentially withdraw its approval of a state program, if EPA were to receive information indicating that the program is not being implemented as originally described by a state, but EPA has not done so.", "The bills considered in the 112 th Congress would use a fundamentally different framework to create state programs to regulate CCRs. The bills did not explicitly require EPA to set uniform national standards of protection or promulgate regulations applicable to CCR structures. In taking this unique approach, several questions are raised that cannot be answered until states begin to develop and implement their programs and EPA interprets its role as it would be described in the proposed bills:", "How would states interpret minimum program requirements and the MSW landfill criteria listed in the bills to promulgate regulations applicable to owners and operators of CCR structures? Given the flexibility the bills would have provided states to define what constitutes a CCR \"landfill,\" \"surface impoundment,\" or \"other land-based unit,\" to what specific \"CCR structures\" would state permit program conditions be applied? Would EPA issue guidance to clarify what it would consider a CCR \"structure\"? If so, how much would EPA's guidance influence states? To what extent would the bills result in states developing or revising requirements for CCR management that would go beyond current waste management requirements? When would owners and operators of CCR structures be subject to any new regulations? If a state were to promulgate new regulations, how would that state determine the level of protection that CCR structures would be required to meet? How would EPA interpret its obligation to identify program deficiencies? Would EPA identify a program as having a deficiency if EPA determined it was not adequate to ensure facility compliance with requirements necessary to protect human health? For example, would EPA identify as a deficiency a state's definition of a \"CCR landfill\" that EPA determined was insufficient to ensure that uses of CCRs that constitute disposal on land are regulated? When and how often would EPA identify program deficiencies? Would EPA review a program for adequacy immediately after a state certified that it had a program in place, or would it wait until years after? Would EPA make such determinations on an ongoing basis? Would EPA establish requirements (similar to 40 C.F.R. Part 239) or issue guidance to allow states to determine what EPA may identify as a program deficiency? Under a range of circumstances specified in the proposed bills, EPA would be required to implement a CCR Permit Program for a state. Given that directive, would EPA promulgate regulations applicable to CCR structures that it would then implement under those circumstances? If so, how much influence would EPA regulations have on a state's development of its own regulations? If EPA implemented a permit program for a state, what regulations would EPA implement\u2014its own or a state's? If EPA uses its own rules, how would the agency interpret permit program requirements that would otherwise be left to states to interpret (e.g., what constitutes a CCR structure or deadlines that existing CCR structures would be required to meet)? How would EPA use its existing general authorities under RCRA and the latitude provided in the bills to interpret Section 4011 in a way that it views as necessary to ensure the viability of the state programs?", "Some in Congress who have expressed concern that EPA has \"overreached\" its existing legislative mandates have supported legislation that would limit EPA's role in regulating CCR disposal while encouraging states to create programs to regulate the material according to conditions established in federal law (i.e., by creating a CCR Permit Program pursuant to proposed Section 4011). Supporters of this approach have suggested, given the unique conditions in each state, that such programs to regulate CCRs could be at least as effective as federal requirements that may be established by EPA under either regulatory option proposed in June 2010. Others counter that, given the potential gaps in existing state programs to regulate CCRs, a program that would continue to allow states flexibility to regulate CCR disposal as they deem necessary would not necessarily fill those gaps\u2014potentially allowing waste management practices identified by EPA as those posing a risk to human health to continue.", "In light of EPA's June 2010 proposal and uncertainty regarding the agency's future regulatory plans, it is likely that CCR legislation will be considered in the 113 th Congress. Congressional consideration of such legislation will occur in the context of ongoing concern about the impacts of current CCR facilities, changing economics for coal-fired electricity, and a range of perspectives about the appropriate role of states and EPA.", "Appendix A. Selected Authorities and Directives in\u00a0RCRA Relevant to CCR Management", "Any waste deemed nonhazardous or explicitly excluded from the Subtitle C requirements (such as CCRs) is subject to RCRA Subtitle D. In contrast to the directive and authorities provided to EPA to promulgate and enforce standards applicable to hazardous waste, Subtitle D established state and local governments as the primary regulating and implementing entities for the management of solid waste (i.e., household garbage and nonhazardous industrial solid waste).", "Under Subtitle D, states have the primary authority to implement and enforce standards applicable to the management of nonhazardous solid waste. EPA's role in regulating the management of nonhazardous solid wastes is, with certain exceptions, limited to promulgating criteria applicable to RCRA's prohibition on open dumping. That prohibition is enforceable by states or by citizens, pursuant to RCRA's citizen suit provisions. EPA's role regarding the open dumping prohibition was to promulgate regulations that contained criteria to distinguish between facilities that would be classified as \"sanitary landfills\" or \"open dumps.\" At a minimum, a facility would be deemed a sanitary landfill if solid waste disposal at such a facility posed no reasonable probability of adverse effects on health or the environment. Disposal facilities that did not meet the criteria for sanitary landfills would be considered open dumps, prohibited under Subtitle D.", "EPA's June 2010 Subtitle D option to promulgate standards applicable to owners and operators of landfills and surface impoundments that receive CCRs would be done pursuant to its existing authority under Subtitle D to promulgate criteria applicable to open dumping. Specifically, if finalized, the Subtitle D option would be implemented pursuant to EPA's authority under RCRA Section 4004 to identify criteria necessary to determining whether a facility should be classified as a \"sanitary landfill\" or an \"open dump.\" ", "In 1984, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA; P.L. 98-616) amended RCRA Subtitle D to\u2014add Section 4010 \"Adequacy of Certain Guidelines and Criteria\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a76949a); and amend the existing Section 4005, \"Upgrading of Open Dumps,\" to include Section 4005(c), \"Control of Hazardous Disposal\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a76945(c)). Pursuant to provisions in these sections, EPA promulgated the MSW landfill criteria (at 40 C.F.R. Part 258) and requirements necessary to determine the adequacy of state permit programs that implement those criteria (at 40 C.F.R. Part 239).", "The manner in which the federal MSW landfill criteria were adopted, implemented, and enforced by states illustrates the limitations to EPA's authority under Subtitle D to require states to adopt, implement, and enforce federal criteria applicable to owner/operators of facilities that receive waste other than MSW. Beyond its limited authority to directly enforce the MSW landfill criteria in states without an EPA-approved permit program, EPA is not authorized to regulate any other type of nonhazardous solid waste (such as CCRs). Instead, EPA may only expand upon the landfill criteria relevant to the state-enforced prohibition of open dumping. Further, EPA has no authority to require or approve/disapprove of state solid waste permit programs applicable to facilities receiving any other type of solid waste regulated under Subtitle D.", "Provisions in RCRA that prescribe EPA and state authorities to promulgate, implement, and/or enforce requirements broadly applicable to the management of nonhazardous solid waste are identified and summarized in Table A -1 .", "Determining Criteria Necessary to \"Protect Human Health and the Environment\" Under RCRA", "Under RCRA, when Congress has required EPA to promulgate regulations applicable to solid waste disposal facilities and required those regulation to be implemented using a permit program, at a minimum, those standards have been explicitly required to be those necessary to protect human health and the environment from threats specific to a particular type of waste disposal facility or units that may receive a particular type of waste. Regulatory criteria that meet that directive have been identified in the more than 30 years that EPA has gone through the public rulemaking process. With regard to waste management, necessary protections involve the identification of various factors, including, but not limited to", "common methods of managing the waste\u2014such as in a landfill or surface impoundment pond; analysis of toxic constituents\u2014this step involves waste characterizations to identify constituents likely in the waste that may cause harm to humans, such as heavy metals; potential pathways of human exposure\u2014the presence of toxic constituents alone is not relevant if they cannot reach humans (or the environment); pathways of exposure may include potential release to air or to water from precipitation run-on/runoff across the disposal site, or contaminant leaching to surface water or groundwater at levels that could lead to drinking water exceeding maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) established under the Safe Drinking Water Act; potential protective measures\u2014waste management practices identified as those that may minimize human exposure to toxins below a standard specified according to federal law; such practices have included a requirement that composite liners be used at the site of deposition.", "In gathering this information, EPA must rely on data provided by states and the potentially regulated industry. Much of what EPA knows now about what constitutes waste management criteria necessary to protect human health has been gleaned from the process to determine criteria applicable to hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs) and for MSW landfills. Final regulations represent the \"minimum national standard\" applicable to waste disposal facilities that, when implemented, would be expected to would achieve the standard of protection set in statute.", "EPA considers risk to be the chance of harmful effects to human health or to ecological systems resulting from exposure to an environmental stressor. A stressor is any physical, chemical, or biological entity that can induce an adverse response. Stressors may adversely affect specific natural resources or entire ecosystems, including plants and animals, as well as the environment with which they interact. EPA uses risk assessments to characterize the nature and magnitude of health risks to humans (e.g., residents, workers, recreational visitors) and ecological receptors (e.g., birds, fish, wildlife) from chemical contaminants and other stressors that may be present in the environment.", "Waste Management Criteria That Meet a Federal Performance Standard", "Pursuant to a directive from Congress, the federal regulatory criteria applicable to MSW landfills were designed to \"protect human health and the environment\" from risks specific to the management of municipal solid waste in a landfill (see information included under \"RCRA Section 4010a; 42 U.S.C. \u00a76949a, Adequacy of certain guidelines and criteria,\" listed in Table A -1 ). Promulgated in 1991, those federal criteria (in 40 C.F.R. Part 258) have since been adopted and implemented by individual states. ", "In its June 2010 proposal to regulate CCRs, standards included in EPA's Subtitle D option were designed to meet the standard of protection established by Congress for sanitary landfills (requirements included under 40 C.F.R. Part 257). To meet that standard of protection, EPA's proposed standards applicable to CCR landfills and surface impoundments were designed to be those that would pose \"no reasonable probability of adverse effects on health or the environment from disposal of solid waste at such facility\" (see information included under \"\u00a76944(a), Criteria for sanitary landfills,\" listed in Table A -1 ). In establishing that Subtitle D option, EPA drew largely from the existing MSW landfill criteria. However, those existing criteria would not address all risks specific to the management of CCRs in landfills and surface impoundments. ", "To recognize the differences between the existing MSW landfill criteria and EPA's proposed standards for CCR disposal units, Table A-2 compares each set of criteria. Listed under each column are individual requirements specifying general compliance standards (statements of purpose and scope, facility compliance deadlines, and program definitions) and regulatory criteria detailing location restrictions, operating criteria, design criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure and post-closure care, and financial assurance. When individual requirements are largely similar, only the regulatory heading is included. When there is a significant difference between two requirements, additional information is provided to clarify that difference. Those descriptions are not intended to summarize the full range of detail in each requirement. ", "The most significant differences pertain to the potential regulation of surface impoundments. For example, requirements that would provide protections specific to the disposal of liquids are not included in Part 258 because bulk disposal of liquids is prohibited in MSW landfills. In comparison, EPA's June 2010 Subtitle D proposal includes various requirements intended to address issues unique to the management of CCRs, particularly the accumulation of liquids in surface impoundments and with regard to both the higher potential risk of a catastrophic release associated with a structural failure and contaminant leaching from those units. ", "For an example of the level of detail included in regulatory criteria, as well as an example of a requirement that EPA determined was necessary ensure that management of CCRs in surface impoundment would pose no reasonable probability of adverse effects on health or the environment, Table A-3 lists EPA's proposed \"Design criteria for new CCR surface impoundments and lateral expansions\" at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7257.72.", "As an example of the level of detail provided in regulatory criteria, Table A-3 lists EPA's \"Design criteria for new CCR surface impoundments and lateral expansions\" at proposed 40 C.F.R. \u00a7257.72. As discussed in the section \" Proposed EPA Standards to Address Risks Specific\u00a0to\u00a0CCR\u00a0Management ,\" in EPA's assessment, the CCR damage cases and EPA's quantitative groundwater risk assessment show the need for effective liners\u2014namely composite liners\u2014to significantly reduce the probability of adverse effects. The proposed Subtitle D design standards would require that new landfills and all surface impoundments that have not completed closure prior to the effective date of the rule, can only continue to operate if composite liners and leachate collection and removal systems have been installed. Units would be required to be retrofitted with a liner or closed within five years of the effective date of the final rule. That is the same time frame EPA proposed under its Subtitle C alternative. EPA also proposed to require the same liner and leachate collection and removal systems as part of the Subtitle D criteria as those being proposed under its Subtitle C option. EPA noted that the technical justification for the requirements is equally applicable to the wastes and surface impoundment, irrespective of the statutory authority under which the requirement is proposed.", "Appendix B. Requirements in 40 C.F.R. Part 239 and Comparable Program Elements in the Amendment to RCRA Proposed in the 112 th Congress", "The State Implementation Rule (SIR), or Requirements for State Permit Program Determination of Adequacy at 40 C.F.R.

An adequate program was one that EPA determined could ensure regulated facility compliance with the MSW landfill criteria. The requirements list the detailed information that states were required to provide to EPA, as well as the authorities, activities, and procedures a state would have to demonstrate that they had in place, before EPA would approve a state program as adequate to enforce the federal MSW landfill criteria.", "Listed below are provisions included in the bills proposed in the 112 th Congress that appear to be drawn from the requirements included in 40 C.F.R.

Potential differences in program implementation can be seen when statutory requirements that would apply to a CCR Permit Program are compared to the regulatory requirements applicable to the permit program to implement the MSW landfill criteria at 40 C.F.R.

Proposed definitions comparable to those in 40 C.F.R. Part 239 are those for \"coal combustion residuals permit program\" and \"permit.\" The applicability of a CCR Permit Program would also depend on the definition of a \"structure\" (at proposed Section 4011(k)(6)), which would mean a landfill, surface impoundment, or other land-based unit which may receive CCRs, but would not include any land-based unit that receives only de minimis quantities of CCRs.", "Appendix C. RCRA Provisions and EPA Responses Related to Directives in the \"Bevill Amendment\"", "As required under Subtitle C, EPA first proposed hazardous waste management regulations in 1978. In these proposed regulations, EPA identified six categories of wastes it deemed \"special wastes\" that would be deferred from hazardous waste management requirements until further study and assessment could be completed to determine their risk to human health and the environment. These special wastes were identified because they typically were generated in large volumes and, at the time, were believed to pose less risk to human health and the environment than the wastes being identified for regulation as hazardous waste.", "In the months before the hazardous waste regulations were finalized in 1980, Congress was debating RCRA reauthorization. In February 1980, Representative Tom Bevill introduced an amendment to the pending legislation that would require EPA to defer the imposition of hazardous waste regulatory requirements for fossil fuel combustion waste until data regarding its potential hazard to human health or the environment could be determined. Representative Bevill stated that EPA's intent to regulate such waste as hazardous would discourage the use of coal and constitute an unnecessary burden on the utility industry. In anticipation of the enactment of this legislation, according to EPA, the agency excluded the regulation of fossil fuel combustion waste from its final hazardous waste regulations.", "Ultimately, the Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980 (P.L. 96-482) included provisions commonly referred to as the \"Bevill Amendment\" or the \"Bevill exclusion.\" Under those provisions Congress specifically excluded CCRs from regulation under RCRA Subtitle C, pending EPA's completion of a report to Congress and regulatory determination on whether hazardous waste regulations were warranted. Pursuant to that directive, EPA was required to conduct a comprehensive study and submit to Congress a report on the adverse effects on human health and the environment related to the disposal and utilization of wastes and other byproduct materials generated primarily from the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels, including an analysis of", "the source and volumes of such material generated per year; present disposal and utilization practices; potential danger, if any, to human health and the environment from the disposal and reuse of such materials; documented cases in which danger to human health or the environment from surface runoff or leachate has been proved; alternatives to current disposal methods; the costs of such alternatives; the impact of those alternatives on the use of coal and other natural resources; and the current and potential utilization of such materials.", "Further, as it deemed appropriate, EPA was required to review studies and other actions of other federal and state agencies regarding the material and invite participation by other concerned parties, including industry, with a view toward avoiding duplication of effort.", "Both legislative and administrative actions regarding the potential regulation of CCRs, particularly EPA action taken in response to the Bevill directive and more recent action taken in the wake of the Kingston release, are summarized in Table C-1 .", "In March 2000, EPA submitted its \"Regulatory Determination on Wastes from Fossil Fuel Combustion\" to the White House Office of Management and Budget, for review. In this March draft, EPA determined that CCRs warranted regulation under Subtitle C when land disposed (e.g., managed in landfills or surface impoundments). Further, EPA stated that it was considering developing national management standards that would include a contingent hazardous waste listing of CCRs under Subtitle C. That is, when the waste was managed in accordance with EPA standards, they would not be classified as hazardous waste. When improperly managed (e.g., disposed of in an unlined surface impoundment) the wastes would become a listed hazardous waste subject to tailored Subtitle C standards.", "EPA recognized that its March 2000 proposal was a departure from previous opinions regarding the management of CCRs. EPA's determination that CCRs warranted regulation as hazardous waste was based, in part, on data from damage cases that showed the potential threat to human health and the environment when the waste was managed in a way that lacked basic environmental control (e.g., disposal in units with no liner or groundwater monitoring). Additionally, EPA cited new data that identified significant risks for the waste to leach arsenic, including risk to human health associated with agricultural uses of coal ash a substitute for lime.", "In May 2000, after review by OMB, EPA issued a revised regulatory determination that stated its intent to leave the Bevill exclusion in place. However, EPA stated that it was convinced that national regulations under Subtitle D were warranted for CCR disposal in landfills and surface impoundments because", "1. the composition of the waste had the potential to present danger to human health and the environment in certain circumstances; 2. EPA had identified proven cases of damages to human health and the environment through improper waste management; 3. while industry management practices had improved measurably, there was sufficient evidence the wastes were being managed in a significant number of landfills and surface impoundments without proper controls in place, particularly in the area of groundwater monitoring; and 4. while there had been substantive improvements in state regulatory programs, EPA identified significant gaps either in states' regulatory authorities or in their exercise of existing authorities.", "Further, citing its concern regarding the potential mismanagement and inconsistent state regulation of CCRs, EPA stated that it would revise its determination if it found that a need for regulation under Subtitle C was warranted. EPA's June 2010 proposal reflects the agency's revised determination."], "subsections": []}]}}
