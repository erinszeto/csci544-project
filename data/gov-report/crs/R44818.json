Under H.R. 1181, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) would be prohibited from determining any beneficiary for whom a fiduciary is appointed, because he or she \"lacks the capacity to contract or handle his or her own affairs,\" as \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for the purposes of gun control, unless a magistrate or judicial authority also rules that the beneficiary is a danger to himself or herself or others.", "Pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, 1993 (Brady Act; P.L. 103-159), since 1998, the VA has provided records on beneficiaries for whom a fiduciary has been appointed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Pursuant to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA; P.L. 110-180), the VA was required to notify beneficiaries of the ramifications of mental incompetency determinations and a potential loss of their gun rights, as well as provide those beneficiaries with an avenue of administrative relief, by which they could appeal such determinations and have their rights restored. In the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), Congress included a provision that codified certain VA procedures related to mental incompetency determinations and potential loss of gun rights.", "Since 2008, however, the legislative history also shows that some Members of Congress have viewed those VA procedures, even after the implementation of NIAA provisions, as inadequate. From the 110th through the 113th Congresses, proposals similar to H.R. 1181 were reported from committee, passed either the House or Senate, or both. In the 114th Congress, related amendments were considered, but not passed, on the Senate floor in the wake of mass shooting incidents in December 2015 in San Bernardino, CA, and in June 2016 in Orlando, FL. In the 115th Congress, moreover, a measure was passed that vacated a final rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) in December 2016 that would have established parallel but different procedures for Social Security disability programs and NICS referrals (P.L. 115-8). Under the vacated rule, SSA disability beneficiaries who were appointed a \"representative payee\" to handle their day-to-day affairs and whose disability could be tied to a mental impairment would have been referred to the FBI for inclusion in NICS.", "According to the FBI, as of December 31, 2016, federal departments and agencies had contributed 173,083 records in the NICS index \"adjudicated mental health\" file, of which the VA contributed 167,815 (98.1%). Supporters of H.R. 1181 view the existing VA procedures as an incongruity in the law. They ask why the VA is the only federal department or agency that has made substantial numbers of NICS referrals to the FBI based on mental incompetency determinations, even though other federal agencies that provide similar disability and income security benefits have not done so. In their opinion, this seeming incongruity calls into question whether the VA benefit claims and disability rating procedures are substantive enough on their own to justify the taking of a constitutionally enumerated right like the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Opponents of H.R. 1181 contend that the VA has complied with the Brady Act and NIAA and that public safety is enhanced by its NICS referrals to the FBI. They contend further that the VA procedures act to protect VA beneficiaries from the harm that might result if they acquired firearms and used them improperly due to reasons possibly related to their mental incompetency.

Under the Attorney General's delegated authority, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) established NICS and through this system the permanent background check provisions of the Brady Act became operational on November 30, 1998. Through NICS, federally licensed gun dealers (otherwise known as federal firearms licensees, or FFLs) initiate background checks through NICS on any customers who are not federally licensed gun dealers, before transferring a firearm to him or her. Through NICS, such checks query other government computer databases for criminal history and other public records on an unlicensed customer that could indicate that he or she is ineligible to receive, possess, ship, or transport a firearm under federal state, local, tribal, or territorial law. ", "Under the Brady Act, Congress also authorized the Attorney General to secure from any federal department or agency information on any person whose receipt or possession of firearms would violate the GCA. To implement such information sharing, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) promulgated a regulation and defined the term \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" to include any person whom a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority has determined that, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease:", "is a danger to himself or herself, or others; lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his or her own affairs; is found insane by a court in a criminal case; or is found incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility, pursuant to certain provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.", "Since 1998, the VA has been providing records to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS Index on beneficiaries for whom a fiduciary (a person selected to manage veteran's benefits) has been appointed by the VA on his or her behalf, because the appointment of a fiduciary is based on a VA determination that the beneficiary is \"mentally incompetent\" under veterans law. Based on this VA determination, the beneficiary is also considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" under the GCA, because he or she \"lacks the mental capacity to contract or handle their own affairs.\"", "Under such circumstances, a VA disability rating specialist notifies the benefits claimant that the VA proposes to \"rate\" them \"mentally incompetent,\" at which point the claimant can request a hearing and submit evidence to the contrary if he or she wishes. The VA also advises the beneficiary regarding his or her right to appeal any final rating regarding the veteran's ability to receive and manage his or her own VA benefits. ", "For a time, however, the VA did not always inform the benefits claimant of the consequences of the mental incompetency determination with regard to his or her firearms eligibility under federal law. Notwithstanding the VA mental incompetency appeals procedures described above, until 2007, avenues of administrative relief by which a VA beneficiary deemed mentally incompetent could petition to have his or her gun rights restored were narrow, if not nonexistent. ", "Pursuant to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA; P.L. 110-180 ), the VA has been required to notify beneficiaries of the ramifications of mental incompetency determinations and a potential loss of their gun rights. The act also required the VA to provide those beneficiaries with an avenue of administrative relief, by which they could appeal such determinations and have their rights restored. In the 21 st Century Cures Act ( P.L. 114-255 ), Congress included provisions that codified certain VA procedures related to mental incompetency determinations and potential loss of gun rights. ", "Since 2008, however, the legislative history shows that some Members of Congress have viewed the VA procedures as inadequate. They particularly take issue with tying firearms ineligibility under the ATF definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" solely to an individual's incapacity \"to contract or manage his [or her] own affairs.\" From the 110 th through the 113 th Congresses, proposals similar to H.R. 1181 were reported from committee, passed either the House or Senate, or both.

Members of the House of Representatives made several arguments for and against H.R. 1181 . The discussion below reflects the debate on H.R. 1181 on the House floor on March 16, 2017.", "Supporters of H.R. 1181 maintain that the existing VA benefit claims and disability rating procedures are not substantive enough on their own to justify the taking of a constitutionally enumerated right like the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Supporters of H.R. 1181 underscore that the VA procedures are unbalanced, because the VA merely has to show that the beneficiary is \"mentally incompetent\" because he or she lacks the mental capacity to contract or handle his or her own affairs; yet, to regain his or her Second Amendment rights, the beneficiary must demonstrate to the VA that he or she is not a threat to himself or herself, or others. In other words, the bar for the beneficiary to regain his or her gun rights is much higher than for the initial VA mental incompetency determination.", "Opponents of H.R. 1181 counter that the VA has complied with the Brady Act and NIAA and that public safety is enhanced by its NICS referrals to the FBI. Opponents note that Congress seconded the VA procedures by codifying them in P.L. 114-255 . They contend that the VA procedures act to protect VA beneficiaries from the harm that might result if they acquired firearms and used them improperly due to reasons possibly related to their mental incompetency. To support this argument, they point to two factors: the gun-related suicide rate among veterans and the number of seriously mentally ill among VA beneficiaries who have been determined to be mentally incompetent. Some opponents of H.R. 1181 also contend that the bill's provisions are retrospective, meaning the VA and FBI would be required to remove all existing VA referrals from NICS, possibly allowing seriously mentally ill VA beneficiaries to have future access to firearms.", "Supporters of H.R. 1181 agree that there could be VA beneficiaries who have been determined to be mentally incompetent who are also seriously mentally ill, but they maintain that the bill's provisions are only prospective. For future determinations and NICS referrals, however, supporters of H.R. 1181 maintain that even seriously mentally ill beneficiaries would need to be found a danger to themselves or others based on a ruling by a magistrate or other judicial authority. They argue further that the existing VA procedures stigmatize the mentally ill disproportionately as perpetrators of criminal violence, when some research indicates that the mentally ill are more likely to be the victims of crime.", "If enacted, H.R. 1181 might raise several oversight issues for Congress because the Attorney General would still be required to secure prohibiting records from federal departments and agencies under the Brady Act and NIAA. For example, would the VA be obligated to establish an administrative process whereby beneficiaries who lacked the mental capacity to contract or handle their day-to-day affairs would also be evaluated to determine whether they were a danger to themselves or others? If the bill's provisions are retrospective, would the VA be obligated to cull through its existing NICS referrals to determine who among those beneficiaries should have their cases placed before a \"magistrate or judicial authority\" based on the grounds that they likely pose a danger to themselves or others? What precedent and expectations would the enactment of H.R. 1181 set for SSA and any other federal agencies that provide disability benefits?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NICS and Firearms Ineligibility", "paragraphs": ["Through NICS, FFLs initiate a background check by contacting either the FBI or a state or local agency serving as a point of contact (POC).

On this form the intending customer attests that he or she is not a prohibited person and that he or she are who they say they are. The FFL attests that it has examined government-issued identification documents, verifying that the intending customer has completely and properly recorded his or her identity, address, and other biographical information based on those identification documents. By signing the ATF Form 4473, both the FFL and intending customer attest that all the information is truthful.

Since FY1993, however, a policy rider attached to ATF annual appropriations for salaries and expenses has prohibited the expenditure of any funding provided under that account on processing such petitions. While a prohibited person arguably could petition the Attorney General, bypassing ATF, it appears that such an alternative has never been successfully tested. As a result, the only way a person can reacquire his or her lost firearms eligibility is to have his or her civil rights restored or disqualifying criminal record(s) expunged or set aside, or to be pardoned for his crime.

These transactions amounted to over 167.5 million background checks for either firearms transfers or state-issued licenses and permits and resulted in over 2.5 million initial denials. Some of these denials were later overturned on appeal. In 2014, for example, about one-third of denials by the NICS Section were appealed and about one-in-seven of those appealed denials were overturned.", "Over the 16-year period, the NICS Section alone completed nearly 93.5 million background checks for firearms transfers and state-issued licenses and permits, resulting in nearly 1.17 million initial denials, or 1.2% of total checks for those years.

In calendar year 2014, for example, the NICS Section conducted nearly 8.3 million background checks, resulting in 90,895 denials: of these denials, about 3,557 denials were based on mental health involuntary commitments or adjudications, or 3.9% of total denials. For the same calendar year, 2014, state and local agencies serving as POCs conducted over 6.7 million checks, resulting in 102,468 denials: of these denials, 3,134 were based on mental health involuntary commitments or adjudications, 3.1% of total denials.

These discussions were largely led by the ATF, the agency principally responsible for administering and enforcing federal gun control laws. On June 27, 1997, the ATF promulgated a final rule defining the following terms:", "\"Adjudicated as a mental defective\" includes a determination by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence or a mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease, (1) is a danger to himself or others, or (2) lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs. The term also includes (1) a finding of insanity by a court in a criminal case and (2) those persons found incompetent to stand trial or found not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to articles 50a and 72b of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C.

In a proposed rulemaking, the ATF opined that the inclusion of \"mentally incompetent\" VA beneficiaries in the definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective,\" under the clause that a beneficiary \"lacks the mental capacity to contract or handle his [or her] own affairs,\" was wholly consistent with the legislative history of the GCA. In compliance with the GCA, as amended by the Brady Act, and the ATF definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective,\" the VBA provided the FBI with disqualifying records on 88,898 VA beneficiaries for the November 1998 implementation of NICS.", "Under VA procedures, an individual is considered \"mentally incompetent\" if he or she lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his or her own affairs for reasons related to injury or disease. And, after 1998, these beneficiaries also fell under the definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" under the administrative definition promulgated by ATF described above. Traditionally, the VA had used such determinations of mental incompetence as a basis for appointing a fiduciary to receive and manage a beneficiary's VA benefits. According to the VA, during the determination process beneficiaries were notified that VA proposed to rate them \"incompetent\" and that they were able to request a hearing and submit evidence to the contrary if they wished. The VA also advised these beneficiaries regarding their right to appeal any final rating regarding their ability to receive and manage their own VA benefits. The VA, however, did not necessarily inform a beneficiary that he or she would lose his or her gun rights as a consequence of a VA determination of mental incompetency. Nor were the beneficiaries informed of the subsequent VA referrals to the FBI NICS Section. ", "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has not, with any known frequency, submitted any disqualifying records on VA medical care recipients to the FBI for inclusion in NICS for any medical/psychiatric reason such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although veterans with PTSD or any other condition, who have been involuntarily committed under a state court order to a VA medical facility because they posed a danger to themselves or others, are ineligible to ship, transport, receive, or possess a firearm or ammunition under federal law, the VHA does not appear to make a related referral about that ineligibility to the FBI. Instead, the state in which the court resides may submit the disqualifying record to the FBI, if such a submission would be appropriate and permissible under state law.", "Nevertheless, the decision by the VA to submit VBA records on \"mentally incompetent\" veterans to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS mental defective file generated some degree of controversy in 1999 and 2000. Critics of this policy underscored that veterans routinely consented to \"mentally incompetent\" determinations so that a fiduciary could be appointed for them. Those critics contended that to take away a veteran's Second Amendment rights without his foreknowledge was improper. At that time, they also pointed out that no other federal agencies were providing similar disqualifying records to the FBI. VA spokespersons countered that they were required by law [the Brady Act] to provide those records to FBI and that the VA process for making mental incompetency determinations was not \"haphazard.\" This controversy eventually subsided, only to re-emerge when Congress considered NIAA in 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007", "paragraphs": ["In April 2007, a lone assailant armed with two pistols shot to death 32 individuals and nonfatally wounded another 17, before shooting himself to death at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, VA. Due to his disturbing on-campus behavior, the assailant had previously been evaluated by health care professionals and ordered by a judge to undergo \"outpatient\" mental health treatment, because he was deemed to be a threat to himself or others. At that time, however, Virginia state law only referred the subjects of \"inpatient\" court orders for such treatment to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS index. Following this mass shooting, the Virginia governor, now-Senator Timothy Kaine, reviewed the state statute and determined that henceforward subjects of either court-ordered inpatient or outpatient mental health care under such circumstances would be referred to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS index.", "In response to the Virginia Tech mass shooting, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA). This act includes provisions designed to encourage states to make available to the Attorney General certain records related to persons who are disqualified from acquiring firearms, particularly disqualifying records related to mental health adjudications, as well as domestic violence misdemeanor convictions and restraining orders. To accomplish this, the act establishes a framework of incentives and disincentives whereby the Attorney General is authorized to either waive a grant match requirement or reduce a law enforcement assistance grant depending upon a state's compliance with the act's goals of bringing such firearms-related disqualifying records online. ", "Among some gun rights advocates, however, opposition to the NIAA arose based on the assertion that, under these amendments, any veteran who was or had been diagnosed with PTSD and was found to be a \"danger to himself or others would have his gun rights taken away ... forever.\" Members of Congress included a provision in NIAA that required agencies to inform a claimant beforehand that they could lose their gun rights and privileges if they are found to be mentally incompetent as a condition of a benefit program's administration and eligibility. In addition, as under the state grant provisions, NIAA required those referring agencies to establish a firearms disabilities relief program, whereby any individual referred to the NICS index for reasons related to mental incompetency would be able to petition to have his or her gun rights and privileges restored, if and when he or she had overcome the incapacities that led to the initial finding.", "The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has awarded $109.8 million in NICS improvement grants to state and local governments from FY2009 through FY2016.

To advance these efforts, the ATF promulgated a regulation defining the term, \"adjudicated as a mental defective.\" As discussed above, this definition was developed in consultation with the VA, and was reviewed by then Attorney General Janet Reno's Department of Justice. The existing VA benefit claims and disability ratings procedures for making \"mental incompetency\" determinations based on the need to appoint a fiduciary for a beneficiary were deemed substantive enough to consider a person \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" under the GCA. During the FBI's initial rollout of NICS, the SSA reviewed its procedures and decided they were not substantive enough to justify making mental incompetency determinations for the purposes of gun control.

The SSA rule would have not only based the mental incompetence determination on an inability to handle one's day-to-day affairs, but would have also tied that determination to certain diagnosed mental impairments. In addition, the SSA rule would have also placed lower and upper age limits on those determinations for the purposes of NICS referrals. Consequently, the SSA final rule would not have been as inclusive as the VA benefit claims and disability rating procedures, possibly calling into question whether the VA procedures were overly inclusive. Nonetheless, the SSA final rule did not address whether such beneficiaries also demonstrated that they were a danger to themselves or others.

Under H.R. 1181 , the VA could still be obligated to make such determinations as part of its benefit claims and disability ratings procedures. If so, would the VA be required to establish new policies and procedures, under which cases for final mental incompetency determinations for the purposes of gun control would be placed before a \"magistrate or judicial official\"? In addition, if the provisions of H.R. 1181 are retrospective, could the VA also be required to cull through all its active NICS referrals and submit administrative cases against some, but not all, of those beneficiaries to a \"magistrate or judicial official\" on the grounds that they could be a threat to themselves or others? ", "These circumstances also call into question what obligations the SSA might still have, if any, under the GCA in light of the recently vacated final rule and the possible enactment of H.R. 1181 . Should the VA and SSA place such mental incompetency determination cases for the purposes of gun control before the same adjudicative body? Would they have parallel administrative processes, and common adjudicative bodies that handle similar mental incompetency cases? Or would the VA and SSA have separate processes and adjudicative bodies? Or would they take those cases to state and local magistrates and judicial officials to adjudicate?

For example, how would those departments and agencies handle mental incompetency determinations for the purposes of gun control? It is unclear what either set of requirements, the existing VA procedures or the possible enactment of H.R. 1181 , could mean for state and local governments that have submitted, or would submit, records on persons deemed too mentally incompetent to be trusted with a firearm. If the VA procedures stand or H.R. 1181 is enacted, the Attorney General might be called to set expectations in terms of guidance for state and local governments, especially absent any state laws governing the referral of such records to the FBI for inclusion on the NICS Index. For now, there appears to be a lack of consensus about the type and severity of mental incompetence or mental illness that ought to be the basis for including a prohibiting record on an individual in a nationwide information sharing platform like the NICS Index for the purposes of gun control."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.

Furthermore, although beneficiaries are entitled to a hearing once notified that it is proposed they will be determined incompetent, the initial hearing is before VA personnel, not an independent authority. From the date of the initial request of the Attorney General through October, 2007, VA has shared information with NICS on over 116,000 individuals for whom it has appointed a fiduciary. VA was unable to provide the Committee with updated information about how many additional names have been added or removed from NICS since October 2007.

We believe adequate protections can be provided to these Veterans under current statutory authority. Under the [National Instant Criminal Background Check System] NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, individuals whom VA has determined to be incompetent can have their firearms rights restored in two ways: First, a person who has been adjudicated by VA as unable to manage his or her own affairs can reopen the issue based on new evidence and have the determination reversed. When this occurs, VA is obligated to notify the Department of Justice to remove the individual's name from the roster of those barred from possessing and purchasing firearms. Second, even if a person remains adjudicated incompetent by VA for purposes of handling his or her own finances, he or she is entitled to petition VA to have firearms rights restored on the basis that the individual poses no threat to public safety. VA has relief procedures in place, and we are fully committed to continuing to conduct these procedures in a timely and effective manner to fully protect the rights of our beneficiaries.", "Also, the reliance on an administrative incompetency determination as a basis for prohibiting an individual from possessing or obtaining firearms under Federal law is not unique to VA or Veterans. Under the applicable Federal regulations implementing the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, any person determined by a lawful authority to lack the mental capacity to manage his or her own affairs is subject to the same prohibition. By exempting certain VA mental health determinations that would otherwise prohibit a person from possessing or obtaining firearms under Federal law, the bill would create a different standard for Veterans and their survivors than that applicable to the rest of the population and could raise public safety issues.", "During Senate consideration of the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 ( S. 649 ), language regarding veterans and firearms was included in amendments offered by Senators Joe Manchin and Patrick Toomey, Senator Charles Grassley, and Senator Burr.

The Manchin-Toomey amendment was rejected by a recorded vote: 54-46 (Record Vote Number: 97).", "Alternatively, the Grassley amendment ( S.Amdt. 725 ), which was commonly referred to as the \"GOP substitute,\" would have substituted the term \"mentally incompetent\" in both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(d) and (g), in lieu of \"adjudicated as a mental defective,\" and would have amended the GCA to define \"has been adjudicated mentally incompetent or has been committed to a psychiatric hospital,\" \"order or finding,\" and \"psychiatric hospital.\" These definitions and other language would have arguably narrowed the scope of whom, and under what circumstances, a federal agency like the VA could refer a record on an individual to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS mental defective file. If enacted, this amendment might have required the VA to revise its policies and procedures with regard to NICS referrals, because a narrower scope of mentally incompetent veterans would have probably fallen under this definition than does today under the current mental defective definition. It is also questionable whether the amendment would have had wide effect on state procedures, because a thorough, published review and comparison of state NICS referral procedures on mentally incompetent persons has not been conducted by DOJ or any other federal agency. Arguably, few states, if any, have adopted administrative procedures that would match the scope of the VA administrative procedures with regard to mental incompetency and NICS referrals.
