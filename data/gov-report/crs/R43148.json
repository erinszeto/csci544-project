Application of these technologies enabled natural gas to be economically produced from shale and other unconventional formations and contributed to the United States becoming the world's largest natural gas producer in 2009. Use of these technologies has also contributed to the rise in U.S. oil production over the last few years. In 2009, annual oil production increased over 2008, the first annual rise since 1991, and has continued to increase each year since. Between January 2008 and May 2014, U.S. monthly crude oil production rose by 3.2 million barrels per day, with about 85% of the increase coming from shale and related tight oil formations in Texas and North Dakota. Other tight oil plays are also being developed, helping raise the prospect of energy independence, especially for North America.", "The rapid expansion of tight oil and shale gas extraction using high-volume hydraulic fracturing has raised concerns about its potential environmental and health impacts. These concerns include potential direct impacts to groundwater and surface water quality, water supplies, and air quality. In addition, some have raised concerns about potential long-term and indirect impacts from reliance on fossil fuels and resulting greenhouse gas emissions and influence on broader energy economics. This report focuses mainly on actions related to controlling potential direct impacts.", "States are the primary regulators of oil and gas production on non-federal lands. In recent years, many oil and gas producing states have revised laws and regulations governing oil and gas production in response to changes in production practices as producers have expanded into tight oil, shale gas, and other unconventional hydrocarbon formations. However, state rules vary considerably, leading to calls for more federal oversight of unconventional oil and gas extraction activities and hydraulic fracturing specifically.", "Provisions of several federal environmental laws can apply to certain activities related to oil and gas production, and proposals to expand federal regulation in this area have been highly controversial. Some advocates of a larger federal role point to a wide range of differences among state regulatory regimes and argue that a national framework is needed to ensure a consistent minimum level of protection for surface and groundwater resources and air quality. Others argue against more federal involvement and point to the long-established state oil and natural gas regulatory programs, regional differences in geology and water resources, and concern over regulatory redundancy.", "The federal role in regulating oil and gas extraction activities\u2014and hydraulic fracturing, in particular\u2014has been the subject of considerable debate and legislative proposals for several years, but legislation has not been enacted.

The techniques developed to produce shale gas\u2014directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing \u2014have migrated to the oil sector. The United States is the third-largest oil producer in the world but also the fastest-growing producer. The United States surpassed Russia in 2009 as the world's largest natural gas producer.

It does not address other types of unconventional production such as coalbed methane or tight gas, as their contributions to overall U.S. production have not changed as dramatically as shale gas. There has been continued congressional interest related to unconventional natural gas and oil production. In March 2015, the House Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources held a hearing addressing the new Bureau of Land Management (BLM) hydraulic fracturing rule. Among actions in the 113 th Congress, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held three roundtable discussions on natural gas supply and use ; the House Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on hydraulic fracturing legislation and the BLM proposed rule; and the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Power held a hearing in June 2013 on U.S. energy abundance.

The shales and rocks are both the source of and the reservoir for oil and natural gas, unlike conventional petroleum reservoirs. The Society of Petroleum Engineers describes \"unconventional resources\" as petroleum accumulations that are pervasive throughout a large area and are not significantly affected by pressure exerted by water (hydrodynamic influences); they are also called \"continuous-type deposits\" or \"tight formations.\" In contrast, conventional oil and natural gas deposits occur in porous and permeable sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Under pressure exerted by water, the hydrocarbons migrated upward from organic sources until an impermeable cap-rock (such as shale) trapped it in the reservoir rock. Although the unconventional formations may be as porous as other sedimentary reservoir rocks, their extremely small pore sizes and lack of permeability make them relatively resistant to hydrocarbon flow. The lack of permeability means that the oil and gas typically remain in the source rock unless natural or artificial fractures occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Price Drives Industrial Innovation", "paragraphs": ["Historically, natural gas prices in the United States have been volatile. From 1995 to 1999, the spot price of natural gas averaged $2.23 per million British thermal units (MBtu, sometimes noted as mmBtu) but increased to an average price of $4.68 per MBtu, in nominal dollars, during the 2000-2004 period, an almost 110% rise. Prices hit a peak in December 2005 at $15.38 per MBtu but remained relatively high through July 2008, as can be seen in Figure 2 . Along with the rise in prices, U.S. net imports of natural gas also rose, increasing 32% between 1995 and 2000 and 41% between 1995 and 2007.", "As U.S. prices and imports continued to trend up, the industry undertook two competing solutions to meet the need for more natural gas\u2014increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports and development of techniques to produce shale gas. The LNG import facilities were much higher profile and were cited extensively in industry and popular press. Approximately 50 import projects were proposed, and 8 were eventually constructed during the mid- to late 2000s, along with the recommissioning of older facilities. ", "Although horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have been industry techniques for some time, their application to shale gas formations is relatively new. Advances in directional drilling, particularly steerable down-hole motors, allowed drilling operators to better keep the well bore in the hydrocarbon-bearing shale formations. Well stimulation was also required, and improvements in hydraulic fracturing techniques, particularly multistage hydraulic fracturing and the ability to better control the fractures, contributed to making shale gas production a profitable venture.", "In 2007, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) first recorded shale gas production, when it accounted for just 7% of U.S. natural gas production. In 2013, shale gas production accounted for almost 40% of U.S. production (see Figure 1 ), while almost all the LNG import terminals were idle and many applied to become export terminals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technologies Stimulate Shale Gas Production First", "paragraphs": ["The application of advances in directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing were first applied to shale gas formations, particularly as natural gas prices increased in the mid-2000s. Methane molecules and those of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are smaller than crude oil molecules and therefore tend to be more responsive to hydraulic fracturing. The success of shale gas development has driven U.S. natural gas production to increase almost every month on a year-on-year basis (see Figure 3 ) from 2008 through May 2014. The rise in shale gas development has also resulted in natural gas prices declining, as shown in Figure 2 .", "The decline in prices and production in the latter half of 2008 was mainly the result of the economic downturn. However, as the economy picked up in 2009, natural gas resumed its upward production trajectory while prices stayed low. Overall U.S. natural gas production grew, as did the contribution from shale. The continued increase in production can be attributed, in part, to industry improvements in extracting more of the natural gas from the shale formations. Continued progress in hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling techniques has enabled companies to drive down production costs while increasing output."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Natural Gas Liquids: A Production Driver", "paragraphs": ["NGLs have taken on a new prominence as shale gas production has increased and prices have fallen. As natural gas prices have stayed low, company interests have shifted away from dry natural gas production to more liquids-based production. NGL is a general term for all liquid products separated from natural gas at a gas processing plant and includes ethane, propane, butane, and pentanes. When NGLs are present with methane, which is the primary component of natural gas, the natural gas is referred to as either \"hot\" or \"wet\" gas. Once the NGLs are removed from the methane, the natural gas is referred to as \"dry\" gas, which is what most consumers use. ", "Each NGL has its own market and its own value. As the price for dry gas has dropped because of the increase in supply and other reasons, such as the warm winter of 2011, the natural gas industry has turned its attention to producing in areas with more wet gas in order to bolster the value it receives (see Figure 4 ). Some companies have shifted their production portfolios to tight oil formations, such as the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana, to capitalize on the experience they gained in shale gas development. Historically, the individual NGL products have been priced against oil, except for ethane. As oil prices have remained higher since 2008 relative to natural gas, they have driven an increase of wet gas production. Because of its low price, dry gas is often treated as a \"byproduct\" of wet gas and oil production."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Increased Tight Oil Production Raises Independence Possibility", "paragraphs": ["The prospect of U.S. energy independence is grounded in the production growth from tight oil formations such as the Bakken Formation in North Dakota and Montana and the Eagle Ford Formation in Texas. Relative to other fuels, the United States is more dependent upon imports for its oil requirements, still accounting for about 47% of consumption. Canada is the largest supplier of U.S. oil imports, which is why energy independence is usually mentioned as North American energy independence. The United States added almost 1 million barrels per day (b/d) of oil production between 2012 and 2013 (see Figure 5 ). U.S. oil production has reached levels not seen in more than a decade but is almost 2 million b/d short of the highs in the 1970s. Since 2005, when crude oil imports reached a peak, they have dropped almost 2.4 million b/d, or 24%, through 2013. Also since 2005, U.S. consumption of crude oil and petroleum products has been trending downward, contributing to the decrease in imports.", "The continued shift of industry resources toward oil-rich production has prompted forecasts of continued growth. Domestic crude oil production is projected to rise through the end of the decade.

Potential direct risks may include impacts to groundwater and surface water quality, public and private water supplies, and air quality. In addition, some have raised concerns about potential long-term and indirect impacts from reliance on fossil fuels and resulting greenhouse gas emissions and influence on broader energy economics. On the other hand, natural gas is seen by many as a \"bridge\" fuel that can provide more energy per unit of greenhouse gas produced than some alternatives (e.g., coal) and has only recently been produced in sufficient quantity and at low enough prices to provide a viable alternative fuel that is widely regarded as relatively cleaner-burning (i.e., no mercury or sulfur emissions and substantially lower emissions of nitrous oxides and carbon dioxide per Btu of energy produced compared to coal). This report focuses primarily on measures to address potential direct impacts.", "Among the variety of potential direct environmental impacts, many may be mitigated with appropriate safeguards, existing technology, and best practices. For example, management of wastewater associated with increased unconventional oil and gas production activity has in some cases placed a strain on water resources and on wastewater treatment plants that were not designed to remove salts and other contaminants from hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water, and these impacts can be mitigated by investing in additional control technologies. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Water Quality Issues", "paragraphs": ["Water quality issues have received much attention, and of these, the potential risks associated with well stimulation by hydraulic fracturing have been at the forefront. Complaints of contaminated well water have emerged in some areas where unconventional oil and gas development has occurred, although regulators have not reported a direct connection between hydraulic fracturing of shale formations at depth and groundwater contamination. In shale formations, the vertical distance separating the target zone from usable aquifers generally is much greater than the length of the fractures induced during hydraulic fracturing. Thousands of feet of rock layers typically overlay the produced portion of shale, and these layers serve as barriers to flow. In these circumstances, geologists and state regulators generally view as remote the possibility of creating a fracture that could reach a potable aquifer. If the shallow portions of shale formations were developed, then the thickness of the overlying rocks would be less and the distance from the shale to potable aquifers would be shorter, posing more of a risk to groundwater. In contrast to shale, coalbed methane (CBM) basins often qualify as underground sources of drinking water. Injection of fracturing fluids directly into or adjacent to such formations may be more likely to present a risk of contamination, and this is where initial regulatory attention and study was focused.", "State regulators have expressed more concern about the groundwater contamination risks associated with developing a natural gas or oil well (drilling through an overlying aquifer and casing, cementing, and completing the well), as opposed to hydraulic fracturing per se. The challenges of sealing off the groundwater and isolating it from possible contamination are common to the development of any oil or gas well and are not unique to hydraulic fracturing. However, horizontally drilled, hydraulically fractured oil and gas wells pose more development and production challenges and are subject to greater pressures than conventional vertical wells. ", "Identifying the source or cause of groundwater contamination can be difficult for various reasons, including the complexity of hydrogeologic processes and investigations, a lack of baseline testing of nearby water wells prior to drilling and fracturing, and the confidential business information status traditionally provided for fracturing compounds. Investigations by regulators and researchers have generally found that incidents involving residential water well contamination (including methane gas migration) have been caused by failure of well-bore casing and cementing or other well development and operating problems rather than the hydraulic fracturing process.", "The debate over groundwater contamination risks associated with hydraulic fracturing has been fueled in part by the lack of scientific studies to assess more thoroughly current practices and related complaints and uncertainties. To address this issue, Congress has asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct a study on the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The \"hydraulic fracturing\" debate also has been complicated by terminology. Many do not differentiate the well stimulation process of \"fracing\" or \"fracking\" from the full range of activities associated with unconventional oil and gas exploration and production. ", "Other water quality concerns\u2014associated with both conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas extraction\u2014include the risks of contaminating ground and surface water from surface spills, leaks from pits, and siltation of streams from drilling and pad construction activities. Because of the large, but short-term, volumes of water needed for the hydraulic fracturing operations used to extract shale gas and tight oil, water consumption issues have emerged as well. Water use issues include the impacts that large water withdrawals might have on groundwater resources, streams and aquatic life (particularly during low-flow periods), and other competing uses (e.g., municipal or agricultural uses). Such impacts may be regional or localized and can vary seasonally or with longer-term variations in precipitation.", "The management of the large volumes of wastewater produced during natural gas production (including flowback from hydraulic fracturing operations and water produced from source formations) has emerged in many areas as a significant water quality issue as well as a cost issue for producers. In some areas, such as portions of the Marcellus Shale region, capacity is limited for wastewater disposal using underground injection wells (historically, the most common and preferred produced-water disposal practice in oil and natural gas fields), and surface discharge of wastewater is an increasingly restricted option. Such issues, as well as water-use concerns, are driving increased water recycling and reuse in the industry. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Emissions", "paragraphs": ["Air emissions associated with unconventional oil and natural gas production have also raised public health concerns and have drawn regulatory scrutiny. Air pollutants can be released during various stages of oil and natural gas production. Emission sources include pad, road, and pipeline construction; well drilling and completion, and flowback activities and natural gas processing, storage, and transmission equipment. Key pollutants include methane (the main component of natural gas and a potent greenhouse gas), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and various hazardous air pollutants. According to EPA, the oil and gas industry is a significant source of methane and VOC emissions, which react with nitrogen oxides to form ozone (smog). EPA has identified hydraulically fractured gas wells during flowback as an additional source of these emissions in the natural gas industry.", "Releases of methane and other pollutants can also occur where natural gas is produced in association with oil and natural gas gathering pipelines and other infrastructure are lacking. In such cases, the natural gas must generally be flared or vented. Flaring reduces VOC emissions compared to venting, but like venting, it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions without producing an economic value or displacing other fuel consumption. Natural gas flaring has become an issue with the rapid and intense development of tight oil from the Eagle Ford Formation in Texas and the Bakken Formation in North Dakota, which have significant amounts of associated gas. Other areas that have experienced large increases in tight oil production have also had increases in the amount of natural gas being flared."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Regulation of Oil and Gas Development", "paragraphs": ["Oil and natural gas development is occurring in at least 32 states. Shale gas, tight oil, or other unconventional resources (such as coalbed methane) are found in many of these states, primarily on non-federal lands (see Figure 6 ). States are the principal regulators of oil and gas production activities on state and private lands. The federal government, through the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM), has responsibility for overseeing oil and gas development on federally managed lands; however, some states require operators on federal public lands within state boundaries to comply with the state's oil and gas rules.", "Hydraulic fracturing, traditionally without horizontal drilling, has been used for decades to stimulate increased production from existing oil or gas wells. This technique, along with other well stimulation techniques, has been regulated to varying degrees through state oil and gas codes. The detail and scope of applicable regulations vary across the states, and some states have regulated \"well stimulation\" broadly without addressing hydraulic \"fracturing\" explicitly. State regulators have noted that hydraulic fracturing operations have been regulated through provisions that address various production activities, including requirements regarding well construction (e.g., casing and cementing), well stimulation (e.g., hydraulic fracturing), well operation (e.g., pressure testing and blowout prevention), and wastewater management. ", "Nonetheless, drilling and fracturing methods and technologies have changed significantly over time as they have been applied to more challenging formations, greatly increasing the amount of water, fracturing fluids, and well pressures involved in tight oil and shale gas production operations. State groundwater protection officials have reported that development of shale gas and tight oil using high-volume hydraulic fracturing, in combination with directional drilling, has posed new challenges for the management and protection of water resources. Consequently, many of the major producing states have revised or are in the process of revising their oil and gas laws and regulations to respond to these advances in oil and natural gas production technologies and related changes in the industry.", "When revising laws and regulations, some states have added provisions to address hydraulic fracturing specifically, such as requirements for disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, various states have adopted measures on water resources protection (including casing, cementing and pressure testing, well spacing, setbacks, water withdrawal, flowback, and wastewater storage and disposal requirements). According to the Ground Water Protection Council (GWPC), the number of states with regulations governing hydraulic fracturing operations specifically increased from 4 in 2009 to 13 in 2013, and the number of states requiring reporting of hydraulic fracturing chemicals grew from 9 in 2009 to 21 in 2013.

Maryland environmental officials recommended in late 2014 that shale gas drilling be allowed using best practices, following a three-year review of potential risks pursuant to an executive order. In 2013, North Carolina lawmakers enacted legislation prohibiting the issuance of permits for oil and gas development using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling until new regulations were in place and the legislature took affirmative action to allow permits to be issued; in 2014, the state enacted legislation authorizing a regulatory permitting program for shale gas development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Debate over the Federal Role", "paragraphs": ["While states continue to adopt and implement varying frameworks for oversight and regulation of unconventional gas and oil development, some Members of Congress and various environmental groups have pressed for greater environmental oversight of shale energy development at the federal level.

Such advocates further argue that greater regulatory uniformity would reduce risks and uncertainties to both the industry and the public. Others, including many oil and gas states, argue against greater federal involvement and point to established state oil and gas programs and regulatory structures (which include a range of structures involving commissions, boards, or divisions within natural resource agencies working to varying degrees with, or within, state environmental agencies).

States or tribes may work with BLM to craft variances from specific regulatory provisions that would allow compliance with state or tribal requirements to be accepted as compliance with the BLM rule (if the state or tribal provision is at least as protective as the pertinent BLM provision).

On-site disposal options are limited, and trucking wastewater to distant injection wells is costly. In 2012, the Coast Guard received two requests for approval for the bulk shipment of wastewater resulting from shale gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale to storage or treatment centers and final disposal sites in Ohio, Texas, and Louisiana.", "The Coast Guard regulates the shipment of hazardous materials on the nation's rivers and classifies cargoes for bulk shipment. For a cargo that has not been classified in the regulations or under prior policy, the ship owner must request Coast Guard approval prior to shipping the cargo. The Coast Guard has identified concerns with shipment of shale gas wastewater in barges. A key Coast Guard concern with the wastewater is \"its potential for contamination with radioactive isotopes such as radium-226 and -228. Radium is of particular concern because it is chemically similar to calcium and so will easily form surface residues and may lead to radioactive surface contamination of the barges.\" Consequently, the Coast Guard currently does not allow barge shipment of shale gas extraction wastewater (SGEWW), and is developing a policy to allow SGEWW to be transported for disposal. ", "In March 2013, the Coast Guard submitted for review to the Office of Management and Budget a draft document, \"Carriage of Conditionally Permitted Shale Gas Extraction Waste Water in Bulk.\" In October 2013, the Coast Guard published a notice of availability of a proposed \"policy letter\" concerning barge shipments of SGEWW and requested public comment. The Coast Guard received more than 70,000 comments and has been reviewing them.

Several bills proposed to limit federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities, while others would have expanded federal involvement.", "In November 2013, the House passed H.R. 2728 to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to prohibit the Department of the Interior (DOI) from enforcing any federal regulation, guidance, or permit requirement regarding hydraulic fracturing relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on or under any land in any state that has regulations, guidance, or permit requirements for hydraulic fracturing. Although the language broadly applied to any federal regulation, guidance, and permit requirements \"regarding hydraulic fracturing,\" the prohibition on enforcement applied only to DOI and therefore presumably would have impacted only hydraulic fracturing operations on lands managed by that agency. The bill would have also required DOI to defer to state regulations, permitting, and guidance for all activities related to hydraulic fracturing relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on federal land, regardless of whether those rules were duplicative, more or less restrictive, or did not meet federal guidelines. ", "As passed, H.R. 2728 further would have (1) prohibited the department from enforcing hydraulic fracturing regulations on Trust lands, except with express tribal consent, and (2) required the Government Accountability Office to study the economic benefits of domestic shale oil and gas production resulting from hydraulic fracturing. H.R. 2728 also incorporated the text of H.R. 2850 ( H.Rept. 113-252 ), the EPA Hydraulic Fracturing Study Improvement Act. These provisions proposed to require EPA to (1) follow certain procedures governing peer review and data presentation in conducting its study on the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water, and (2) issue the final report by September 30, 2016. On November 20, 2013, S. 1743 , a companion bill to H.R. 2728 as introduced, was offered in the Senate. H.R. 2728 was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar in December 2013. In September 2014, the House passed broad energy legislation ( H.R. 2 ), which included the text of H.R. 2728 in Subdivision D. The Senate did not act on either bill.", "Similarly, the Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act, H.R. 2513 and S. 1234 , proposed to give states sole authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing operations on lands within state boundaries. The legislation further specified that hydraulic fracturing on federal public lands would be subject to the law of the state in which the land is located. S. 1482 , the Empower States Act of 2013, would have generally prohibited the Secretary of the Interior from issuing regulations or guidelines regarding oil and gas production on federal land in a state if the state had otherwise met the requirements under applicable federal law. Among other provisions, the bill also proposed to (1) amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to require federal agencies, before issuing any oil and gas regulation or guideline, to seek comment and consult with each affected state agency and Indian tribe, and (2) require any future rule requiring disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals to refer to the FracFocus database. H.R. 1548 ( H.Rept. 113-263 ) would have prohibited the BLM hydraulic fracturing rule from having any effect on land held in trust or restricted status for Indians, except with the express consent of its Indian beneficiaries.

Additionally, S. 332 proposed to repeal SDWA Section 1425, which provides states with an alternative to meeting the specific requirements contained in EPA UIC regulations by allowing states to demonstrate to EPA that their existing programs for oil and gas injection wells are effective in preventing endangerment of underground sources of drinking water. S. 332 , Section 302, would have required EPA to report to Congress on fugitive methane emissions resulting from natural gas infrastructure.", "Legislation was also introduced to require baseline and follow-up testing of potable groundwater supplies in the vicinity of hydraulic fracturing operations.

H.R. 2825 , the Closing Loopholes and Ending Arbitrary and Needless Evasion of Regulations Act of 2013, would have amended the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to require EPA to determine whether wastes associated with oil and gas production meet the criteria for hazardous waste and to regulate any such wastes as hazardous."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 114th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Legislation in this Congress addressing unconventional oil and gas production repeats themes from 113 th Congress.

The technological advances that drove the changes in the United States have also reversed the global perspective of dwindling oil and natural gas resources and increased the concern about greenhouse gas emissions. Other countries seek to emulate the U.S. production success but have yet to do so. The U.S. oil and gas situation continues to be extremely dynamic, and many questions remain about how the United States will develop its resources.", "Many observers, including U.S. government officials, have only recently recognized the tremendous resource size and the benefits that will accrue from developing the resources. Even though shale gas development is still considered very new and tight oil production is even newer, the industry has continued to improve its efficiency in extracting the resources, particularly of natural gas. As more industry resources are shifted to tight oil plays, the natural gas sector has had to produce more with less. Some in industry point out that at the beginning of shale gas development about 5% of the resource was able to be extracted; now it is closer to 20% but will likely increase over time. By comparison, the extraction rate for conventional gas is between 30% and 60% of the resource.", "Development of these resources has generated concern and debate over potential environmental and human health risks. Concerns include potential impacts to groundwater and surface water resources from well development and stimulation operations and wastewater management, as well as air quality impacts from emissions of air pollutants, including methane. These concerns have drawn scrutiny of regulatory regimes governing this industry and have led to calls for greater federal oversight of oil and gas development. A growing concern is that the deep-well disposal of oil and gas production wastewater may be responsible for increasing rates of seismic activity in certain areas. Although primary regulatory authority over oil and natural gas exploration and production on state and private lands generally rests with the states, provisions of several federal environmental laws currently apply to certain activities associated with oil and natural gas exploration and production. Moreover, EPA has been reviewing other statutory authorities and pursuing new regulatory initiatives, and BLM is planning further revisions to its oil and gas rules to address venting and flaring of natural gas on federal and Indian lands. A broader concern among some is that the low price of natural gas is having negative consequences for the development and growth in energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, and nuclear power, potentially resulting in another generation of greenhouse-gas-producing energy sources. ", "The importance of tight oil and shale gas resources to U.S. energy policy and regional economies is likely to keep issues surrounding their development on the agenda in the 114 th Congress. Bills have been introduced to expand and also to constrain federal involvement in oil and gas development involving hydraulic fracturing. Meanwhile, the Administration continues to pursue actions to broaden federal oversight of this industry sector through administrative means. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
