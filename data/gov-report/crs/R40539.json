Both the United States and the EU provide significant government support for their agricultural sectors. In the United States, a large share of support is concentrated on wheat, feed grains, cotton, oilseeds, sugar, and dairy. The EU provides more extensive support to a broader range of farm and food products, including grains, cotton, rice, oilseeds, peanuts, dairy, and sugar, but also fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, and livestock products. In addition, starting in the 1980s, both the United States and the EU introduced policies and programs expanding the type and amount of support for agricultural conservation and so-called \"agri-environment\" practices on-farm. Compared to support for commodity production, however, support for agricultural conservation still constitutes a very small share of total farm-level support within both the EU and the United States.", "According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the EU and the United States together account for more than 60% of all government support to agriculture among the major developed economies. In terms of total spending, EU agricultural support generally is much higher than in the United States, and the EU alone accounts for 50% of the OECD's total estimate. However, comparisons are complicated by significant structural differences between the U.S. and EU farm sectors.

The data indicate that, since the mid-1980s, total farm support in the United States and EU has declined as a share of total gross farm receipts. In general, support for commodity programs has decreased, whereas the support for non-commodity programs, such as farmland conservation and certain types of rural development programs, has increased. However, support for non-commodity programs still accounts for a small share (less than 1%) of farm receipts. As a share of overall farm receipts, support for such programs is slightly greater in the United States, where support for non-commodity programs accounts for less than 0.7% of receipts, than in the EU, where it accounts for less than 0.3% of receipts annually.

Some argue that the failure of the United States and EU to reform their respective farm support programs has contributed to delays in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations within the World Trade Organization (WTO). In response to these criticisms, both the United States and the EU have modified their farm programs in part by expanding various types of \"non-commodity\" support, such as farmland conservation (or so-called \"agri-environment\") programs and rural development programs, among other programs.

Although many of these policies can be and sometimes are modified through freestanding authorizing legislation, or as part of other laws, the omnibus, multi-year farm bill provides an opportunity for policymakers to address agricultural and food issues more comprehensively. The most recent omnibus farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 , the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008) covers a range of areas, including commodity crops, horticulture and livestock, conservation, nutrition, trade and food aid, agricultural research, farm credit, rural development, energy, forestry, and other programs.", "U.S. farm support consists of programs that provide both direct and indirect support to producers and consumers and to the agricultural sector in general. The core programs provide price and income support for selected commodities, including corn, wheat, cotton, rice, soybeans, dairy, and sugar. Grains, cotton, oilseeds, dairy, and peanuts generally are eligible for both fixed \"decoupled\" payments (payments not tied to production or crop yields) and \"counter-cyclical assistance\" payments (payments tied to per-bushel or per-pound target prices); the total producer subsidy is based on past production. Producers of these and other commodities also are eligible for crop loans and loan-related subsidies that provide further support. Dairy and sugar are supported through various minimum pricing systems, and some commodities are subject to quotas to limit imports. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the average cost of the commodity programs will be about $8.3 billion per year under the 2008 farm bill (FY2008-FY2012). Farmers may also be eligible for crop insurance and disaster assistance payments.", "Starting with the 1985 farm bill, Congress introduced programs intended to help producers adopt farming practices that preserve or enhance the environment. Conservation programs administered by USDA can be broadly grouped into land retirement and easement programs and so-called \"working lands\" programs. In general, land retirement and easement programs take land out of crop production and provide for program rental payments and cost-sharing to establish longer-term conservation coverage to convert the land back into forests, grasslands, or wetlands. Working lands programs provide technical and financial assistance to assist agricultural producers in improving natural resource conservation and management practices on their productive lands. In addition, aside from some long-standing rural business and community programs, the 1996 and 2002 farm bills, as amended, included several new rural development programs intended for infrastructure improvements, community services, and business development. The 2008 farm bill also expanded upon these overall program areas by creating new farm conservation and rural development programs. CBO estimates that the average cost of the mandatory conservation and rural development programs will be about $4.8 billion per year under the 2008 farm bill."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EU Agricultural Policy", "paragraphs": ["The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) governs agricultural policies and programs for the EU's the 27 member countries. Established in 1962, the CAP's objectives are to:", "increase agricultural productivity, ensure fair living standards for farmers, stabilize markets, ensure the availability of food, and provide food at reasonable prices.", "These aims were achieved primarily by the EU intervening in commodity markets to buy farm output when market prices fell below agreed target prices. To prevent imports from undercutting the high internal prices that resulted from the operation of the intervention buying system, the EU levied variable tariffs on imported agricultural products. Export subsidies were used eliminate the surpluses of agricultural products that resulted from the high internal prices of the intervention buying system. Among the unintended consequences of the CAP were high prices for consumers and high budget expenditures. During the 1970s and 1980s, the CAP accounted for as much as 70% of the total EU budget. The CAP was also criticized by EU trading partners for distorting world markets and interfering with global agricultural trade.", "Since 1992, the EU has implemented policy changes that move the CAP toward support that is more market-oriented and decoupled from current production and prices; the changes also reduce the budgetary costs of the CAP and bring EU agricultural policy in line with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and restrictions. More recently, the evolution of the CAP has been influenced by other objectives (than those mentioned in the Treaty of Rome) such as maintaining the quality of rural life, improving the environment, and protecting animal welfare. Reforms in 1992 (the MacSharry Reforms) and 1999 (Agenda 2000) reduced EU commodity support prices toward market levels and required that some farmland be taken out of production. Budget disciplines designed to reduce the growth in community spending on the CAP were established in 2002. In addition, the receipt of farm income support is contingent upon the farmer meeting an extensive array of agricultural and environmental norms that were introduced in 2003 (the Midterm Review).", "Direct aid to farmers and commodity market support constitute the first pillar of the CAP. Rural development measures, added to the CAP starting in mid-1995, are the second pillar. Total reported spending for the EU's farm programs\u2014including direct aid and support for conservation and rural development\u2014is estimated at nearly $68 billion (\u20ac54 billion) for 2008, and accounts for more than 40% of the EU budget annually.", "The major component of the first pillar of the CAP (direct aid and market support) is the single farm payment (SFP). Introduced in 2003, the SFP replaced payments made under various commodity-specific common market organizations (CMOs) and largely decoupled support from current prices or production. EU member countries could opt to maintain a limited link between payments and production (\"partial decoupling\"), but most chose to move to full decoupling. The recently completed Health Check will eliminate partial decoupling for all but a few (livestock) commodities by 2012. Reported spending for \"direct aids,\" covering SFP, is estimated at about $50 billion (\u20ac37 billion) for 2008.", "In order to receive the SFP, a farmer must comply with certain environmental and agricultural measures. Cross-compliance entails keeping farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition and observing mandatory management requirements. The requirements are included in regulations established for groundwater protection, water pollution from nitrates, pesticide use, and the protection of habitats for flora and fauna. These agricultural and environmental practices, often referred to as \"good agricultural practices\" or GAPs, are listed below ( Table 1 ).", "Non-compliance is sanctioned by reductions in direct payments. The reduction may not exceed 5% for one instance of non-compliance, but may increase to 20% in the case of repeated non-compliance. If non-compliance is intentional, the reduction will not be less than 20% and could result in total denial of the SFP for one or more years. ", "Rural development policy (pillar two) focuses on three identified areas: competitiveness for farming and forestry; environment and countryside; and quality of life and diversification of the rural economy. Activities under the second pillar are designed and co-financed by member countries. Within member states, the EU funds 75% of the cost of rural development activities, and 90% in poorer areas. Increased spending on rural development is financed by reducing the direct payments to larger farmers. From 2007 onward, direct payments to individual farmers of \u20ac5,000 and higher are reduced by 5% to finance rural development. The EU refers to this reduction in direct payments and transfer of funds from the first to the second pillar as \"modulation.\"", "Spending on the EU's \"rural development\" programs, which include agri-environmental programs, is estimated at about $14 billion (\u20ac10 billion) for 2007 and about $19 billion (\u20ac13 billion) for 2008. Overall, CAP spending for rural development represents about 20% or more of all EU farm spending. Direct farm spending, including the SFP, accounts for about 70% of the CAP. The remaining budget is spent on other farm programs and administration. CAP spending is subject to a financial discipline mechanism designed to keep spending on direct aid and market support (pillar one) in line with budget ceilings agreed to in 2002. If overspending on direct aids is forecast, then direct aids are reduced to ensure that the budget is not exceeded.

For example, the United States' commodity program focuses its support on a few major commodities (mostly corn, wheat, rice, soybeans, cotton, dairy, and sugar), whereas the EU farm program provides commodity support for a much wider range of products, including grains, cotton, rice, oilseeds, peanuts, dairy, sugar, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, and livestock products. Farm structures and organization are also vastly different: the United States has roughly twice the farmland base of the European Union, with fewer but significantly larger farms than the EU. The EU has less total land in farming, but as many as six to seven times the number of farm operators. Such differences can affect how the available data and information may be interpreted, and caution is needed when comparing any available data translated into a per-unit basis, such as expenditures per acre or per farm, between these countries.", "Putting aside limitations of the data, these information sources are useful in comparing farm program support across countries.

These positive attributes include environmental protection, landscape preservation, biodiversity, rural viability and employment, animal welfare, food safety and quality, and food security. Typically, non-commodity outputs of agriculture satisfy two conditions: they are jointly produced with commodity outputs, and they provide social value (and impose social costs) not reflected in markets.

For commodities, the OECD's reported information is inclusive across all program areas and includes support for all commodities, even those that are supported through price supports and administered prices (such as dairy and sugar in the United States). This allows for a direct comparison of agricultural support between the United States and the EU. Also, for the EU, the OECD report provides information across several levels of EU accession: EU12 (1986-1994, including parts of eastern Europe from 1990); EU15 (1995-2003); EU25 (2004-2006) and EU27 (since 2007).

Of this total, the share of total farm support for commodity programs dropped from 24% to 6% of overall farm receipts; support for non-commodity programs increased but still accounts for less than 1% of receipts.

Green box programs are payments that are only minimally trade-distorting. Examples are research programs, direct payments to farmers that are not contingent on production, environmental program payments, or disaster assistance. Green box payments do not require WTO disciplines or reductions, and do not count against the country's subsidy ceiling. 2. Blue box programs are direct payments made under a production-limiting program. Examples are EU direct payments to producers based on fixed areas or yields or a fixed number of livestock. There are currently no U.S. blue box programs. Blue box programs are not subject to WTO disciplines or reductions. 3. Amber box programs are contingent on participation in agricultural production. Examples are U.S. price supports for dairy and sugar; U.S. loan deficiency payments or marketing loans for grain, oilseed, and cotton producers; and EU intervention purchases of farm products at administratively maintained prices above market prices. Such payments are considered market-distorting and are subject to WTO reduction commitments. 4.

For example, the U.S. dairy and sugar programs do not receive commodity support payments, but are instead covered through other support mechanisms, such as government purchases (dairy) and marketing quotas and import barriers (sugar). Yet the AMS captures this support as part of its overall estimate. As reported in the U.S. notification, dairy and sugar programs accounted for 40% and 9% of the U.S. \"Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support\" in 2005, along with corn (35%) and cotton (13%). In contrast, the most recent EU notification reports that total fresh and processed fruits and vegetables represented about one-third of EU \"Current Total Aggregate Measurement of Support\" in 2005/2006, along with another roughly 50% for dairy products, sugar, and most grain products.", "The principal limitation of the AMS data is its substantial reporting lag.

Accordingly, the only period available to compare data on the United States and the European Union is 1995 through 2005. A more recent EU submission is reportedly delayed because of accounting issues surrounding EU country accession.", "The available AMS data are also limited because of differences in policy priorities, as well as reporting and accounting differences in farm programs between the United States and the EU. For example, the United States \"green box\" payments differ from the EU's in that the U.S. includes \"domestic food aid,\" which includes food stamps, and other domestic food and child nutrition programs ( Table 1 ). In addition, internal shifts among categories between reporting periods also complicate a direct or historical comparison. For example, in recent years the U.S. notification has classified the farmland long-term retirement program, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), as an \"environmental payment,\" whereas previously it was classified under \"resource retirement programs.\" This type of change can distort historical trends and period averaging of the available data, understating U.S. spending on conservation programs, as further described in the next section."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What the Data Indicate", "paragraphs": ["Available AMS information for the United States and the EU, averaged over the 1995-2005 period, indicate that the United States provides less support than the EU for both production-based \"amber box\" programs and environmental programs under the \"green box,\" but substantially more for domestic food aid and decoupled direct payments ( Table 2 ). These data suggest that the bulk (about 77%) of U.S. farm payments are green box (i.e., not subject to WTO disciplines), while about 27% of EU payments are green box. ", "However, these data are not directly comparable across all reported categories and, in some cases, do not reflect current conditions. For example, the U.S. notification classifies \"domestic food aid\" as a sizable part of its green box support ($38.3 billion), whereas the EU does not. In addition, in the United States, direct payments are notified as decoupled, total roughly $5 billion per year, and have ranged from about 25% to 44% of total commodity payments in recent years. The U.S. classifies these farm payments as \"green box\" when reporting agricultural subsidies to the WTO; thus these payments do not count against their subsidy ceiling. The EU data reflect changes since the 2003 CAP reforms. As part of these reforms, EU farm production payments were largely decoupled with the establishment of \"single farm payments\" (SFP). ", "Comparing available AMS data ( Table 2 ) on environmental payments also requires additional clarification. As already discussed, the recent U.S. notification reclassified the CRP as an \"environmental payment\" whereas previously it was classified under \"resource retirement programs.\" Given that these data are averaged over the 1995-2005 period, this indicates that average environmental payments in the United States ($1.2 billion) are substantially lower than in the European Union ($5.3 billion) ( Table 2 ). However, U.S. payments for \"resource retirement programs\"($1.0 billion), reflecting the inclusion of CRP in earlier years, are more than twice similar payments in the European Union ($0.5 billion). Although total environmental payments under the \"green box\" classification are generally higher in the EU than in the United States, more recent data show this difference is less stark: U.S. environmental payments were $3.8 billion in 2007, compared to the EU's $5.6 billion in 2005.

Non-commodity supportEuropean Union: Available EU budget data are reported across an aggregate category, \"Rural development\" (budget item 05 04), and there is limited information providing a detailed breakout of current budget outlays for individual conservation, rural development, and forestry activities across all EU27 countries. United States: Available U.S. data are compiled building up from comparable subcategories and excluding some categories. Included are reported budget outlays for all U.S. conservation programs administered by both USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA), select rural development programs (rural utilities loans and grants) and forestry programs (research, and state/private forest lands funding). Excluded are some programs listed under total U.S. rural development and forestry programs, including wildfire activities, the National Forest Service system, and rural housing. These subcategories do not appear to have comparable budget lines as part of the EU farm accounting.", "Compiled in this manner, Table 3 shows available U.S. and EU budget data for select farm program areas, with total expenditures broken out by farm commodities and selected rural development, conservation, and forestry programs. These data show that between 2006 and 2007, EU spending for non-commodity support increased. Budget data for farm commodity support are less straightforward, since commodity prices were generally low in 2007, which complicates a comparison of the trends in overall commodity program spending.", "Limited information is available within the EU's aggregate \"rural development\" budget category to estimate the EU's so-called agri-environmental payments. Other available budget data for the EU15 countries indicate that, on average, agri-environmental payments have accounted for about 75% of the total rural development budget item (2000-2006). EU outlays for agri-environmental programs are currently estimated at roughly $11-$12 billion per year. This compares to an average of about $5 billion in outlays for U.S. conservation programs during the same period, or less than one-half of total spending in the European Union. The EU requires its farmers to meet certain conditions related to environmental protection, food safety, and animal welfare before receiving these direct payments, whereas there are limited similar requirements of U.S. farmers regarding conservation payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Per-Unit Budget Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Caution is needed when comparing these data as translated to a per-unit basis, such as per-acre or per-farm. Previously, the OECD reported its compiled data on a per-unit basis, but it stopped presenting data this way because it was considered too misleading, given underlying differences in farm structures.", "Comparing data on a per-acre or per-farm basis is complicated by the significant structural differences between the U.S. and EU farm sectors: namely, the United States has roughly twice the farmland base of the EU but less than 15% of the total number of farms. These reported land-use values reflect all farmland, including working lands and retired farm lands, as well as lands that produce crops and animals that are not supported by, for example, the U.S. commodity programs.", "Comparing budget data on a per-unit basis affects a simple inter-country comparison and may result in vastly different interpretations of the data. As an example, when expressed on a per-acre basis, the budget data show that farm expenditures are roughly five to six times greater in the EU than in the United States. When these same data are expressed on a per-farm basis, the outcome is reversed, indicating that U.S. expenditures per farm are about two to three times greater than in the EU ( Table 3 )."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Policy Implications", "paragraphs": ["The EU is one of the United States' chief agricultural trading partners and also a major competitor in world food markets. Both the EU and the United States heavily support their agricultural sectors. Although many in Congress have historically defended U.S. farm support programs as a means to ensure that the United States has continued access to the \"most abundant, safest, and cheapest food supplies in the world,\" long-standing criticisms and continued debate have challenged the extent of and need for government support of farm programs. In response to these criticisms, both the United States and the EU have modified their farm programs in part by expanding various types of \"non-commodity\" support, such as farmland conservation and rural development programs, among other programs. To date, however, non-commodity support still constitutes a very small share of total farm-level support, compared to farm production support.", "Some argue that the failure of the United States and EU to reform their respective farm support programs has contributed to delays in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations within the World Trade Organization (WTO). Information comparing the EU and U.S. farm support programs will continue to be of interest to Congress as the Doha negotiations continue to move forward."], "subsections": []}]}}
