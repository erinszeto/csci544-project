Prominently included among this conduct is criminal activity.", "In general, aliens may legally enter the United States under one of three categories: (1) legal permanent residents (LPRs), who are also commonly referred to as immigrants; (2) nonimmigrants, who are aliens permitted to enter the United States temporarily for a specific purpose, such as for tourism, academic study, or temporary work; and (3) refugees, who are aliens facing persecution abroad and are of special humanitarian concern to the United States. There are two aspects for legal admission under each of these categories. First, an alien must fulfill the substantive requirements for admission under a specified category. For example, in order to enter the United States as a nonimmigrant student, an alien must demonstrate that he is a bona fide student at an approved school. Second, aliens who fulfill substantive requirements for admission may nevertheless be denied admission if they fall within a class of inadmissable aliens listed under INA \u00a7 212. Once admitted, aliens remain subject to removal if they fall within a class of deportable aliens listed under INA \u00a7 237. The INA contains bars for admission and grounds for deportation based on criminal conduct.", "This report discusses the potential immigration consequences of criminal activity. \"Criminal activity\" generally refers to conduct for which an alien has been found or plead guilty before a court of law, though in limited circumstances consequences may attach to the commission of a crime or admission of acts constituting the essential elements of a crime. Consequences may flow from violations of either federal, state or, in many circumstances, foreign criminal law. Some federal crimes are set out in the INA itself\u2014alien smuggling, for example. However, not all violations of immigration law are crimes. Notably, being in the United States without legal permission\u2014i.e., being an \"illegal alien\"\u2014is not a crime in and of itself. Thus, for example, an alien who overstays a student visa may be an \"illegal alien,\" in that the alien may be subject to removal from the United States, but such an alien is not a \"criminal alien.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Administration of Immigration Law", "paragraphs": ["For several decades, the primary authority to interpret, implement, and enforce the provisions of the INA was vested with the Attorney General.
