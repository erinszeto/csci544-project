Further, the laws whose descriptions follow do not constitute all of the statutes which may be applicable to, or implicated in antitrust issues, but rather, are those which are most often utilized.

The limitation to actual damages was also applicable, until late 1990, to monetary injuries sustained by the United States (15 U.S.C. \u00a715a)); that limitation was removed by the 101 st Congress in H.R. 29 ( P.L. 101-588 ), following much hearing testimony to the effect that the damage limitation made the federal government the \"antitrust victim of choice.\" Treble-damage recovery is now available to the United States, as it is to private antitrust plaintiffs pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a715."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 7 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18)", "paragraphs": ["Is probably the most prominent, substantive provision of the Clayton Act .

It is enforced by both the Department of Justice and the FTC. As originally enacted, the provision required notification, with certain, enumerated exceptions, of all merger or acquisition transactions by persons in or affecting commerce in which either party had nets sales or assets of $10 million and the other party had net sales or assets of $100 million (15 U.S.C. \u00a718a(a)). The reviewing agency had 30 days from the time of notification (15 days in the case of tender offers) to review the proposed transaction, which could not be consummated during that time unless the reviewing agency granted an early termination of the waiting period (15 U.S.C.\u00a718a(b)). Prior to the conclusion of that time, the reviewing agency was authorized to seek a second round of information, which extended the original waiting period by 20 days (10 days in the case of a tender offer) (15 U.S.C. \u00a718a(e)). The focus of the current premerger notification provision is more clearly directed at the consequences of a merger/acquisition transaction: notification must occur when the transaction will result in the acquiring party's holding assets or voting securities (1) in excess of $200 million, or (2) between $50 million and $200 million plus the assets or voting securities of the acquired party (either a $10 million or $100 million entity being acquired, respectively, by a $100 million or $10 million entity). The current provision also extends, for merger transactions, the period for review of material submitted in response to a second request for information\u2014from 20 to 30 days; and establishes, based on the size of the proposed transaction, a sliding scale of fees required in order for premerger review to begin (the fee previously was $45,000 irrespective of the size of the transaction; the new scale begins at $45,000).
