Although no accurate estimates exist of the number of missing adults, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that as of December 31, 2016, approximately 54,000 cases of missing adults (age 18 and older) were pending in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) system, a federal computerized index with data on crimes and locator files for missing and unidentified persons. Certain adults are particularly vulnerable to missing episodes; for example, those with dementia are at risk for becoming disoriented while engaged in a routine activity and may not be able to determine where they are or get to where they should be. Adults who engage in high-risk behaviors, including involvement in gang activity, may also be more prone to going missing.", "Unlike children, adults have the legal right to go missing under most circumstances. As a result, families of missing adults may receive limited assistance from state and local law enforcement entities in recovering their loved ones. The federal government has not been involved in assisting law enforcement entities with missing adult cases in the same way it has with missing children cases. Further, cases of missing children and young adults under the age of 21 must be reported to the NCIC, while reporting missing adults to the database is voluntary. In recent years, however, the federal government has increasingly played a role in (1) preventing certain types of missing adult incidents; (2) working to recover adults who go missing, including those who are deceased and for whom only remains can be found; and (3) supporting databases, including NCIC, that maintain records of missing adults and unidentified remains.", "Recognizing the needs of a growing aging population, Congress authorized funding for the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert program under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-322). The purpose of the program is to locate and respond to those with Alzheimer's and dementia who go missing. Congress provided appropriations for the program of $750,000 to $2 million annually from FY1996 through FY2015. No funding was appropriated for FY2016 or FY2017. Grants had been awarded under the program to a variety of entities, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), Alzheimer's Association, Project Lifesaver, and universities. In 2000, Congress passed Kristen's Act (P.L. 106-468) to authorize the Department of Justice (DOJ) to make grants to establish a national clearinghouse for missing adults and provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies in locating these individuals. From FY2002 through FY2006, DOJ made grants for these purposes. In addition, the federal DNA Initiative has also supported efforts to recover missing persons and identify unidentified human remains by funding DNA analysis and related assistance.", "In addition to the NCIC, the federal government maintains the National DNA Index System (NDIS), which stores criminal information as well as information on individuals believed to be missing, their relatives, and unidentified human remains; and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), which includes databases for missing adults and unidentified remains. Records are submitted to most of the databases by law enforcement agencies, state missing persons clearinghouses, medical examiners and coroners, or DNA laboratories. The NDIS, NamUs, and NCIC databases can be accessed only by authorized law enforcement and other personnel; however, records in NamUs can also be reviewed by the public.", "Policymakers and other stakeholders have increasingly focused on the coordination of the federal databases on missing persons, as well as the role of the federal government in providing assistance to states and localities to develop alert systems and technology to locate missing adults.

This response is complicated by a number of factors. Unlike children, adults have the legal right to go missing in most cases and may do so to seek protection from a domestic abuser and other related reasons. Further, law enforcement agencies may be hesitant to devote resources to missing adult cases, given competing priorities. Law enforcement agencies within and across states also respond differently to missing adult cases.

However, the true number of unidentified missing adult cases is unknown because remains can go undiscovered, or if they are recovered, they may not be reported to the databases or retained. In a census conducted by DOJ in 2004, medical examiners and coroners reported a total of 13,486 unidentified human remains on record, though about 51% of medical examiner and coroners' offices lacked policies for retaining records such as x-rays, DNA, or fingerprints that could identify missing individuals. (The report also found that 90% of offices serving large jurisdictions did retain such records.) Further, medical examiners and coroners estimated that about 4,400 unidentified human decedents were reported in an average year, with approximately 1,000 (23.0%) remaining unidentified after one year. Another DOJ study estimated, using death records reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1980 through 2004, that as many as 10,300 of these records were for unidentified decedents. This number is an approximation, as states do not uniformly specify on the death certificate when a person's identity is not known. In addition, the criteria used by DOJ to search the death records may have included individuals whose identities were known, as well as unidentified individuals who were later identified.", "The discussion in the next section will show that the databases range in the number of profiles they contain, as well as the type of information they collect, such as basic demographic profiles, DNA profiles, etc. ( Note that only the data on missing persons and unidentified decedents, as reported in NCIC, are regularly updated in this report .)

The stakeholders assert that states should have criteria for activating an alert that limits disclosure of information to the public only when it is absolutely necessary to preserve the missing person's life. They also assert that disclosure of this information should be reserved to the most limited geographic area possible. Further, concerns have been raised that having only selected criteria for the alert may be short-sighted. For example, some have argued that making age the primary factor for issuing an alert overlooks the possibility that age alone does not necessarily signal whether a person is endangered. Another consideration is the extent to which information about a missing person's health background can be broadcast to the public. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Health Privacy Rule\u2014the federal rule that regulates the use or disclosure of protected health information\u2014limits disclosure of health information by health care providers. ", "In 2011, DOJ published a guide to assist states and communities in developing or enhancing what DOJ calls an Endangered Missing Advisory (EMA), or an advisory for individuals who do not meet the AMBER Alert criteria established by DOJ. The guide suggests that EMAs can be issued for missing adults, or for children while law enforcement determines whether a case meets the AMBER Alert criteria. The guide outlines the steps states and communities can take in developing an EMA plan, including creating a task force\u2014comprised of key AMBER Alert stakeholders, broadcasters and other representatives from the media, and law enforcement, among others\u2014that can establish criteria and procedures for the EMA and oversee its operation and effectiveness. The guide suggests that adults may benefit from a different type of alert system than AMBER Alert, and that task forces should determine which elements of the AMBER Alert plan should be used to activate an EMA.", "Still, some states with alert systems could have difficulty coordinating with another state that lacks a similar system. States could also have challenges coordinating with states that have alert systems with different criteria for activating an alert. Although state and local governments have taken the lead in implementing alert systems, the federal government could play a role in coordinating efforts when a missing individual is believed to have crossed state lines as well as assist in the development of formal agreements or protocols for the use of interstate alerts. The federal government could model any policies to coordinate across state lines on the AMBER Alert program, which provides training and technical assistance to states on a number of issues related to abducted children. This training addresses how jurisdictions, including those in different states, can work together to recover children who are abducted, among other topics. Through conference and training exercises, state AMBER Alert coordinators, state and local law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders have opportunities to meet and exchange ideas, which may further facilitate coordination.

One such electronic monitoring program is used by some state and local law enforcement agencies with technology developed by Project Lifesaver International, a nonprofit organization that administers the Project Lifesaver program and has received funding under the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert program. Project Lifesaver uses a personalized wristband that emits a signal to track individuals prone to going missing. The wristband is worn by the clients continuously, and each month, a law enforcement officer or trained volunteer visits with the clients to replace the wristband batteries and provide referrals to clients and their caregivers in need of social services. When family members or caregivers report to the designated Project Lifesaver agency\u2014typically a local law enforcement or first responder agency\u2014that the client is missing, a search and rescue team responds to the wanderer's area to search using a mobile locator tracking system. ", "Project Lifesaver grew out of local law enforcement experience with search and rescue efforts for missing persons with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. The target population of the program has expanded to include children with special needs such as autism and Down's syndrome and to anyone else that may be at risk of wandering for a medical reason.", "In addition to providing the technology, the program trains the designated agency to communicate with persons with Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. Project Lifesaver International reports that the tracking technology is used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies in nearly all states and the District of Columbia. According to Project Lifesaver International, the benefits from the program include saving law enforcement and search and rescue response time and resources in locating missing persons due to wandering. ", "The Alzheimer's Association also has a program, known as Comfort Zone, that uses tracking technology. The program is a web application that includes a location-based mapping service. The enrolled individual carries a tracking device with global positioning system (GPS) technology. Caretakers can track the individual's whereabouts via a secure online website through the Alzheimer's Association. The website includes a map with addresses of the vicinity in which the person is located. Caretakers can also receive alerts and notifications of the individual's whereabouts, such as when the individual leaves a specified radius (e.g., beyond their house or some other location). ", "Tracking technology raises questions about the rights to privacy and autonomy of individuals who are enrolled. These organizations appear to have taken steps to ensure that enrolled participants meet the eligibility criteria and to secure the consent of the enrolled individual, where possible. For individuals who participate in Project Lifesaver, consent usually comes from a caregiver having legal responsibility for the individual. In rare cases, the individual gives consent. Individuals enrolled in Comfort Zone give consent to be enrolled, and in some cases the caregiver with legal responsibility gives consent. According to the Alzheimer's Association, the program is ideally for individuals with early stages of dementia."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
