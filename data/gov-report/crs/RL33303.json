Federally funded, extramural academic research is to be \"classified\" if it poses a security threat; otherwise, it is to be \"unrestricted.\" Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, controls increasingly have been placed on some unclassified research and S&T information, including that used to inform decision making and citizen oversight. These controls include \"sensitive but unclassified\" (SBU) labels; restrictive contract clauses; visa controls; controlled laboratories; and wider legal restrictions on access to some federal biological, transportation, critical infrastructure, geospatial, environmental impact, and nuclear information. Some professional groups have supported voluntary controls on the conduct or publication of sensitive research. Federal agencies do not have uniform definitions of SBU or consistent policies to safeguard or release it, raising questions about how to identify SBU information, especially S&T information; how to keep it from terrorists, while allowing access for those who need to use it; and how to develop uniform nondisclosure policies and penalties. On December 16, 2005, President Bush instructed federal agencies to standardize procedures to designate, mark, and handle SBU information, and to forward recommendations for government-wide standards to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). The Information Sharing Environment Implementation Plan, sent to Congress in November 2006, reports that final action will occur during the lst quarter of CY2006.", "Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, the Bush Administration issued guidance that reversed the Clinton Administration's \"presumption of disclosure\" approach to releasing information under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and cautioned agencies to consider withholding SBU information if there was a \"sound legal basis\" to do so. Some agencies contend that SBU information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, even though such information per se is not exempt under FOIA. The 2002 enactment of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) rendered moot the definition of SBU that some agencies had used since the passage of the Computer Security Act of 1987, which identified sensitive information by content. FISMA requires agencies to categorize the criticality and sensitivity of all information according to the security control objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability across a range of risk levels and to use safeguards based on risk of release. Many federal agencies have not yet fully implemented these new procedures. During the 109th Congress, P.L. 109-90 and P.L. 109-295 focused on management, oversight, and appropriate use of the sensitive security information (SSI) category. Legislative proposals focused on standardizing concepts of \"sensitive\" information; modifying penalties for disclosure; and clarifying FOIA. During the 110th Congress, additional topics likely to be controversial include limiting the number of persons who can designate SBU; widening the use of risk-based approaches to control; centralizing review, handling, and appeals; and evaluating the impact of federal policies on nongovernmental professional groups' prepublication review and self-policing of sensitive research. This report will be updated as necessary."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction to the Issues", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have long confronted the need to balance the release of information for public use with the need to withhold information that could be used to threaten privacy or security. The term \"sensitive but unclassified\" (SBU) information was used before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, even though there is no statutory definition for it. Since 9/11 more agencies have started to use the term \"SBU,\" or some variant of it, and to implement security systems to identify and protect nonclassified information whose release might benefit terrorists. Many questions have been raised about how to design uniform policies and controls for SBU information. This report focuses on controls for two kinds of scientific and technical information\u2014information used in research and scientific publication and information used to serve broader public policy purposes, such as in regulatory decisionmaking and citizen oversight. Both public and privately controlled information are included and in some respects, private professional groups' responses are being defined by public pressures and decisions.", "Two divergent perspectives are discernable. From one perspective, broadening controls to deny public access to federal SBU information will constrain terrorists, who might use it to threaten buildings, infrastructure, people, and services. It has been estimated that \"our adversaries derive up to 80% of their intelligence from open-source information.\" Another source put this at 90%, referring to information about local energy infrastructures, water reservoirs, dams, highly enriched uranium storage sites, and nuclear and gas facilities. Moreover, some say that the potential for terrorism is heightened if terrorists can aggregate seemingly innocuous bits of public information. Although many agencies have begun to limit public access to sensitive information, from this perspective, these efforts are inadequate.", "In contrast to those who seek to widen controls, another view contends that inadequate and insufficient sharing of information with the public and among first responders potentially weakens efforts to protect the nation from terrorist attacks. A related perspective is that as government policy on sharing information shifts to the \"need to know\" rationale that has become more prevalent since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the imposition of more controls will deny ordinary citizens information relating to research, environmental protection, transportation, and so forth that they need in order to be informed and to hold accountable government and industry decisionmakers. Some say new control policies unduly limit access to information needed to advance the progress of science and technology and the development of technologies to counter threats, arguing that if scientific and technical information needs to be restricted, it should be classified.", "This report traces the evolution of SBU-related controls; summarizes actions taken to protect certain types of scientific and technical information; describes critiques of some control policies; and summarizes proposals and actions, including congressional, executive and other initiatives, to clarify these issues and develop policies that serve various stakeholders.

During 2001 and 2002, the heads of several federal agencies with substantial research responsibilities, who did not have classification authority under Executive Order 12958, were given original classification authority. These included the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Also, pursuant to Executive Order 12958, federally funded researchers at any research-performing institution, including universities and colleges, are obligated to report to the government information that they produce that should be classified. In addition, the government may exercise prepublication reviews on some R&D information, and by writing into contracts control clauses for SBU or classified information. Some R&D information is \"born classified,\" according to the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. In addition, pursuant to the Information Security Act of 1951, certain patent information may be classified if release would harm national security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controls on Nonclassified Academic and Industrial Research", "paragraphs": ["Academic and industrial researchers are also subject to sensitive information controls for nonclassified information. Some of these are voluntary and self-imposed by researchers or professional societies and publishers. For instance, in the early 1940s basic physics research in fission was voluntarily withheld from publication by a leading journal, Physical Review , because of fears that publication of research results would benefit German atomic energy research. After the war ended the results were published. However, reportedly, foreign scientists, especially Soviet scientists, deduced that the absence of research publications on the topic meant that Americans \"were pursuing an atomic bomb\" and started their own inquiries on this subject. More recently, some researchers have initiated voluntary controls on the conduct and/or publication of sensitive research in biological sciences fields that might assist terrorists. (For additional details, see the section below entitled \" Controls on Unclassified Biological Research Information .\") In addition, the directors of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) six academic centers of excellence have developed draft guidelines \"to control the dissemination of sensitive information generated by their research\" \u2014which is in the fields of agricultural, chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological, cyber terrorism, and the behavioral aspects of terrorism.", "There are also formal government-mandated controls. For instance, pursuant to sections 3235 and 3295(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2000, the Department of Energy (DOE) released regulations, effective August 18, 2006, that require all users of DOE computers, including persons who e-mail a DOE computer, to give the department written permission for investigators to check any DOE computer accessed by that person for up to three years in the future. The regulation applies to all information, including classified and sensitive but unclassified, and other types. Reportedly, the required paperwork might prove to be costly to some researchers.", "The federal government also mandates controls on contract research. For instance, the issue of federal agency research contracts with universities imposing prepublication review clauses was addressed in an April 2004 report, Restrictions on Research Awards: Troublesome Clauses, released by the Association of American Universities, in cooperation with the Council on Government Relations. It detailed 138 instances of restrictions placed on publications or other prohibitions on foreign nationals as preconditions for receiving research awards. The report opposed the practice, recommended that federal agencies adhere to the mandates of NSDD-189, and concluded that governmental restrictions were not compatible with university research."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Export and Visa Controls", "paragraphs": ["Export control regulations generally do not apply to the conduct of fundamental research as long as it is ordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientific community. However, export control regulations and International Traffic in Arms Control regulations (ITAR) permit the government to require licensing for the export, or \"deemed export,\" of certain scientific and technical information to specific foreign countries or citizens of those countries working in the United States on university campuses or in industrial laboratories. During 2004 and 2005, considerable controversy arose over the publication of two Inspector General reports, one from the Department of Defense (DOD) and the other from the Department of Commerce (DOC). They proposed strict adherence to government interpretations that, even if the research being conducted is fundamental, the operation, technical training, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul, or refurbishing of commercially available equipment used in the research is a \"deemed export\" that requires an export license for certain foreign researchers. This would be for equipment as common as fermenters and global positioning system (GPS) locators and would apply to students from China, Russia, India, and other countries on lists of countries that pose national security threats. In a notice of a proposed rule published in the Federal Register on March 28, 2005, the DOC recommended that country of birth rather than of citizenship or permanent residence be used as the criterion for determining nationality for deemed export controls. DOD's proposed rules, which would require badging, training, and segregated work areas for eligible researchers and exclusion of others, were published in July 2005, when the comment period began.", "Subsequently, some university officials argued that expanded interpretations of rules for \"deemed export\" licenses may be unnecessary. Other members of the academic community cite problems in administering use controls, including ambiguity about identifying which equipment or material in university laboratories is subject to export controls; discrimination on the basis of nationality; difficulty in controlling access of students and researchers in university laboratories; time required to obtain licenses and inflexibility in obtaining licenses; modest security benefits; slowing or preventing important discoveries due to licensing delays; loss of research talent if students and researchers study in other countries; and reduction in research at the leading edge of science.", "The three presidents of the National Academies [of Science, Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine] opposed such controls in a letter to DOC Secretary Carlos M. Guitierrez, June 16, 2005, and made several recommendations, including the proposal to \"[c]lear international students and postdoctoral fellows for access to controlled equipment when their visas are issued or shortly thereafter so that their admission to a university academic program is coupled with their access to use of export controlled equipment.\" One policy group recommended an alternative approach: to require a deemed export license for \"transfers of technology to specifically identified individuals if specific adverse information exists about that individual.\" In a 2005 report prepared at congressional request, a National Academies panel recommended providing all foreign students and researchers engaged in fundamental research with access comparable to that provided to U.S. citizens and permanent residents and to remove \"... all technology items (information and equipment) from the deemed-export technology lists that are available for purchase on the overseas open market from foreign or US companies or that have manuals that are available in the public domain, in libraries, over the Internet, or from manufacturers.\" The National Foreign Trade Council and other related technology groups also have opposed these rules. Others charge universities would have to pay \"... millions of dollars to inventory sensitive equipment, determine students' birthplaces and study which foreigners were using which machines.\"", "In January 2006, a DOC spokesman said that because of comments received on the proposed rule, DOC would modify its procedure and base controls not on country of birth, but on a foreign national's most recent country of citizenship or permanent residency. DOC also established a committee to examine its rules further. Responding to complaints received during the comment period, DOD modified its proposed rules with a new proposal published on August 14, 2006 that said it would withdraw the prescriptive identification requirements proposed in July, but would continue to require researchers to adhere to existing export control rules of the Commerce and State Departments. Final comments were due by October 13, 2006.", "As for other controls to deter terrorism, more governmental scrutiny has been used to review and issue visas for foreign researchers and students, and more items have been placed on the Technology Alert List (TAL), which is now classified. The State Department uses the TAL to identify academic and technical subjects that are viewed as sensitive; foreign students proposing to study these subject undergo extra visa scrutiny under the Visas Mantis program. The State Department also has tightened entry/exit registration of foreign students and scholars and tracks their activities in an effort to deter terrorism. These actions may have prohibited the entry of potential terrorists, but some critics allege that they have reduced the number of foreign students studying science and technology in the United States and increased the number of foreign students studying in other countries. This, they say, portends not only erosion of the U.S. market share of worldwide Higher education, but also a reduction in the number of new U.S. scientific and technical personnel.", "In 2004, the federal government proposed rules declaring that American scientists could not collaborate with, and American publishers could not edit works authored by, scientists in nations that are targets of trade embargoes, including Iran, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, and North Korea. Most scientific societies opposed these proposals on the grounds that they reduced the intellectual freedom of those in other countries and hampered international science. Subsequently, the administering agency, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), decided to permit editing and peer review, but continued to prohibit collaboration between U.S. scholars and researchers in a sanctioned country."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Policies To Control SBU Information", "paragraphs": ["The history through 2002 of using the label SBU was described in detail in CRS Report RL31845, \" Sensitive But Unclassified \" and Other Federal Security Controls on Scientific and Technical Information: Background on the Controversy and is summarized briefly in this section, which also updates action through February 15, 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction to the Term \"SBU\"", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies began to use the term \"SBU\" in the 1970s, but the term has never been defined in statutory law.

It authorized the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), now called the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to create a security-oriented standards program. The definition of \"sensitive information\" was placed within the section that listed NBS's functions, and subsequently NIST became responsible when the agency's name was changed in 1988.

Attorney General John Ashcroft's prior memorandum of October 2001 on this issue was referenced. These statements modified the previous Administration's policy, which urged agencies to release information if there was no \"foreseeable harm\" in doing so.", "Subsequently in 2003, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued guidance based on court decisions that broadened interpretation of exemptions from disclosure under FOIA.

It also recognized the use of nondisclosure agreements for sharing sensitive but unclassified information with state and local personnel. Section 892, as amended, required the President to \"prescribe and implement procedures\" for federal agencies to \"identify and safeguard sensitive homeland security information that is sensitive but unclassified,\" [now abbreviated SHSI] and to prescribe procedures to share this information with other federal agencies and appropriate state and local personnel (required by section 892 (a) (1) (A)(B) of P.L. 107-296 ).

The potential minimum impact value (low, moderate, or high ) on the compromise of a security objective is the highest value (i.e., high-water mark) for security categories for each type of information on the system.", "FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems , the second of the mandatory security standards documents, specifies minimum security requirements for information and information systems supporting the federal agencies and a risk-based process for selecting the security controls necessary to satisfy the minimum security requirements. This standard is intended to establish minimum levels of due diligence for information security and to facilitate a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems that meet minimum security requirements.", "NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems, issued in final version in June 2004, is intended to help agencies identify their information types and systems and to assign impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and availability for them for a range of risk levels. The impact levels are based on the security categorization guidelines in FIPS Publication 199. Special Publication 800-60 gives agencies explicit guidance on developing impact standards for each of the three risk categories for all types of information and information systems handled by federal agencies (based on OMB's Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office's publication, The Business Reference Model Version 2.0 ). Agencies are given guidance to determine impact levels for information in fields such as public health, environmental management, energy, and general sciences and innovation, including research and development. Thus the high-water mark, or highest value category for security impact (and thus minimum security categorization) for both \"Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation Information\" and for \"Research and Development Information,\" is moderate. Examples of minimum security categories for some other types of information are environmental remediation information, moderate; pollution prevention and control, low; and health care services, high. Each explanation describes circumstances, including homeland security and national security-related implications, that agencies could identify to raise the threshold level of security controls for each type of information.", "When agencies need to evaluate the levels of protection for information, they are to undertake a risk assessment using threat and vulnerability analysis that incorporates local conditions and then adjust their security controls using NIST publication SP 800-30. An agency is to identify the minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and technical controls) for information and information systems in each such category as identified in document 800-53, that is Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, February 2005. NIST identified 17 types of security control clusters to guide selection of minimum security controls (i.e., safeguards and countermeasures) to protect information and information systems and 154 uniquely identified controls (i.e., management, operational, and technical security controls) for information and information systems in each category. These include access control; awareness and training; audit and accountability; certification, accreditation, and security assessments; configuration management; contingency planning; identification and authentication; incident response; maintenance; media protection; physical and environmental protection; planning; personnel security; risk assessment; systems and services acquisition; system and communications protection; and system and information integrity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Formal Risk Analysis Process Is Not Required", "paragraphs": ["OMB's apparent operative guidance for information security protection, Appendix III of OMB Circular A-130, cautions agencies that they do not need to conduct expensive, formal risk analyses to fulfill these requirements.

In the past, substantial resources have been expended doing complex analyses of specific risks to systems, with limited tangible benefit in terms of improved security for the systems. Rather than continue to try to precisely measure risk, security efforts are better served by generally assessing risks and taking actions to manage them. While formal risk analyses need not be performed, the need to determine adequate security will require that a risk-based approach be used. This risk assessment approach should include a consideration of the major factors in risk management: the value of the system or application, threats, vulnerabilities, and the effectiveness of current or proposed safeguards.

The board \"...also wants the government to require companies to screen orders for synthetic DNA against the genomes of select agents and to maintain a record of purchase orders. Neither procedure is currently mandated by law.\" Topics for subsequent NSABB meetings include developing oversight plans and implementation processes for these guidelines in academia and in government.

Related to this, a 2006 National Academies report, concerned about how new developments in the life sciences coupled with rapidly advancing fields such as nanotechnology and materials science could prove to threatening, endorsed the free and open change of information in the life sciences to the maximum extent possible. However, it also recommended,", "creating statutorily an independent advisory group in the security community to strengthen scientific and technical expertise within the intelligence and security communities; adopting and promoting a \"common culture of awareness and a shared sense of responsibility within the global communities of life scientists,\" including development of codes of ethics; and establishing, \"... a decentralized, globally distributed network of informed concerned scientists who have the capacity to recognize when knowledge or technology is being used inappropriately or with the intent to cause harm\" and whose interventions could take the form of counseling or \"... reporting such activity to national authorities when its appears potentially malevolent in intent.\"", "Other shortcomings in current policy have been identified. For instance, the scope of the DHHS's NSABB board has been faulted because it does not extend to privately funded research nor harmonize international standards. Others criticize the select agent rules as inadequate and say federal regulations should be expanded to prevent unauthorized persons from possessing the DNA components of a select agent. George Church, a genetics professor at Harvard, reportedly \"is organizing a consortium of researchers and academics to push the federal government to license anyone interested in purchasing DNA segments for agents of bioterror.\" Similarly, John Steinbruner and colleagues at the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM), in a 2005 report, advocated mandatory licensure of researchers and institutions that conduct biodefense research. Three levels of independent review\u2014at the institutional, national, and international level\u2014would monitor risks and benefits of research proposals and would issue approval or disapproval for conduct of researchers and publications.", "Nongovernmental professional groups have explored the use of codes of conduct or self-policing policies for research topics and publications. Some publishers adopted a set of voluntary, risk-based publishing principles, called \"Statement of Scientific Publication and Security,\" 2003; but this, reportedly, has resulted in changes in only very few articles before publication. In June 2005, the American Society for Microbiology drafted a code of ethics for its members and urged them to report to \"appropriate authorities\" misuses of microbiology information. The Interacademy Panel on International Issues, consisting of most of the world's national science academies, issued a set of principles that urged scientists to take responsibility to prevent misuse of their work. Two researchers, Margaret A. Somerville of McGill University and Ronald M. Atlas, President of the American Society for Microbiology, proposed an international code of ethics to prevent bioterrorism. Adherents to the code would refuse to conduct work that could be used in bioterrorism and would seek to restrict access of those they believe could use information maliciously.", "It was noted above in the section on \"Nongovernmental Experts' Recommendations To Use Risk Analysis To Identify and Control Sensitive Information,\" that proposals have been made to instill in researchers a culture that discourages research that could be used malevolently, that professional peer reviews should be conducted before publication of work that should be protected, and that the federal government should define policy controls for these activities. In addition, J. Gaudioso and R. M. Salerno proposed a biosecurity risk assessment process that would restrict the use of agents that have the potential to be weaponized and that could serve as the basis for international standards. This process would involve using", "four Biosecurity levels: low, moderate, high, and extreme risk. The overwhelming majority of pathogens and toxins would fall into the low-risk category (requiring practices such as locking unattended laboratories and maintenance of documentation of agents used), and most select agents would be placed in the moderate-risk category (requiring additional safeguards such as access controls and personnel checks). The security measures for low-and moderate-risk categories should pose reasonable costs and largely rely on existing biosafety measures. Very few agents would be designated high risk (requiring more stringent security measures and a dedicated Biosecurity officer). Perhaps only variola major, because it is no longer found in nature would be considered an extreme risk, requiring the most stringent protections (such as comprehensive background investigations and an on-site guard force). Higher security than that currently mandated by federal regulations would only be applied for those very few agents that represent true weapon threats. Biosecurity levels should be developed and vetted by experts in biological weapons, microbiology, security, and public and agricultural health. This would help federal agencies apply uniform criteria to grantees and could form the basis for standardizing biosecurity internationally.", "Brian J. Gorman proposed a risk-based alternative approach for prepublication peer review. He called for a risk-based process called \"Due Process Vetting System\" (DPVS) together with \"... a Risk Assessment Scale [RAS] and a Least Restrictive Classification System for the communication, assessment, and disposition of sensitive life science research in a manner consistent with national security interests.\" The process would be overseen by a new agency called the Biologic Regulatory Commission, modeled after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The vetting process would be triggered at the request of an author or peer reviewer if an article attained a predetermined score on the RAS set by the BRC. \"The RAS surveys opinions of informed reviewers including the author of the article, the author's Institutional Review Board or Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and finally the journal interested in publishing the article.\" The DPVS would safeguard high-risk articles by providing the government with a mechanism to identify \"potentially dangerous articles before they reach the presses,\" would avoid the \"deleterious effects of censorship,\" and would make articles available only to a \"select academy of biodefense researchers after the authors, the publishing journal and others, reach a consensus with the government through cooperative vetting of the article in question.\" Gorman proposed expanding the academy to a qualified body of world scientists, an approach he said is superior to the ASM model and ad hoc approaches undertaken by the majority of U.S. biosciences journals.", "Some scientists disagree with the types of aforementioned restrictions. Existing controls on \"select agents,\" reportedly, have caused \" ... many researchers ... to discontinue or not pursue research on regulated biological agents, rather than implement the new security regulations and bear the associated financial burden. Reportedly, the CDC expected 817 entities to register under the new select agent rule. Instead, only 323 facilities are registered with the CDC, which indicated that many institutions have discontinued their work with select agents.\" There are also complaints that U.S. \"select agent\" rules can hinder cooperation from foreign scientists who cannot afford security controls and that many foreign laboratories do not meet the standards for conducting such research demanded by the U.S. government. As a result, foreign partners, some charge, may be forced to become \"mere sample exporters,\" and criminal sanctions might be applied to the U.S. partner in a foreign collaboration if the foreigner partner's laboratory does not meet U.S. research security standards. Complaints about the CDC's \"information security\" manual have led to concern by influenza researchers that the CDC is not releasing databases of virus sequences and other data needed to develop flu vaccines, thereby potentially damaging the development of public health protections.", "In addition, at the first NSABB meeting, some members suggested that instead of formal restrictions, ethics education for researchers would suffice to deal with potential problems. Others suggest that controls on biological research information could constrain the exchange of information needed to develop effective defenses against dangerous pathogens. A National Academies report, Seeking Security; Pathogens, Open Access and Genomic Data Bases, published in 2004, that had been requested by the National Science Foundation and the Central Intelligence Agency, concluded that there should be no change in current policies that allow scientists and the public unrestricted access to genome data on microbial pathogens. Access, it concluded, improves the nation's ability to fight both bioterrorism and naturally occurring infectious diseases. Open access to raw sequence data is unlikely to help bioterrorists develop weapons, and preventing distribution of such information could hurt research to prevent bioterrorism and emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Genomic information about most dangerous pathogens is already available, it said, and if the government wants to restrict distribution of information in the future, such information should be classified. The report concluded that security against bioterrorism would be achieved best by policies that facilitate, not limit, the free flow of this information. In May 2005, the DHHS attempted to prevent the National Academy of Sciences from publishing an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on how the U.S. milk supply could be tainted with botulism and control measures to prevent it. The Academy published it on the grounds that the benefits of publishing the paper giving biodefense guidance outweighed any threats.", "Other nations and international scientific groups have addressed this issue. For instance, reportedly a December 13, 2004 paper issued jointly by the United Kingdom's Royal Society and the Wellcome Trust urged caution on government intervention. The joint paper said \"government should ask scientific societies and funding institutions to take more responsibility for vetting and preventing the dissemination of risky technical details. The paper suggested that grant review forms could include a check box for bioterror issues to ensure that they are considered.\" Also, at a meeting in June 2005 in Geneva, life scientists from several countries sought to develop a code of conduct. Biosafety in life sciences research was also a topic of discussion at an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) International \"futures\" program meeting in September 2004, and the National Academies held an International Forum on Biosecurity in Como, in March 2005 to discuss convergence on codes of conduct and oversight of biosecurity research."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues Dealing with Geospatial Information", "paragraphs": ["There is considerable controversy about providing access to certain types of geospatial information, including satellite imagery and maps depicting ordinary geographic features, buildings, sensitive facilities, hazardous materials storage facilities, and so forth.", "Supporting more open access to such information, in March 2004, the RAND Corporation released a study recommending that the federal government should not remove geospatial information such as maps and imagery from public availability because much of it is not current enough to meet terrorists' needs, terrorists can obtain such information from other sources, and the public benefits from access to much federal geospatial information. Instead, it recommended that the federal government develop an analytical process to assess the potential homeland security sensitivity of specific publicly available geospatial information using three filters: usefulness, uniqueness, and societal benefits and costs. Subsequently, in June 2005, the Homeland Security Group of the Federal Geographic Data Committee, an 18-member federal interagency group that coordinates geospatial data, issued for consideration interim and then final guidelines for public, private, and nonprofit organizations that originate and publicly disseminate geospatial data. The guidelines seek to balance \"security risks and the benefits of geospatial data dissemination\" and suggest how organizations can use risk-based procedures to provide access to data while protecting sensitive information. The group observed that safeguarding is justified only for data that contain sensitive information that is difficult to observe and not available from open sources, that are the unique source of the sensitive information, and for which the security risk outweighs the societal benefit of dissemination. Two options were offered to handle sensitive data before public release\u2014changing it to remove or modify the sensitive information by summarizing it, blurring details, and so forth; or restricting the data but maintaining it in original form and making it available to those who need it, such as first responders.", "Congressional action in 2004 tightened controls on some geospatial information.

It summarized the policy dilemma by saying that \"restrictions are clearly needed to safeguard strategic secrets; but openness also is needed to accelerate the progress of technical knowledge and enhance the nation's understanding of potential threats.\" The statement encouraged the government to reiterate government policy that basic scientific research should not be classified, that nonclassified research reporting should not be restricted, and that vague and poorly defined categories of research information, such as sensitive but unclassified, should not be used. \"The inevitable effect is to stifle scientific creativity and to weaken national security.\" The statement outlined \"action points\" for both government and professional societies to consider when developing a dialogue about procedures to safeguard scientific and technical information that could possibly be of use to potential terrorists. An American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) report addressing governmental restrictions on science, observed that \"[t]he 'sensitive but unclassified' and equivalent categories that effectively bar public access to information must be eliminated. All information should either be properly classified or unrestricted.\" Similarly, the American Association of University Professors recommended, \"We should resist or seek to repeal efforts to regulate unduly, or to make secret, the results of lawful research projects under novel uses of the \"sensitive but unclassified\" rubric.\" The National Academies held a workshop on this subject early in 2003, in cooperation with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Some agencies' policies are illustrated in Appendix A , elsewhere in this report, and in other reports. For example, nondisclosure agreements are authorized in P.L. 107-296 relating to sharing of SHSI with state and local government personnel (sec. 892) and for handling SSI (sec. 1601). Section 214 of the law allows penalties consisting of imprisonment, fines, administrative penalties or dismal from employment for employees of DOT and DHS who inappropriately share CII information. DHS Management Directive 11042.1 prescribes penalties consisting of administrative or disciplinary actions for DHS employees and contractors for disclosing SBU information. DHHS has nondisclosure provisions and penalties for disclosure of select agent information and other sensitive information, as does the CDC for SBU information and the USDA, for sensitive information.

The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) may penalize unauthorized release of certain types of SBU information and unclassified nuclear information.

This contentious policy issue has been addressed in existing law, Department of Justice (DOJ)documents, congressional hearings, and in statements issued by the American Bar Association, among others. Contrasting differences in interpretation characterize this issue. As noted, the CSA specified it \"was not to be construed to constitute authority to withhold information sought pursuant to the FOIA, or to authorize any federal agency to limit, restrict, regulate, or control, among other actions, the disclosure, use, transfer, or sale of any information disclosable under the FOIA....\" According to the DOJ's Freedom of Information Act Guide, May 2004, SBU and SHSI are not to be exempt from disclosure under FOIA, except for CII (which is protected pursuant to P.L. 107-296 ) and other kinds of sensitive information protected by statute\u2014which now includes SSI (pursuant to P.L. 107-296 ), some land remote sensing geospatial information (pursuant to P.L. 108-375 ), and some information controlled by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

For instance, as described above, the DOJ Freedom of Information Act Guide describes broad court interpretations that may permit justifiable withholding of sensitive information under FOIA. Also, the Administration has issued instructions to agencies to attempt to use FOIA to protect information if release would harm homeland security. The Card memo, discussed earlier and which guides agencies on handling of SBU information, referred to the Attorney General's memo of October 2001, which instructed agencies, when making discretionary decisions to determine if information is exempt from disclosure under a FOIA exemption, to withhold information if it is legal to do so. It emphasized that agencies should to try to withhold sensitive information under FOIA to protect the nation from terrorist threat, and said that the Department of Justice would support agency determinations.", "Agencies also differ on how requests to release information under FOIA will be handled. Illustrations of the variety in federal agencies' proposed or existing policies are given in Appendix A and are outlined here. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued proposed rules in February 2005 for \"Safeguards Information\" (SGI)\u2014unclassified sensitive information deemed too sensitive for public release, which it said should be withheld from public access and released only to those with a \"need to know\" even though it was not classified. In 2005 guidance, CDC said its SBU information is information that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. This was modified in 2006 to require that if a request is received for a document marked SBU, it should be reviewed to determine if it qualifies for an exemption under FOIA and withholding. DHS's management directive 11042.1 on SBU said all information identified as SBU should be labeled FOUO and would include any information that might adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of federal programs; information so labeled and requested under FOIA would be released only on a case-by-case basis, will not be distributed to unauthorized persons, and should be protected and disseminated only to those with a \"need to know.\" The DHS draft directive on categorical exemptions for environmental impact information, dated June 14, 2004, proposed exclusion for disclosure under FOIA.

However, FERC's claims are based not on any court-accepted interpretation of FOIA, but on the Justice Department's potpourri of possible exemptions. ...The other problem is that FERC wanted to continued to share this information during its proceedings, requiring it to create a non-FOIA process of disclosure to those parties with a 'need to know,' which required parties to sign a nondisclosure agreement. It is difficult to see how information that was previously public could become non-public based solely on agency regulations.", "Reportedly in 2006, controversy arose between Connecticut's State Attorney General and FERC about the state's attempt to access information regarding a proposed Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) plant. The state sought information to review design and safety considerations and to determine whether building the plant would endanger the health and safety of state residents.

Thomas S. Blanton, Director of the George Washington University National Security Archive, testified at the March 2, 2005 hearing that use of the term SBU thwarts the intent of FOIA and almost forces government bureaucrats to withhold such information:", "We have heard from officials at the Department of Justice that these new pseudo classifications are simply guidance for safeguarding information, and do not change the standards under the Freedom of Information Act.

The document briefed Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge on an upcoming meeting with the Pakistani Foreign Minister, but evidently officials could not identify any national security harm from release of the briefing, and fell back on the new tools of SBU, together with the much-abused \"deliberative process\" exemption to the Freedom of Information Act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Action, to Clarify FOIA, with Implications for SBU", "paragraphs": ["On February 13, 2006, the American Bar Association House of Delegates adopted a recommendation, accompanied by a background report, that \"urges the Attorney General of the United States to issue a memorandum to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) officials at federal agencies clarifying that the designation of agency records as 'sensitive but unclassified' cannot be a basis for withholding agency documents from release.\" The recommendation also called for establishing a standard policy for \" ... designating information as \"sensitive but unclassified; ... the internal handling of such information; ...taking into account the sensitive nature of such information; and ... ensuring the release of such information unless exempt under FOIA.\"", "Legislative action has been taken to clarify the relationship of some SBU information to FOIA.

Similarly, the President could task ISCAP to receive and evaluate challenges to controls that have been imposed on unclassified information, in addition to its current oversight of classified information.

Will DHS's SBU controls on \"developing technology or current technology\" affect information generated by DHS-funded research and development grants and contracts? Can risk-based procedures be used effectively to control access to, and dissemination of, scientific and technical information, and can they effectively balance access and control? Would the use of risk-based procedures generate control procedures different from those used in existing SBU information control systems? What is the cost (administrative and financial) of SBU information control regimes, the actions needed to implement them, and to safeguard SBU information indefinitely? Would there be a significant difference in cost-effectiveness calculations for implementing risk-based analysis procedures versus some of the currently used SBU procedures?
