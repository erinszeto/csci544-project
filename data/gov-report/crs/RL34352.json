The enacted bill reorganizes the Department's Research, Education, and Economics mission area, which currently comprises four agencies that separately administer intramural and extramural programs supporting agricultural research and development (R&D).", "The research title of P.L. 110-246 (Title VII) classifies all current research, extension, and education programs into two groups\u2014capacity programs and competitive programs\u2014based upon the way in which their funding is distributed to recipients. Title VII creates an umbrella coordinating entity known as the Research, Education, and Extension Office (REEO) in the Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics, and designates the Under Secretary as the Chief Scientist of USDA. The REEO will coordinate and plan both capacity and competitive programs, as well as USDA-administered intramural (Agricultural Research Service (ARS)) and extramural programs. Extramural programs (both capacity and competitive), currently administered by the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES)), will be transferred to a new National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA), and CSREES will cease to exist on October 1, 2009.", "Within the new NIFA, the existing National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program (NRI) will be expanded into an Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI). It will incorporate the purposes of the former Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems (IFAFS), whose authority the new farm bill repeals.", "The House and Senate versions of the farm bill would have provided $865 million and $160 million, respectively, in mandatory funding for certain research programs over the five-year life of the bill. The enacted bill provides a total of $333 million in mandatory funds for (1) a new specialty crop research initiative ($230 million); (2) research on fresh produce food safety ($25 million); and (3) organic agriculture research ($78 million).", "The enacted farm bill research title includes major initiatives to provide capacity-building support to Hispanic-serving agricultural colleges and to make them eligible to receive funding through a wider range of grant programs.", "This report will not be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for conducting agricultural research at the federal level, and for providing partial support for cooperative research, extension, and post-secondary agricultural education programs in the states.

In addition to research in the biological sciences, the mission also includes substantial economic data collection and analysis.", "The state partners are the colleges of agriculture at land grant universities in 50 states and eight U.S. territories, with their affiliated state agricultural experiment stations, schools of forestry and veterinary medicine, and cooperative extension. There also are 18 historically black land grant colleges of agriculture (the 1890 institutions) and more than 30 Native American colleges that gained land grant status in 1994 (referred to as the tribal colleges). Small grant programs have supported agricultural education at Hispanic-serving institutions, and at Alaskan and Hawaiian native-serving institutions. The omnibus farm bill enacted May 22, 2008, also extends eligibility for certain research, education, and extension programs to non-land grant institutions that offer degree programs in agriculture."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Issues", "paragraphs": ["USDA differs from other federal research agencies in allocating the majority of its annual research appropriation directly to in-house research (ARS, ERS, and NASS). Most federal science agencies primarily fund extramural research through a competitive, peer-reviewed grant process. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has recommended for more than a decade that at least 35% of total USDA research money be distributed competitively. When the Academy first made its recommendation in 1989, it determined that less than 6% of USDA's research funding was competitively awarded. In FY2006 it was approximately 14%, according to CRS calculations.", "The primary and longest-standing mechanisms for distributing annual federal appropriations to the colleges of agriculture at the state land grant universities are contained in the Hatch Act of 1887 (for cooperative research) and the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 (for extension activities). Formulas set forth in each of these acts determine how annual federal appropriations are divided among states. The majority of funding for state-level programs, however, comes from state appropriations, competitive grants from USDA and other federal agencies, and private industry. States are required to match Hatch and Smith-Lever formula funds; most states appropriate three to four times the federal allotment. Nonetheless, despite the fact that federal formula funds represent only a small percentage of total funding at the state level, they traditionally have been viewed by state research and extension directors as a very reliable source of support for their core programs.", "Congress has set the policies and authorized the funding for USDA's research, education, and extension programs as part of omnibus farm bills since 1977. Permanent authority for most of the programs resides in older laws, but the farm bill renews the authorization for appropriations.", "To address the challenges posed by the perceived need to increase competitive grants in agriculture, several major proposals released in advance of congressional debate on the research title recommended significant changes in how ARS and CSREES are structured and administered."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Proposals for Change", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Administration's Proposal", "paragraphs": ["In the comprehensive farm bill proposal that USDA released in February 2007, the Administration proposed to rename the Research, Education, and Economics mission area the Office of Science, and to merge ARS and CSREES into a single agency conducting both intramural and extramural programs under the leadership of a Chief Scientist. The proposal called for the current formula-funded authorities to be retained. ERS and NASS would be the other two agencies also under the Office of Science. The Administration maintained that an integration of budgets and programs would provide more efficient and effective program implementation and resource allocation. In its call for a unified budget and a single scientific agency, this proposal mirrored some of the key aspects of the land grant system's CREATE-21 proposal (see below)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2002 Farm Bill Task Force Proposal", "paragraphs": ["In Section 7404 of the 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ), Congress commissioned a task force \"to conduct a review and evaluation of the merits of establishing one or more National Institutes focused on disciplines important to the progress of food and agricultural sciences,\" among other things. The task force recommendations, released in July 2004, called for the formation of a National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) within USDA \"to supplement and enhance, not replace, the existing research programs.\" The task force conceived of the NIFA as a separate entity solely for awarding competitive peer-reviewed grants, and called for an annual budget for the institute to build to $1 billion over a five-year period. The task force proposal was reflected in companion House and Senate bills prior to congressional activity on drafting a farm bill ( H.R. 2118 (C. Peterson)/ S. 971 (Bond)).

The key provisions included (1) putting all of USDA's intramural and extramural research, education, and extension agencies (including the research arm of the Forest Service) under one administrative body, working with a unified budget; (2) providing $200 million annually in mandatory funds and substantial annual increases in appropriated funds (to 171.5% of the current level of $2.67 billion) in FY2012; and (3) providing opportunities for minority and smaller schools, both land grant and non-land grant, to expand their capacity for agricultural research, education, and extension.
