TANF's predecessor program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), historically assisted non-working single mothers. The debates leading to the 1996 law focused on how to move those single mothers from welfare to work.", "TANF provides states with flexibility in how they design their programs. It has national goals, one of which is ending dependence of needy parents on government benefits by, in part, promoting job preparation and work. To enforce that goal, TANF requires that 50% of each state's TANF families with an adult recipient include a member who is either working or engaged in welfare-to-work activities. There are credits that states may receive that lower the 50% goal for states that have reduced caseloads or spend from their own funds more than the amount required under TANF. Thus, there are four different routes for states to meet the work participation standard: (1) caseload reduction (i.e., reducing the number of families receiving TANF assistance); (2) excess state spending; (3) providing assistance to those already working (\"unsubsidized employment\"); and (4) engaging otherwise non-employed recipients in welfare-to-work activities, such as job search, education and training, community service, work experience, and subsidized employment.", "The main performance measure for TANF is the work participation rate (WPR), which measures the share of families in the caseload with a member who is either working or engaged in welfare-to-work activities. The WPR is compared annually to the state's after-credit numerical goal to determine whether it met the work participation standard. The national average WPR fluctuated around 30% from FY2002 through FY2011. Most states met the work participation standard through a combination of caseload reduction, excess spending credits, and a WPR below 50%. Over that period, about half of the national WPR was comprised of recipients in unsubsidized jobs.", "In recent years, the national TANF average WPR has increased; it approached 50% for the first time in FY2015. This increase is due to states using TANF dollars to implement \"earnings supplement\" programs, separate from the regular TANF cash assistance programs. Earnings supplement programs provide benefits, usually small ones ($10 to $50 per month), to families with working parents who are not in regular state TANF assistance programs. Some earnings supplement programs provide benefits to those who left regular state TANF cash assistance programs; others provide benefits to families without any necessary connection to regular TANF cash assistance. Despite this, families who receive these TANF-funded benefits are counted toward the WPR.", "Throughout the history of TANF, participation in welfare-to-work activities has been relatively modest. In FY2015, out of a monthly average of 743,000 non-employed TANF work-eligible individuals, 143,000 (less than 1 in 5) were reported as engaged in welfare-to-work activities.", "TANF now has a record of 20 years, highlighted by (1) caseload reduction, with particularly large caseload declines in the early years; (2) an increase in the share of families receiving assistance with a parent who is employed; and (3) modest rates of participation in welfare-to-work activities among those who are not otherwise employed. If policymakers wish to increase engagement of non-employed recipients, a number of questions would be raised\u2014including whether TANF's flexibility with the performance standards structure provides sufficient incentives to increase engagement, or whether other program models, such as a separate program dedicated to work activities for assistance recipients, should be considered."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides federal funding to states, tribes, and territories for a wide range of benefits, services, and activities to address both the effects of and the root causes of child poverty.

TANF replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which was a cash assistance program for needy families with children. Most of these children were in families with a non-employed single mother. A major focus of the debates leading to the 1996 welfare reform law was how to move non-employed single mothers from welfare to work.", "TANF is a broad-purpose block grant with national goals.

States may also count state expenditures made for TANF-eligible families on these benefits, services, and activities toward the TANF state spending requirement, known as the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement.

The remaining TANF dollars included those spent on activities to support work (child care, refundable tax credits) and on an array of social services, including early childhood education (pre-K) and services for families in which the children have experienced, or were at risk of experiencing, abuse and neglect (child welfare services). These activities are broader than those that were financed in TANF predecessor programs, and they can fund benefits for populations other than those eligible for or receiving cash assistance. Note that even the $2.1 billion for work program expenditures might reflect services provided to persons in families with children who are not receiving cash assistance. ", "As indicated on the figure, a major use of TANF funds is to support those in families with children, and who are already working, as opposed to the pre-1996 focus on supporting families with a non-employed single parent. The child care expenditures and refundable tax credits (e.g., state add-ons to the Earned Income Tax Credit) generally go to working families. Additionally, as discussed in this report, a greater share of those receiving assistance under TANF are working compared to those who received cash assistance under AFDC.", "The wide range of uses of TANF funds\u2014and the ability to use state-funded expenditures for any program providing services to TANF-eligible families\u2014mean that TANF is effectively not a single program, but a funding stream.

Currently, states are given credit for caseload declines from FY2005 to the most recent prior year. That, is, caseload reduction credits for FY2015 are based on caseload declines from FY2005 through FY2014. However, states are not given credit for caseload reduction that results from changes in federal or state policies. In determining a state's caseload reduction credit, the state provides HHS with (1) its gross caseload decline and (2) an estimate of the effects of policy changes on that decline. The caseload reduction credit is given for net caseload reduction, after the effects of policy changes are factored out. ", "For example, for FY2015 states would be given credit for net caseload declines from FY2005 through FY2014. If a state's net caseload decline was 25%, it would receive a 25 percentage point credit against its work participation standard. Its standard would be 50% minus 25 percentage points, or 25%. The 25% would be the minimum WPR that the state would have to achieve to meet its standard. ", "Historically, the caseload reduction credit has played a fairly large role. The caseload reduction credit originally included in the 1996 welfare reform law measured caseload reduction from FY1995 (before the welfare reform law). The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ) changed the base year for measuring caseload declines, effective FY2007, providing credits for caseload declines from FY2005.", " Figure 2 shows the number of families receiving assistance from FY1995 to FY2014. It shows particularly sharp caseload declines in the late 1990s; after 2000, the caseload continued to fall, but at a slower rate. Caseloads temporarily increased in response to the 2007-2009 recession, but began to fall again in FY2011.

Figure 3 shows the cumulative caseload decline measured from either FY1995 (for years before DRA was effective) or FY2005 (for years after DRA was effective) for the nation as a whole. In the early 2000s, the cumulative caseload decline from FY1995 exceeded 50%.", "The figure is intended to illustrate how the caseload decline translated into large caseload reduction credits. The actual credits were determined on a state-by-state basis, and also netted out the effect of policy changes. In FY2002, which used caseload reduction from FY1995 to FY2001 to determine the caseload reduction credit, the credit was 50 percentage points in 21 states. This reduced the minimum WPR for these states to 0%; they did not need to have a single work-eligible individual working or in activities to meet the standard.", "The figure also shows smaller cumulative caseload declines for FY2007 and thereafter, when the DRA change to measuring caseload declines from FY2005 forward was effective. Though caseloads rose in response to the 2007 to 2009 recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) froze caseload reduction credits through their application to the FY2011 standard, so that the caseload increase in response to the 2007-2009 recession did not reduce the caseload reduction credit and increase the minimum WPR states would have to meet.

These families are then added to other caseload reductions that states have in determining their overall caseload reduction credit.", "The credit for excess state spending was little used until the DRA change to the caseload reduction credit that measured caseload decline from FY2005 rather than FY1995 became effective. Following the implementation of that change in FY2007, the number of states claiming the excess state spending credit increased.

The continued caseload declines in the face of increasing child poverty since 2000 led to concerns that the program was not meeting the needs of poor families.

This percentage had already slipped to 47% in 2000 and fell further after that point, reaching 28% in 2012. TANF also reached fewer families with children, even those in the deepest of poverty.

There have also been proposals to raise the one-year limit on counting vocational education training. Opponents of these proposals often cite the pre-1996 research that indicated that \"human capital\" development programs (those emphasizing education and training) did not result in better outcomes for recipients than did programs emphasizing job search and quick job attachment. That research is now quite old, and the economy, the educational attainment of the labor force, and the types of education and training programs that are available have changed.

Pre-1996 research indicated that community service and work experience programs provided useful services to their communities, but generally failed to improve employment outcomes for recipients. Again, that research is dated. ", "There has been recent interest in subsidized employment programs.

In particular, two programs were evaluated: one in Philadelphia that was targeted to long-term TANF assistance recipients, and another in New York for ex-offenders. Both programs raised incomes of participants while they were in subsidized jobs. However, they did not show longer-term, positive employment impacts.

If a state can meet its work participation standard through a combination of caseload reduction, excess state spending, or unsubsidized employment, it receives the same amount of federal funding if it engages non-employed recipients in activities or not. If it engages non-employed recipients in activities, the state receives the same amount of money if it engages a recipient in a relatively cheap welfare-to-work activity (e.g., job search) versus a relatively expensive activity (e.g., supported work).", "Additionally, relying on performance measures to enforce national policy objectives runs a number of risks. Performance measures are meant to change behavior\u2014in this case, the behavior of those who design and administer TANF programs. Sometimes performance measures change behaviors in ways that policymakers intend them to, and other times they change behaviors in unintended ways. The performance measure literature has identified some \"dysfunctional responses,\" when the action taken to meet a performance standard does not efficiently further the true objective of an organization or program. That is, the response to a performance measure could mean that a state is \"hitting the target but missing the point.\" The use by states of earnings supplement programs to meet the TANF work participation standard could be viewed as such a dysfunctional response.", "Moreover, any performance system needs a standard, or goal to reach. As discussed above in \" What Rate of Engagement Can Be Expected? \", there is no recent research to inform what participation rate a state could or should be able to achieve. TANF's track record indicates that setting an arbitrary, national standard without consideration of what a state might reasonably achieve could lead to dysfunctional responses, rather than having states raise engagement in activities.", "Congress could consider alternate program structures that might create more incentives for states to serve non-employed cash assistance recipients. For example, it could create a separate program, with dedicated funding, to provide employment services and/or work opportunities for non-employed recipients. Separate funding streams dedicated to work or a limited range of activities have been added to TANF in the past. The Welfare-to-Work grant program, enacted by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ), added dedicated funding for work activities for hard-to-serve TANF recipients and related populations for FY1998 and FY1999. While the evaluation of that program lacked an examination of program impacts, it did show results in increased service capacity, find a new focus on serving non-custodial parents, and provide some lessons for other welfare-to-work efforts. As noted above, the ECF was added to TANF by ARRA. Its funding for FY2009 and FY2010 was limited to basic assistance, non-recurrent short-term benefits, and subsidized employment. This led to the creation of the TANF subsidized employment programs and the current interest in that type of program intervention.", "Appendix A.

However, few states have ever had to meet the full standard because the percentages are reduced for caseload reduction or state spending in excess of what is required under the TANF MOE. The caseload reduction credit lowers a state's 50% and 90% standards based on caseload reduction measured from FY2005, reducing it by one percentage point for each decline of 1% in the caseload. Additionally, under HHS regulations promulgated in 1999, states may also receive credits for spending in excess of what they are required to spend under the MOE requirement. States may consider families assisted by spending in excess of MOE as caseload reduction, and hence receive extra caseload reduction credits for such families.", "For example, if a state achieves caseload reduction (including the effect of caseload reduction from excess MOE) of 25%, the state's work participation standard for the all-family standard is reduced by 25 percentage points\u2014from 50% to 25%.
