These studies have examined both the economy-wide effects, as well as the effects to specific sectors. Two principal reports on the economic effects to the U.S. agriculture and forestry sectors were conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). As described by USDA, these studies generally concluded that the overall economic costs to the agricultural community of the proposed legislation would be modest. Both studies further suggested that farm revenues from carbon offsets could result in net economic gains for the U.S. agricultural sectors.Concerns have been raised regarding the results of the EPA and USDA analyses, as well as the potential effects of a carbon offset market established by a cap-and-trade system. Many in the U.S. farming community have expressed concern that these analyses estimate that 60 to 65 million acres of U.S. agricultural land could be converted to woodlands by 2050. This conversion would be the result of farmers and landowners choosing to participate in the emerging carbon markets through additional tree-planting, in response to expected high carbon prices. Some believe this could take land out of crop production, removing farmers from the business of food production, and raising food prices to consumers. In addition, some in the farming community have expressed concern that only certain landowners and agricultural producers might benefit in the carbon offset market. Some worry that only larger landowners and farmers might benefit from a carbon offset program, which could result in further industry consolidation in the farming sectors, exacerbating difficult business conditions for smaller, traditional farmers. Others worry that only certain crop producers will benefit, resulting in inequities across all crop producers.", "Given the general uncertainty about the possible outcomes of a likely regulatory process, following the still uncertain passage of climate legislation in Congress, it is not possible to definitively predict or provide a quantitative assessment of the potential implications or participation rates within a future carbon offset program. Regarding available economic modeling projections of land-use changes, many variables and factors complicate the analyses and projections of cropland conversion rates should be regarded with caution. Among the types of factors are: assumptions in the models of high and rising carbon prices that substantially influence the modeling results; missing farm-level costs, such as transaction costs associated with the future regulatory regime and possible foregone revenue from farm support programs; regional and biological variability that might not be precisely reflected in the model; possible physical capacity constraints and limitations to support substantial afforestation efforts; and possible legal and contractual constraints that might affect participation in the carbon market, given differences in the U.S. crop sectors between farmland ownership and leasing in the United States.", "The available economic models are even more limited in their ability to predict land-use changes or other potential changes under a carbon offset market, differentiating among producers and production areas. Anecdotally, the evidence about whether or not some operations and production regions might benefit more than others is mixed. Some evidence suggests that larger landowners and farming operations may have greater opportunities to participate in carbon markets, because of their economies of scale and their likely lower transactions costs compared to smaller landowners and farmers. Alternatively, smaller-sized operations might have greater opportunities to participate in carbon offset projects, because they are more likely to own their land and generally tend to be more operationally diverse, and the expected continued role of designated middlemen in generating and marketing carbon offsets."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress is currently debating climate legislation which could affect the U.S. agriculture and forestry sectors.

The USDA analysis further considered the possibility that increases in farm production costs would be mitigated by freely distributed tradable allowances (akin to currency) to U.S. fertilizer manufacturers under the legislative proposals' allowances for \"energy-intensive and trade-exposed\" industries. Both EPA and USDA projected economic gains from the possible resource shifts in changing agricultural markets, including land use conversions and related crop production and market changes. In particular, the results showing substantial possible conversion of cropland to forestland under a carbon offset program have stirred some controversy in the agricultural community. (This is discussed further under \"Potential Land Conversion,\" below.)", "Almost all of the studies predict that energy costs would rise under a GHG cap-and-trade system, though the estimated magnitudes vary widely. Several studies also examine the potential harm to the U.S. agriculture sectors from climate change, absent policy changes designed to mitigate such effects, as part of efforts to evaluate the possible economy-wide benefits of climate change legislation. (See Appendix B . )", "The general economic conclusions of the potential for net agricultural sector gains have been supported by some additional economic studies. Various studies conclude that, despite higher energy and farm-level input costs, the expected gains to the U.S. farming sector from a cap-and-trade system will result in net benefits to the entire sector. Among the predicted gains are expected higher commodity prices, due to modest consumer response and potential short crop supplies, and alternative sources of farm revenue from increasing bioenergy demand and offset income opportunities. New markets for carbon offsets via afforestation and bioenergy crops would increasingly compete for available land, raising farmland values. Also, producers shifting land out of crop production to participate in biofuels or carbon offset markets, thus raising crop prices, would likely present additional production opportunities to farmers that might not be willing or able to participate in the emerging biofuels or carbon offset markets. These benefits would generally accrue to all U.S. crop and animal producers.", "Nonetheless, some are worried about the possible implications for crop production, food prices, and trade. In response to concerns, USDA has indicated that it would re-examine its model, modeling assumptions, and results regarding cropland conversion.

Mitigation potential estimates are the raw data, without economic and implementation limitations, that are inputs into models estimating offset use in a cap-and-trade program.

Particularly relevant design choices include: which sources are covered; which types of offset projects are allowed; whether or not offset use is limited; and the degree to which set-aside allowances are allotted to activities that may otherwise qualify as offsets. Policymakers' treatment of international offsets also would have a substantial effect on domestic offset development. Technological development . The development and market penetration of low- and/or zero-carbon technologies in both covered and non-covered sectors would likely have substantial effects. These technologies could lower the costs of the cap-and-trade program, making fewer (in covered sectors) or more (in non-covered sectors) offset projects cost effective. Carbon market price. The market price of carbon emissions reductions would determine the supply and type of offsets that would be economically competitive in a cap-and-trade system. As the price increases, more (and different types of) projects would become cost effective. Future carbon prices are difficult to predict, as they depend on numerous variables, including offset treatment (i.e., the policy choices described above). Other factors.

Simulation models are theoretical constructs designed to represent a system or group of functionally interrelated elements forming a complex whole. At best, simulation models provide a simplified framework to illustrate highly complex spatial and temporal dynamics, interrelationships, and processes. They depend highly on available data and, inevitably, on the simplifying assumptions necessary to depict the underlying relationships and processes of complex systems. This complexity can be attributed to a number of factors that are difficult to quantify, including resource limitations, environmental and geographical constraints, site-specific conditions, individual and cooperative decision processes, institutional and legal requirements, and general uncertainty and variability. Consequently models often rely on simplistic assumptions, such as perfect market competition (e.g., assuming theoretical supply and demand conditions) or optimum behavioral outcomes (e.g., assuming that all farmers and landowners are profit maximizers, and follow required protocols to manage their operations to maximize on-site carbon sequestration).

This includes information suggesting that U.S. cropland would be converted to woodlands, as farmers' respond to expected favorable market conditions and prices under a future carbon offset market.

At certain rising price levels, the FASOM model projects that a total of 60 to 65 million agricultural acres could be converted to woodlands by 2050, including 35 to 50 million acres of cropland. (See Table 1 .) Compared to current estimates of total cropland acres (about 406 million acres in 2007), this would mean that cropland acres could drop by more than 11% below current levels. Projections beyond 2050 indicate continued conversion. These results have caused some concern about the possible implications for crop production, food prices, and international trade. Specifically, some speculate that cropland conversions of this magnitude could reduce crop production and, in turn, raise food prices. Opportunities for export might also be reduced, given expected reduced overall food supplies. To put this projected decrease into perspective, however, it is worth noting that cropland acres decreased by 28 million acres\u2014more than 6%\u2014in the five years between the two most recent Census of Agriculture periods (2002 and 2007). Under the USDA-administered voluntary land retirement program, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a total of 31 million acres are enrolled nationally.

Under a modeling scenario where the carbon price begins in 2010 and remains constant at $15 per MT CO 2 -Eq. (metric tons of CO 2 -equivalent), the predicted land conversion grows markedly at the onset of the new market, but then remains more or less constant over the modeling period (shown for 2020-2050). However, under a scenario where the base carbon price starts in 2010 at $15 per MT CO 2 -Eq. and rises at 5% per year, land conversion would nearly triple from 2020-2050. Note also that EPA and USDA used different price paths to generate their land conversion estimates. As Figure 1 illustrates, EPA's price path was higher, starting at $15 per MT CO 2 -Eq. (2004 dollars) and reaching $106 per MT CO 2 -Eq. by 2050. USDA's price path assumed a price of $13 (2005 dollars) per MT CO 2 -Eq., rising to $70 per MT CO 2 -Eq. in 2050.", "These assumed prices do not account for possible program discounts, unintentional reversals, possible error margins related to measurement and sequestration potential, or discounting due to other types of transaction costs. Nevertheless, these results illustrate the importance of the underlying assumptions about the market carbon price in influencing the modeling results within the agricultural and forestry offset market. ", "The USDA analysis further refers to other studies that examined alternative assumptions, including lower estimates for future market prices. These studies show that at price levels of less than $10 per MT CO 2 -Eq., offsets would be generated mostly by changes in agricultural production practices, rather than by afforestation.

Motivated by the possibility of additional farm-level profits and revenues from sources other than the more traditional food, fiber, and fuel markets, it seems likely that farmers would convert their land holdings. Accordingly, participation in carbon offset market would merely be a response to an alternative financial venture available to farmers and landowners, who are simply responding to favorable market incentives. In other words, at some carbon price, the return on investment on afforestation and other offset activities is greater than that for conventional crop mixes, and the model reflects these market changes through projected higher afforestation and land-use changes that could lower total farmed acres. These results are consistent with simplifying assumptions built into most economic models, including that used by EPA to evaluate the proposed climate legislation. (For additional background on these assumptions and related topics, see discussion in the text box titled \"Economic Model Assumptions versus Other \"Real World\" Considerations.\")", "However, farmers and landowners may not behave in a purely economically rational, profit-maximizing manner. As discussed previously, farmers face many non-economic incentives that may influence their behavior. Converting cropland to forestland could meet social and/or cultural hurdles. For example, fourth-generation grain farmers may not wish to participate in an emerging carbon offset market, regardless of the perceived market incentives; they might be motivated by other social factors not related strictly to profits, such as transferring the farm to their children. ", "In addition, while crop production is subject to natural hazards (insects, diseases, severe storms, etc.), the longer-term commitment for forests exacerbates the risk from natural hazards and adds at least one hazard\u2014wildfire\u2014 not typically faced in crop production. On the other hand, some risks might be ameliorated, as forests are less susceptible to catastrophic failures from short-term drought or individual storms. Nonetheless, considering these additional risks and the time commitment involved, some landowners may decide to continue with their current operations.", "Moreover, a future carbon market would be inherently uncertain, as the implementation details of the program are unknown and would follow future EPA and/or USDA rulemaking processes. Once the program is established, the requirements would become more predictable, but the initial startup would involve adjustment and transition among farmers and landowners. During this transition, landowners might not be readily willing to risk such uncertainty; they might also be skeptical of participating in a market that might be strictly regulated by governmental authorities. EPA's and USDA's models cannot account for these factors. ", "Another consideration is the potential learning-curve of education and experience. Although some farmers and landowners may be more familiar with agroforestry activities and land set-aside programs, some are not. Converting cropland to forestland substantially alters the day-to-day, on-the-ground practices of the landowner, and requires a different set of tools and equipment. Such changes, combined with the longer-term commitment for forests, could meet resistance from landowners. Further, technical assistance and educational outreach may be required in areas where forestry is not commonly practiced. ", "Studies evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of land use changes (primarily agricultural to urban) have found communal pressures against conversion, due to the cooperative nature of production agricultural activities, such as equipment sharing, land renting, custom work, and irrigation system development. Dramatic land-use changes would potentially eliminate or reduce these benefits for traditional cropland owners. Conversely, farmers may continue to benefit from the traditional information sharing and formal and informal business relations that currently exist among neighboring farms. Multiple landowners converting to forestry may create a network of support that could expand afforestation in some areas. In addition, farmers could also benefit from the additional environmental services that forests can provide (e.g., clean water and wildlife habitat for hunting)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Accounting of All Financial Costs", "paragraphs": ["Participating in and complying with the new carbon market would not be costless to farmers.

However, farm support payments can make up a substantial share of overall annual farm income for some operations and are an important part of the business decision-making process for some farmers. U.S. farm programs are governed by laws and regulations periodically reviewed and updated by Congress in omnibus \"farm bill\" legislation. Since the 2002 farm bill, USDA reports that farm payments have totaled, on average, about $15 billion per year; government payments are estimated at $12.5 billion in 2009. About 40% of farms receive government payments. In 2007, farm payments averaged nearly $9,800 for those farms receiving government payments, accounting for about 5% of gross cash income and about 22% of net cash income. The exclusion of such a potentially significant component of a farm's financial accounting, and basing economic decision-making only on commodity price and market conditions, does not accurately portray the behavior of many farming operations.

Thus, the mix of farmland ownership and leasing in the United States might constrain efforts to shift land uses, despite a willingness by farmers to participate in an emerging carbon market program. The EPA or USDA models, as designed, cannot reflect such effects.", "Some farm groups have expressed concerns that extended contract periods (between 5 and 30 years) could create a barrier to farmer participation in a carbon offset program. They argue that because many farmers rent at least some of the land they farm, they might not be in a position to enter into multi-year contracts under a carbon offset program. Although the exact contract period for various offset projects would be determined through rulemaking after the laws are enacted, Congress has provided some stipulations in the House-passed bill ( H.R. 2454 ): contract periods would be limited to 5-10 years (for various agricultural projects) and 20 years (for forestry projects). Some environmental groups are continuing to push for extended crediting periods for certain offset projects because of concerns about permanence issues as well as the overall credibility of carbon emission reduction goals.

The report builds off previous studies showing that farmers that rent land may be more reluctant to make long-term conservation investment. The report states that farmers that rent land might be unable to obtain a long-term land lease and therefore have less flexibility to enter into the types of long-term investments and/or farming practice commitments that would be required in a carbon offset market. Moreover, \"the complexity of the associated lease agreements and negotiation challenges will continue to act as a deterrent\" to their participation in the carbon market, compared to landowners. ", "Concerns among farm groups about land tenure issues raise important programmatic and policy considerations. Renting land is commonplace in the U.S. farming sector. USDA identifies three groups related to farm tenure: full owners, who own all the land they operate; part owners, who own at least 1% of the land they operate, but also rent land; and tenants, who own less than 1% of the land they farm and who rent the rest. The most recent available USDA survey of land ownership characteristics in the United States farming sector (1997 data) reported that less than 30% of all farmed acres are owned by their operators.

Currently, landowners lease land to farmers, because often few other marketable opportunities for the land exist. High and rising carbon prices under a cap-and-trade, however, would create additional competition for land and raise land values. On one hand, offsets could provide additional financial incentives for farmers, which could lead to additional farm income. On the other hand, higher land values might entice current farmer-landowners to sell their land or abandon its current use for the more lucrative alternative in afforestation. For example, absentee-landowners might be induced to consider terminating their leases with farmers, both affecting the livelihood of the farmer and taking land out of production for up to 20-30 years.

The CRP, authorized in 1985, is a voluntary land retirement program intended to encourage landowners to establish long-term, resource-conserving covers on eligible farmland. Under the program, landowners enroll in contracts for 10-15 years and receive annual rental payments as well as cost-share assistance (of up to 50% of the cost) for approved conservation practices. When the program was originally established, authorized enrollment allowed for up to 45 million acres; this limit was reduced in subsequent legislation. The authorization allowed for the removal of over 10% of the nation's cropland at that time. Current CRP enrollment is at 31 million acres, or about half of EPA's and USDA's projected land conversion estimates of 60 million to 65 million acres for 2050.", "In the 1980s, while CRP reduced the principal crop acreage, average annual yields continued to climb. This observation may be explained by the types of land that typically participate in CRP. Lands retired under CRP are largely associated with marginal or idle lands and generally are not considered to be taking productive cropland out of production. Similarly, incentives encouraging afforestation under a carbon offset program are likely to first take less productive and idled lands, as is reflected in EPA's and USDA's models. Which lands are taken out of production for afforestation will largely depend on the opportunity cost of the land. As long as crop production remains more profitable than participation in the carbon market, productive lands would likely remain in crop production. At higher offset prices, however, the tradeoffs between returns and profits in the two markets would become more competitive, and afforestation could eventually outweigh opportunities from growing crops.", "CRP rules require landowners to offer farmers who rent their land the opportunity to participate in CRP contracts and receive payments under the program. Similar requirements under a carbon offset program might help address land tenure issues, in particular the willingness of the lessee to participate in the program. CRP rules also limit enrollment within a county to no more than 25% of its total acres to prevent significant disruptions to local input industries, such as the manufacturers and sellers of seed, chemicals, and farm equipment.", "Other provisions might be considered to ensure that contractual obligations are met. As an example, under USDA's Environmental Qualities Incentives Program (EQIP), farmers who lease land are required to show proof of control of the land for the duration of the contract period. These types of requirements might also be required for farm and forestry carbon offset projects, either through statutory provisions or through rulemaking.", "Existing programs provide an indication of the potential willingness of farmers to participate in multi-year contracts. Under CRP, participants enroll in contracts for 10 to 15 years. EQIP contracts range from 1 to 10 years in length. Participation in each of these programs continues to increase despite these types of obstacles. However, a study by USDA shows that farmers who own 80% or more of the land they farm are more likely to enroll in CRP and account for the bulk (about two-thirds) of all CRP enrolled acres. While CRP does have a provision that requires landowners to offer tenants the opportunity to participate in CRP and receive payments, the USDA study also found that few farmers that mostly lease land (defined as those who own less than 60% of the land they farm) tend to focus more on crop production and are reluctant to retire land.

Economies of size, specialization, and relative market power also play a role, allowing some larger-sized operations to lower their overall production or input costs. Evidence in the agricultural sector suggests that these market forces have led to farm consolidation (fewer small farms). See the text box below for more information.

Research assessing existing offset projects has demonstrated that measurement costs account for a larger percentage of total costs for smaller projects than for large-area projects. Observations from the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) confirmed these findings: verification costs vary by an order of magnitude between small ($1/MT) and large ($0.10/MT) agricultural soil sequestration projects.", "Although this disparity would seem to favor larger projects, smaller projects may still be economically viable, depending on the magnitude of the transactions costs relative to the estimated offset revenue and depending on the nature of the project. Evidence indicates that the cost calculation would vary substantially under different offset protocols (e.g., the CCX, the Voluntary Carbon Standard, or the 1605(b) requirements). Studies have shown that different offset protocols produce a wide spectrum of break-even prices (the carbon price needed to make a project economically viable); for example, a 2009 study found that the break-even prices for a 246-acre (100-hectare) afforestation project ranged from $10 per MT to approximately $50 per MT. Different protocols affect not only the transaction costs, but the number of offset credits that would be generated, an integral figure in a break-even price assessment. A 2008 study estimated the offset credits that a hypothetical afforestation project would generate under several offset protocols, finding that the offsets generated over a 60-year period under different protocols would range from 118 million MT CO 2 -Eq. to 300 million MT CO 2 -Eq.", "In addition, different types of offset projects could have radically different transaction costs. For example, agricultural soil sequestration projects would likely require annual monitoring, possibly at several sites, depending on the size of the project. In contrast, afforestation might need only periodic monitoring, perhaps every 5 years, to assure that carbon sequestration is occurring.

Presumably this is because that state's production of higher value crops, such as fruits and vegetables, could out-compete the carbon market for land use. Other areas such as the Great Plains show less afforestation and more land remaining in cropland production. This is possibly related to that region's limited ability to grow trees.
