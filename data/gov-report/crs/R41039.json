The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-499, SARA) clarified the applicability of the statute's requirements to federal facilities, and modified various response, liability, and enforcement provisions. Several other laws also have amended CERCLA for specific purposes, including relief from cleanup liability for certain categories of parties, and the authorization of federal assistance for the cleanup of abandoned or idled \"brownfields\" where the presence or perception of contamination may impede economic redevelopment.", "CERCLA authorizes cleanup and enforcement actions to respond to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment, but generally excludes releases of petroleum and certain other materials covered by other federal laws. Considering the limitation of federal resources to address the many contaminated sites across the United States, CERCLA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to maintain a National Priorities List (NPL) to identify the most hazardous sites for the purpose of prioritizing cleanup actions. The states and the public may participate in federal cleanup decisions at NPL sites. The states primarily are responsible for pursuing the cleanup of sites not listed on the NPL, with the federal role at these sites limited mainly to addressing emergency situations.", "CERCLA established a broad liability scheme that holds past and current owners and operators of facilities from which a release occurs financially responsible for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and the costs of federal public health studies. At waste disposal sites, generators of the wastes and transporters of the wastes who selected the site for disposal also are liable under CERCLA. The liability of these \"potentially responsible parties\" (PRPs) has been interpreted by the courts to be strict, joint and several, and retroactive. At contaminated federal facilities, federal agencies are subject to liability under CERCLA as the owners and operators of those facilities on behalf of the United States. Federal agencies also may be liable in instances in which an agency generated or transported waste for disposal at a non-federal facility.", "CERCLA established the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund to pay for the cleanup of sites where the PRPs cannot be found or cannot pay. A combination of special taxes on industry and general taxpayer revenues originally financed the Superfund Trust Fund, but the authority to collect the industry taxes expired on December 31, 1995. Over time, Congress increased the contribution of general revenues to make up for the shortfall from the expired industry taxes. General revenues now provide most of the funding for the trust fund, but other monies continue to contribute some revenues (i.e., cost-recoveries from PRPs, fines and penalties for violations of cleanup requirements, and interest on the trust fund balance). The availability of these trust fund monies under the Superfund program is subject to appropriations by Congress. Private settlement funds deposited into site-specific Special Accounts within the Superfund Trust Fund also are available to EPA, but are not subject to discretionary appropriations.", "Considering the liability of the federal government at its own facilities, the cleanup of federal facilities is not funded with Superfund Trust Fund monies under the Superfund program, but with other federal monies appropriated to the agencies responsible for administering the facilities. However, EPA and the states remain responsible for overseeing and enforcing the implementation of CERCLA at federal facilities to ensure that applicable cleanup requirements are met."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["By the end of the 1970s, Congress had enacted several environmental laws to regulate sources of pollution in the United States, but had not yet addressed responsibility for contamination resulting from releases of pollutants into the environment. In the late 1970s, the discovery of severely contaminated sites, such as \"Love Canal\" in New York and Times Beach in Missouri, raised questions as to whether there should be a federal role in cleaning up environmental contamination to protect the public from potential harm. Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA; P.L. 96-510 ) to authorize the federal government to clean up contaminated sites in the United States and to make the \"potentially responsible parties\" connected to those sites financially liable for the cleanup costs. CERCLA created the Superfund program to carry out these authorities. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the program. Subsequent amendments to CERCLA also authorized EPA to administer a separate grant program to support the cleanup of abandoned or idled \"brownfields\" properties to encourage their redevelopment. ", "CERCLA established a broad liability scheme that holds both past and current owners and operators of contaminated facilities financially responsible for the costs of cleanup. At waste disposal sites, generators of the waste sent to the site for disposal, and transporters of the waste who selected the site for disposal, also are responsible for the cleanup costs. If these potentially responsible parties cannot be found or cannot pay for the cleanup, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to finance the cleanup to ensure the protection of human health and the environment. These costs borne by the federal government are referred to as \"orphan shares.\" The broad liability scheme of CERCLA is intended to capture all parties that may have had some involvement in the actions that resulted in contamination of the environment, in order to minimize the burden of the costs of cleanup on the general taxpayer who had no involvement. This approach to liability is based on the principle that polluters should be required to pay for the environmental damage that they cause, often referred to as the \"polluter pays principle.\"", "CERCLA established the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund to finance cleanup actions taken by the federal government at contaminated sites where the potentially responsible parties cannot pay or cannot be found. A combination of special taxes on industry and revenues from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury initially financed the Superfund Trust Fund, but the authority to collect the industry taxes expired at the end of 1995. As the remaining revenues were expended over time, Congress increased the contribution of general Treasury revenues in an effort to make up for the shortfall from the expired industry taxes. The availability of Superfund Trust Fund monies to finance the cleanup of contaminated sites is subject to appropriations by Congress.", "Considering the liability of the federal government as a potentially responsible party at its own facilities, the cleanup of federal facilities is not funded with Superfund Trust Fund monies under the Superfund program, but with other federal monies appropriated for other programs administered by the agencies responsible for these facilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Energy (DOE) administer the cleanup of most contaminated federal facilities. EPA and the states are responsible for overseeing and enforcing the implementation of CERCLA at federal facilities to ensure that applicable requirements are met.", "To prioritize cleanup actions, CERCLA directed EPA to establish and maintain a National Priorities List (NPL) of the most contaminated sites in the United States which present the greatest risks to human health and the environment. The NPL includes both non-federal sites and federal facilities that are deemed to present a sufficient level of risk to warrant listing. EPA may require the potentially responsible parties to directly perform or pay for cleanup actions themselves. Alternatively, EPA may clean up a contaminated site up-front with appropriated Superfund monies and later recover those funds from the potentially responsible parties (with the exception of the cleanup of federal facilities which must be funded up-front by the administering agencies). In the event that the potentially responsible parties cannot pay or cannot be found, appropriated Superfund monies may be used to pay the orphan shares of cleanup costs at a site, under a cost-sharing agreement with the state in which the site is located.", "The following sections of this report summarize the major cleanup authorities of CERCLA and other relevant provisions of the act. The topics discussed herein include the overall scope and reach of these statutory authorities, the process under which cleanup actions are selected and carried out at individual sites, the financial liability of potentially responsible parties for the costs of cleanup actions, the Superfund Trust Fund that may pay for cleanup actions when the potentially responsible parties cannot pay or cannot be found, enforcement of cleanup liability against the potentially responsible parties to minimize the need for federal tax revenues to finance the cleanup of contaminated sites, the applicability of CERCLA to federal facilities, and federal assistance for the cleanup of brownfields properties. A briefer summary of these topics is presented in CRS Report RL30798, Environmental Laws: Summaries of Major Statutes Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency .", "It should be emphasized that how and to what degree a specific contaminant at an individual site must be cleaned up under CERCLA are not specified in the law itself. The specific actions that are required to clean up contaminants at individual sites are determined on a site-by-site basis. Although CERCLA established a general process for making cleanup decisions, more specific direction is provided in EPA regulation and agency guidance. Other federal agencies that administer the cleanup of federal facilities under CERCLA have developed additional guidance documents that apply to their own respective facilities. Although the statutory authorities upon which federal agencies have based their cleanup regulations and guidance are discussed in this report, the content of these regulations and guidance is not examined here.", "As such, this report summarizes selected statutory provisions of CERLCA, but does not discuss agency regulations and guidance that may provide more detailed direction for carrying out cleanup actions at individual sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Amendments", "paragraphs": ["Congress has amended CERCLA on numerous occasions to clarify the applicability of the cleanup authorities of the statute, and to provide relief from liability for certain categories of parties who may not have been involved in actions that led to contamination, or who may have contributed only certain quantities or types of waste to a site. Congress also has amended the statute to authorize federal assistance for the cleanup of abandoned or idled \"brownfields\" properties to encourage their redevelopment. Further, certain amendments have addressed unique cleanup challenges at federal facilities, such as the cleanup of unexploded ordnance on decommissioned military training ranges in the United States, and responsibility for the cleanup of contaminated federal property when it is transferred out of federal ownership.", "The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA; P.L. 99-499 ) clarified that federal facilities are subject to the cleanup requirements of CERCLA to the same extent as non-federal entities, and amended various response, liability, and enforcement provisions of the law. The 1986 amendments also renewed the authorization of appropriations for EPA's Superfund program through FY1991, and established a separate Defense Environmental Restoration Program within the Department of Defense (DOD) to address contamination at active and decommissioned military facilities in the United States.", "Title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-508 ) extended the authorization of appropriations for EPA's Superfund program through FY1994, and Title XI of that statute extended the authority to collect the special Superfund taxes on industry through December 31, 1995. Although reauthorizing legislation has been introduced in various Congresses, the taxing authority for the Superfund Trust Fund has not been renewed to date, nor has the authorization of appropriations for EPA's Superfund program been extended. Instead, Congress has continued to fund the Superfund program primarily with general Treasury revenues through the annual appropriations process. Congress has annually authorized and appropriated funding for the Defense Environmental Restoration Program each year since its establishment. Most of this funding is supported with general Treasury revenues, with the exception of some revenues generated from the sale or lease of closed military bases which help fund their cleanup.", "In 1992, the Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act ( P.L. 102-426 ) amended the federal facility provisions of CERCLA to facilitate the transfer of uncontaminated parcels of surplus federal property on which hazardous substances or petroleum products were not released. Section 334 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1997 ( P.L. 104-201 ) further amended CERCLA to allow the transfer of contaminated surplus federal property before cleanup is complete, if assurances are provided to guarantee that the property will be cleaned up to a level that would be suitable for its intended use after transfer.", "Other amendments have attempted to address the fairness of the liability scheme of CERCLA, either by limiting or eliminating the liability of certain categories of parties. In 1996, the Asset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit Insurance Protection Act (Subtitle E, Title II, Division A of P.L. 104-208 ) amended CERCLA to protect certain fiduciaries and financial lenders from liability. In 1999, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act (Title VI, Appendix I of P.L. 106-113 ) exempted generators and transporters of recyclable scrap materials from cleanup liability under CERCLA, if the person who received the materials disposed of them instead and the disposal resulted in contamination. There had been some concern that the potential liability of generators and transporters under CERCLA could be a deterrent to recycling.", "In 2002, the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act ( P.L. 107-118 ) provided relief from cleanup liability for (1) persons who contributed very small quantities of waste or only municipal solid (i.e. non-hazardous) waste to a site, (2) owners of property that became contaminated merely as a result of migration from a contiguous property owned by another person, and (3) \"bona fide\" prospective purchasers who otherwise may be hesitant to acquire a contaminated property because of potential cleanup liability once acquiring ownership. The 2002 act also established more specific criteria for exempting \"innocent\" owners of contaminated property from cleanup liability, if they purchased the property without knowledge of the existing contamination and they had no involvement in actions that led to contamination.", "As required by the statute, persons seeking an exemption from liability as a \"bona fide\" prospective purchaser, contiguous property owner, or \"innocent\" landowner must have performed \"all appropriate inquiry\" into the prior uses of the property before acquiring ownership, and must take \"reasonable steps\" after acquiring ownership to prevent potentially harmful exposure to environmental contamination. Because of these requirements, such persons still may bear some responsibility for managing contamination on their properties, even though they may be exempt from liability for more extensive cleanup actions that may be taken under CERCLA. ", "In addition to providing relief from liability for certain categories of parties, P.L. 107-118 authorized federal grants to assist in the cleanup of \"brownfields\" properties. Brownfields properties typically are abandoned, underutilized, or idled sites where the known or suspected presence of contamination, and the potential for cleanup liability, could be viewed as a deterrent to purchase the property for redevelopment. Brownfields properties tend to be less contaminated than sites listed on the NPL, but may need some cleanup to make them suitable for reuse. EPA originally had established a program in 1993 to provide federal assistance for the cleanup of brownfields properties using the general cleanup authorities of CERCLA as the legal basis for this assistance. P.L. 107-118 provided explicit statutory authority for this purpose, and established a separate Brownfields grant program within EPA, apart from the Superfund program.", " Table 1 lists CERCLA as enacted in 1980 and the major amendments to the law noted above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Response Authorities", "paragraphs": ["Section 104(a) of CERCLA specifically authorizes the President to respond to a release (or substantial threat of a release) of a hazardous substance into the environment, or of a pollutant or contaminant which may present an \"imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare.\" As authorized by Section 115 of CERCLA, the President delegated the response authorities of CERCLA to EPA and other federal agencies by executive order. EPA may respond to releases on the land, and the U.S. Coast Guard may respond to releases into inland river ports and harbors, the Great Lakes, and U.S. coastal waters. If a release were to occur at a federal facility, the agency that administers that facility is authorized to take response actions, subject to oversight and enforcement by EPA and the states in which those facilities are located. Federal funding to carry out response actions under CERCLA is subject to appropriations by Congress.", "Notification of a release of a hazardous substance is the action that may trigger a federal response under CERCLA. Section 103(a) requires the party responsible for a release to notify the National Response Center if the quantity of the release exceeds the regulatory limit established for that particular substance. These limits are referred to as \"reportable quantities,\" which are specified in federal regulation. State or local officials, or members of the public, who observe or suspect a release of a hazardous substance also may report the incident. Once a release is reported, the National Response Center is to notify the appropriate federal agency that would be responsible for carrying out the President's response authorities under Section 104(a), and for taking any federal enforcement actions that may be necessary against the parties responsible for the release.", "Response actions taken under CERCLA most often entail cleanup activities involving the containment, removal, or treatment of environmental contamination to prevent potentially harmful exposure, but may include the temporary or permanent relocation of potentially exposed individuals if warranted. Congress has excluded certain types of environmental contamination from the response authorities of CERCLA, which may be addressed under other federal environmental laws. These exclusions are provided within the statutory definitions of key terms upon which the response authorities of CERCLA hinge, including the terms \"hazardous substance,\" \"pollutant or contaminant,\" and \"release.\" In addition to these exclusions, Congress has placed general limitations on the extent to which response actions may be taken under CERCLA to address releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants in certain situations. In effect, these exclusions and limitations may restrict the applicability or scope of the response authorities of CERCLA at a particular contaminated site."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Petroleum Exclusion", "paragraphs": ["The response authorities of CERCLA do not extend to releases of petroleum. Section 101(14) of CERCLA generally excludes releases of petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, from the definition of a \"hazardous substance\" for the purposes of the statute. Section 101(33) does the same for the definition of \"pollutant or contaminant.\" Petroleum releases are covered instead by other statutes. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-380 ) is the primary federal law that addresses releases of petroleum. Other federal laws also provide authorities to respond to petroleum releases in specific situations. For example, Section 311(c) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the federal actions to respond to releases of petroleum into or on the navigable waters of the United States and adjoining shorelines. Section 9003(h) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act provides federal response authorities for petroleum leaked from underground tanks. In practice, CERCLA has been applied to the cleanup of some wastes containing petroleum only if the wastes also contained hazardous substances that were not part of the petroleum product itself."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Exclusions", "paragraphs": ["Section 101(22) of CERCLA also excludes certain types of releases from the definition of the term \"release,\" thereby removing such releases from the statute's reach. A specific category of nuclear materials is excluded from the definition of release, including \"source, byproduct, or special nuclear material\" released from a nuclear incident or at certain processing sites. The disposal and cleanup of these materials are subject to the Atomic Energy Act. With the exception of these specific nuclear materials, CERCLA generally applies to the release of radionuclides. In federal regulation, EPA has designated several hundred radionuclides as hazardous substances that are subject to the authorities of CERCLA. Section 101(22) also excludes three other types of releases from the response authorities of CERCLA: (1) a release that would result in exposure solely within the workplace; (2) emissions from engine exhaust of a motor vehicle, train, aircraft, vessel, or power pumping station; and (3) the \"normal\" application of fertilizer. There also are certain situations identified in CERCLA in which a party would not be subject to liability, such as the proper application of a registered pesticide product or a federally permitted release of a hazardous substance. However, response authority under the statute generally would remain available to EPA in these two instances, just not the enforcement of liability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations on Response Actions", "paragraphs": ["Section 104(a)(3) limits the extent to which actions may be taken under CERCLA to respond to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants in certain situations. Response actions generally may not be taken in situations involving (1) releases of naturally occurring substances in their unaltered form; (2) releases from products (such as asbestos) that are part of a residential, business, or community structure or building; or (3) releases into public or private drinking water supplies due to deterioration of supply systems through ordinary use. However, in the event of a public health or environmental emergency declared by the President, CERCLA authorizes response actions to be taken under the statute in any of these three situations, if no other person has the authority and capability to respond in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prioritization and Procedures for Response Actions", "paragraphs": ["Section 105(a) of CERCLA required the President to develop a National Hazardous Substance Response Plan to establish procedures and standards for prioritizing and responding to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants into the environment. The law directed the President to incorporate these procedures and standards into the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (referred to as the National Contingency Plan for short, or NCP). As delegated by the President, EPA promulgated the National Hazardous Substance Response Plan in federal regulation as part of the NCP. These regulations govern any response actions taken under CERCLA.", "Consistent with the purpose of the NCP, Section 105(a) of CERCLA also required the President to develop a National Priorities List (NPL) of the most hazardous sites in the United States as an administrative mechanism to prioritize response actions. The President has delegated this task to EPA. The NPL must be updated at least once annually. Section 105(c) primarily requires the use of a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) to determine which sites warrant placement on the NPL. The system scores each site based on certain factors, such as the quantity and nature of hazardous substances; the likelihood of the migration of contamination in groundwater, surface water, and air; and the proximity to human populations and sensitive environments. Because of this range of factors, the severity of contamination alone may not necessarily be sufficient cause to list a site on the NPL. For example, a geographically isolated site with substantial contamination still may not score highly enough on the HRS to warrant placement on the NPL, if the distance from human populations prevents the likelihood of exposure.", "In addition to the use of the HRS to evaluate eligibility for listing a site on the NPL, there are two other mechanisms under which EPA also may list a site. First, Section 105(a) allowed each state the one-time opportunity to designate a single site within its borders as the state's highest priority for listing on the NPL. Second, EPA may list a site for which the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has issued a public health advisory, if EPA also determines that the contamination presents a significant public health threat and that its use of \"remedial\" authority will be more cost-effective than its sole use of \"removal\" authority without listing the site. As discussed below in the \" Scope of Response Actions \" section, a site must be listed on the NPL as a condition for the availability of Superfund appropriations to perform remedial actions, but removal actions are not subject to such condition.", "EPA has listed over 1,600 sites on the NPL over time, including federal facilities. EPA has deleted over 300 of these sites once EPA determined, in concurrence with the states, that the long-term cleanup objectives had been met. The vast majority of the sites were listed based on EPA's evaluation of the potential risks using the HRS, but some sites have been listed as a result of states designating them as their top priority and as a result of an ATSDR public health advisory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope of Response Actions", "paragraphs": ["CERCLA authorizes two types of response actions: \"removal\" and \"remedial\" actions. These terms are defined in Sections 101(23) and 101(24) of CERCLA respectively. Removal does not necessarily mean the physical removal of contamination from the soil, surface water, or groundwater, and remedial actions do not necessarily involve treatment of contamination. Rather, both actions may involve various methods to prevent exposure to contamination, including the relocation of potentially exposed individuals if warranted. It should be noted that the NCP allows remedial actions to be financed with Superfund monies only at sites listed on the NPL, whereas removal actions may be financed with Superfund monies at non-NPL sites to address emergency situations. This restriction is intended to reserve Superfund monies for costlier remedial actions at NPL sites that are thought to present the greatest risks. This funding restriction in the regulations is based on the statutory requirement of Section 105(a) of CERCLA for EPA to prioritize contaminated sites for the purpose of taking remedial actions.", "Removal actions tend to be shorter term actions that address more immediate risks, whereas remedial actions tend to be longer term actions that offer a more permanent solution. As such, remedial actions often entail more extensive and costly measures. Because of the typically greater extent and cost of remedial actions, they are subject to more in-depth review in the form of a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS). An RI/FS involves an investigation of the contamination to assess potential risks of exposure and a study of the feasibility of remedial alternatives to address those risks. Remedial actions also are subject to public participation requirements under Section 117 of CERCLA. (See the \" Public Participation \" section of this report.) Removal actions are not subject to a similar degree of review or public comment because of the perceived need for swifter response to address more immediate risks.", "Section 104(c)(1) generally restricts the timing of removal actions funded with Superfund monies to one year and the cost to $2 million, with exceptions provided in certain situations. For example, a remedial action may exceed these limitations if the continuance of the removal action would contribute to the remedial action planned at the site. These general timing and cost limitations on removal actions are intended to ensure that removal actions are not pursued on a broader scale as a way to avoid the more in-depth review required of remedial actions.", "However, CERCLA does not impose these limitations on a removal action funded by a responsible party with its own funds, nor by a federal agency at a federal facility with dedicated monies appropriated to that agency for that purpose apart from Superfund. From a practical standpoint, imposing the above timing and cost limitations on removal actions at many federal facilities administered by the Department of Defense and Department of Energy could constrain the needed scope of removal actions, as cleanup challenges are often greater at these federal facilities in comparison to non-federal sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal-State Cost Sharing", "paragraphs": ["Section 104(c)(3) of CERCLA requires the state in which a non-federal NPL site is located to agree to share the costs of remedial actions at that site, as a condition of obligating federal Superfund monies to finance those actions. States are not responsible for sharing the costs of cleanup at sites where the potentially responsible parties pay for the cleanup, including federal facilities that are funded by the federal agencies that administer them. Rather, the federal government and the states are to share the costs of assuming the responsibility for the orphan shares of the cleanup costs, for which there are no viable parties to pursue.", "This cost-sharing requirement in Section 104(c)(3) is intended to reduce the financial burden on the federal taxpayer presented by the often long-term financial commitment involved in carrying out a remedial action. Notably, CERCLA does not require states to agree to share the costs of removal actions, which typically are less costly as a result of their smaller scope. Consequently, federal Superfund monies may be used to finance the entire costs of removal actions.", "At a site where the state must agree to share the costs of remedial actions as a condition of the obligation of federal Superfund monies, the state first must provide certain assurances of its financial commitments, specified in a binding contract or cooperative agreement with the federal government. Absent such contract or agreement, federal Superfund monies are not available to finance remedial actions at that site. To allow the obligation of federal Superfund monies to commence the remedial actions, the state must agree to pay 10% of the costs of those actions. If the site was owned or operated by the state, or a political subdivision of the state, at the time of disposal, the state must agree to pay at least 50% of the costs of the remedial actions.", "In addition to the above conditions, the state must agree to perform future maintenance of the remedial actions for their expected operational life. The point of maintenance usually occurs after any necessary construction is complete and the remedial action is operating as intended. CERCLA authorizes a delay in the state's responsibility for the maintenance of groundwater or surface water remedies. Section 104(c)(6) allows a state to delay its maintenance responsibilities for the first 10 years of the operation of such remedial actions. The statute allows a delay in the state's maintenance responsibility specifically for these types of actions to reduce the burden of those costs on the state, as the cleanup of groundwater or surface water tends to be more costly than other types of remediation.

Section 121(b) states a preference for the selection of remedial actions that involve treatment to \"permanently and significantly\" reduce the \"volume, toxicity or mobility\" of contamination, as opposed to actions that do not involve such treatment. ", "Actions not involving treatment often entail the containment of wastes on-site, or the removal and disposal of wastes off-site. The containment of wastes on-site could present lingering health and environmental risks if the containment method were to fail over time. If the remedial action would result in wastes being left on-site, Section 121(c) requires the President to review the performance of the remedial action every five years to determine whether that action continues to be protective of human health and the environment. If the action is not functioning as intended, the President may take additional remedial actions at the site to achieve the cleanup goal.", "Although Section 121 includes certain requirements to govern the selection of remedial actions, it does not specify how clean an individual site must be to protect human health and the environment. Section 121 also does not identify the specific nature of the remedial actions that would be required to attain a cleanup goal at an individual site.

ARARs can include a host of federal or state standards, requirements, or other criteria. In this sense, CERCLA functions as an \"umbrella\" statute under which other statutes or regulations also may be applied to the cleanup of a contaminated site.", "Section 121(d)(4) authorizes the waiver of a particular standard, if", "the contemplated response action would be part of a larger remedial action that would meet the standard once the larger action is completed; compliance with the standard would result in a greater risk than the alternatives; compliance with the standard would be technically impracticable from an engineering perspective; an equivalent standard of performance would be attained; in the case of a state standard, the state has not consistently applied that standard elsewhere within its jurisdiction; or meeting the standard would not provide a balance between the need for protection of public health and welfare and the environment at the site under consideration, and the availability of monies in the Superfund Trust Fund to respond to more immediate risks at other sites.", "Although CERCLA generally does not list specific standards that may apply to the cleanup of an individual site, there are two sets of standards cited in Section 121(d) that broadly apply to the selection of remedial actions at any site.

On the other hand, opponents of the taxes have observed that not all of the individual businesses subject to the tax may have been involved in activities that resulted in contamination, and that the actual polluters are paying for the cleanup of most Superfund sites through enforcement actions under the liability provisions of CERCLA.", "The extent to which Superfund taxes may have affected \"innocent\" businesses has been a principal question in the debate over the fairness of the tax structure. The Superfund tax on corporate income was intended to raise additional revenues from a wide range of businesses that may have benefitted from the use of hazardous substances in some way. However, this income tax captured all businesses that met the income threshold, regardless of whether a business may have used or disposed of any hazardous substances.

In such situations, removal of munitions could be pursued to eliminate the source of the contamination. Absent off-range migration, munitions generally may be left on a range as long as the range remains in operational status. In such circumstances, cleanup of the munitions typically is not required until the range is closed, and the range then becomes eligible for cleanup under the Military Munitions Response Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Security Exemption", "paragraphs": ["Although Section 120 of CERCLA clarified the applicability of the statute to federal facilities, Section 120(j) authorized the President to exempt an individual federal facility from a requirement of CERCLA on a case-by-case basis if the exemption would be necessary to protect national security. This exemption is intended to prevent situations in which a federal facility may become unavailable for purposes essential to protecting national security, if carrying out a specific cleanup action somehow may interfere with those purposes. Section 120(j) specifically authorizes the President to exempt an individual facility administered by the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy from compliance with a requirement of CERCLA, if the President deems such an exemption necessary to protect national security.", "The President must notify Congress within 30 days of the issuance of an exemption and explain the reason for it. The time period of an exemption initially is limited to one year, but the President may renew it annually with notification to Congress. To date, a national security exemption under CERCLA has not been invoked at any facility of the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy. Instead, contaminated facilities of both departments have been made subject to the cleanup requirements of CERCLA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Brownfields Properties", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, EPA established an element within the Superfund program to assist communities with the cleanup of certain lower risk sites that did not warrant placement on the NPL, but at which cleanup was desired to encourage economic redevelopment. The purpose of the program was to provide federal financial assistance for the cleanup of properties referred to as \"brownfields.\" These properties typically are abandoned, idled, or underutilized, and on which known or suspected contamination is perceived as a deterrent to redevelopment by prospective purchasers who may be hesitant about becoming liable for cleanup once acquiring ownership.", "EPA initially used Superfund appropriations to provide \"seed monies\" to communities in the form of grants and loans to aid them in financing certain types of cleanup actions. Although there was broad support for this effort, some questioned EPA's authority under CERCLA to use Superfund monies for the cleanup of these lower risk sites that were not listed on the NPL and that did not appear to warrant emergency removal actions under the Superfund program. Still, in the annual appropriations process, Congress set aside funding for brownfields cleanup assistance within the Superfund account for several years without specifically amending CERCLA for this purpose.", "In the 107 th Congress, Subtitle A and Subtitle C of Title II of the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-118 , hereinafter referred to as the \"Brownfields Act\") amended CERCLA to provide explicit statutory authority for EPA to administer a Brownfields program separately from the Superfund program. The Brownfields Act authorized appropriations for this new program apart from appropriations for the Superfund account. There had been some concern about the diversion of Superfund appropriations away from addressing the greater human health and environmental risks at NPL sites. Still, the portion of Superfund appropriations that had been spent on the cleanup of brownfields properties was relatively small compared to the total appropriation.", "The program explicitly authorized in the Brownfields Act is similar in scope to the program that EPA had established in 1993, with the exception that the Brownfields Act allowed federal financial assistance for the cleanup of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum. As discussed earlier in the \" Federal Response Authorities \" section of this report, CERCLA otherwise does not apply to the cleanup of petroleum. The Brownfields Act also created two separate types of grants within the Brownfields program. One provides more direct financial assistance for the assessment and cleanup of individual properties. The other provides financial assistance to states and Indian tribes to aid them in carrying out their own cleanup programs, which in turn may assist in the cleanup of individual properties.", "Specifically, Section 201 of the Brownfields Act amended Section 104 of CERCLA to add a new subsection (k) that authorized $200 million annually for grants to fund the assessment and cleanup of individual brownfields properties. Entities generally eligible for these grants include state and local governments, Indian Tribes, redevelopment agencies chartered or otherwise sanctioned by a state government, and land clearance authorities or other \"quasi-governmental\" entities operating under the supervision and control, or as an agent, of a local government. The grants are awarded on a competitive basis. The recipients may use the grant funds to characterize, assess, or remediate brownfields properties, or to capitalize revolving loan funds that in turn may finance the remediation of multiple brownfields properties by other entities, including loans issued to site owners or developers.", "Section 231 of the act also added Section 128 to CERCLA, authorizing an additional $50 million annually for other grants to assist states and Indian Tribes in establishing or enhancing their own cleanup programs. States and Tribes may use these monies to augment their own resources to assist with the cleanup of brownfields properties to prepare them for reuse. They also may use these monies to pursue the cleanup of other contaminated sites within their respective jurisdictions, which may present potential health or environmental risks but are not addressed under the federal Superfund program. The authorization of appropriations for both the Section 104(k) and Section 128 grants expired at the end of FY2006, but Congress has continued to fund these grants through the annual appropriations process without enacting reauthorizing legislation.", "As discussed earlier in the \" Limitations on Liability \" section of this report, Section 222 of the Brownfields Act exempted \"bona fide\" prospective purchasers of contaminated properties from liability under CERCLA, if they satisfy the prerequisite statutory criteria. This exemption is intended to work in tandem with federal grants assistance under the Brownfields program to further the purpose of stimulating the economic redevelopment of contaminated properties. Accordingly, Section 104(k)(4)(B)(iii) of CERCLA specifically authorizes the eligibility of bona fide prospective purchasers for brownfields grants. If a party cannot qualify for this exemption, or another exemption from liability, that party is not eligible to receive a brownfields grant. This statutory prohibition on awarding Brownfields grants to potentially responsible parties is consistent with the policy premise of the liability scheme of CERCLA to hold the potentially responsible parties responsible for the costs of cleanup, so as to minimize the burden of these costs on the federal taxpayer who had no connection with the site.", "Congress also has enacted certain tax incentives to encourage the cleanup of brownfields properties, through amendments to the Internal Revenue Code but not CERCLA itself. These incentives have constituted another form of federal financial assistance to support the cleanup of contaminated sites. Section 941(a) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-34 ) allowed a taxpayer to fully deduct the costs of cleaning up a brownfields property in the year the costs were incurred. This type of deduction is referred to as \"expensing,\" as opposed to \"capitalizing\" in which the costs would be deducted over a period of years. The tax incentive was intended to encourage property developers to rehabilitate sites where environmental contamination may be a deterrent to bringing nonproductive properties back into use. The tax deduction has no direct application for public sector entities, such as municipalities, which do not pay income taxes. Enacted in the 111 th Congress, Section 745 of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 , Title VII, Subtitle C) extended this brownfields tax incentive through December 31, 2011.", "Congress also had authorized another federal brownfields tax incentive in Section 702 of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-357 , Title VII), which expired on December 31, 2009. This incentive addressed the treatment of gain or loss on the sale or exchange of certain qualified brownfields sites, as defined in Section 101(39) of CERCLA. This provision allowed a tax-exempt entity to invest in a qualified brownfields site, and not treat the gains as taxable \"unrelated business income.\" To be eligible for this tax incentive, the entity must have incurred cleanup costs exceeding the greater of $550,000, or 12% of the property's fair market value in a remediated condition, in addition to meeting certain other requirements. The tax incentive was not available to parties who are potentially liable for the cleanup under Section 107 of CERCLA. "], "subsections": []}]}}
