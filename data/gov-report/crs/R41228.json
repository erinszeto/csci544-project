Funding for Foreign Operations and State Department/Broadcasting programs has been steadily rising since FY2002, after a period of decline in the 1980s and 1990s. Ongoing assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as large new global health programs and rapidly increasing assistance to Pakistan, has kept the international affairs budget at historically high levels in recent years. The change of Administration in 2009 did not disrupt this trend. However, increasing concern about the federal budget deficit and accountability for funds already provided has halted this growth in FY2011.", "On February 1, 2010, President Obama submitted a budget proposal for FY2011 that requested $58.68 billion for the international affairs budget, a 3% increase over the enacted FY2010 funding level, including supplementals. If $1.8 billion in \"forward funding\" of FY2010 priorities appropriated in FY2009 supplemental legislation is counted toward FY2010 rather than FY2009 totals, as it was by the Administration, and the enacted FY2010 supplemental is factored in, the FY2011 request would represent a slight decrease from FY2010-enacted levels.", "This report focuses only on the $56.82 billion requested for programs and activities funded through the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which excludes some portions of the International Affairs request and includes funding for certain commissions requested as part of other budget functions. The Administration requested significant increases for Global Health and Child Survival, Development Assistance, technical assistance and debt restructuring through the Treasury Department, Foreign Military Financing, and various multilateral environmental accounts. Programs for which the Administration recommended significantly reduced funding, compared with enacted FY2010 levels, are contributions to international organizations, commissions and foundations, and peacekeeping operations.", "The House State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee approved a draft FY2011 bill on June 30, which totaled $52.81 billion.

In the 1990s, with the Cold War ended, distinct policy objectives\u2014including stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs, expanding peace efforts in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting religious freedom, and countering trafficking in persons\u2014replaced the Cold War-shaped foreign policy objectives.", "A defining change in focus came following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. Since then, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have emphasized national security objectives, frequently cast in terms of contributing to efforts to counter terrorism. In 2002, President Bush released a National Security Strategy that for the first time established global development as the third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy. Development was again underscored in the Administration's re-statement of the National Security Strategy released on March 16, 2006.", "Also in 2002, foreign assistance budget justifications began to highlight the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority, emphasizing U.S. assistance to 28 \"front-line\" states\u2014countries that cooperated with the United States in the war on terrorism or faced terrorist threats themselves. Large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq exemplified the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism. State Department efforts focused extensively on diplomatic security and finding more effective ways of presenting American views and culture through public diplomacy, particularly in Muslim communities.", "The Obama Administration has carried forward many Bush foreign aid initiatives, including USAID's Development Leadership Initiative (DLI), the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and robust assistance to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Obama Administration has also largely sustained Bush Administration investments in global health and HIV/AIDS treatment, though its Global Health Initiative shifts the emphasis away from a focus on discrete diseases and toward comprehensive health systems. In the FY2011 request, the Administration further defines its international priorities, with an emphasis on building State Department and USAID capacity, supporting multilateral food security and global climate change initiatives, and shifting responsibility for assistance programs in Iraq and elsewhere from military to civilian authorities.

Supplemental resources for State and Foreign Operations programs, once used primarily to respond to unanticipated emergencies or natural disasters, became a significant and continuous source of funds for ongoing international activities during the Bush Administration, especially for programs related to reconstruction efforts and corresponding to ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some criticized this practice, which kept significant funds separate from the annual budget cycle and made future-year planning difficult. The Obama Administration requested $6.16 billion in supplemental funds for FY2010 to meet needs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and Haiti. Congress approved $6.18 billion in FY2010 supplemental funds for these and other priorities on July 27.", "Year-to-year comparison has also been complicated by recent use of forward funding mechanisms, whereby appropriations legislation may provide funding for multiple fiscal years. One FY2008 supplemental, for example, included $3.68 billion within a section titled \"Bridge Fund Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2009,\" essentially providing a FY2009 supplement before the FY2009 base appropriation was enacted. These funds were clearly designated as FY2009 funds, to be obligated between October 2008 and September 2009.

In the FY2011 Congressional Budget Justification (CBJ), the Administration included these funds in FY2010 account totals in many instances, while the Congressional Budget Office is treating them as FY2009 appropriations, as does this report.", "The inclusion of supplemental funds and the accounting used for forward funds can significantly affect year-to-year comparisons of appropriations levels. For example, the FY2011 request was slightly less than the FY2010 total if the FY2010 supplemental and forward funding are included in the FY2010 column, but represented a 16% increase if the supplemental funds are excluded and the forward funding is counted in FY2009 rather than FY2010.

Of that amount, $354.8 million was designated for recruiting and hiring 200 new Foreign Service Officers at USAID, as well as supporting the annualized recurring costs of DLI positions filled since FY2008.

As conditions on the ground have stabilized and both State and USAID have begun building their capacity, both the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense have expressed support for stronger civilian control of these activities. The FY2011 foreign operations request addressed this issue by including the following funding for activities that were previously funded through the Defense Appropriations bill: ", "The Complex Crisis Fund, for which $100 million was requested for FY2011, would replace funding for reconstruction, security, and stabilization activities previously provided through DOD's Section 1207 authority. The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund, for which $1.2 billion was requested for FY2011, would move ongoing activities to improve the capabilities of Pakistan's security forces from DOD control to the purview of the Secretary of State. For Iraq, $314.6 million was included in the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account request for FY2011 (along with $650 million provided for this purpose in FY2010 supplemental funds) to enable State to take control of Iraqi police training programs now funded through the DOD. Secretary of State Clinton has claimed that this shift from military to civilian control would allow the defense budget for Iraq to decrease by $16 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Front-Line States", "paragraphs": ["As demonstrated in Table 5 , proposed funding for FY2011 would have largely continued the FY2010 flow of assistance to countries of strategic interest in the fight against terrorism. The request included $12.22 billion, or 34% of the total bilateral aid requested, for \"front-line\" states. For Afghanistan, $3.92 billion was requested for FY2011, primarily to increase U.S. civilian resources to balance the recent troop surge. For Pakistan, $3.05 billion was requested for FY2011, primarily to build the capacity of the government of Pakistan and support infrastructure and economic development projects that provide tangible benefits to communities and reduce the appeal of extremism. For Iraq, $729 million was requested for FY2011, on top of $650 million provided in FY2010 supplemental funds, to support the aforementioned civilian takeover of security training programs.

The request represented an 8.8% increase over the FY2010-enacted level, or 8.1% if $50 million the Administration considered forward funding from the FY2009 supplemental was counted toward the FY2010 total. The six-year, $63 billion GHI is intended to be a comprehensive approach to global health problems that builds on the previous Administration's focus on global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, but prioritizes building strong and sustainable health systems through an emphasis on maternal and pediatric programs, as well as strategic coordination. Some advocates for HIV/AIDS programs have expressed concern about the shift in focus, noting that funding requested for HIV/AIDS programs in FY2011, while slightly above the FY2010 level, was less than amounts authorized by Congress and, some argue, inadequate to sustain U.S. global commitments. However, Ambassador Eric Goosby, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, has stated that GHI maternal health programs will include significant activities addressing HIV/AIDS, which is the leading cause of death worldwide for women of child bearing age.

The Administration's new Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative is intended to address root causes of food insecurity and proposes to target funding to countries with widespread hunger, an agriculture-based economy, and comprehensive strategies for food security already in place. The request also emphasized the benefits of working multilaterally and in partnership with other stakeholders to leverage resources.
