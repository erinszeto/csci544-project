This provision also required calorie labeling of certain vending machine items. In 2011, as required by the ACA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published two proposed rules establishing calorie labeling requirements for food items sold in certain restaurants and vending machines; both rules were finalized and published in the Federal Register on December 1, 2014. The labeling rules were to take effect one year later (December 1, 2015) for restaurants and two years later (December 1, 2016) for vending machines. The compliance date was extended following language included in the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-113), which prohibited the use of any funds for implementation, administration, or enforcement of the menu labeling requirements until the later of December 1, 2016, or until one year from the date that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issues Level 1 guidance on compliance with specified requirements for menu labeling contained in the final menu labeling rule. FDA issued such final guidance on May 5, 2016, and stated that the agency would not begin enforcing the final rule until May 5, 2017. In response to continuing concerns from certain sectors of the affected industry and some Members of Congress, on May 1, 2017, FDA announced that it was extending the compliance date to May 7, 2018. FDA has also extended the compliance date for calorie labeling of certain food products sold in vending machines to July 26, 2018.", "In addition to requiring calorie labeling for food sold in certain restaurants and vending machines, labeling will also be required for prepared foods sold at supermarkets, grocery and convenience stores, and entertainment venues (e.g., movie theaters and amusement parks). Calorie counts will have to be listed on menus and menu boards for all standard items, including alcoholic drinks and salad bar items.", "Prior to the federal rule, state and local menu labeling regulations had resulted in a patchwork of labeling requirements, making compliance challenging for chain food establishments.

For example, as mentioned above, the final rule requires grocery stores and delivery establishments (e.g., pizza places) to meet the labeling requirements. Opponents of the extension have argued that many chains are successfully complying with the labeling requirements and that consumers want menu labeling.

The 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA, P.L. 101-535 ) authorized the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require nutrition labeling of most foods and dietary supplements, but it did not require the labeling of food sold in restaurants. Section 4205 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 ) amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), establishing nutrition labeling requirements for standard menu items offered for sale in chain restaurants or similar retail food establishments (SRFEs) that have 20 or more locations, that conduct business under the same name regardless of the type of ownership of the locations, and that offer the same menu items for sale. The ACA provision required FDA to promulgate regulations specifying the scope of entities and foods covered by the law, as well as details regarding how the required calorie and nutrition information would be conveyed to consumers. In 2011, FDA proposed two rules delineating nutrition labeling requirements for restaurants and SRFEs, as well as vending machines; both rules were finalized and published in the Federal Register on December 1, 2014.", "Prior to the final rule, some food establishments had already begun voluntarily posting nutrition information.

Although rates appear to have stabilized in youth since 2003-2004 (see Figure 1 ), the prevalence of obesity among U.S. adults and children is higher than the Healthy People 2020 goals of 30.5% and 14.5%, respectively. This is of public health concern because obesity is associated with increased risk of a number of health conditions, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. ", "Research has shown that frequent eating out is associated with increased calorie intake, and that food eaten away from the home tends to be of lower nutritional quality and higher in saturated fat and sodium than food prepared at home. Larger portion sizes served in restaurants contribute to greater calorie intake, and analyses of three fast food chain restaurants indicate that portion sizes have not changed since the mid-1990s (1996-2013). Studies also suggest that consumers tend to underestimate the number of calories in restaurant meals.", "Changes in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the United States have paralleled changes in calorie consumption. As obesity rates increased, calories consumed by individuals two years and older also increased significantly, from a daily average of 1,875 calories in 1977-1978 to 2,002 calories in 2005-2008. The same study indicates that in 1977-1978, individuals in the United States consumed approximately 18% of calories away from the home, compared with 32% in 2005-2008.", "More recent NHANES data suggest that obesity rates have been leveling off and even decreasing in some age groups (e.g., among two- to five-year-olds). Data from USDA's Economic Research Service show that average calorie intake has also declined\u2014by 118 calories (about 5%) between 2005-2006 and 2009-2010. During this time period, consumption of calories from food eaten away from home fell by 127 calories per day, and daily fast food calories fell by 53 calories per day. These changes suggest that consumer preferences for nutritious foods may be increasing, and there may be greater use of available nutrition information (e.g., the Nutrition Facts panel), resulting in improved diet quality among consumers.", "Public health stakeholders have generally supported restaurant menu labeling as a policy option for obesity prevention. Proponents of menu labeling say that providing calorie information in restaurants and food establishments may help consumers make healthier and more informed dietary choices.

Although consumers often report ordering fewer calories as a result of menu labeling, studies examining restaurant transaction data have not consistently reported a decrease in calories purchased after implementation of menu labeling. This section discusses several studies that have evaluated the impact of menu labeling, using survey and transaction data, on calories purchased.", "Findings from current research are limited because existing studies often vary in scope and methodology. For example, several of the studies that did not find a post-labeling decrease in calories purchased were conducted by the same group of researchers using samples from low-income communities in New York, NY and Newark, NJ, and research has shown that there are socioeconomic disparities in calorie label use, with higher-income individuals being more likely to notice calorie labels. Another study limited its sample population to one chain of restaurants in King County, WA. An additional factor to consider is the time frame between implementation of menu labeling and an assessment of purchasing behavior, as there needs to be enough time for an effect to take place. One study, for instance, did not find an effect at four to six months post-mandatory menu labeling, but it did find a decrease in calories purchased 18 months after implementation. Another study that did not find an effect of menu labeling on calories purchased examined outcomes two months post implementation, which may not have been enough time for an effect to take place. In addition, most of these studies relied on self-reported data to assess customers' awareness and use of calorie labels. Such self-reporting may not be accurate, as evidenced by the inconsistencies between reported calories purchased and actual calories purchased as indicated on receipts. Finally, these studies analyzed the number of calories purchased but not changes in calories consumed, which may differ in response to menu labeling. For example, in full-service restaurants, customers may be more likely to share a meal or eat half the meal and take the rest home, which would not be captured by transaction data. Similarly, in fast food or carry-out establishments, customers may consume only a portion of their meal, which would not be captured by transaction data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies of the Impact of Menu Labeling on Sales and Revenue", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, Starbucks commissioned a Stanford University study to determine how the menu labeling mandate in New York City (NYC) affected its overall sales.", "Findings indicate that after the implementation of mandatory calorie labeling, average calories per transaction fell by 6% at Starbucks, an effect that lasted 10 months after the calorie posting commenced. This effect was primarily found for food purchases, as the average food calories per transaction fell by 14% (i.e., approximately 14 calories per transaction), while average beverage calories per transaction did not substantially change. Changes in beverage calories may not be reflected in transaction data. For example, if a customer orders a latte and substitutes skim milk for 2% milk, or asks for one pump of syrup instead of the usual three or four, those substitutions would not be captured by transaction data because the cost of the latte would not change.", "This study also assessed the impact of calorie posting on Starbucks revenue, reporting no statistically significant change in revenue as a result of calorie labeling. Because cost data associated with the policy was unavailable, profits were not measured directly. The effect on revenue was divided into (1) the effect on the number of transactions and (2) the effect on revenue per transaction. The study found that daily store transactions increased by 1.4% on average, while revenue per transaction decreased by 0.8% on average for all Starbucks in NYC, resulting in a zero net impact of calorie posting on Starbucks revenues. In NYC Starbucks stores located within 100 meters of a Dunkin Donuts, daily revenue increased by 3.3% on average.", "To determine consumers' preliminary knowledge of calories in Starbucks food and beverages, surveys were administered before and after the introduction of a calorie-posting law in Seattle. Pre-menu labeling survey data indicate that Starbucks customers tended to be inaccurate in predicting the number of calories in their beverage and food orders. Specifically, in this study, consumers overestimated the number of calories in beverages and underestimated the number of calories in food. This is consistent with the study's finding that calorie posting discouraged individuals from purchasing food but not beverages. Because consumers tended to underestimate the number of calories in food items, seeing the posted caloric value, which was greater than initially expected, may have led consumers to reduce their food purchases. However, because consumers tended to overestimate beverage calories, calorie posting may not have discouraged people from purchasing beverages.", "Proponents of menu labeling argue that, in addition to affecting consumer purchasing behavior, mandatory menu labeling may incentivize restaurants to offer lower calorie options and provide consumers with healthier choices. A study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine reported that new menu items in restaurant chains in 2013 contained approximately 60 fewer calories compared with menu items in 2012\u2014a 12% drop in calories.

Studies examining the impact of menu labeling on calories purchased show mixed findings, suggesting that providing consumers with nutrition information does not mean they will make more healthful decisions (see \" Research Evaluating the Impact of Menu Labeling \").

For example, as introduced in the 115 th Congress, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act ( H.R. 772 , S. 261 ) would permit entities that receive the majority of orders from customers who are off-premises (e.g., pizza chains) to provide their menus online in place of menu boards in restaurants; would give manufacturers greater flexibility in how they determine and document nutrient content analyses; and would permit establishments with standard menu items that come in different flavors, varieties, or combinations that are listed as a single menu item to determine and disclose nutritional information using specified methods or methods allowed by the Secretary. Under this proposal, if a restaurant or retailer is determined to be in violation of the menu labeling requirements, the entity would have 90 days to take corrective action, and the Secretary would be prohibited from taking enforcement action if the violations are corrected within those 90 days. In addition, the Secretary would be required to promulgate regulations to carry out the standards for determining and disclosing the nutrient content for standard menu items that come in different flavors, varieties, or combinations, but which are listed as a single menu item. Such regulations, as well as any regulations issued before enactment of the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, would not be allowed to take effect until the compliance date specified in the final regulations promulgated pursuant to this Act.", "As mentioned, the menu labeling compliance date has been extended multiple times since the final rule was issued in December 2014. Opponents of the extension have argued that many chains are successfully complying with the labeling requirements and that consumers want menu labeling.
