From October 1, 2013, through October 16, 2013, the federal government (including DHS) operated under an emergency shutdown furlough due to the expiration of annual appropriations for FY2014. More than 31,000 DHS employees were furloughed. Tens of thousands of others that were excepted from furlough, and those whose salaries were paid through annual appropriations, worked without pay until the lapse was resolved by passage of a short-term continuing resolution. From October 17, 2013, to January 17, 2014, the federal government operated under the terms of two consecutive continuing resolutions: P.L. 113-46, which lasted until its successor was enacted on January 15, 2014; and P.L. 113-73, which lasted until the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76), was enacted on January 17, 2014.", "Division F of P.L. 113-76 is the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, which includes $39,270 million in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. This is $922 million more than DHS reportedly received in its annual appropriation for FY2013 after taking into account the impact of sequestration. The act also included an additional $5.6 billion requested by the Administration for FEMA in disaster relief funding as defined by the Budget Control Act, and an additional $227 million for the Coast Guard to pay the costs of overseas contingency operations. Those additional costs are compensated for by adjustments in the discretionary spending limits outlined through the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act as amended.", "For a more detailed discussion of policy matters and legislative details beyond funding levels, see CRS Report R43147, Department of Homeland Security: FY2014 Appropriations, coordinated by [author name scrubbed].", "This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["This report provides an overview of appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

However, the structural changes effected by the Budget Control Act that allowed disaster funding to be included in regular appropriations bills without being scored against the bill's allocation altered the downward trend as funding that might have been provided in a supplemental appropriations bill now was provided in the annual process. Without the impact of disaster relief funding, the nominal level of annual appropriations for the department declined each year since the FY2010 peak, until increasing in FY2014. Supplemental funding, which frequently addressed congressional priorities such as disaster assistance and border security, varies widely from year to year and as a result distorts year-to-year comparisons of total appropriations for DHS.", "Note the table includes two lines for FY2013.
