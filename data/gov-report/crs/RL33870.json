The Administration determined that the program provided approximately 64% of LEAs with funding that was less than $10,000 per year, which it concluded was typically too small to conduct general and effective drug prevention and school safety programs. Also, it was decided that the state grants program did not have a track record producing measurable or positive outcomes. Because of the PART assessment and fiscal constraints affecting the FY2007 budget, the Administration proposed to terminate the state grants program in order to fund what it considered to be higher-priority programs, including several SDFSC national programs.", "PART determined that the national program component of SDFSC held more promise in achieving important results and in helping to enlarge the nation's knowledge base on effective methods and actions related to drug and violence prevention.
