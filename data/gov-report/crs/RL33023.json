{"id": "RL33023", "title": "Open Access Publishing and Citation Archives: Background and Controversy", "released_date": "2006-12-12T00:00:00", "summary": ["Controversies about open access publishing and archiving confront issues of copyright and governmental competition with the private sector. Traditional publishers typically charge readers subscriber fees to fund the costs of publishing and distributing hard-copy and/or online journals. In contrast, most open access systems charge authors publication fees and give readers free online access to the full text of articles. Supporters of the open access \"movement\" object to the rising costs of journal subscriptions; share peer reviewers' reluctance to do free reviews for journals rapidly escalating in price; and believe that scientific collaboration, advancement, and utilization will be hastened by free access to information. Traditional subscriber-pays commercial publishers and some scholarly associations object to most open access publishing because it may weaken the publishing industry and erode profits. Critics seek to limit free government-run repositories only to articles and citations from federally sponsored research; others oppose fees in the thousands of dollars charged to authors to pay the costs of publishing articles or view as unreliable foundation donations that sustain some open access activities.", "In response to congressional action in 2004 and 2005, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented a policy that requires authors it funds to voluntarily submit copies of their manuscripts to NIH's free access electronic database, PubMed Central (PMC), as soon as possible after a journal accepts the article for publication, but within 12 months. The policy allows a publisher-imposed embargo, or delay, before allowing free public access to the manuscript. Many publishers oppose this policy and there is only about a 4% compliance rate by grantees. In September 2006, NIH publicized procedures to permit publishers to post manuscripts or articles directly to PMC and to give NIH free access to some articles for the embargo period.", "In the 109th Congress, report language on H.R. 3010, signed as P.L. 109-149, endorsed NIH's policy to post peer-reviewed manuscripts and mandated NIH to develop its open access repository, PubChem, and to avoid duplication with private efforts. H.R. 5647 would have mandated NIH-funded researchers to submit final manuscripts to PMC; S. 2104 would have required submission within six months. S. 2695, the Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA), would have required federal agencies with research funding exceeding $100 million annually to require all their federally funded researchers to deposit final manuscripts in a publicly accessible archive within six months of acceptance by a publisher.", "During the 110th Congress, issues likely to generate controversy could include the FRPAA, which may be reintroduced; modification of NIH's Public Access policy to require the government to link to the original journal's website to read articles; monitoring the added costs of expanding PubMed Central; determining if other agencies will use governmental nonexclusive licensing to allow access to commercially published journal articles, regardless of copyright ownership; assessing the quality of science published in open access journals; and evaluating the economic impacts of open access publishing on traditional publishing.

Estimates of fees charged vary, but generally range from about $500 to $4,000. These charges may be paid by individual authors, or by institutions, pursuant to institutional subscription contracts with open access journals that cover publication charges for all authors affiliated with that institution.

Surely the cost of open-access digital publishing cannot, in total, be more than we are already paying under the subscription and licensing model. By simply changing the way we support the scientific publishing enterprise, the scientific community and public would preserve everything we value in scientific publishing and gain all of the benefits of open access.", "In opposition, some say if the government paid such costs, money would be diverted inappropriately from research to publishing. Some universities say their costs will increase if they need to reimburse researchers to pay author fees for open access journals and if they still have to pay high costs for subscriptions to traditional journals. In addition, some young scientists/investigators say that business models that force authors to pay for publication in open access journals could hurt them since they often have smaller grants and \"... an author-pays model could amount to a 'tax for productivity.' \" Another issue is that in some applications-oriented fields, such as medicine, engineering, computer science, management, and pharmacy, users of journals, including open access materials, are often private sector parties who read the journals, but likely would not be authors who would contribute to journal publication costs.

In open access publishing, the author of the article retains copyright ownership, but access to the article normally remains free to readers.

Usually journal editors or editorial boards make an initial selection of articles to be peer reviewed from among those submitted; use a panel of expert scientists who may volunteer their time to review submissions; select articles to be published from among the articles peer reviewers ranked as high quality; and sometimes do some editing.", "A long-held principle is that the accumulation of high-quality scientific knowledge rests on a foundation of publication, typically in traditional commercially distributed scientific journals, with the findings and results vetted and validated through a process involving peer review and fee-based journal subscriptions. Critics allege that the open access \"author pays\" model of paying for publishing costs, including peer review, prevents quality control mechanisms from working correctly and that, in the long run, scientific articles published in open access sources may be less credible than those published in journals which charge subscription fees. A survey published in 2005, funded by traditional, subscriber-pays journal publishers, is reported to have found that the quality of peer review was lower in open access than in traditionally published journals:", "Open-access journals ... received fewer submissions and were less selective in choosing among submissions. [It continued] essentially all of the journals reported using editorial review to select and edit submissions.

On the other hand, a study published in 2005 by a publishing analysis firm showed that the quality of nearly 200 open access journals was almost as high in specific medical disciplines as the quality of articles in traditionally published journals.", "Some analysts say that peer review in open access journals suffers from the difficulty of finding enough scientist peer reviewers for both the growing number of open access journals and traditional journals. There is also the view that editorial boards of open access journals, may not filter out unacceptable manuscripts as much as traditional, subscriber-pays journal boards do. Thus peer reviewers for open access journals, who interact and report primarily electronically, may be overwhelmed by the number of articles they are given to review, and, ultimately, there may be delay in the system. Publication in peer reviewed journals figures prominently in promotion and tenure processes in academia. Some observers contend that members of the academic and scientific communities may not view publication on the Internet or in an open access journal to be as prestigious as publication in a traditional, subscriber-pays peer reviewed journal.", "Others use citation data as a surrogate measure for quality. Some analysts cite data showing that articles posted in open access journals or freely available on the Internet are used and cited more frequently than those published in traditional journals and are, therefore, a better model to ensure the speedy utilization of scientific research. For instance,", "Experience in physics where researchers publish in traditional journals and then self-archive their papers in a free database is conducive to scientific communication and favorable to authors because \"papers listed in free archives often get more citations....\" A recent study showed that in four disciplines, philosophy, political science, electrical and electronic engineering, and mathematics, articles that are freely available via open access publishing have a greater research impact than those not available via open access. Impact is measured by citations made by other researchers to the literature in the ISI Web of Science database. In computer sciences, \"a 2001 study in Nature, showed that, at least in one set of disciplines, papers that appear free online are more likely to be cited by other researchers than those that do not. A scientist at NEC Research Institute analyzed nearly 120,000 papers in computer science and related titles. Those that were freely available online had been cited more often in other papers than were those not online, he found. The average number of citations of offline papers was 2.74, compared with 7.03 for those freely available online.\" A study published in an open access journal, suggested that articles published online in open access journal got cited more often than those cited in subscriber or pay for view journals.

The government may subsequently use and distribute the scientific and technical articles as submitted to a publisher or as published in a journal if the publisher has not added any original materials, such as publisher-prepared abstracts or peer review comments.

Subsequently, in 2004, the Science and Technology Committee of Britain's House of Commons issued a report endorsing open access to research results by proposing to require authors to deposit their published papers in online archives and journals using an author pays model and eliminating subscription fees. It also recommended that government agencies mandate that government-funded researchers put their articles into the archives and that the government pay some publishing fees. In November 2004 the U.K. government (the Department of Trade and Industry) rejected the proposal, maintaining there is no indication that access to scientific journals is impeded under current publishing methods, and that according to the government, \"the true costs of open-access publishing are still not clear ...\" and \"it is 'not obvious ... that the 'author pays' business model would give better value for money than the current one....\" In June 2005, the United Kingdom Research Councils (RCUK), the main British supporter of publicly funded research, \"which distribute[s] most government science funding,\" issued for comment a draft policy which mandates researchers it funds to archive their journal articles and conference papers \"in a free public archive 'at the earliest opportunity, wherever possible at or around the time of publication.'\" But the rules may allow publishers to continue to embargo archiving articles until many months after publication, since the council says \"its mandate is 'subject to copyright and licensing arrangements' that can restrict what authors do.\" Costs of publishing in \"author pays\" journals would be covered by the Research Councils' funding grant \"subject to justification of cost-effectiveness.\" The British government said it would review its policy options on this issue taking into consideration the draft RCUK policy and any changes to it, as well as other information. The executive board of the RCUK issued a policy statement in the summer of 2006, saying that \"...all peer-reviewed journal papers produced by publicly funded research must be made available for free soon after they're completed.\" But \"exactly what that means was not specified, and RCUK left each research council to set its own rules.\" RCUK also said it would assess the results of a two-year analysis of the impact of mandating open access and review the policies in 2008.

Will fee-for-access ventures that collect open-access articles become a new cash cow for publishers? At present, faculty members offer their recommendations to the filtering services free, and publishers sell their aggregated opinions to institutions\u2014will established professors go on contributing their free labor to such entrepreneurial enterprises? How will the role of the research library change, as open-access scholarly communication becomes more widely practiced? To what extent will librarians be freed from the burdens of subscription management? Many university libraries now encourage open access by subsidizing a portion of the publication charges in open-access venues for authors affiliated with the university, through channels like our employer's institutional membership program. Will those subsidies continue? If so, will they continue to be paid from libraries' budgets, or will they come from research budgets\u2014a source that would be more consistent with the view of open-access proponents that costs of publication should be part of the costs of conducting research? Or will external granting agencies, many of which already pay scientists' page charges and color-illustration fees, assume the full costs of their investigators' open-access publications? Will libraries continue to serve as intermediaries through which researchers find open-access information, as well as that available only through subscription, and how? Those questions relate not just to academic libraries, but to the mission of colleges and universities. The time has come for a comprehensive review of how best to pay for the dissemination of professors' work. How will reduced legal barriers to reusing articles\u2014a stipulation of most formal definitions of open access\u2014affect teaching, research, and other scholarly activities? There are, of course, good precedents for having few or no legal restrictions on the reuse of scholarly work: Every article published by an employee of the NIH is in the public domain. Some more-restrictive open-access licenses now available, like the Creative Commons attribution license in use for articles from our employer and from BioMed Central, permit users to reproduce scholarly work in any medium, for any purpose, as long as the author receives proper credit. What kinds of educational tools will such licenses make possible? For example, will we see a proliferation of online articles enhanced with explanatory links and informational sidebars, which make scientific discoveries more comprehensible to a wide audience? Will such resources be produced by commercial enterprises? By nonprofit organizations? Or by networks of volunteers, as is the case with open-source computer software? Will open-access articles enable more researchers from less-developed countries to work on the frontiers of science? Given that all credible open-access journals waive publication fees for authors who can't afford to pay them, increased availability\u2014and therefore knowledge\u2014of the literature might well allow scientists in the developing world to increase their output of cutting-edge work. Would that change, in turn, help resolve the \"10/90 gap\"\u2014the unfortunate reality that less than 10 percent of the global expenditure on medical research goes to study the predominant health needs of 90 percent of the world's population? Most important, what kinds of discoveries might result from searchable, open archives of peer-reviewed, full-text scientific literature? The aggregation of gene sequences in a single, freely accessible information space (GenBank) has spawned entire fields of research; will open access to journal articles have a similar effect on areas of work that could benefit from \"mining\" full texts and figures? Clearly, comprehensive collections of open-access literature would make it much easier to systematically review published medical studies. Will open-access literature lead to frequent discoveries of correlations between phenomena previously thought to be unrelated? Will it spark more open access to data sets and databases of laboriously compiled and annotated information? The potential for open access to lead to new discoveries is its single most compelling asset, though one that is frequently overlooked."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
