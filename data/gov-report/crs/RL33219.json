In February 2006, the virus spread from Asia and central Europe to western Europe. By March 2006, health experts had confirmed new bird flu cases in more than 20 countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The first human H5N1 fatalities outside of Asia occurred in that year, with Turkey and Iraq reporting H5N1-related human deaths for the first time in January and February, followed by Azerbaijan and Egypt in March.", "Congress has provided funds for U.S. international avian flu efforts through three appropriations.

Bird (or avian) flu outbreaks have occurred at various times around the world. Until 1997, there were no known human H5N1 cases. That year, 18 people in Hong Kong contracted the virus; of whom 6 died. To contain the virus, 1.5 million birds were killed. Since 2003, when the virus resurfaced and killed 4 people, scientists have closely monitored resurgent H5N1 outbreaks. When analyzing the viral spread and severity of H5N1, some health experts prefer to consider the average H5N1 human fatality rate since the virus emerged in 2003 (more than 50%). The World Health Organization (WHO), however, considers the annual change of human fatality rates. The overall human fatality rate was highest in 2004 (73%), followed by 63% to date in 2006, and 43% in 2005 ( Table 1 ).", "There has been some debate about whether H5N1 will cause a global pandemic. WHO ranks the current global H5N1 outbreak in pandemic alert phase three, which means a virus new to humans is causing infections, but not spreading easily from one person to another ( Table A-1 ). Some predict that if H5N1 were to become transmissible among humans, the virus could cause an \"influenza pandemic\" (worldwide disease outbreak). Skeptics argue that such predictions are exaggerated, because if the virus were able to transform into a strain that is efficiently transmissible among people it would have already done so. WHO warns that the virus is continuing to spread and that the threat has not been eliminated. Thus, in the latter view, governments should continue to prepare for some sort of pandemic and not become complacent even though H5N1 has not yet become transmissible between people.", "At last count, H5N1 has infected birds in more than 50 countries and infected 261 people, of whom 157 have died. More than 200 million birds in Europe, the Middle East and Africa have either died from H5N1 or have been culled in containment exercises. From December 2003 to August 2004, nine Asian countries reported H5N1 outbreaks in poultry. In late July 2005, Russia identified H5N1 in its poultry for the first time. By October 2005, birds in Croatia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Romania, and Turkey had contracted H5N1. In 2006, human H5N1 cases were being reported outside of Asia for the first time.

Some experts contend that wild migratory birds infected with H5N1, notably water fowl, are the main vectors, or media of transmission. H5N1 has been detected in migratory birds in multiple countries, and in some instances, its spread has correlated with seasonal migrations of certain wild species. In some countries, H5N1 has only been found in wild birds. Some veterinarians point out that detecting H5N1 in wild birds can be difficult, because some of the infected birds are asymptomatic, harboring but not exhibiting disease symptoms or ill effects from the virus.", "Other experts, however, maintain that other important modes of transmission should not be underestimated, such as cross-border trade of infected poultry and transmission through poor agricultural practices. Indications that may support such assertions include the detection of H5N1 on commercial farms among caged poultry that are unable to mingle with wild fowl; the detection of H5N1 on farms located far from wetlands where migratory birds seasonally dwell; and the detection of H5N1 in regions where H5N1-linked wild fowl die-offs have not been reported. In some countries, such as in Nigeria, there are some indications that wild fowl may not be implicated in the transmission of H5N1.", "Some epidemiologists contend that the limited human-to-human transmission of H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses that have occurred should also be closely monitored. WHO asserts that the limited cases should not cause alarm, because the virus had not spread beyond a first generation of close contacts or caused illness in the general community.

In January 2006, at the Beijing donor conference, FAO presented a plan that it developed with OIE to control and eradicate H5N1 in animals. Key components of the program to be implemented by FAO and OIE included: coordinating and managing the global response to H5N1; supporting countries with H5N1 cases to control and eradicate the disease; and assisting countries without H5N1 cases to develop preparedness plans. The plan, which was accepted at the Beijing conference, included a budget of $476 million for a three-year cycle. FAO estimated that it would need $130 million to fulfill its part of this global effort.", "As H5N1 continued to spread, requests for assistance simultaneously rose. In response, FAO and OIE revised their plan, particularly to expand assistance to Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The revised plan anticipated that $882 million would be required to address H5N1 in the animal health field, excluding farmer compensation costs. FAO would need $308 million of the funds to undertake its part of the global effort. As of September 30, 2006, donors had pledged $94.4 million to FAO and an additional $39.5 million had been promised to the organization.

In an effort to respond to the global spread of diseases, such as H5N1, and to minimize their interference with international traffic and trade, the World Health Assembly revised the International Health Regulations (IHR) in May 2005.

The revised IHR mandates the WHO to evaluate governments' public health capacities, provide technical assistance, offer logistical support, and mobilize financial resources for building capacity in surveillance and response. Although the revised IHR do not include an enforcement mechanism, all WHO Member States are bound to them, except those that have objected to them. WHO and a number of countries, including the United States, have already taken steps towards implementing the revised IHR and improving countries' capacities to respond to international health risks and emergencies.", "One of the first steps taken was to develop the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN); a system that manages critical information about outbreaks and ensures accurate and timely communications among key international public health professionals.
