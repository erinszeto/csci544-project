A user creates two elements, a public key which helps identify their transactions on the blockchain, and a private key which is necessary to conduct a transaction with the public key. Asymmetric encryption allows for the authentication of users because only those with the private key can decrypt data encrypted with the public key or encrypt the data for public key decryption, thereby creating a signature. ", "The public key may be broadcast on the blockchain itself, or may be tied to an address which is broadcast instead. In some blockchain systems, the real-world identity of each address or public key is logged so that individual users may be tracked. In others, a user may be able to generate public and private keys independently and broadcast the public key or address without identifying themselves, creating a pseudonymous identity on the blockchain. ", "In a blockchain, the public key is used to identify a user on the blockchain and verify the resources (e.g., assets or records) tied to that user's public key or address. The resource could not be used unless the holder of the public key to which the resource is tied unlocks (or decrypts) the resource with their private key, allowing it to be transferred to another identity on the blockchain (a public key or address) and locked with that second user's private key. This transaction would be logged on the blockchain, so that other users could verify the resource has changed possession. ", "An example of how asymmetric key encryption is used daily is when a user connects to a website via Hypertext Transfer Protocol-Secure (HTTPS). To enable the secure connection to the website, a user starts the process by sending a request to the site. The site then sends its public key to the user, and the user's computer then generates a new, secure key (to be used in the HTTPS connection), encrypts it with the website's public key, and sends that back. The user knows that only the website that has the private key can decrypt the information the user just sent. With the new, user-generated key, the website creates the secure connection with the user, indicated to the user by the HTTPS icon (frequently a lock symbol) in the browser window.

In blockchains, a number of transactions are tranched together to make a single block, which is then hashed. ", "Hash values are used to validate the block's integrity. Any alterations to the transactions that make up a block will change the hash value of the block as a whole. If a block's hash value stays the same over time, users can have a high degree of confidence that the transactions in that block have not been tampered with.

If one wanted to have a hash value for the database, one would have to constantly hash it, and maintain a way of ensuring they have the right hash value to align with the current state of the system in order to judge its integrity. Additionally, the larger the database becomes, the more computationally intensive hashing it becomes. A Merkle tree is a cryptographic concept introduced by Ralph Merkle in 1980 as a way around this problem.", "In a Merkle tree, data is segmented apart from a single whole data file. There is a root block of data with a hash value, then subsequent blocks of data (sometimes referred to as child, branch, or leaf blocks) that have their own hash value. Each subsequent block of data takes the hash value of their previous block (sometimes referred to as a parent block) as an input in the creation of the hash value of the new block. This creates a chain or tree of hash values, cryptographically tying new blocks of data to previous ones in a way that prohibits altering previous data. If data in a previous block were to be added, modified, or deleted, the hash value of the subsequent blocks of data would not compute to what they would need to be, alerting users that a change was made. This also allows hash values to be created for smaller, more discrete blocks of data. Hashing these smaller blocks is computationally less resource intensive than rehashing an entire set of data each time an edit is made. ", "Blockchains borrow the concept of Merkle trees to make hash chains. In a blockchain, a first block is created and a hash value is computed for it. This is the root block. Subsequent blocks then use the hash value of the previous block in the chain as one of the inputs to create that next block.

A permissioned blockchain is one in which the permission of a user is assigned to them. Some users may only be able to view a whole or portion of the blockchain; others may be able to add new blocks. In this system, the administrator(s) do not serve as a central authority, since they do not govern the creation of blocks on the blockchain, just the rights of users on the blockchain.

The users on a blockchain could be the individuals, businesses, or other identities which have a public-private key pair and conduct transactions. A node is a computing system on that blockchain. A user may have a node (e.g., an individual's computer or a business's computing network), or a group of users could pool resources to create a single node (e.g., users who share their computing power to mine for new blocks on the blockchain). In a blockchain platform that uses a CSP, the CSP is a node on the blockchain, but may also be a user. ", "The creation and publication of a new block in the blockchain is called mining. In mining blocks, users seek to add the next block to the chain. Mining is incentivized by improving the user's standing in that blockchain, through either a monetary, reputational, or stake award for adding new blocks. New blocks may be added to a blockchain through a variety of methods. Three such methods are proof of work, proof of stake, and round robin. ", "In a proof of work scheme, those seeking to add a block to the blockchain are presented a difficult computational problem. By solving the problem, they win the opportunity to post the next block and possibly a reward for doing so. Their solution is broadcast to others users who can validate it immediately without going through the same resource intensive computation required to solve the problem. In this scheme, the problem is frequently a direction that the hash value contains certain elements (e.g., the value begins with four zeros). In order to produce a hash value with those elements, additional information is added as an input (along with the previous block's hash value, the transactions in the block, data and time information, etc.). This additional information is called a nonce, and could be as simple as a number which would alter the hash value. Finding the nonce value that solves the problem wins for that miner the right to publish the next block. ", "In a proof of stake scheme, the next block may be awarded to the user who has an appropriate stake in that block. This may be because the block contains transactions regarding that user. Or, the user has an X percentage of stake in that blockchain, so they are awarded the right to publish X percent of blocks to that blockchain. Proof of stake schemes are computationally less resource intensive than proof of work. In the round robin scheme, users on the network take turns adding new blocks. Because some level of trust is necessary for round robin schemes to work, they are used in permissioned blockchains. ", "If there is a disagreement in the blockchain, most users on the node will consider the longest chain on the block to be the valid ledger and use that one as the basis for future transactions. In the event that two different miners publish blocks at the same time, and those blocks contain different information, blockchains may allow both blocks to be published for that round, then allow the system to resolve itself upon the publication of the next block, which would then create the largest chain of transactions, and therefore, the most trusted ledger.
