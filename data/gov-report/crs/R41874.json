Much of this can be attributed to the reduction in Navy Reserve strength during this period. There were also modest shifts in strength for some other components of the Selected Reserve. For comparative purposes, the authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves for FY2001 were as follows: Army National Guard (350,526), Army Reserve (205,300), Navy Reserve (88,900), Marine Corps Reserve (39,558), Air National Guard (108,022), Air Force Reserve (74,358), and Coast Guard Reserve (8,000).

Section 515 in the Senate bill would allow the Secretary of Defense to involuntarily order units and individuals of the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Air Force Reserve to active duty for up to 120 days \"when a governor requests federal assistance in responding to a major disaster or emergency.\" National Guard forces are not included in this authority, but state governors already have the ability to activate their state National Guard forces and to request support from other state National Guards under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact.

A dual status commander is a military officer who simultaneously serves as a state National Guard officer under the control of his or her governor, and as a federal military officer under the control of the President. A dual status commander is thus able to command non-federalized National Guard forces and federal forces via these separate chains of command. The language of this provision also specifies that \"when a major disaster or emergency occurs in any area subject to the laws of any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, the Governor of the State affected normally should be the principal authority supported by the primary Federal agency and its supporting Federal entities, and the Adjutant General of the State or his or her subordinate designee normally should be the principal military authority supported by the dual-status commander when acting in his or her State capacity.\" There was no analogous language in the House bill.

The authority to activate reservists under this provision rests with the Service Secretary, but it may only be invoked for missions that are \"preplanned\" and where the reserve component activations were budgeted for. According to the Senate Committee report, this new authority \"is not designed for use for emergent operational or humanitarian missions, but rather to enhance the use of reserve component units that organize, train, and plan to support operational mission requirements to the same standards as active component units under service force generation plans in a cyclic, periodic, and predictable manner\" No more than 60,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves may be serving on active duty under this authority at any given time.

They also note that a Vice Chief should be at least the same rank as the Directors of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, both of whom are lieutenant generals, in order to effectively act in the place of the CNGB when required.

Such provisions have been included regularly in annual national defense authorizations. However, this provision was removed this year in the HASC chairman's mark. By not extending the existing prohibition on fee increases, the bill would allow the Obama Administration to implement its proposal to increase the annual enrollment fee by $30 per year for individual and $60 per year for family enrollments.

The law currently makes most Medicare-eligible retirees ineligible for TRICARE unless they enroll in and pay Medicare Part B premiums. Medicare-eligible retirees enrolled in USFHP, however, are not required to enroll in Medicare Part B. Because DOD believes that it pays a higher capitated rate than the equivalent Medicare capitated plan, it believes that the Government can reduce expenditures if future Medicare-eligible USFHP enrollees are required to enroll in Medicare Part B to retain TRICARE coverage under the TRICARE for Life plan. Medicare Part B premiums are currently $96.40 per month for individuals with incomes less than $85,000 per year.
