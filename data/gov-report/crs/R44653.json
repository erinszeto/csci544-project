The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides a preview report at the beginning of the calendar year calculating any adjustments to the existing statutory spending limits. For FY2017 the adjusted discretionary spending caps are $551.068 billion for defense and $518.531 billion for nondefense. Once discretionary spending is enacted, OMB evaluates that spending relative to the spending limits and determines whether sequestration is necessary. For FY2017 discretionary spending, the first such evaluation (and any necessary enforcement) is to occur within 15 calendar days after the 2016 congressional session adjourns sine die . For any FY2017 discretionary spending that becomes law after the session ends, the OMB evaluation and any enforcement of the limits would occur 15 days after enactment.
