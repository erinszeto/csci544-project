The reform debates have included proposals and initiatives to establish and foster an interagency community of national security professionals (NSPs) from all relevant departments and agencies. According to proponents, NSPs, through participating in activities that might include shared educational and training opportunities, and rotational tours in other agencies, would gain a better understanding of the mandates, capabilities, and cultures of other agencies. They would become better prepared to plan national security missions with counterparts from other agencies and to execute those missions at home and abroad, and eventually become better able to oversee their own agencies' efforts from leadership positions.", "Such recommendations are not new, but real-world events over the past decade\u2014 the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. government responses to natural disasters at home, including Hurricane Katrina\u2014gave the debates a greater sense of urgency by underscoring room for improvement in the ability of the U.S. government to integrate the various components of its efforts.", "Congressional interest has emerged in both houses, on both sides of the aisle, and from multiple committees. That interest was manifested in part by the introduction of NSP-related legislation in the 110th, 111th, and 112th Congresses.", "In the executive branch, in 2007, the Bush Administration launched the National Security Professional Development (NSPD) program, based on the three pillars of education, training, and rotational service.

Such preparation would enable NSPs to more effectively craft strategy and plan and execute national security missions together. These shared practices, proponents add, would eventually lead to broader organizational cultural change across U.S. government agencies, as NSPs, for whom interagency collaboration would become second nature, reach senior leadership positions.", "Such recommendations are not new, but they were given a new sense of urgency by operational experiences at home and abroad over the last 10 years\u2014from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the responses to Hurricane Katrina\u2014which suggested insufficiencies in the ability of the U.S. government to integrate and apply the various components of its efforts.

In the war's immediate aftermath, the War Department commissioned a study of military officer education and tasked Army Lieutenant General Leonard Gerow to lead it. In February 1947, the study team issued its findings, including a recommendation for the establishment of a National Security University. The University would bring together and educate practitioners not just from the military but also from all other security-related agencies, broadly defined. The University would include the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF, which had already been established), as well as four new schools\u2014a National War College, a joint administrative college, a joint intelligence college, and a Department of State college. As it turned out, of the proposed new institutions, only the National War College (NWC) was established, and in 1976, ICAF and the NWC were brought together under the new National Defense University, designed to pool the intellectual resources of the defense community.", "Fifty years later, in the aftermath of the Cold War and during a time of expanding U.S. government involvement in nation-building missions, the National Defense Panel (NDP) recommended the establishment of an interagency cadre based on long-term, multi-faceted career development. The NDP itself, a \"nonpartisan, independent panel,\" was established by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1997 to assess and report on the execution by the Department of Defense (DOD) of the 1997 quadrennial defense review process. The NDP recommended creating:", "an interagency cadre of professionals, including civilian and military officers, whose purpose would be to staff key positions in the national security structures. Such a cadre would be similar in spirit to the \"joint\" experience envisioned by the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act. Attention should be given to their education, development, and career development [sic]. A certain number of \"interagency\" slots should be identified within the national security community, including domestic agencies that have foreign affairs responsibilities (e.g. Justice, Commerce, Energy) and staffed by the interagency cadre.", "The panel further recommended that to support the new cadre, a national security curriculum should be established, \"combining course work at the National Defense University and the National Foreign Affairs Training Center, with a mix of civilian, military, and foreign students to receive training and education in strategic affairs.\"", "In February 2001, as part of a larger package of proposed national security reforms, the United States Commission on National Security/21 st Century (the \"Hart-Rudman Commission\") proposed the creation of an interagency cadre called the National Security Service Corps (NSSC) and spelled out its recommendations in detail. The goal would be developing leaders \"skilled at producing integrative solutions to U.S. national security policy problems.\" The program would include full-spectrum career development, including rotational assignments and professional education, and these experiences would be prerequisites for \"hold[ing] certain positions or to be promoted to certain levels.\" The scope of \"national security\" would be broadly defined\u2014participating departments would include \"Defense, State, Treasury, Commerce, Justice, Energy, and the new National Homeland Security Agency.\" The proposals focused only on civil servants\u2014the military, the intelligence community, and the Foreign Service would be excluded.", "To help integrate the efforts by multiple agencies, the Hart-Rudman Commission recommended the creation of an \"interagency advisory group.\" The group would ensure that promotion rates for the NSSC were at least comparable to those elsewhere in the Civil Service, and would help establish guidelines for rotational assignments and for meeting professional education requirements. Departments would retain control over their own personnel and would continue to make promotion decisions. The Commission believed that specific legislative authority for such an initiative was not necessary.", "In 2005, the Beyond Goldwater-Nichols project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) made a very similar recommendation, noting its debt to the Hart-Rudman Commission. They proposed and described the creation of a \"national security career path that would give career professionals incentives to seek out interagency experience, education, and training.\" To the Hart-Rudman proposals, the CSIS team added that to make the program workable for civilian agencies, \"Congress should approve a 10% float\"\u2014additional personnel\u2014to allow participation in training, education, and exchange programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the interagency reform debates received a powerful jumpstart from the convergence of \"lessons learned\" thinking in the homeland security and traditional national security communities, developed to assess operational experiences, respectively, in response to Hurricane Katrina, and in Iraq and Afghanistan. Members of both communities concluded that fostering an interagency cadre of specialists would help improve coordination in the future. The convergence of national and homeland security thinking gave additional weight to the basic recommendation, but it also introduced a fundamental tension concerning the relative importance of national and homeland security considerations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Homeland Security: Hurricane Katrina", "paragraphs": ["In February 2006, then-Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Frances Fragos Townsend submitted to President Bush the report The F ederal Response to Hurricane Katrina: Lessons Learned , which described the state of national preparedness before Katrina's landfall and assessed the responses in the immediate aftermath. The report highlighted numerous challenges responding organizations faced in trying to coordinate their efforts\u2014for example, communicating with one another effectively, given that some communications systems were mutually incompatible and others were rendered inoperable by natural events. The report made 125 recommendations for change. Among those recommendations, the report called for the creation of a \"comprehensive program for the professional development and education of the Nation's homeland security personnel,\" with the goal of fostering \"a 'joint' Federal Interagency, State, local and civilian team.\" The scope of the proposed program would thus be broad, including federal, state, and local officials as well as emergency management personnel from the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and faith-based and community groups.", "To implement such a program, the Katrina Lessons Learned report, like the Hart-Rudman Commission report, prescribed a de-centralized division of labor with only limited centralized oversight. While the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) would establish the professional development program, each participating agency would determine which of its offices played homeland security roles, and what preparation they would need in order to execute those responsibilities. Each agency would establish its own professional development program, including \"career assignments, education, exercises, and training.\" The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in turn, would set up an interagency working group to establish shared goals and standards for measuring individual agency progress\u2014a collaboration among equals.", "The Katrina Lessons Learned report also called for making both education and rotational tours in other agencies prerequisites for \"senior managerial positions.\" It argued that legislation should be considered to support this provision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Security: Iraq and Afghanistan, and Goldwater-Nichols", "paragraphs": ["Meanwhile, early operational experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan led many participants and observers to conclude that U.S. government interagency coordination in the decision-making, strategy-making, and planning and execution for national security activities left much to be desired. For example, in the case of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), some practitioners and observers suggested that an insufficiently rigorous National Security Council decision-making process failed to appropriately define objectives or to assign roles and missions among agencies ahead of time; that agencies conducted insufficient planning for post-war considerations; and that in the execution of the formal occupation of Iraq, from 2003 to 2004, agencies found it difficult to collaborate smoothly and seamlessly. ", "At the Department of State, these and other operational experiences contributed to the decision to establish, in 2004, the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS), with the mandate to help develop policies and procedures to enable more effective integration of effort in planning and execution, in future contingencies.", "Within the Department of Defense, for many senior military officers, the apparent need for closer integration of effort across U.S. government agencies suggested that the military's experiences integrating the military services under the umbrella of \"jointness,\" based on the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, might be germane. In 2004, then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Corps General Peter Pace, in a series of public speeches and addresses to DOD war college audiences, suggested that the nation might need a \"Goldwater-Nichols for the interagency.\" He emphasized the value that \"cross-pollination,\" trust, and understanding among agencies could have, and he stressed the fact that within DOD, the Services \"had to be forced\" into jointness by legislation.", "Goldwater-Nichols is a touchstone for the uniformed military\u2014both a watershed event for today's senior leaders, and a fundamental way of doing business for junior officers\u2014so it is no surprise that it provides a basis of comparison for many, in thinking about possible interagency reform. In common parlance, \"Goldwater-Nichols\" refers to the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 itself ( P.L. 99-433 , October 1, 1986), and to the ongoing process of implementing and adapting the Goldwater-Nichols legislation, including follow-on amendments to Title 10, U.S. Code, and associated updates to DOD practices and policies.", "The 1986 act ushered in fundamental defense reorganization, aimed at reducing inter-Service rivalries and fostering greater \"jointness\" among the Services. The act began by defining what the new concept \"joint\" meant, thereby bounding the substantive scope of the act . It stated, \"the term 'joint matters' means matters relating to the integrated employment of land, sea, and air forces, including matters relating to\u2014(1) national military strategy; (2) strategic planning and contingency planning; and (3) command and control of combat operations under unified command.\"", "To achieve greater \"jointness,\" the Goldwater-Nichols Act and related later amendments to Title 10, U.S. Code, created and elaborated a professional development system for joint qualified officers, including requirements for both education and joint duty assignments. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2007 made an important revision, amending Title 10, U.S. Code, to establish a four-tiered system of joint qualification that emphasized career-long development and introduced more flexible options for meeting the requirements. As the amended Title 10 now states: \"The purpose of establishing such qualification levels is to ensure a systematic, progressive, career-long development of officers in joint matters and to ensure that officers serving as general and flag officers have the requisite experience and education to be highly proficient in joint matters.\"", "To make the new system work, the Goldwater-Nichols Act and follow-on legislation established links between \"jointness\" and career progression. In the first place, the legislation took steps to ensure that pursuing \"jointness\" would have no negative repercussions on individual career advancement, by supporting parity in promotion decisions concerning \"joint\" officers and their peers.", "In addition, in order to create a strong incentive for individual participation, the Goldwater-Nichols Act established joint service as a requirement for promotion to the rank of general or flag officer. The N DAA for FY 2002 strengthened the requirements for promotion to general or flag officer, to include serving a \"full tour\" of duty in a joint duty assignment, as well as achieving joint designation.", "The concept of a \"Goldwater-Nichols for the interagency\" was institutionalized in DOD strategic thinking in 2005, during the conduct of the congressionally mandated quadrennial defense review (QDR) process. The QDR Report called specifically for an interagency cadre: \"the Department supports the creation of a National Security Officer (NSO) corps\u2014an interagency cadre of senior military and civilian professionals able to effectively integrate and orchestrate the contributions of individual government agencies on behalf of larger national security interests.\" In putting forward this proposal, the QDR Report also specifically invoked the joint duty assignment provisions of Goldwater-Nichols, noting, \"Much as the Goldwater-Nichols requirement that senior officers complete a joint duty assignment has contributed to integrating the different cultures of the Military Departments into a more effective joint force, the QDR recommends creating incentives for senior Department and non-Department personnel to develop skills suited to the integrated interagency environment.\" The QDR Report was issued in February 2006, the same month that the Katrina Lessons Learned report was released."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Developments", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the George W.

And who exactly should be included?", "From the outset, the program pointedly defined \"national security\" to include both \"traditional national security and homeland security missions.\" The National Strategy attempted to refine that definition by stating, somewhat circularly, that \"national security missions\" were those necessary for the implementation of a series of national strategies: ", "among others, the National Defense Strategy , the National Drug Control Strategy , the National Intelligence Strategy , the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism , the National Strategy for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction , the National Strategy for Homeland Security , the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets , the National Security Strategy , the National Response Plan , the National Cyber Security Strategy , and the War on Terrorism National Implementation Plan . ", "This statement provided practical but not conceptual guidance concerning the bounds of \"national security.\"", "Without a crisp definition of \"national security\" itself, the NSPD program struggled to determine which categories of personnel ought to participate. ", "Levels of Government: While the initial intent of the NSPD program, which pointedly included homeland security in its conceptual scope, appeared to be to include all levels of government, the focus subsequently narrowed to the federal level. The NSPD E.O. stated that the NSPD program's \"opportunities shall be provided across ... levels of government\"; and it directed that the Secretary of Homeland Security \"develop a program to provide to Federal, State, local and tribal government officials education in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery plans and authorities, and training in crisis decision-making skills.\" Yet the language of the National Strategy repeatedly suggested that NSPs are exclusively federal government employees. For example, the Strategy's first paragraphs asserted that success depends on \"heightened collaboration and a mutual understanding ... across the Federal Government.\" The Strategy also noted: \"A national security professional development framework must utilize existing and new opportunities to develop Federal Government professionals with the breadth and depth of knowledge, skills, abilities, and experiences necessary for them to carry out their national security responsibilities effectively.\" Three Special Categories: The NSPD E.O. created special conditions for three categories of federal professionals: the military, the Foreign Service, and the intelligence community. According to NSPD officials, as the E.O. was being drafted, these communities, all of which already maintained their own robust career development programs, expressed concerns that full incorporation into the NSPD program would impose undue additional burdens in terms of time and resources required. The E.O. clearly indicated the intent that these three communities contribute to the implementation of the National Strategy. At the same time, it specifically freed them from oversight by the NSPD program governing hierarchy. Instead, it tasked their respective agency heads to \"issue rules or guidance on professional development programs ... to implement the national strategy,\" and directed that in doing so they \"shall coordinate such programs to the maximum extent practicable with the [NSPD] Steering Committee.\"", "Within these parameters, the original NSPD program used positions\u2014or billets\u2014to determine individual participation. The E.O. specifically defined national security professionals as \"current and future professionals in national security positions.\" Agencies were tasked to identify NSP billets, and current occupants of those billets were \"in\" to the program by virtue of the seats they occupied. Missing, according to some officials, was a mechanism for identifying \"future\" NSPs, in the language of the E.O., as well as a system for tracking and effectively utilizing NSPs once they had completed program requirements and left designated NSP billets. ", "In 2008, the NSPD program provided a rough order of magnitude estimate that the program would eventually include approximately 20,000 federal government employees, of whom about 1,500 would be Senior Executive Service members, and the rest GS-13s through GS-15s (and their rank equivalents). At the time, some officials familiar with the program suggested that these numbers seemed low, and they wondered which positions at the Department of Defense, for example, would not logically fall under the rubric of national security. Others suggested that the relatively low numbers had a practical explanation\u2014the NSPD program tasked individual departments and agencies to produce lists of their respective NSP positions, but provided no additional resources to support NSP education, training, or other programs, so agencies may have had an incentive to lowball the total numbers reported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organization and Structure", "paragraphs": ["In general, governance of the original NSPD program was characterized by relatively weak central administration and largely decentralized execution. Specific leadership roles, and the relationships among key NSPD bodies, shifted during the course of implementation.", "The May 2007 E.O. created an Executive Steering Committee (ESC) to provide senior-level oversight of the NSPD program. The E.O. specified that the ESC would be chaired by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The ESC's relatively extensive membership, reaching beyond the bounds of those agencies traditionally concerned with national security, included the principals or their designees from the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Agriculture, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, and Homeland Security; as well as the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In practice, according to participants, once the program was established, agency designees tended to be senior human capital professionals. In late 2007, leadership of the ESC shifted\u2014rather abruptly, some observers noted\u2014from OPM to OMB, under the personal direction of then-Deputy Director for Management Clay Johnson. The shift took place after OPM, in accordance with Section 3 of the E.O., had met a major program milestone by submitting the initial plan for the National Strategy .

Agencies were tasked to craft career development initiatives under the NSPD umbrella, and it would be the function of the ESC to \"coordinate, to the maximum extent practicable, national security professional development programs and guidance issued by the heads of agencies in order to ensure an integrated approach to such programs.\" The National Strategy elaborated on this theme, arguing that core competencies and requirements differed among agencies, and therefore the goal was not \"a single human resource or career development standard,\" but rather the \"integration of national security professional development resources and opportunities.\"", "In early 2008, the NSPD Integration Office (IO) was established with the mandate to coordinate NSPD-related activities among agencies on behalf of the ESC. The NSPD IO was led, under the Bush Administration and in the first years of the Obama Administration, by retired Army Major General William Navas, Jr., a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. He was supported initially by a senior executive detailed from the Central Intelligence Agency and a handful of staff provided by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. DOD provided the office with a limited operating budget. With its skeleton staff, relatively limited resources, and limited authority, the IO performed a monitoring rather than an enforcement function: conveying ESC guidance to participating agencies, encouraging and tracking agency implementation, coordinating efforts among agencies, and reporting back to the ESC.", "The structure of the original NSPD program also included the National Security Education and Training Consortium (NSETC), a virtual network of public and private institutions providing relevant national security education and/or training. The NSETC was led by a board of directors, created in late spring 2008 and mandated to establish criteria for admitting new members to the consortium, to facilitate coordination and information-sharing among members, and to address any identified gaps. The board included representatives from NSPD participating agencies, and it enjoyed significant support from the U.S. Institute of Peace.

These pillars broadly echoed the basic planks of the military's Joint Qualification System. In practice, in NSPD's de-centralized construct, the pillars were implemented to varying degrees and in varied ways, from agency to agency, frequently drawing on and modifying their own pre-existing programs in order to meet NSPD intent.", "For the education pillar, the NSPD National Strategy stated that the federal government would \"establish a broad interagency education system.\" To that end, rather than create new programs from scratch, the ESC was tasked first to inventory existing programs inside and outside government, to synchronize and provide curricula as needed, to enable virtual connectivity among agencies and educational institutions, and to consider a wide array of possible formats including short-term programs and distance learning.", "The educational pillar of the NSPD program drew on a pre-existing effort at the Department of Defense aimed at pooling educational resources under the broad banner of national security. The 2006 QDR Report , borrowing terminology from a 1947 study by the War Department, had called for the transformation of the National Defense University (NDU), located at Fort McNair in Washington, DC, into a \"true National Security University.\" As the QDR Report described it, the new institution would be \"tailored to support the educational needs of the broader U.S. national security profession. Participation from interagency partners will be increased and the curriculum will be reshaped in ways that are consistent with a unified U.S. government approach to national security missions, and greater interagency participation will be encouraged.\"", "Some leading proponents of Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) responded to the QDR recommendations with concern. Representative Ike Skelton of the House Armed Services Committee, long a strong proponent of professional military education, wrote a letter to then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, urging him not to take a step that might impinge on JPME. General Pace, by then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reportedly agreed and gave guidance to make sure that any new interagency-focused initiatives at DOD schoolhouses would not interfere with the fulfillment of the military's own existing educational requirements. ", "As a result of such concerns, instead of transforming itself into a \"National Security University,\" including new bricks-and-mortar facilities, NDU began exploring options for creating virtual communities with counterpart institutions affiliated with other U.S. government agencies, including the Foreign Service Institute, and the National Intelligence University. This approach, known for a time as the National Security Education Consortium, also reportedly eased the concerns of some civilian agencies that developing interagency educational programs within a physical, DOD-owned facility might give the program too much of a defense focus.", "After the NSDP E.O. was signed in May 2007, these ground-up NDU-led educational efforts were subsumed under the NSPD program. While NDU's early efforts to expand interagency education had been guided primarily by educators, under the NSPD umbrella, human capital professionals, responsible in general for establishing competencies to guide educational requirements, assumed the lead role. ", "One early major NSPD educational initiative was a pilot program hosted by NDU, during the 2007-2008 academic year, at three of its schoolhouses\u2014the National War College (NWC) and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) at Fort McNair, and the Joint Forces Staff College (JFSC) in Norfolk, VA. According to its mission statement, the goal of the pilot program was to produce professionals able to \"analyze, at the strategic and operational level, the capabilities, organizational cultures, procedures, and roles of U.S. departments and agencies in the planning and conduct of complex operations in peace, crisis, war and post-conflict overseas and in homeland contingencies.\"", "A total of 38 students took part\u201415 at the NWC, 15 at ICAF, and 8 at the JFSC. Of those, 11 were military officers, including some members of the U.S. Coast Guard. Participating civilian agencies included the CIA, and the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Energy, and the Congressional Research Service. At each institution, NSPD students enrolled in all of the regular core curriculum courses, but selected their elective courses from special lists. At the NWC and ICAF, 12 electives were available, including\u2014illustratively\u2014\"Intelligence and National Security,\" \"Homeland Security,\" \"Stabilization and Reconstruction,\" and \"Interagency Negotiation.\" At the JFSC, available electives included \"Case Studies in Interagency and International Operations;\" \"Homeland Security, Transformation and the War against Terrorism;\" \"Joint Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance;\" and \"Just War to Jihad: Ethics in an Age of Uncertainty.\"", "The pilot program participants, who graduated on June 12, 2008, were to receive a designation in their personnel records that they had completed the NSPD education pillar. According to NSPD officials, eligible participants would still be required to complete the training and professional experience pillars, in order to be designated \"national security professionals.\" At the time of graduation, however, the qualification requirements for those pillars had not yet been developed.", "\"Lessons learned\" efforts, including a series of focus groups conducted by NDU, and informal feedback volunteered by students, suggested a few concerns with the pilot program's execution. Some observers reportedly commented that it was not obvious how the NSPD educational objectives differed from those of the normal NDU programs. This observation might be considered a vote of confidence in the adaptability of NDU programs, which have been revised and updated in recent years to reflect greater concern with interagency issues. Some pilot program participants advocated greater flexibility in selecting their elective courses, suggesting that the concept of what is relevant to national security professionals might usefully be expanded. Others reportedly suggested that an NSPD educational program should be more robust and intensive\u2014for example, it might include additional seminars or discussions, outside the usual coursework, exclusively for NSPD participants, to delve more deeply into key interagency issues and case studies. The NSPD educational pilot program was not continued in the following academic year.", "Meanwhile, the Department of State also leveraged existing initiatives to support the education pillar of the NSPD program. In spring 2007, State piloted its new National Security Executive Leadership Seminar (NSELS) at its Foreign Service Institute (FSI). NSELS, initially envisaged as a replacement for an earlier, nine-month residential executive course, was developed in parallel with the NSPD E.O. and refined to meet its intent. Like the DOD courses, the NSELS program focuses on both national security and interagency concerns, utilizing a variety of assigned reading and guest speakers. NSELS is also deeply \"interagency\"\u2014about half the participants in each NSELS course come from agencies other than the State Department. Unlike the DOD courses\u2014which are nearly a year long and full-time residential\u2014NSELS students participate two days a month for five months. This approach allows students to continue to do their day jobs without a backfill. ", "Some NSPD-affiliated educators and observers have raised questions about what properly constitutes \"education,\" and they have suggested that short-form courses like NSELS might more appropriately be considered \"training.\" Some further point to the very name of the facility that hosts NSELS: the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center (emphasis added). Others, however, argue that the distinction between education and training should depend more on content than on course length. The NSPD National Strategy defines the two terms this way:", "Education: Opportunities to enhance a person's capacity for critical and innovative thinking, and level of understanding of authorities, risks, responsibilities, and tools to perform a current or future national security mission successfully. Training: Opportunities to enhance, exercise, or refine a person's ability to apply knowledge, skills, and abilities in performing national security missions.", "State's NSELS program is not unique in adopting a format that allows participants to continue serving in their current billets. For example, DOD's Executive Leadership Development Program (ELDP), established in 1985, provides DOD civilians (GS-12 to GS-14) with deep exposure to DOD joint roles and missions. Over the course of 10 months, students\u2014who remain in their current jobs\u2014convene first for two weeks of classroom education, and then monthly for one-week field visits to various DOD commands around the world. Proponents argue that such formats can make educational opportunities available to those cannot leave their day jobs for a significant consecutive length of time and would thus otherwise be unable to participate; and that, compared to online coursework, they have the advantage of facilitating in-person relationship-building.", "For the training pillar of NSPD, the National Strategy called for \"ample training opportunities to refine skills through instruction, drills, and exercises.\" According to the Strategy , the first step\u2014as in the education pillar\u2014was to be identifying existing programs, facilities and institutions that could support the NSPD program. The survey was to consider federal programs first, but also state, local, territorial, tribal, academic, non-governmental, and private sector programs. The newly constituted National Security Education and Training Consortium (NSETC) Board of Directors was assigned the responsibility to recommend training as well as educational courses for inclusion in the NSPD program. The National Strategy also tasked the ESC to promote existing federal government training consortia concerned with aspects of national security, \"in order to promote a sharing of best practices.\"", "In general, the original NSPD program acknowledged great variation among the roles and responsibilities of NSPs across the government. The National Strategy , for example, recognized \"the reality that the core competencies needed for each mission area and institution will vary, and therefore professional experience, education, and training programs must be customized in each mission area and institution.\" What the NSPD program's strategic documents did not directly address is that the variation in requirements might be substantially greater for training than for education. Education in strategic planning, problem-solving, and leadership, for example, might be appropriate for all NSPs. Training requirements, however, are typically much more specific, focused on mastering tasks to be executed during contingencies, including requirements to coordinate with specific colleagues in other agencies, and thus might reasonably vary significantly among NSPs.", "The earliest NSPD training efforts were focused on creating an appropriate orientation for all participating NSPs. According to NSPD officials, the purpose of introductory training would not be to create instant experts, but rather to introduce participants to the full spectrum of NSPD agencies and concerns. In practice, orientation training was bifurcated between homeland and traditional national security concerns.", "On February 4, 2008, the Emergency Management Institute of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), part of the Department of Homeland Security, unveiled an online, three-hour orientation course entitled, \"National Response Framework: An Introduction.\" The course, like the framework itself, had been developed in response to lessons learned from responses to Hurricane Katrina. The FEMA course outline stated that material covered included the framework's purpose, response doctrine, the roles and responsibilities of participating entities, and multi-agency coordination. The course was intended for \"government executives, private-sector and non-governmental organization (NGO) leaders, and emergency management practitioners.\" The course was adopted pragmatically by the NSPD program to meet at least part of its own training requirements.", "Meanwhile, in the absence of a pre-existing product, National Security Council staff worked to develop a traditional national security-focused introductory online training module, entitled \"National Security Objectives, Structures and Processes: An Introduction.\" At the time, some officials noted that this pragmatic dual-track approach to orientation missed a key opportunity to underscore and elaborate on a fundamental premise of the NSPD program\u2014that, as the National Strategy stated: \"The Nation cannot view the missions of national security and homeland security as separate and distinct.\"", "Professional experience\u2014or interagency rotation\u2014was the third pillar of the NSPD program established by the May 2007 E.O. Other than interagency rotation programs that were already in place, this pillar was the least developed of the three under the original NSPD program, arguably because rotations require more refinements to personnel systems and more coordination among agencies than either shared education or shared training. The original NSPD program consistently adopted a highly de-centralized approach toward rotational opportunities.", "The National Strategy spelled out the tasks to be undertaken to support the interagency experience pillar, including designating certain activities as \"interagency duty assignments,\" developing a \"formal mechanism\" for rotational and temporary detail assignments, and linking career advancement to participation in such rotational assignments. The Strategy assigned these responsibilities to the \"relevant departments and agencies,\" while the role of the ESC would be simply to \"coordinate the completion\" of the tasks. ", "In March 2008, the NSPD IO coordinated the compilation of a checklist of proposals to the ESC for decision and action. This \"Action List\" echoed the Strategy's highly de-centralized division of labor for interagency rotation issues. It recommended tasking individual agencies to develop the \"criteria for acceptable mission-related experiences that are appropriate for their NSP positions;\" to identify positions available for rotational opportunities; and, \"to the extent permitted by law,\" to draft regulations \"designed to create rules stipulating that candidates for Senior Executive Service (SES) positions (or other equivalent senior-level federal executive positions) for identified national security positions across the Federal government must have documented rotational or interagency national security professional experience.\"", "In November 2008, OPM, in coordination with the ESC, acted on some of these proposals by issuing guidance to NSPD participating agencies, in which they \"encourage[d] agencies to implement a qualification requirement for specific NSP-designated SES positions,\" based on individuals' \"demonstrated ability to lead inter-agency, inter-departmental, inter-governmental activities, or comparative cross-organizational activities;\" and recommended \"a multi-agency or equivalent experience for selection into NSP SES positions.\" This OPM guidance cast a broad net in defining the boundaries of \"interagency\" experience, including \"Federal, state, local or foreign government entities, non-profit or non-governmental organizations, private sector organizations, international organizations such as NATO, and/or academic institutions.\" Like the National Strategy, the OPM guidance gave agencies a great deal of leeway in general, including the flexibility to include internal rotations among their own components, and the discretion more broadly to define the qualification requirements based on their own needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NSPD Under the Obama Administration", "paragraphs": ["Since the mandate for the NSPD program is an executive order, the January 2009 change of administration introduced deep uncertainty about the future of the program\u2014would the Obama Administration rescind the E.O., or extend and perhaps expand on it, or simply let it die a quiet death?

For example, the State Department continued to conduct its NSELS educational course for full houses of State and non-State \"students,\" and its Foreign Service Institute conducted germane training courses for State and non-State participants, such as the workshop \"Interagency Effectiveness: Strategies and Best Practices.\" In August 2010, the Department of Defense (DOD) hosted a National Security Professional Symposium at the National Defense University. The event was designed not to map out the next phase of NSPD program activities, but rather to continue the NSPD process by \"bringing together professionals from a wide variety of agencies to collaborate and learn together.\" DOD reported that the event drew 266 participants from more than a dozen federal agencies. In November 2010, the Department of Commerce hosted a half-day \"NSPD Agency Awareness\" event, with participants from at least 10 agencies. The event was designed to give NSPs \"the opportunity to network with other NSPs from across the federal government while also learning about the history, functions, and cultures of other departments.\" The event included \"101\"-style overviews by three agencies: the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and Transportation. Despite the lack of robust overall program guidance at that time, the level of individual interest in participating in the NDU event was reportedly reasonably strong.", "Meanwhile, during the so-called pause, the National Security Staff (NSS) sought to reinvigorate and refine the focus of the NSPD program. Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates, then the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor for Strategic Planning, who had led efforts across the Administration to produce the 2010 National Security Strategy , was given policy responsibility for the NSPD program and established an Interagency Policy Committee (IPC) to oversee the effort. Ambassador Yates' staff, working through an interagency sub-IPC, reportedly made substantial progress revising the Bush Administration's National Strategy for the Development of Security Professionals, which had been issued in July 2007, with the intent of using a clear, agreed new NSPD strategy as the basis for developing and issuing an updated NSPD executive order. ", "In addition, Ambassador Yates' NSS team led an effort to craft and gain IPC approval of a revised list of desired \"shared capabilities\" that would apply to all NSPs. The objective, according to NSS and agency officials, was to provide all NSPD participating agencies with refined, broad intent to serve as a basis for their respective NSPD program planning efforts. The revision effort grew out of discussions that took place during the August 2010 NSPD Symposium hosted by NDU. After the NDU event, the National Security Education and Training Consortium (NSETC) put together a curriculum working group which, under NSS leadership, revised the Bush Administration-era document, \"National Security Professionals Shared Competencies for Interagency Operations.\" The new document, \"Shared Capabilities,\" identified the same basic eight qualities named in the earlier version\u2014strategic thinking; critical and creative thinking; leading interagency teams; collaborating; planning and managing interagency operations; maintaining global and cultural acuity; mediating and negotiating; and communicating\u2014but refined the descriptions of each.", "Substantively, all of the categories in the revised \"Shared Capabilities\" paper were broadly applicable to any contingency, rather than being mission-specific. The paper did not describe how much of each capability an individual required. Practically, the shift away from the use of the word \"competencies\" was deliberate\u2014the revised paper began, \"It is important to note that the list does not include specialized competencies.\" The change was significant from a human resources (HR) perspective\u2014in that community, the term has technical ramifications for hiring and career progression. While the HR community reportedly was eager to shed the term, other NSPD officials apparently lamented the loss of the leverage that might be gained from pinning desired outcomes to mandatory HR procedures.

That new emphasis, officials indicated, would be reflected in the revised NSPD National Strategy . The \"Shared Capabilities\" paper also underscored the new emphasis in its new preambular language, which noted that every response to national security threats and opportunities shares \"the need for integrated interagency engagement,\" and that \"recognizing this, the Executive Steering Committee opted to focus on the shared capabilities NSPs need in order to succeed in any interagency environment.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NSPD 2.0: Mandate and Scope", "paragraphs": ["In 2011, the Obama Administration launched a significant reorientation of the NSPD program\u2014referred to by some key practitioners as \"NSPD 2.0\"\u2014including changes to its structure, organization, and focus.", "After Ambassador Yates transitioned to a new role on the NSS as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for African Affairs, her team's mandate to revise the National Strategy and the E.O. was apparently not transferred to her Strategic Planning successor.

At the same time, the Charter itself has served as a vehicle for refining the program's emphasis.

", "In completing these assignments and charting a way forward, the refined NSPD program reportedly has been able to leverage implementation of Presidential Policy Directive-8, on \"National Preparedness,\" issued in March 2011. PPD-8 directed the development of a \"national preparedness goal that identifies the core capabilities necessary for preparedness,\" to include threats and vulnerabilities, and measurable, prioritized objectives; and \"a national preparedness system to guide activities that will enable the Nation to achieve the goal,\" including mechanisms for planning, organizing, equipping, training, conducting exercises, carrying out assessments, and engaging in strategic communications. PPD-8 named DHS the lead agency for coordinating with other agencies, other levels of government, and outside stakeholders in order to craft the goal and design the system. Agencies participating in both the NSPD program and the implementation of PPD-8 were able to use PPD-8 working group participation lists to help identify both positions and personnel for the NSPD program. In turn, PPD-8 implementation, officials note, has provided opportunities for budding NSPs to test and further develop the skills and understanding that the NSPD program was designed to foster.", "The reorientation of the NSPD program has been the focus of some debate, particularly among current and former officials with responsibilities for the program. The field of emergency management, it is generally agreed, had the advantage of existing collaboration mechanisms, and training and educational programs (in particular through FEMA's Emergency Management Institute), that were already quite robust. Most agree that making emergency management the focus of NSPD allows the program to draw on these existing initiatives in order to \"demonstrate success\"\u2014tangible evidence of collaboration\u2014relatively early.

The John Warner NDAA for FY 2007 introduced a four-level qualification system, in which approval for each level requires the completion of some combination of education and joint service. On being approved for Level III, an individual is considered a Joint Qualified Officer (JQO), the only level that has a specific associated term.
