The FHWA considers a \"manufactured product\" to be \"any item that must undergo one or more manufacturing processes before the item can be used in a highway project ... [and] may be usable as a stand-alone product, or as a component within a more complex assembly which would also be considered a manufactured product.\" Section 313's restriction on use of foreign products only applies to manufactured products that consist predominantly of steel or iron, not all manufactured products, as discussed in detail below.", "Regulations promulgated by FHWA further clarify the Buy America requirements, which must be satisfied in order for a Title 23 project to be authorized for advertisement or otherwise proceed. The requirements are satisfied if the project meets at least one of the following four criteria. First, the project qualifies if it has no permanently incorporated steel or iron materials, or if steel or iron is used in the project, it is manufactured in the United States. Manufacturing processes include the \"application of a coating,\" where a coating is any process that protects or enhances the value of the underlying material. Second, the state can include standard contract provisions requiring the use of domestic materials and products. Third, the state can include alternate bid provisions for foreign and domestic steel and iron materials. The alternate bid procedure must be acceptable to the Division Administrator and require all bidders to submit bids based on domestic materials. The contract must also clearly state that the contract will be awarded to the bidder with the lowest total bid on domestic materials unless that bid exceeds the lowest total bid on foreign materials by more than 25%. Fourth, the project may use a minimal amount of foreign steel or iron, such that the cost of the materials does not exceed 0.1% of the total contract cost or $2,500, whichever is greater. ", "These requirements apply to \"projects\" receiving funds under Title 23 and administered by the DOT. \"Project\" is defined as \"any undertaking eligible for assistance under this title.\" Additionally, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21) added a new subsection to section 313, which states,", "The requirements under this section shall apply to all contracts eligible for assistance under this chapter for a project carried out within the scope of the applicable finding, determination, or decision under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [NEPA] ( 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), regardless of the funding source of such contracts, if at least 1 contract for the project is funded with amounts made available to carry out this title.", "Under this new provision, if one contract within the scope of a NEPA document is funded through Title 23, the Buy America requirements will apply to all contracts within that NEPA document that would be eligible for assistance, even if the other contracts are ultimately funded through non-federal sources. This provision applies to contracts awarded on or after October 1, 2012. The FHWA has stated its intent to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for this new provision in 2013.", "Finally, the FHWA is prohibited from imposing funding restrictions that would prevent a state from imposing stricter requirements on the \"use of articles, materials, and supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in foreign countries in projects carried out with\" Title 23 funds. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA General Waivers", "paragraphs": ["The FHWA may issue waivers to the Buy America requirements and based on this authority has issued three general, nationwide waivers to the requirements. First, in 1983 the FHWA determined that it was in the public interest to waive application of Buy America to manufactured products other than steel and iron manufactured products. The FHWA further clarified this general waiver in memoranda issued in 1997 and 2012, concluding that", "in order for a manufactured product to be considered subject to Buy America, the product must be manufactured predominantly of steel or iron. The FHWA deems a product to be manufactured predominantly of steel or iron if the product consists of at least 90% steel or iron content when it is delivered to the job site for installation.", "The \"miscellaneous steel or iron components, subcomponents, and hardware\" needed to assemble and construct either manufactured products consisting predominantly of steel or iron or other manufactured products are not subject to the Buy America provisions. ", "This waiver was motivated by a belief that applying the Buy America requirements to these products would not fulfill Congress's intent to protect the domestic manufacturing industry. The FHWA determined that \"foreign competition in natural materials was not significant due to their high cost in transportation and that petroleum-based products were not available from domestic sources in sufficient and reasonable quantities.\" Furthermore, it can be difficult to trace the origin of various materials that make up manufactured products. In 2013, the FHWA stated that it \"has applied, and intends to continue to apply, Buy America to predominantly steel and iron products delivered to a project site for permanent incorporation in that project.\"", "Second, a nationwide waiver for certain steel items used in the construction of ferryboats was issued in 1994. This waiver covers \"marine diesel engines, electrical switchboards and switchgear, electric motors, pumps, ventilation fans, boilers, electrical controls, and electronic equipment.\" FHWA determined that these items were not manufactured in sufficient and reasonably available quantities in the United States \"to avoid an enormous administrative burden on the State, contractor, and suppliers.\" However, other steel or iron products that are used in the construction of ferryboats are readily available in the United States, and, therefore, are not covered by this waiver and are still subject to Buy America.", "Third, the FHWA granted a nationwide waiver for pig iron and processed, pelletized, and reduced iron ore. Pig iron is a crude iron made from molten iron that got its name from the pig-shaped molds it is often poured into when it comes out of a blast furnace. Processed, pelletized, and reduced iron ore are the result of \"methods by which raw iron ore is improved to produce enriched ore.\" The FHWA concluded that these materials are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of a satisfactory quality. Therefore, \"imposing Buy America requirements on these materials is not in the public interest.\" ", "Each of these general waivers remains in force. However, in July 2013, the FHWA issued a Notice and Request for Comment on the continued need for the general waivers to Buy America and if necessary, what limits should be placed on the waivers. Additionally, at least one bill introduced in the 113 th Congress would require the Secretary to review each standing nationwide waiver, through a notice and public comment process, every five years to determine if the waiver is still necessary.

The waiver may be requested for a specific project, for certain materials or products in a specific geographic area, or both. The requests are first submitted to the Regional Federal Highway Administrator and a denial of a request may be appealed to the FHWA. In evaluating a request, the FHWA may consider such factors as cost, administrative burden, and potential delays that may occur if the provisions are not waived. Additionally, not less than 15 days before issuing a waiver, the FHWA must give public notice and an opportunity to comment on the issuance of such a waiver. The FHWA is prohibited from issuing waivers for foreign products that come from a country that has an agreement with the United States, under which the Buy America requirements have been waived, if the country has violated the agreement in specific ways.

According to FTA regulations, this waiver will be granted if the amount of the lowest responsive and responsible foreign materials bid multiplied by 1.25 is less than the amount of the lowest responsive and responsible domestic materials bid.", "The FTA has additional authority to waive the requirements when funds are used to purchase rolling stock, which is defined as \"transit vehicles such as buses, vans, cars, railcars, locomotives, trolley cars and buses, and ferry boats, as well as vehicles used for support services.\" A waiver for rolling stock may be issued if the FTA finds that (1) the cost of the components and subcomponents produced in the United States is more than 60% of the cost of all components of the rolling stock; and (2) final assembly of the rolling stock occurs in the United States. Similar to the public interest waiver discussed above, the FTA has issued a general waiver to the Buy America requirements when \"foreign sourced spare parts for buses and other rolling stock ... whose total cost is 10 percent or less of the overall project contract cost are being procured as part of the same contract for the major capital item.\"", "In all cases, proposed waivers to the FTA Buy America requirements must be published in the Federal Register and must provide the public with notice and a reasonable comment period.
