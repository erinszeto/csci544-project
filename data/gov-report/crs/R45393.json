First, EPA proposed to replace the Obama Administration's 2015 Clean Power Plan (CPP) with revised emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel steam electric generating units (EGUs), which are largely coal-fired units. Second, EPA proposed revised regulations to implement emission guidelines under Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 111(d). Third, EPA proposed to modify an applicability determination for New Source Review (NSR), a CAA preconstruction permitting program for new and modified stationary sources.", "The first action stems from EPA's finding that the CPP exceeded EPA's statutory authority by using measures that applied to the power sector rather than measures carried out within an individual facility. In the ACE rule, EPA proposed to base the \"best system of emission reduction\" (BSER) for existing coal-fired EGUs on heat rate improvement (HRI) measures. EPA did not propose a BSER for other types of EGUs, such as natural gas combined cycle units. In addition, EPA did not establish a numeric performance standard as the agency did in the CPP. Instead, EPA proposed a list of \"candidate technologies\" of HRI measures that constitute the BSER. States would establish unit-specific performance standards based on this list and other unit-specific considerations.", "Second, EPA proposed to revise the general implementing regulations to clarify EPA's and states' roles under Section 111(d) based on the agency's current legal interpretation that states have broad discretion to establish emissions standards consistent with the BSER. The proposed changes would, among other things, revise definitions and lengthen the time for development and review of state plans.", "Third, EPA proposed to revise the NSR applicability test for EGUs. According to EPA, this would prevent NSR from discouraging the installation of energy efficiency measures. EGUs that adopt HRI measures and operate more efficiently may be used for longer time periods, thereby increasing annual emissions and potentially triggering NSR. Under ACE, NSR would not be triggered if the EGU modification did not increase emissions on an hourly basis, even if the modification increases annual emissions.", "EPA estimated emission changes under multiple scenarios. EPA projected that power sector emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) would increase under the ACE proposal compared to the CPP. EPA also projected that ACE would, in most scenarios, decrease CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions compared to a baseline without the CPP.", "Power sector emissions projections, comparing CPP and non-CPP scenarios, provide context for evaluating the potential impacts of the ACE proposal. The CO2 emission reduction differences between CPP and non-CPP scenarios are greater in the studies from earlier years. For example, a comparison between CPP and non-CPP scenarios from the past three Energy Information Administration analyses shows that the percentage difference has decreased from 16% (in 2016) to 8% (in 2018), reflecting the fact that many of the changes EPA expected to result from the CPP (i.e., natural gas and renewables replacing coal-fired units) have happened already due to market forces and other factors. Comparisons between modeling projections of electricity sector CO2 emissions should be made with caution, however, given potential differences in modeling assumptions about future economic conditions and underlying energy inputs (e.g., natural gas prices).", "EPA estimated that compared to the CPP, ACE would reduce compliance costs and yield lower emission reductions, thereby increasing climate-related damages and human health damages (\"forgone benefits\"). According to EPA, the estimated value of the forgone benefits would outweigh the compliance cost savings when replacing the CPP with ACE, yielding net costs. Specifically, EPA estimated that this replacement would yield net costs ranging from $12.8 billion to $72.0 billion (2016$) over a 15-year period (2023-2037). Excluding forgone human health co-benefits from these comparisons yields estimates that range from a net cost of $5.4 billion to a net benefit of $3.4 billion over a 15-year period (2023-2037)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In August 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the \"Affordable Clean Energy\" (ACE) rule.

ACE would also modify an applicability determination for New Source Review (NSR), which is a CAA preconstruction permitting program intended to ensure that new and modified stationary sources of air pollution do not significantly degrade air quality. ", "EPA proposed ACE in response to Executive Order 13783, in which President Trump directed federal agencies to \"review existing regulations and policies that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources.\" Among the order's specific directives was that EPA review the CPP, which was one of the Obama Administration's key actions directed at reducing GHG emissions. EPA's review also led the agency to convene an \"NSR Reform Task Force\" to assess opportunities to simplify the NSR application and review process. ", "Congress has also considered questions about NSR. A House hearing , held in early 2018, highlighted some long-standing and divergent views on the NSR program. Witnesses speaking in favor of NSR emphasized the program's health and environmental benefits, while other stakeholders described it as an outdated, cumbersome impediment to economic growth. For example, one of the witnesses testified that the complexities and costs of the NSR permitting process discourage pollution control and energy efficiency projects. In addition, two bills\u2014 H.R. 3127 and H.R. 3128 \u2014were introduced in the 115 th Congress that would amend the CAA definition of modification , a key term in determining NSR applicability. ", "Notable interest in the CPP and subsequent proposals to repeal or replace it reflects the perceived importance of their potential effects on the economy and the health, safety, and well-being of the nation. Some stakeholders contend that the U.S. economy would be adversely affected by controls on GHG emissions from power plants. At the same time, national and international scientific assessments of climate change have concluded that there is an increasing likelihood of \"severe, pervasive and irreversible\" GHG-induced impacts. After EPA proposed the CPP in 2014, the agency received more than 4.3 million public comments, the most ever for an EPA rule. EPA responded by making numerous changes to the rule between proposal and promulgation.

CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion account for the largest percentage (76% in 2016) of total U.S. GHG emissions. ", "Historically, the electricity sector accounted for the largest percentage of U.S. CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. However, the transportation sector surpassed electricity in 2016. In 2017, the transportation sector accounted for 37% and the electricity sector accounted for 34% of U.S. CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion.", "In previous decades (1973-2010), CO 2 emissions from electricity generation followed an upward course\u2014similar to electricity generation levels in the same time period, as illustrated in Figure 1 . In 2010, their courses diverged. Although electricity generation has remained relatively flat in recent years (2010-2017), CO 2 emissions have generally continued to decline. In 2017, electricity generation was equivalent to generation levels in 2010, while CO 2 emissions were 23% below 2010 levels.", "Multiple factors impact CO 2 emission levels from the electricity sector. One key factor in CO 2 emission levels is the electricity generation portfolio. Electricity is generated from a variety of sources in the United States. Some sources\u2014nuclear, hydropower, and some renewables\u2014directly produce no CO 2 emissions with their electricity generation. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, generate different amounts of CO 2 emissions per unit of generated electricity. For example, natural-gas-fired electricity from a combined cycle unit yields approximately 43% of the CO 2 emissions of coal-fired electricity per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Therefore, shifting the U.S. electricity generation portfolio to lower emissions sources would likely have (all else being equal) a considerable impact on CO 2 emissions from the electricity sector, which in turn, would likely reduce total U.S. GHG emissions.", "As illustrated in Figure 2 , recent changes in the U.S. electricity generation portfolio between 2005 and 2017 have played a key role in electric power emission levels:", "Coal's contribution to total electricity generation decreased from 50% to 30%. Natural gas's contribution to total electricity generation increased from 19% to 32%. Non-hydro renewable energy (wind and solar) generation increased from 2% to 10%.", "Structural changes in the electricity sector are likely playing a role in the electricity generation portfolio changes described above. Over the last decade (2007-2017), the electricity-generating capacity (measured in megawatts) of coal-fired power plants has decreased by 19%, while natural gas capacity has increased by 45%, and (non-hydro) renewable sources has increased by 445%. If these recent changes in the electricity generation portfolio continue, U.S. CO 2 emissions may continue to decline as well\u2014assuming the emission levels in other economic sectors, particularly the transportation sector, do not offset the reductions.

They also conserve clean air to accommodate future growth as well as for its own benefits.

Section 111 directs EPA to determine what constitutes the BSER.", "Section 111 also addresses existing stationary sources of pollution. Section 111(d) requires EPA to promulgate regulations, which EPA has historically referred to as \"emission guidelines.\" These emission guidelines establish binding requirements that states are required to address when they develop plans to regulate the existing sources in their jurisdictions. In particular, states must establish performance standards for existing sources reflecting the BSER, which is determined by EPA. States, in their plans, provide for their implementation and enforcement of the standards.

One national performance applied to existing electric steam generating units (which are mostly coal), and the other applied to existing stationary combustion turbines\u2014for example, natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) units. EPA based these standards on BSER. The agency determined BSER based on three \"building blocks\": (1) improving the heat rate at coal-fired units, (2) shifting generation to lower-emitting natural gas units, and (3) shifting generation from fossil fuel units to renewable energy generation.

In general, the NSR program requires the installation of modern pollution controls when new facilities are built or when existing facilities make a change that substantially increases emissions. Owners or operators must obtain an NSR permit before the construction or modification begins. Permit applicants must demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed new source or modification will not violate or worsen a violation of a NAAQS or that, in areas complying with the NAAQS, it will not exceed the increments of increased air pollution allowed under Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations. ", "The CAA defines modern pollution controls as the \"best available control technology\" (BACT), which would achieve the maximum degree of emissions reductions, taking into consideration energy, environmental, and economic impacts. The way that the CAA applied NSR to existing facilities is described as \"grandfathering,\" meaning that facilities that were in existence before August 7, 1977, were not required to install BACT immediately following enactment of the 1977 CAA amendments. Rather, the NSR provisions did not require existing facilities to install BACT until such facilities made major modifications. This approach was premised in part on an expectation that the \"grandfathered\" facilities would \"either be upgraded or replaced over time and that, whenever changes were made later, existing facilities would install new, cleaner technologies to prevent or control air pollution.\" ", "Historically, NSR applicability determinations have been contentious and extensively litigated. The CAA broadly defines modification as \"any\" physical or operational change in a stationary source \"that increases the emissions of any air pollutant or results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted.\" EPA and state air pollution control agencies have interpreted this definition to implement NSR through regulations and policy guidance. EPA's interpretation of modification under the NSR program has been subject to various legal challenges. Since 1974, EPA has construed the term to not include \"routine maintenance, repair, and replacement\" at a stationary source \u2014despite the CAA's inclusion of \"any\" physical or operational change that increases emissions in its definition of modification .

For example, EGUs that adopt HRI measures may operate more efficiently, which in turn may lower their operating costs. The reduced operating costs may lead these units to be dispatched for more hours in a year, thereby increasing emissions on an annual basis. Under existing law, the higher annual emissions may trigger the NSR process. Under ACE, however, the annual emissions would not be considered in states that adopt the revised NSR test. That is, facilities in those states would not be required to consider the potential increase in annual emissions, provided the hourly rate of emissions does not increase.

Other stakeholders, however, have suggested that the proposed NSR revision has broader implications for the energy and air quality programs. For example, one state agency described ACE as \"a significant overhaul\" of NSR that would increase the number of \"projects that are excluded from requirements to install reasonable controls,\" thereby allowing \"poorly controlled and grandfathered sources to continue to operate without cost-effective controls.\" ", "Moreover, it is uncertain how the proposed NSR revision would affect each state's air quality objectives.

The estimated percentage emission reductions between the ACE proposed HRI scenarios and the CPP and non-CPP scenarios range between 0% and 1%.

For example, a comparison between CPP and non-CPP scenarios from the past three EIA analyses shows the percentage difference has decreased from 16% (in 2016) to 8% (in 2018). This reflects the fact that many of the changes EPA expected to result from the CPP (e.g., natural gas and renewables replacing coal-fired units) have already happened as the result of market forces in the electric power sector.
