The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-6), signed into law on March 26, 2013, provided year-long appropriations to all agencies for FY2013. The law included divisions incorporating five of the regular appropriations bills\u2014Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies; Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies; Department of Defense; Department of Homeland Security; and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\u2014and included continuing appropriations for agencies covered under the other regular appropriations bills. Agency appropriations were subject to one or more rescissions as well as sequestration. For several agencies, research and development (R&D) funding is included in accounts with non-R&D activities. For such agencies, unless Congress provides funding at the full request level as requested, it is not possible to know the agency's R&D funding level. In such cases, the funding level may not be known until it is included in the President's FY2015 budget request and/or agency budget justifications. When final appropriations are not resolved until after the President's next fiscal year budget request is prepared (as was the case for FY2013 appropriations and the President's FY2014 request) funding for agency R&D may not be known until the subsequent year's budget request. However, some agencies may opt to provide funding estimates, publicly or privately (for example, in response to a CRS inquiry). Determination of funding levels can be complicated by a number of factors, including rescissions, sequestration, supplemental funding, transfers, and reprogramming. Agency analyses in this report use the most current information available at the time this report was published.", "Funding for R&D is highly concentrated in a few departments. Under President Obama's FY2013 budget request, seven federal agencies would have received 95.8% of total federal R&D funding, the largest among them being the Department of Defense (50.6%) and the Department of Health and Human Services (22.3%, primarily for the National Institutes of Health). Among the largest changes proposed in the President's request, the R&D budget of the Department of Defense would have fallen by $1.535 billion (2.1%), while R&D funding for the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) would have increased by $1.329 billion. The proposed NIST growth was fueled by increases in funding for its core research laboratories and by the establishment of two new initiatives: $1 billion for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, which seeks to promote the development of manufacturing technologies with broad applications, and $300 million for a Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund to help develop cutting-edge technologies for public safety users.", "President Obama also requested increases in the R&D budgets of NIST, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science that were targeted for doubling over 7 years, from their FY2006 levels, by the America COMPETES Act, and over 11 years by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The funding requested for FY2013 was consistent with a doubling timeframe of 17 years, much longer than authorized by either act.", "The President's budget request sought support for three multi-agency R&D initiatives in FY2013: $1.766 billion for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, an increase of $70 million (4.1%) over FY2012; $3.807 billion for the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program, an increase of $69 million (1.8%); and $2.633 billion for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, an increase of $136 million (5.6%)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The 112 th Congress continued to take a strong interest in the health of the U.S. research and development (R&D) enterprise and in providing support for federal R&D activities. However, widespread concerns about the federal debt and recent and projected federal budget deficits drove difficult decisions involving prioritization of R&D within the context of the entire federal budget and among competing priorities within the federal R&D portfolio. The U.S. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering research and development. Its purposes include addressing specific concerns (e.g., national defense, health, safety, the environment, energy security), advancing knowledge generally, developing the scientific and engineering workforce, and strengthening U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. Most of the R&D funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of the funding agencies. The federal government has played an important role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies, from jet aircraft and the Internet to communications satellites and defenses against disease.", "Congress plays a central role in defining the nation's R&D priorities as it makes decisions with respect to the size and distribution of aggregate, agency, and programmatic R&D funding. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal funding in light of the current federal fiscal condition, deficit, and debt. As Congress acted to complete the FY2013 appropriations process it faced two overarching issues: the extent to which the federal R&D investment could grow in the context of increased pressure on discretionary spending and how available funding would be prioritized and allocated. Low or negative growth in the overall R&D investment may require movement of resources across disciplines, programs, or agencies to address priorities. ", "This report provides government-wide, multi-agency, and individual agency analyses of the President's FY2013 request as it relates to R&D and related activities and congressional actions on appropriations legislation, and specific information on appropriations enacted by Congress in the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, ( P.L. 113-6 ) for agencies that have made such information available.

Adjusted for inflation, the President's FY2013 R&D request represented a decrease of 0.2% from the FY2012 level. ", "Among its provisions, the President's FY2013 budget maintained an emphasis on increasing funding for the physical sciences and engineering, an effort consistent with the intent of the America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ) and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ). These acts sought to achieve this objective by authorizing increased funding for accounts at three agencies with a strong R&D emphasis in these disciplines: the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Commerce (DOC) National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) core laboratory research and R&D facilities construction funding (collectively referred to as the \"targeted accounts\"). However, appropriations provided to these agencies for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 fell short of the levels authorized in P.L. 110-69 . P.L. 111-358 set authorization levels for the targeted accounts for FY2011-FY2013 at a slower growth rate than P.L. 110-69 . FY2011 and FY2012 funding for the targeted accounts fell short of their P.L. 111-358 authorized levels. For FY2013 appropriations not only fell short of the authorized levels for the targeted accounts, but actually decreased 3.1% from the FY2012 appropriations level. (See \" Doubling Effort \" later in this report for a more detailed discussion.)", "More broadly, in a 2009 speech before members of the National Academy of Sciences, President Obama put forth a goal of increasing the national investment in R&D to more than 3% of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). President Obama did not provide details on how this goal might be achieved (e.g., how much would be funded through increases in direct federal R&D funding or through indirect mechanisms such as the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit); however, doing so likely would have required a substantial increase in public and/or private investment. In 2009, total U.S. R&D expenditures were $400.5 billion, or approximately 2.87% of GDP. Based on 2009 figures, reaching President Obama's 3% goal would have required an increase of 4.4% in national R&D spending.", "In addition, advocates for increased federal R&D funding\u2014including President Obama's science advisor, John Holdren\u2014have raised concerns about the potential harm of a \"boom-bust\" approach to federal R&D funding (i.e., rapid growth in federal R&D funding followed by much slower growth, flat funding, or even decline). The biomedical research community experienced a variety of challenges resulting from such a circumstance following the five-year doubling of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget that was completed in FY2003. With the NIH doubling came a rapid expansion of the nation's biomedical research infrastructure (e.g., buildings, laboratories, equipment), as well as rapid growth in university faculty hiring, students pursuing biomedical degrees, and grant applications to NIH. After the doubling, however, the agency's budget fell each year in real terms from FY2004 to FY2009. Critics assert there have been a variety of damages from this boom-bust cycle, including interruptions and cancellations of promising research, declining share in the number of NIH grant proposals funded, decreased student interest in pursuing graduate studies, and reduced employment prospects for the large number of biomedical researchers with advanced degrees. According to then-NIH Director Elias Zerhouni, the damages have been particularly acute for early- and mid-career scientists seeking a first or second grant. The current effort to double funding for the targeted accounts has followed a similar pattern, but on a smaller scale. Funding for the targeted accounts grew by about 28% from FY2006 to FY2010 (or approximately 6.4% per year), but fell 3.6% between FY2010 and FY2013.", "Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by several factors, such as the inclusion of R&D in accounts with non-R&D activities. As a result of this and other factors, the R&D agency figures reported by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) (shown in Table 1 ), may differ somewhat from the agency budget analyses that appear later in this report.", "Another factor complicating analysis of the President's FY2013 budget request was the inclusion of the Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund, a part of the Administration's Wireless Innovation and Infrastructure Initiative. First proposed in the President's FY2012 budget request, the WIN Fund would have received $300 million in FY2013 from receipts generated through electromagnetic spectrum auctions. The fund was intended to support development of leading-edge wireless technologies and public safety applications. Under the President's budget, NIST was to have received up to $300 million in FY2013 if the WIN fund had been established. NIST intended to use these funds to work with industry and public safety organizations on research and development of new standards, technologies, and applications that advance public safety communications, including establishing a competitive grant fund. The grant fund would have awarded between $70 million and $75 million per year from FY2014 through FY2016 for related research, development, and demonstration projects.

These priorities and the mission of each agency contribute, in part, to the composition of an agency's R&D spending (i.e., the allocation between basic research, applied research, development, and facilities and equipment). The federal government is the nation's largest supporter of basic research, funding 53.2% of U.S. basic research in 2009, primarily because the private sector asserts it cannot capture an adequate return on long-term fundamental research investments. In contrast, industry funded only 21.7% of U.S. basic research in 2009 (with state governments, universities, and other non-profit organizations funding the remaining 25.1%).

(See Table 6 .) However, RDT&E funds are also appropriated in other parts of the bill. For example, RDT&E funds are appropriated as part of the Defense Health Program, the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program, and the National Defense Sealift Fund. The Defense Health Program supports the delivery of health care to DOD personnel and their families. Program funds are requested through the Operations and Maintenance appropriation. The program's RDT&E funds support congressionally directed research in such areas as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer and other medical conditions. Congress appropriates funds for this program in Title VI (Other Department of Defense Programs) of the defense appropriations bill. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program supports activities to destroy the U.S. inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to avoid future risks and costs associated with storage. Funds for this program have been requested through the Procurement appropriation. Congress appropriates funds for this program also in Title VI. The National Defense Sealift Fund supports the procurement, operation and maintenance, and research and development of the nation's naval reserve fleet and supports a U.S. flagged merchant fleet that can serve in time of need.

The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office, which administers the fund, tracks (but does not report) the amount of funding allocated to RDT&E. The JIEDDF funding is not included in the table below.", "RDT&E funds also have been requested and appropriated as part of DOD's separate funding to support efforts in what the Bush Administration had termed the Global War on Terror (GWOT), and what the Obama Administration refers to as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Typically, the RDT&E funds appropriated for GWOT/OCO activities go to specified Program Elements (PEs) in Title IV. However, they are requested and accounted for separately. The Bush Administration requested these funds in separate GWOT emergency supplemental requests. The Obama Administration, while continuing to identify these funds uniquely as OCO requests, has included these funds as part of the regular budget, not in emergency supplementals. However, the Obama Administration will ask for additional OCO funds in supplemental requests, if the initial OCO funding is not enough to get through the fiscal year.", "In addition, GWOT/OCO-related requests/appropriations often include money for a number of transfer funds. These have included in the past the Iraqi Freedom Fund (IFF), the Iraqi Security Forces Fund (which was not requested in FY2012), the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund (MRAPVF), and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (transferred to the State Department in FY2012). Congress typically makes a single appropriation into each of these funds, and authorizes the Secretary to make transfers to other accounts, including RDT&E, at his discretion. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, Congress established a new Military Intelligence Program Transfer Fund, granting the Secretary similar authority.", "For FY2013, the Obama Administration requested $69.408 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E and another $246 million in OCO RDT&E. The FY2013 request was $2.902 billion and $280 million, respectively, below what Congress appropriated for FY2012. In addition, the Administration requested $673 million in RDT&E through the Defense Health Program, $647 million in RDT&E through the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, and $43 million in RDT&E through the National Defense Sealift Fund. Congress authorized $69.938 billion for the baseline RDT&E account (Title II in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, P.L. 112-239 ) and $246 million in additional OCO RDT&E. In regards to appropriations, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriation Act, 2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ) provided $69.859 billion for baseline RDT&E (not adjusted for sequestration). This was more than requested, but nearly $6 billion less than appropriated in FY2012. P.L. 113-6 appropriated $248 million in OCO RDT&E. The act also appropriated $6 million less than what was requested for the National Defense Sealift Fund and appropriated nearly double the requested level for RDT&E in the Defense Health Plan. ", "RDT&E funding can be analyzed in different ways. Each of the military departments request and receive their own RDT&E funding. So, too, do various DOD agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), collectively aggregated within the Defensewide account. RDT&E funding also can be characterized by budget activity (i.e., the type of RDT&E supported). Those budget activities designated as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 (basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development, respectively) constitute what is called DOD's Science and Technology Program (S&T) and represent the more research-oriented part of the RDT&E program. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components (e.g., the Joint Strike Fighter or missile defense systems), for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support, including support for test and evaluation facilities. Budget activity 6.7 supports system improvements in existing operational systems. ", "Many congressional policymakers are particularly interested in S&T funding since these funds support the development of new technologies and the underlying science. Some in the defense community see ensuring adequate support for S&T activities as imperative to maintaining U.S. military superiority. The knowledge generated at this stage of development can also contribute to advances in commercial technologies.", "According to its FY2013 Budget Request Overview, DOD was seeking to \"maintain a strong S&T posture\" going forward. The FY2013 Title IV baseline S&T funding request was $11.861 billion, $343 million less than what Congress appropriated for S&T in FY2012. Congress authorized $11.839 billion for S&T, but appropriated $12.471 billion.", "Within the S&T program, basic research (6.1) receives special attention, particularly from the nation's universities. DOD is not a large funder of basic research compared to the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation. However, over half of DOD's basic research budget is spent at universities and represents the major contribution of funds in some areas of science and technology (such as electrical engineering and material science). The Administration requested $2.117 billion for basic research for FY2013, $5 million more than what Congress appropriated for Title IV basic research in FY2012.

The Administration requested $831 million for the S&T Directorate for FY2013. This was 24% more than the FY2012 appropriation of $673 million. Funding for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) would have increased by $212 million. Of the six thrust areas within RDI, the largest requested increase (from $61 million in FY2012 to $144 million in FY2013) was for disaster resilience R&D. A reduction of $50 million in the request for Laboratory Facilities reflected the omission of funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), a planned replacement for the existing Plum Island Animal Disease Center. The $50 million appropriated in FY2012 for the start of NBAF construction was one-third of what the Administration had requested. DHS announced plans for an assessment of whether and for what purpose a facility like NBAF should be built. The assessment was to consider current threats and review cost, safety, and alternatives to the NBAF plan.", "The House bill would have provided $826 million for the S&T Directorate, or $6 million less than the request. The total included $72 million less than the request for RDI. The House committee directed DHS to determine how to allocate that reduction across the six thrust areas. In Laboratory Facilities, the bill would have provided $75 million more than the request. The committee directed that this increase should be spent on NBAF construction.", "The Senate committee recommended S&T funding levels that were the same as the Administration's request. Within RDI, however, it specified separate amounts for each of the six thrust areas, rather than a single total. In recommending no funding for NBAF construction, the committee noted a total cost estimate for the facility of $1.138 billion.", "The April 2013 operating plan included $801 million for the S&T Directorate.

The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO for FY2013, an increase of 14% above the FY2012 appropriation of $290 million. The request included an increase of $44 million for Transformational R&D, a program that the Administration had previously proposed to transfer to S&T. The proposed increase for Transformational R&D was partially offset by a proposed reduction of $23 million for Systems Development. In the Systems Acquisition account, funding for human-portable radiation detectors would have increased by $20 million, while funding for radiation portal monitors would have decreased to $1 million from $7 million in FY2012.", "The House bill would have provided $316 million for DNDO, or $12 million less than the request. Most of the reduction would have been in the Transformational R&D program.

The committee recommended funding NIH at $100 million higher than the President's request. The House Appropriations Committee did not report a comparable FY2013 bill, but the House Labor/HHS Subcommittee approved a draft FY2013 bill on July 18, 2012. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ) provided appropriations for Labor/HHS agencies through the end of FY2013. The law provided an increase of almost $70 million for the NIH Office of the Director, but also required an across-the-board rescission of 0.2% for all accounts (pursuant to Section 3004, as interpreted by OMB). The March 1, 2013, sequestration order and a transfer of funding under the authority of the HHS Secretary further reduced FY2013 amounts for NIH by $1.553 billion and $173 million respectively; these reductions are reflected in amounts shown for the FY2013 Operating Plan in Table 8 .", "NIH Organization and Sources of Funding. NIH supports and conducts a wide range of basic and clinical research, research training, and health information dissemination across all fields of biomedical and behavioral sciences. About 83% of NIH's budget goes out to the extramural research community in the form of grants, contracts, and other awards. The funding supports research performed by more than 300,000 non-federal scientists and technical personnel who work at more than 2,500 universities, hospitals, medical schools, and other research institutions around the country and abroad. The agency's organization consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers. The Office of the Director (OD) sets overall policy for NIH and coordinates the programs and activities of all NIH components, particularly in areas of research that involve multiple institutes. The institutes and centers (collectively called ICs) focus on particular diseases, areas of human health and development, or aspects of research support. Each IC plans and manages its own research programs in coordination with the Office of the Director. As shown in Table 8 , Congress provides a separate appropriation to 24 of the 27 ICs, to OD, and to an intramural Buildings and Facilities account. (The other three centers, which perform centralized support services, are funded through assessments on the IC appropriations.)", "Funding for NIH comes primarily from the annual Labor/HHS appropriations bill, with an additional amount for Superfund-related activities from the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies (Interior/Environment). Those two bills provide NIH's discretionary budget authority. In addition, NIH receives mandatory funding of $150 million annually that is authorized and directly appropriated in the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for a special program on type 1 diabetes research; it also receives $8.2 million annually in discretionary funding for the National Library of Medicine from a transfer within PHS. The total funding available for NIH activities, taking account of add-ons and transfers, is the program level.", "NIH and other HHS agencies and programs that are authorized under the PHS Act are subject to a budget assessment called the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside or the evaluation tap. Section 241 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7238j) authorizes the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to study the effectiveness of federal health programs and to identify ways to improve them. Congress sets the percentage level of the tap in the annual Labor/HHS appropriations acts, and also directs specific amounts of funding from the tap for transfer to a number of HHS programs. The set-aside has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds for specific purposes among PHS and other HHS agencies. NIH, with the largest budget among the PHS agencies, becomes the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds, and is a relatively minor recipient. The set-aside level for FY2012 was 2.5% of eligible appropriations, making just over $1.0 billion available for transfer among programs. The FY2013 President's Budget proposed increasing the set-aside to 3.2%, which would have increased the NIH contribution by about $200 million. In S. 3295 , the Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the proposed increase and called for the tap to continue at 2.5%. Ultimately, the 2.5% tap was maintained under the provisions of P.L. 113-6 , and NIH was assessed over $700 million as in FY2012. By convention, budget tables such as Table 8 do not subtract the amount of the evaluation tap, or of other taps within HHS, from the agencies' appropriations. ", "FY2013 President's Budget Request. Most of the ICs were flat-funded in the request with a few increases and decreases as noted below. NIH described its FY2013 areas of emphasis under four broad themes that built on current activities and continued implementation of an organizational restructuring for translational medicine that started in FY2012.", "Investing in Basic Research. Congress has given NIH direction to continue its emphasis on support of basic biomedical and behavioral research, which seeks to understand the causes of disease onset and progression. About 54% of the FY2013 request was targeted for basic research in areas such as genetics, regenerative medicine (including stem cells), and environmental and behavioral influences on health.", "Accelerating Discovery Through Technology. The request indicated that NIH would continue to support development and application of advanced technologies (DNA sequencing, microarray technology, nanotechnology, new imaging modalities, and computational biology) to increase understanding of complex diseases and enable development of more effective therapies. A high-priority project, the Cancer Genome Atlas, generates maps of genetic changes found in different types of cancer.", "Advancing Translational Sciences. Translational medicine focuses on converting basic research discoveries into clinical applications that benefit patients. In 2010, NIH began planning for the creation of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The new entity pulls together a variety of preclinical and clinical translational sciences resources that were scattered across the ICs. NCATS was established and funded in the FY2012 appropriations law ( P.L. 112-74 ), which also abolished the National Center for Research Resources and transferred its programs to NCATS and several other ICs. The NCATS mission includes exploring more reliable, rapid, and cost-effective ways to test possible new drugs, diagnostics, and preventive measures for human use (or new uses for old products). In addition, NCATS fosters partnerships between extramural researchers, industry, health care, and government entities to speed commercialization of new therapies. The FY2013 request for NCATS was $639 million, $64 million (11%) over its FY2012 first-year budget. The request indicated that nearly $40 million of the increase would go to expanding the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) from $10 million to almost $50 million. The $463 million requested for the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program included a $1 million increase. CTSA funds a national consortium of medical research institutions engaged in improving clinical research.", "Encouraging New Investigators and New Ideas. NIH has several programs to support exceptional young scientists and speed their transition to independent research. The NIH Director's New Innovator Award program provides first-time independent awards to outstanding investigators; the Administration requested $80 million to support these awards in FY2013, the same as in FY2012. The NIH Director's Early Independence Program supports talented junior scientists, allowing them to by-pass the traditional postdoctoral training period and move directly to an independent research career; the President requested $12 million for this program, up from $8 million in FY2012. For NIH's major research training program, the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards, the budget proposed funding of $775 million, $2 million below FY2012. The request noted this level would support a 2% stipend increase and 16,361 training positions, a decrease of 309 positions. During FY2013, NIH systematically analyzed biomedical workforce and training needs, with a special focus on promoting diversity in the workforce and understanding barriers to career advancement.", "Selected Other Program Changes in IC Budgets. Institutional Development Awards (IDeA): The FY2012 appropriation provided the IDeA program with a $50 million increase (22%) to $276 million, and NIH was encouraged to broaden the eligibility criteria for these research capacity and infrastructure grants. For FY2013, the Administration did not request continuation of the extra funding\u2014the budget request for the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) included $225 million for the IDeA program, $51 million less than in FY2012.", "National Children's Study: The budget request for the Office of the Director was $28 million below FY2012 because requested funding for the National Children's Study was reduced by nearly 15% from $193 million to $165 million. The pilot Vanguard Study is moving to a less resource-intensive phase, and NIH is evaluating more cost-effective sampling approaches for the study.", "Alzheimer's disease research: In February 2012, the Administration announced that NIH would devote additional resources to Alzheimer's disease research in FY2012 and FY2013. Within FY2012 appropriations, NIH planned to redirect $50 million from other research areas to Alzheimer's-related grants. In FY2013, HHS planned to make available $80 million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund (mandatory funding authorized and directly appropriated by the Affordable Care Act) for a portfolio of new research on Alzheimer's.", "Research Project Grants. The main funding mechanism for supporting extramural investigator-initiated research is competitive, peer-reviewed research project grants (RPGs). The President's Budget requested $16.5 billion for RPGs in FY2013, about 52% of NIH's proposed budget. This amount would have supported an estimated 35,888 RPG awards. Within that total, 9,415 would be competing RPGs (\"competing\" awards means new grants plus competing renewals of existing grants). The average cost of a competing RPG in FY2013 was estimated to be $431,000. After adjusting for certain large high-cost grants that happened to come into competing status in FY2013 (HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks grants), there was an expected overall reduction of 1% in the average cost of competing RPGs.", "NIH proposed several grant-funding policies in order to maximize resources for investigator-initiated grants and for young, first-time researchers. According to the request, non-competing (continuation) RPGs would have had their budgets reduced by 1% from the FY2012 level, and the budgets of competing RPGs would have been negotiated downward by about 1% to avoid growth in the average award size. NIH planned to continue current policies that equalize the success rates of new and established investigators in receiving funding. Additional review and scrutiny was planned for awards to any scientist who already has total grant support of $1.5 million or more. ", "Other Funding Mechanisms. The FY2013 request also proposed changes for other funding mechanisms within the NIH budget besides those for RPGs and training awards. Support for r esearch centers would decrease by $64 million (-2.1%) to $2.966 billion, largely because of the proposed $51 million drop in funding for the IDeA program mentioned previously. A $108 million (3.6%) increase to $3.076 billion was proposed for the R&D contracts mechanism, reflecting (among other things) funding to cover the proposed increase in the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. The NIH intramural research program would gain $21 million (0.6%) for a total of $3.420 billion. Research management and support requested an increase of $1.7 million (0.1%) to a total of $1.535 billion. The Office of the Director would decrease by $28 million to $1.429 billion because of the plans for the National Children's Study discussed earlier. Also funded through the OD account is the NIH Common Fund, which supports research in emerging areas of scientific opportunity, public health challenges, or knowledge gaps that might benefit from collaboration between two or more institutes or centers. The request for the Common Fund was $545 million, the same as the FY2012 level. Buildings and Facilities was $125 million, the same as FY2012.", "FY2013 Senate Committee Recommendation. The committee recommended a total of $30.723 billion in Labor/HHS funding for NIH, a $100 million increase (0.3%) above both the request and the FY2012 level. The increase over FY2012 was spread across most of the ICs, with some exceptions reflecting program priorities. The committee recommended a 10% increase for NCATS and would have allowed up to $40 million to be used for the Cures Acceleration Network rather than the requested $50 million. No extra funding for the IDeA program would have been provided in the bill in the NIGMS appropriation, although the committee report included language referring to an \"increase that should be paid for by a reduction in funding across NIH ICs.\" Funding for the National Institute on Aging would also have been increased above the request to continue the HHS initiative on Alzheimer's research.

Final FY2013 funding levels for NIH ICs and for extramural and intramural programs became clear when HHS released its agency operating plans. For NIH, the FY2013 program level of $29.151 billion represented a decrease of $1.709 billion (-5.5%) from the FY2012 level. RPGs will receive $14.906 billion, a reduction of $976 million from the FY2012 level of $15.882 billion.

Costs for increased utilization of existing BES facilities and the start of construction of the Linac Coherent Light Source-II, a high-energy x-ray source, were mostly offset in the Administration proposal by a scheduled ramp-down in construction for the National Synchrotron Light Source-II. The House bill would have provided $142 million less than the request for BES. The Senate committee recommended $88 million less than the request. Both committees rejected the proposal for BES energy frontier research centers to work jointly with EERE. In the fusion energy sciences program, the request would have increased the U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) by $45 million, but this would have been more than offset by reduced funding for domestic fusion activities, including the end of operations for the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, a fusion reactor. The estimated total cost for the U.S. share of ITER, a multi-year construction project, remains in the range of $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion, but \"it is possible that costs will increase.\" The House bill would have provided $76 million more than the request for fusion, including domestic funding at the FY2012 level and $28 million more than requested for ITER.

We'll continue our efforts to combat destructive pests and disease that threaten crops and livestock.", "The Agricultural Research Service is USDA's in-house basic and applied research agency, and operates approximately 100 laboratories nationwide. The ARS also includes the National Agricultural Library, a primary information resource on food, agriculture, and natural resource sciences. The ARS laboratories focus on efficient food and fiber production, development of new products and uses for agricultural commodities, development of effective biocontrols for pest management, and support of USDA regulatory and technical assistance programs. The President requested $1.1 billion for ARS in FY2013, 0.7% above the FY2012 enacted level. The FY2013 request included $50.4 million in program reallocations to address the nation's most critical research needs, including a reallocation of $4.0 million for research to develop integrated, sustainable production systems that will improve food production efficiency and protect the environment.", "The President also proposed elimination of lower priority extramural projects. Priorities in the FY2013 request included the conversion of agricultural products into biobased products and biofuels; development of new measures to control bovine tuberculosis and bovine respiratory diseases; domestic and global market opportunities; new varieties and hybrids of feedstocks; and new healthier foods with decreased caloric density, and research on detection methods and countermeasures to foreign animal diseases that could result in catastrophic losses. The FY2013 request proposed an increase of approximately $25 million for research directed at improving American agriculture's adaptability to environmental challenges. This proposal stemmed from recommendations contained in a 2011 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology stating the need for improved accounting of ecosytem services and increased protection of the environment.", "The National Institute of Food and Agriculture was established in Title VII, Section 7511 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-246 , also known as the 2008 farm bill). NIFA is responsible for developing partnerships between the federal and state components of agricultural research, extension, and institutions of higher education. NIFA distributes funds to State Agricultural Experiment Stations, State Cooperative Extension Systems, land-grant universities, and other institutions and organizations that conduct agricultural research, education, and outreach. Included in these partnerships is funding for research at 1862 land-grant institutions, 1890 historically black colleges and universities, 1994 tribal land-grant colleges, and Hispanic-serving institutions. Funding is distributed to the states through competitive awards, statutory formula funding, and special grants. ", "For FY2013, the President requested $1.2 billion for NIFA, 3.0% above the FY2012 enacted level. The Administration's FY2013 request for NIFA emphasized competitive, peer-reviewed allocation of research funding to generate solutions for the most critical needs of agriculture. Funding for FY2013 included support for grant management, as well as for programs that are responsive to critical national issues such as agricultural security, local and regional emergencies, zoonotic diseases, climate change, childhood obesity, and pest risk management. ", "NIFA is responsible for administering the agency's primary competitive research grants program, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI). In addition to supporting fundamental and applied science in agriculture, USDA maintains that the AFRI makes a significant contribution to developing the next generation of agricultural scientists by providing graduate students with opportunities to work on research projects. A focus of these efforts is to provide increased opportunities for minority and under-served communities in agricultural science. The FY2013 request sought $325.0 million for the AFRI, a proposed increase of $61.0 million over the FY2012 enacted level. Major initiatives for FY2013 included proposed funding of $30.0 million for alternative and renewable energy research to develop high-quality, cost-effective feedstocks for biofuel production; $3.7 million for research to address the adaptation of production systems to climate varieties; $7.2 million for international food security to improve research and extension efforts on sustainable plant and animal production systems; and $3.2 million for AFRI's Foundational Research Program. Additional research was also requested for global climate change research to develop mitigation capabilities for agricultural production, and support for an integrated food safety research program with the potential for improving the understanding of disease-causing microorganisms. The request also supported research in agricultural genomics, emerging issues in food and agricultural security, the ecology and economics of biological invasions, and plant biotechnology. ", "The FY2013 budget request proposed $77.4 million for Economic Research Service, slightly below the FY2012 enacted level of $77.7 million. The request included the termination of low-priority programs. The ERS supports economic and social science information analysis on agriculture, rural development, food, commodity markets, and the environment. ERS collects and disseminates data concerning USDA programs and policies to various stakeholders.", "Funding for the National Agricultural Statistics Service was proposed at $179.5 million in the FY2013 request, $20.9 million above the FY2012 enacted level. The FY2013 request included support for improving research efforts in analyzing the impacts of bioenergy production, and for examining concerns pertaining to feedstock storage, transportation networks, and commodity production. Other research areas receiving support included production and use of biomass materials; stocks and prices of distillers' grains; current and proposed ethanol production plants; the chemical use data series on major row crops; post-harvest chemical use; and alternating annual fruit, nuts, and vegetable chemical use.

For example, the House Appropriations Committee included a directive that for FY2013 EPA would need to make specific refinements and modifications to the agency's policies and practices for conducting human health risk assessments under the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). EPA uses this system to establish toxicity concentrations and risk thresholds for various chemical substances, which often inform the agency's regulatory decisions under multiple pollution control statutes.", "Also within the S&T account, the committee would not have provided a $4.25 million increase for hydraulic fracturing research that the President had requested, and would have disallowed EPA from using any of the funds that would be provided in H.R. 6091 to research environmental justice impacts related to hydraulic fracturing. Although the conferees on the FY2010 appropriations bill had urged EPA to study the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water, the House Appropriations Committee noted in its report on H.R. 6091 that EPA had expanded its research beyond the scope of the congressionally directed study.
