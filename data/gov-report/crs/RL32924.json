On Sunday, December 18, House and Senate conferees filed agreements both on the FY2006 defense appropriations bill ( H.R. 2863 ) and on the FY2006 defense authorization bill ( H.R. 1815 ). On December 19, the House approved the appropriations conference agreement by a vote of 308-106 and the authorization conference agreement by a vote of 371-41.

The provision allocated projected revenues to Alaska, Katrina relief, and the LIHEAP energy program. Opponents of ANWR drilling resisted the measure in the Senate, and, in a key test vote, on December 21, the Senate refused to invoke cloture on the appropriations conference report by a vote of 56-44 (with 60 votes required). The Senate then passed the appropriations conference report, minus the ANWR provison, and approved, by a vote of 48-45, an enrolling resolution to instruct the Clerk of the House to remove the ANWR provision from the defense bill. The House approved the resolution on December 22, thus clearing the appropriations bill, without ANWR drilling, for the President. Other measures added to the defense appropriations bill: Along with ANWR drilling, the defense appropriations bill became a vehicle for several pending congressional measures, including a $29 billion reallocation of funds for Katrina relief and reconstruction, a $3.8 billion measure for avian flu preparedness, and a 1% across-the-board cut in FY2006 appropriations totaling $8.5 billion. All of these measures are included in the enacted bill. Cuts in defense spending in the defense appropriations bill: The House-passed defense appropriations bill trimmed $3 billion from the Administration request, and the defense appropriations bill as passed by the Senate trimmed $7 billion, leaving those amounts available for non-defense appropriations. The cuts did not include significant reductions in major weapons programs, but instead came mainly from eliminating funds that the committees found unnecessary to carry out requested programs in personnel and operating accounts. The largest reductions in the military personnel accounts were for programs that were underexecuted in FY2005. Congress has made similar cuts for the past couple of years. In part, it appears, that expenses have been financed through supplemental funds. The largest reductions in the operation and maintenance accounts were for depot maintenance workloads that are not needed because equipment is being used for the war and repair costs are being covered with supplemental appropriations. So, though indirectly, large emergency supplemental funding has offset regular defense appropriations, freeing up non-emergency funds for non-defense programs. The White House Statement of Administration Policy on the Senate appropriations bill, issued on September 30, objected to the Senate reduction and warned of a veto if the final appropriations bill \"significantly underfunds\" defense \"to avoid a reduction in non-security spending.\" House and Senate appropriators finally agreed to trim $4.4 billion from the request, and they added $0.1 billion to the military construction bill. In a measure attached to the defense appropriations bill, Congress also approved an across-the-board cut in all appropriations, which trims an additional $4.1 billion from Department of Defense funds. So, in all, Congress provided $8.4 billion less for DOD than the Administration had requested (see Table 4 ). Prisoner abuse: Treatment of detainees became a major issue in Senate consideration of the defense authorization bill and subsequently of the defense appropriations bill. On the authorization bill, in July Senator Levin proposed an amendment to establish an independent commission on treatment of detainees. Senator McCain proposed one amendment to prohibit cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of persons in U.S. custody and another to establish for the Defense Department uniform interrogation standards as authorized by the Army field manual on intelligence interrogations. Senator Warner proposed an alternative amendment to require the Secretary of Defense to establish uniform standards for detention and interrogation. And Senators McCain and Graham proposed an amendment to provide statutory authority for the Defense Department to use military tribunals to determine the status of detainees. The formal White House Statement of Administration Policy on the authorization bill warned of a veto if the bill includes any measure that would establish a commission on detainees or regulate \"the detention, treatment or trial of terrorists.\" With action on the authorization bill delayed, Senator McCain offered an amendment to the defense appropriations bill that combined two of his authorization proposals. On October 5, by a vote of 90-9, the Senate approved an amendment (1) to require the Defense Department to adhere to regulations in the Army field manual on interrogations in questioning detainees under DOD control or on DOD facilities and (2) to prohibit any federal agency from engaging in cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees. Subsequently, when the Senate resumed consideration of the defense authorization, Senator McCain offered the same measure as an amendment and it was accepted by voice vote on November 4. Later, Senator Graham withdrew his original proposal to provide statutory authority for tribunals to review the status of prisoners at Guantanamo and offered a revised amendment that would require the Secretary of Defense to establish regulations for the tribunals, require that the senior civilian in charge of tribunals be confirmed by the Senate, and allow only limited court appeals of tribunal decisions. This led to an extensive debate about court oversight of the tribunal. The Senate rejected an amendment by Senator Bingaman to allow court review of habeas corpus petitions. Senators Graham and Levin then agreed on, and the Senate approved, a compromise version of the Graham amendment that expanded the range of potential court appeals of tribunals decisions. The conference agreements on the authorization and appropriations bills both include, without change, the McCain amendments requiring DOD adherence to the Army field manual on interrogations and prohibiting cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees. Conferees added a new provision, modeled on the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to ensure that U.S. government personnel accused of illegal treatment of detainees may assert as a defense that they did not know that practices were unlawful. Conferees also added a requirement that Iraqi security personnel be instructed in interrogation techniques and receive translated copies of the Army field manual. The conference agreements also include an amended version of the Graham-Levin amendment establishing procedures for tribunals. Exit strategy for Iraq: On May 25, the full House rejected by a vote of 128-300 an amendment to the defense authorization bill by Representative Woolsey expressing the sense of Congress that the President should develop a plan to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq. In floor debate on the defense appropriations bill, Representative Pelosi offered an amendment to require an Administration report on measures of progress in Iraq that would permit a withdrawal\u2014in effect, an exit strategy. The Rules Committee did not agree to protect the proposal from a point of order, however, and it was subsequently ruled out of order as legislation on an appropriations bill. On July 20, the House approved by a vote of 291-137 an amendment to the foreign affairs authorization bill ( H.R. 2601 ) by Representative Ros-Lehtinen stating that calls for \"an early withdrawal\" from Iraq are counterproductive and that it is U.S. policy to withdraw only \"when it is clear that United States national security and foreign policy goals relating to a free and stable Iraq have been or are about to be achieved.\" The Senate debated U.S. Iraq policy extensively when it resumed action on the authorization bill in November. On November 15, the Senate rejected a Levin amendment that would, in effect, have required the Administration to establish a schedule that would tie withdrawals of troops to progress in Iraq. But the Senate agreed to a very modestly revised version of the Levin amendment without the final provision on troop withdrawals. As agreed to, the amendment states that 2006 should be a transition year in which Iraqi security forces take on increasing responsibility for security and that this should lead to U.S. troop withdrawals, and it requires Administration reports on a schedule for improved conditions in Iraq that would permit the redeployment of U.S. forces. Two days later, on November 17, Representative Murtha, the ranking Democrat on the defense appropriations subcommittee, opened a new phase of the national debate about Iraq policy when he called for redeploying U.S. military forces out of Iraq as soon as possible, arguing that the U.S. presence was making the security situation worse. On November 18, following a tumultuous debate, the House rejected by a vote of 403-6 a resolution ( H.Res. 571 ) proposed by Representative Hunter calling for immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq. The authorization conference agreement includes a provision that makes minor changes in the Senate statement of Iraq policy. The measure requires quarterly reports on progress in Iraq and establishes a policy that 2006 should be a turning point in transferring responsibility to Iraqi security forces. The conference provision removes a Senate reference to a \"schedule\" for achieving specified measures of progress in Iraq and substitutes a requirement for a \"plan.\" The appropriations conference report also requires quarterly reports on progress in Iraq. A \" bridge fund \" for Iraq and Afghanistan operations: The House-passed authorization recommended $49.1 billion, the Senate authorization recommended $50 billion, the House-passed appropriations provided $45.2 billion, and the Senate-passed appropriations bill provided $50 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and elsewhere as a bridge until FY2006 supplemental appropriations can be provided next year. Last year, Congress provided $25 billion. One issue in House action on the authorization was whether to strengthen reporting requirements on the use of the money, on equipment repair requirements, on troop levels, and on the costs of operations in Iraq. The House agreed to a modified amendment that requires reports on the allocation of funds, on equipment, and on military construction projects. The appropriations conference agreement provides $50 billion as a bridge fund, including, $8 billion for weapons procurement. The House had provided $2.9 billion and the Senate $8.6 billion for procurement. Women in combat: As part of an en bloc amendment to the defense authorization bill, the House approved a measure proposed by Armed Services Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter that would require DOD to notify Congress 60 days in advance of implementing any changes in policy for assigning women to operational ground units. The measure was a substitute for a provision in the committee reported version of the bill that would have (1) codified into law the Pentagon's 1994 policy that prohibits assigning women to units that engage in ground combat operations and (2) prohibited any changes in current assignments. The full committee measure was, in turn, a substitute for a more restrictive subcommittee measure that would have prohibited assigning women to some support units, including units in which women currently serve, that might accompany combat units into battle. The authorization conference agreement reduces the requirement for advance notification to 30 days. Army and Marine Corps end-strength: Both the House authorization and the Senate Armed Services Committee added to statutory end-strength. The House authorization added 10,000 in end-strength to the Army and 1,000 to the Marine Corps in FY2006. The Senate authorization added 20,000 to Army end-strength. These increases, which add to those Congress approved last year, would require DOD to support more than the 30,000 extra troops it is now temporarily keeping in the force. The Senate authorization is 43,000 troops above the baseline level for the Army and Marine Corps. The Senate appropriations committee included funds to support the added end strength in the Senate authorization. The authorization conference report provides an increase of 10,000 in Army and 1,000 in Marine Corps end-strength in FY2006. The total authorized end-strength in the Army is 512,400, which is 30,000 above the \"baseline\" level before the Iraq war and which, therefore, is not at odds with current Administration policy. In practice, end-strength has fallen short of the goal. The authorization conference agreement also permits the Secretary of Defense to increase the Army by an additional 20,000 troops and the Marine Corps by an additional 4,000 troops between FY2007 and FY2009, which suggests that end-strength may again be an issue next year. Navy shipbuilding: The House authorization bill restructured Navy shipbuilding dramatically, adding funds for three additional ships and imposing cost caps on current ships, including a cap on the DD(X) next generation destroyer program that would be impossible for the Navy to meet, in effect terminating the program. The House appropriations bill added funds for four ships and followed the House authorization in trimming funds for the DD(X). The Senate authorization prohibited a winner-take-all competition among shipyards for the DD(X), requiring that the ship by built at two shipyards, and added advance procurement funds for a second ship, but otherwise did not substantially alter the Navy request. The Senate appropriations bill eliminated funds for a T-AKE cargo ship but supported the DD(X) and other requested shipbuilding. On November 9, Representative Murtha, the ranking Democrat on the defense appropriations subcommittee, told reporters that the conference agreement would preserve funding for the DD(X). The appropriations conference agreement provides requested funding for the DD(X), does not provide advance procurement funds for a second ship in FY2007, provides one T-AKE cargo ship, as requested, and adds funds for two additional Littoral Combat Ships, as in the House bill. The authorization conference agreement establishes cost caps on specific ships and requires the Navy to design a new, lower-cost submarine. Cost growth in major weapons programs: The House authorization not only imposed cost caps on Navy ships, but also trimmed and restructured funding for the Army Future Combat System (FCS), cut funding for some satellite programs, and revised acquisition laws to require a full analysis of alternatives any time program cost growth exceeds 15%. The House appropriations bill made most of the same weapons cuts. The Senate authorization bill did not cut the FCS and made smaller cuts in satellite programs. The Senate appropriations committee trimmed the FCS by 1/3 as much as the House, cut some satellite programs, and reduced funding because of delays in other programs. The appropriations conference agreement cuts the FCS by $236 million, about midway between the House and Senate, cuts several satellite programs substantially, and reduces the troubled Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) by $334 million. The authorization conference agreement includes several amendments to defense acquisition laws, including a measure to improve reporting on weapons cost growth, a requirement for a report on all major programs with unit cost growth of 50% or more, and a requirement for a report on the role of Lead Systems Integrators in developing major weapons. The conference agreement on the authorization did not include the House-passed measure that would require a full analysis of alternatives for weapons that exceed 15% cost growth. Missile defense testing: The House authorization added $100 million for additional testing of the ground-based missile defense system that is now being deployed, but the Armed Services Committee rejected, among other measures, a proposal to shift oversight of missile defense testing from the Missile Defense Agency to the DOD Office of Operational Test and Evaluation. No amendment to strengthen testing was permitted by the House rule on the bill. The Senate defense appropriations bill added $200 million for the ground-based system. The appropriations conference agreement adds $150 million for testing. Reserve personnel health benefits: The House Armed Services Committee approved an amendment in markup to make DOD's health program for military dependents, known as TRICARE, available to non-deployed as well as deployed reserve personnel. The provision was later stricken from the bill before it reached the floor because its cost would have exceeded caps on mandatory spending. The House narrowly rejected a motion to recommit the bill and restore the provision. On July 21, the Senate approved a Graham-Clinton amendment to the authorization bill to allow all non-deployed reservists to enroll in TRICARE. The authorization conference agreement amends the Senate provision to open TRICARE to non-deployed reservists who are receiving unemployment compensation or who are not eligible for employer-provided health insurance, with a premium of 50% of the value of the benefit. New nuclear weapons: The House authorization eliminated funds for the Department of Energy (DOE) to study the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), as did the House-passed energy and water appropriations bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee did not cut DOE RNEP funds. And in floor action on the energy and water appropriations bill, the Senate rejected an amendment proposed by Senator Feinstein to eliminate DOE funds for the RNEP. The conference agreement on the energy and water bill eliminates RNEP funding. On October 25, Senator Domenici released a statement saying that the Administration supported the elimination of funds and wanted to focus on non-nuclear weapons for destroying deeply buried targets. Subsequently, Administration officials have emphasized that the current policy is to test projectiles that could penetrate hardened concrete. Some opponents of the RNEP have complained that this leaves room for the nuclear program to be resurrected in the future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Status of Legislation", "paragraphs": ["On April 28, both the House and the Senate approved a conference agreement on the FY2006 congressional budget resolution ( H.Con.Res. 95 ).

[Note: This did not, in fact, limit the amount Congress could provide for Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2006. While the budget resolution specifically set aside $50 billion, it also exempted any amount for military contingency operations from spending limits in the House and any amount for any defense purpose in the Senate.

Administration supporters argue that it would be a mistake to do so because it would allow regime opponents to plan for a U.S. exit and might dishearten regime supporters.

That memo did not, however, address funding for wars after the initial phases. On that question, the precedents are mixed. While the Korean conflict was financed mainly with supplementals, World War II and Vietnam were funded both with supplementals and with regular appropriations. In Vietnam, the Administration first asked for a $700 million supplemental for FY1965 in May of 1965; then for a $1.7 billion addition to the regular FY1966 defense appropriations bill, which was requested as a budget amendment in the summer of 1965; and then, in January of 1966, as troop levels in Southeast Asia were climbing, a supplemental of $12.3 billion for FY1966 and regular appropriations of $10.3 billion for FY1967, both requested when the FY1967 budget was submitted.", "So, in the case of Vietnam, the Johnson Administration asked for emergency supplementals when necessary, but also requested funds in regular appropriations bills as soon as those bills were on the congressional agenda, even though troop levels were in flux and the duration of the conflict could not be foreseen.", "Most recently, CRS reviewed precedents for funding of ongoing military contingency operations in the 1990s. CRS reported that in action on the FY1996 defense appropriations bill, Congress, on its own initiative, decided to include funding for ongoing operations in Southwest Asia in regular appropriations bills rather than in supplementals, and it directed the Administration to request funding for ongoing military operations in regular bills in the future. Subsequently, in the FY1997 defense budget and in later requests, the Clinton Administration included funding for ongoing operations, including operations in Southwest Asia, Bosnia, and Kosovo, in the regular defense budget."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Action", "paragraphs": ["In floor debate on the FY2005 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 1268 , Senator Byrd offered an amendment, SA 464, expressing the sense of the Senate that funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan after FY2006 should be requested and appropriated in regular annual funding bills.

Funding caps in the FY2006 congressional budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 95 , do not appear to be a barrier. To be permissible in view of caps on overall discretionary spending established by the budget resolution, the appropriations bills would have to designate funding for operations abroad as either as \"defense emergency appropriations\" (in the Senate) or as funding for \"contingency operations in support of the global war on terrorism\" (in the House and, for up to $50 billion, in the Senate)\u2014see the box below for a further explanation.", "That said, in its markup of the FY2006 defense authorization bill, the Senate Armed Services Committee provided $50 billion in additional funding for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, the House-passed authorization recommends $49.1 billion, the House-passed defense appropriations bill provides $45.2 billion, and the Senate-passed defense appropriations bill provides $50.0 billion.

On the floor, however, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to restore the funds by a margin of 95-4. In the House, Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle considered but then dropped a proposal to recommend $2 billion less for defense than the Administration requested.", "But even though the FY2005 budget resolution did not recommend a reduction, in the end, appropriators trimmed about $2 billion from the Administration request in the FY2005 defense appropriations bill ( H.R. 4613 . P.L. 108-287 ), making that amount available partly for other defense bills, including military construction, and partly for non-defense programs. This has been a recurring process. The appropriations committee defense cuts in FY2005 did not go as far in FY2004, when the committee rescinded $3.5 billion in funds in the regular FY2004 defense appropriations bill ( H.R. 2658 , P.L. 108-87 ) and another $1.8 billion in the FY2004 omnibus appropriations measure ( H.R. 2673 , P.L. 108-199 ) as means of offsetting funding in non-defense bills.

These reports, thus, are known as the \"302(b) allocations.\" Budget limits are enforced by establishing a point of order against a reported bill or an amendment to a bill that would exceed each subcommittee's 302(b) allocation, though the full appropriations committees may, and often do, revise the allocations over the course of the year. So the 302(b) allocations are a critical part of the appropriations process that determine how much will be available in total for each bill.", "The FY2006 congressional budget resolution ( H.Con.Res. 95 ) provides a 302(a) allocation to the appropriations committees of $843.02 billion. On May 5, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jerry Lewis released his proposed initial 302(b) allocations. These allocations were later revised on May 12, May 18, and June 22, but the revisions did not change the defense figures. For the defense subcommittee, the allocation was $363.44 billion, which is $3.28 billion below the Administration request for programs under the subcommittee's jurisdiction. For the military quality of life/veterans affairs subcommittee, the allocation is $85.158 billion, which is $1.05 billion above the request. The 302(b) allocations do not determine how the funds will be divided among programs under each subcommittee, so some of the extra money for the MQL/VA subcommittee could be for the Department of Defense and some for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The allocations allowed about $2.9 billion more for non-defense programs than the request\u2014in effect, roughly $3 billion was shifted from defense to non-defense programs.", "In releasing its initial allocations, the House Appropriations Committee made one key argument about the defense total. The allocation to the defense subcommittee assumed that the defense appropriations bill would include $5 billion of rescissions of prior year defense funds which can be applied to offset increases in FY2006 programs in the defense appropriations bill. If so, the $3.28 billion cut from the request would be more than offset by rescissions, and there would be room for a $1.72 billion increase in actual programs.", "Some may quibble with this argument. One quibble is that there are often rescissions of prior year funds in all appropriations bills, and they are normally applied as offsets to increases in new funds elsewhere in each bill. In effect, the initial House 302(b) allocations require that defense rescissions be available partly to offset increases in total non-defense appropriations compared to the Administration's request. A different quibble is that defense rescissions may later be \"backfilled\" by increased emergency supplemental appropriations later in the process. The FY2004 omnibus appropriations bill, for example, rescinded $1.8 billion in prior year defense funds to offset non-defense amounts. The Iraq/Afghanistan emergency funding provisions of the FY2005 defense appropriations bill, however, repealed the rescission. So, in effect, emergency defense appropriations were used to offset increased FY2004 non-defense funding.", "The version of the defense appropriations bill that the House Appropriations Committee marked up on June 7, and the amended version passed on June 20, provided $363.7 billion of which $363.4 billion was for discretionary (rather than mandatory) programs, equal to the initial House 302(b) allocation and $3.28 billion below the request.", "On June 9, the Senate Appropriations Committee formally approved and released its initial 302(b) allocations. The Senate allocations trimmed $7 billion from the Administration request for the defense bill and added $797 million for the military construction/Veterans Affairs subcommittee.

The House-passed appropriations bill was $3.0 billion below the Administration request, and the Senate-passed bill was $7.0 billion less. Neither bill, however, made deep cuts in overall funding for major weapons, though both selectively trimmed some programs. Rather the cuts came mainly in military personnel, in operation and maintenance, and in revolving fund accounts (see Table 4 above).", "The difference between the House and Senate on overall defense funding was a key issue to be resolved in conference negotiations on the defense appropriations bill. For its part, in its Statement of Administration Policy on the Senate bill, the White House warned of a veto if defense was cut substantially to pay for increased non-defense appropriations. In the run up to the conference, House and Senate appropriators resolved the difference by agreeing on a total closer to the House level. On November 2, the House approved revised 302(b) estimates that reflect the compromise with the Senate. The Senate reported its revised allocations on November 10. The revisions trim defense by $4.4 billion below the Administration request. This amount was reflected in the conference on the defense appropriations bill. Meanwhile, the conference agreement on the military construction/VA appropriations bill added $0.1 billion for Department of Defense programs. Division B of the defense appropriations bill included an across-the-board cut of 1%, or $8.5 billion, in total non-emergency FY2006 appropriations. Of that, $4.1 billion is cut from the Department of Defense.

Opponents also warned that federal employees who serve in the reserves would have an incentive to abandon the federal employee health benefit program (FEHBP) and sign up for the cheaper TRICARE system, which would drive up FEHBP costs for others.

What the Defense Authorization and Appropriations Bills Cover", "Congress provides funding for national defense programs in several annual appropriations measures, the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill. Congress also acts every year on a national defense authorization bill, which authorizes programs funded in several regular appropriations measures. The authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely the same level of detail as the defense-related appropriations, and congressional debate about major defense policy and funding issues often occurs mainly in action on the authorization.", "The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD), including pay and benefits of military personnel, operation and maintenance of weapons and facilities, weapons procurement, and research and development, as well as for other purposes. Most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the Department of Defense, though the bill also provides (1) relatively small, unclassified amounts for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management, (2) classified amounts for national intelligence activities administered by the National Intelligence Director, by the CIA, and by other agencies as well as by DOD, and (3) very small amounts for some other agencies.", "At the beginning of the 109 th Congress, the House Appropriations Committee undertook a substantial reorganization that removed the Defense Health Program, environmental restoration programs, and military facilities maintenance accounts from the jurisdiction of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and placed them under the jurisdiction of the newly-named Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee. The Senate Appropriations Committee subsequently adopted a reorganization plan that kept the same accounts within the defense appropriations bill, though it assigned military construction and veterans affairs programs to a renamed Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. This report will continue to track funding levels of the programs moved out of the defense appropriations bill by the House, as they still fall within both the Department of Defense and overall National Defense budget functions.", "Several other appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of DOD and other agencies. This report does not generally track congressional action on defense-related programs in these other appropriations bills, except for a discussion of action on some Department of Energy nuclear weapons programs in the energy and water appropriations bill.", "Appendix B. Overview of the Administration Request", "On February 7, 2005, the Administration released its FY2006 federal budget request. The request includes $441.8 billion in new budget authority for national defense, of which $421.1 billion is for military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD), $17.5 billion for atomic energy defense activities of the Department of Energy, and $3.2 billion for defense-related activities of other agencies (see Table B -1 ). The FY2006 request does not include funding for ongoing military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. On February 14, 2005, the Administration submitted a supplemental appropriations request for FY2005 that included $74.9 billion for DOD.", "The FY2006 request represents an increase of 4.3% over the FY2005 enacted level (excluding the supplemental) in nominal terms, and of 1.9% after adjusting for inflation. This rate of growth is considerably slower than earlier in the Bush Administration. Between FY2000 and FY2005, funding for national defense grew by 38% in nominal terms or about 23% after inflation, an annual inflation-adjusted growth rate of 4.2%. Administration figures show relatively slow rates of real growth in the baseline defense budget (excluding supplemental appropriations) for the next several years (see Table B -2 ).", "Key Features of the Administration Request", "Within the defense budget, three aspects of the Administration's FY2006 request stand out:", "Continued growth in military personnel and in operation and maintenance costs; A slowdown in growth of funding for RDT&E and procurement; and Some substantial last-minute changes in projected funding for major weapons programs when, in December, 2004, the Office of Management and Budget instructed the Defense Department to trim a net of $30 billion from the total Defense Department FY2006-FY2011 six-year plan.", "Continued Growth in Military Personnel and in Operation and Maintenance\u00a0Costs", "As Table B -1 shows, the FY2006 request for the Department of Defense is $19.1 billion higher than the FY2005 baseline budget (i.e., excluding supplemental appropriations). Of that increase, $5.7 billion is for military personnel and $10.0 billion is for operation and maintenance (O&M). So, over 80% of the requested DOD increase between FY2005 and FY2006 is for military personnel and O&M. The growth in personnel and operating accounts reflects an ongoing trend. Between FY2000 and FY2005, increases in military personnel and operation and maintenance funding accounted for 60% of the overall, relatively larger increase in the Department of Defense budget. This still left substantial amounts to boost weapons acquisition. But as budgets level off, continuing increases in personnel and operations may limit the new funding available for weapons programs.", "Slower Growth in Procurement and RDT&E", "In the FY2006 request, the Administration proposes $78.0 billion for procurement, a decrease of $300 million compared to the FY2005 baseline level, and $69.4 billion for RDT&E, an increase of $600 million. After adjusting for inflation, both represent real reductions in funding (see Table B -3 ). Over the next few years, the Administration plan calls for only very modest growth in weapons acquisition in the regular defense budget\u2014an increase in procurement funding is offset by a decline in RDT&E. In all, procurement plus RDT&E spending increases by 7.3% after adjusting for inflation over the next six years, about 1.2% per year real growth.", "One additional point is important to note. The Administration plan also projects only modest real growth in operation and maintenance of about 1.8% per year over the next six years, substantially below the historical growth rate of 2.6%. If, as in the past, projections of O&M savings prove to be too optimistic, then funds may migrate from acquisition programs into O&M to protect readiness.", "Program Budget Decision 753 (PBD-753)", "The implications of constraints on weapons funding became rather dramatically apparent in December, 2004, when the Defense Department made a number of significant changes in its long-term acquisition plans to meet budget targets established by the White House. In the last few weeks before the President's FY2006 budget was to be submitted to Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructed the Defense Department to cut $55 billion from its FY2006-FY2011 Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). At the same time, OMB told the Pentagon to add $25 billion to the FY2007-FY2011 Army budget to cover costs of an ongoing reorganization plan, known as Army Modularization (see below for a further discussion). The net result was a reduction of $30 billion in the DOD budget over the next six years.", "To effect these reductions, DOD issued Program Budget Decision 753 (PBD-753), which prescribed adjustments to be incorporated into the FY2006 budget submission in order to meet the OMB mandate. Table B -4 lists the major program changes in PBD-753.", "As Table B -4 shows, the proposed reductions are heavily weighted towards the out-years\u2014especially FY2009 and FY2010\u2014and minimized in FY2007. Several of these cuts have been controversial in Congress, particularly the Navy shipbuilding reductions and termination of the C-130J. The fate of these and other programs may be a major focus of congressional attention in action on this year's defense bills. As the House Armed Services Committee was beginning to mark up the defense authorization bills, the Defense Department announced that it had decided not to terminate C-130J production.", "Long-Term Defense Budget Challenges", "Over the next several years, the defense budget will be under a considerable amount of pressure due to several long-term trends. These include", "Relatively moderate rates of growth in defense spending in Administration budget projections and continued downward pressure on the budget due to efforts to constrain budget deficits; Recent large increases in military personnel costs that have made uniformed personnel more than 30% more expensive than in 1999; Continued growth in operation and maintenance costs; Cost growth in a number of major weapons programs and recent cuts in major weapons due to budget constraints; and New perceptions of threats to U.S. security that may lead the Pentagon to alter its budget priorities substantially.", "Taken together, these trends pose some potentially daunting, though by no means unprecedented, challenges for Congress and the Defense Department in shaping the defense budget. These issues are reviewed in CRS Report RL32877, Defense Budget: Long-Term Challenges for FY2006 and Beyond , by [author name scrubbed]. Though Congress seldom addresses these matters directly, long-term budget pressures underlie many of the issues that Congress will grapple with this year."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
