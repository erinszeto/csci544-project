The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance payments to eligible servicemembers and veterans, and their dependents. One of its primary objectives is readjustment of veterans to civilian life and the workforce. The federal Pell Grant program provides grant aid payments to eligible and financially needy undergraduate students, regardless of military service record. One of its primary objectives is to increase postsecondary education access of low-income individuals. The report investigates whether the administrative processes supporting Pell Grants can provide lessons for achieving more timely, efficient, and student-friendly administration of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, thus ensuring that it achieves its policy objectives with respect to educational achievement of the target population.", "There are several differences between the programs and their administration. Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility is contingent on service in the uniformed services, whereas Pell Grant eligibility is contingent on financial need. Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits must be used within several years of discharge from active duty, whereas Pell Grants can be used at any stage of an individual's life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit was designed to meet most costs of education, whereas the Pell Grants were designed to meet a portion of an individual's financial need. Eligible individuals may receive both benefits concurrently.", "When comparing the administrative processes of the programs, there are at least three important considerations. One is the difference in the number of beneficiaries/recipients\u2014estimates indicate there were fewer than 1 million Post-9/11 GI Bill participants and more than 9 million Pell Grant recipients in FY2014, which leads to economies of scale and greater familiarity for Pell Grant administrators. Another is the greater variety of programs of education approved for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which increases administrative complexity. Finally, while the Post-9/11 GI Bill went into effect in 2009, the Pell Grant administrative processes are more mature, having been developed and administered for decades.", "There are areas in which the Post-9/11 GI Bill processes and procedures arguably could be improved if compared to the Pell Grant program. The key area would be a larger investment in system automation and internal controls to more fully automate the processes and maintain them with respect to ongoing legislative changes. For example, Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility determinations could be more fully automated. VA systems could choose the most advantageous GI Bill programs based on applicant information. Exact payments and unmet costs may be estimated for Post-9/11 GI Bill participants prior to enrollment to encourage informed enrollment. Providing payments to educational institutions to disburse to students may eliminate an extra processing step by the VA and speed payments and adjustments. Overpayments of Post-9/11 GI Bill payments could be resolved through deductions from subsequent Post-9/11 GI Bill payments or other VA benefit payments.", "However, there may be underlying issues that prevent or hinder improvements and may suggest a limited advantage from them. For example, a single lump sum housing allowance payment before the start or at the beginning of the academic term may help pay early housing expenses; however, it may increase the incidence and amount of overpayments and debts."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill \u00ae )\u2014enacted as Title V of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-252 ) \u2014provides educational assistance payments to eligible individuals (servicemembers and veterans, and their dependents) from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in accordance with their military service.

Some participants have criticized the administration of Post-9/11 GI Bill payments for taking too long and asserted that the penalties for participants who received an overpayment of benefits are too high as compared to ED student aid programs. Some participant criticism is a result of simultaneous experience navigating the processes to receive Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and Pell Grant payments. Since passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee has held several oversight hearings to ensure administration of the Post-9/11 GI Bill meets the needs of servicemembers transitioning to civilian life. The hearings have focused on automation, timeliness of payments, and accuracy of benefits. Some of the differences in aid processing are a consequence of the programs' purposes. However, other differences in the processing design and operation may expose opportunities for improvement. ", "This report is designed to assist congressional staff seeking an exploration of ways in which the administration of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits might be improved through the adoption of practices employed in the administration of Title IV aid. The report approaches this task through an examination of the statutory and regulatory provisions that are pertinent to the design and administration of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and Pell Grants, the Title IV aid program that is seemingly the most comparable to Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. The report also examines the operational practices employed to implement statutory and regulatory provisions. Information on operational practices, particularly those relevant to aid administration, has been obtained through a review of sub-regulatory guidance materials, manuals providing guidance to staff involved in administering aid, and through a limited set of interviews and site visits with individuals at federal agencies and colleges who are directly involved in administering aid. The report presents a thorough description of the administrative practices used for each of these educational assistance programs and attempts to identify differences and reasons for differences in the administrative practices used across the programs. It also identifies some ways in which existing practices might be enhanced, and discusses possible ways Post-9/11 GI bill benefit administration might be improved by adopting some Title IV practices. It is hoped that this examination can help inform the dialogue on ways in which practices employed in the administration of one program may warrant consideration for their potential to streamline or enhance the administration of the other.

Eligible individuals may receive a grant of money while enrolled in eligible programs at an eligible institution of higher education (IHE; see Appendix A for a description of an IHE). The benefits were originally designed to help qualified high school graduates with exceptional financial need take advantage of the benefits of higher education. Pell Grants are intended to be the foundation for all federal student aid.", "To be eligible for a Pell Grant in award year 2014-2015, students must meet several criteria: completion of secondary school or an equivalent, citizenship or eligible noncitizen status, Selective Service registration, and pursuit of an eligible program at an eligible institution. Several situations related to a drug conviction, other Title IV aid (e.g., defaulting on student loans), and institutionalization may disqualify otherwise eligible individuals from receiving a Pell Grant.

Table 2 provides a succinct overview of some key differences. A full explanation of each is available in the appropriate section following the table.", "Some of the administrative differences may be a consequence of the relatively younger age of the Post-9/11 GI Bill; what may arguably be termed greater benefit complexity for the Post-9/11 GI Bill; and the complexity of DOD records. Because the Post-9/11 GI Bill was enacted in 2009 and the Pell Grant program was enacted in 1973, ED, IHEs, and Congress have had more time and resources to develop a suite of fully automated and integrated information systems, which administer Pell Grants in concert with the other HEA Title IV aid programs, and to improve process and system efficiency through administrative, regulatory, and legislative enhancements. And although the VA has administered several GI Bill programs since 1944, the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit architecture was not compatible with the legacy GI Bill information systems. Pell Grants are a single payment type intended to cover educational costs; while the most common Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit includes four different payments (tuition and fees, YR, housing, and books) intended to cover different educational costs and thus requiring differing award rules. Besides the most common Post-9/11 GI Bill payments, there are additional payment types covering less commonly utilized educational costs that require different information for certification and payment. ", "Differences in the level of automation are crucial to processing speed and accuracy. Finally while ED checks several Pell Grant eligibility criteria through automated database matching programs with other federal agencies, VA has been unable to fully automate the calculation of qualifying active duty service. As a consequence, initial FAFSA processing is automated, but initial processing of applications for veterans education benefits is primarily manual. It may be of note that despite initial FAFSA automation, at least one data element on the application of almost half of all eligible applicants is verified manually by an FAA to ensure system integrity.", "Both programs allow individuals to apply online. The Post-9/11 GI Bill application requires most applicants to choose the most advantageous GI Bill. The Pell Grant application requires more information, including personal financial information, that confuses some applicants. A veteran may apply for and receive a certificate of eligibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits at any time within their entitlement period even if he or she does not plan to use the benefits in the immediate future. A Pell Grant application is only processed for eligibility during college admissions or while attending college.", "The initial benefit application is processed to determine eligibility. With respect to the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the VA cross references DOD data and several legacy systems and issues a certificate of eligibility (COE) to the individual within approximately 20 days. The COE summarizes the individual's qualifying service and resulting benefit level (40%-100%), remaining entitlement, and delimiting date (the last date of eligibility for education benefits). With respect to Pell Grants, ED's Central Processing System (CPS) automatically verifies basic eligibility for HEA Title IV aid, not necessarily the Pell Grant program in particular, by matching data from several federal agency databases. Within 3-5 days, CPS provides the applicant with a student aid report (SAR) that summarizes the application data and data match results, indicates the applicant's expected family contribution (EFC) and resulting potential Pell Grant amount, and provides additional HEA Title IV aid information for the application academic year.", "After the initial application process, the VA and educational institutions share processing responsibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, whereas the remaining Pell Grant processes are primarily the responsibility of the IHEs. This difference may contribute to the differences in the time required to pay benefits and concerns regarding who is responsible for Post-9/11 GI Bill overpayments\u2014the participant or educational institution. An overpayment occurs when a benefit amount is paid on behalf of a Post-9/11 GI Bill participant to the participant or to the educational institution, and then it is subsequently determined that the individual is eligible for a smaller amount. ", "Secondary claim/application processing determines benefit payment amounts based on actual or planned enrollment. An IHE may complete secondary processing in order to inform prospective students of their HEA Title IV aid package and encourage enrollment. The VA completes secondary processing only to award payments. For registered or enrolled students, the educational institution reports enrollment to the VA in order for the VA to calculate and make Post-9/11 GI Bill payments accordingly. The federal government encourages educational institutions to counsel GI Bill participants on the complexities of higher education and financial aid. For registered or enrolled students, the IHE may in special circumstances adjust some data elements used in calculating the HEA Title IV aid package, including Pell Grant payments, and make payments accordingly. The IHE reports Pell Grant payments to ED for payment.", "The key differences between the handling of overpayments from the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Pell Grant programs have to do with the total amount of the overpayment and the related programs. A Pell Grant overpayment occurs when a student receives more aid than that which he or she is eligible. A single Post-9/11 GI Bill payment may exceed $20,000. A single Pell Grant disbursement in FY2014 was no more than $2,865. For purposes of Post-9/11 GI Bill payments, VA first sends debt notification letters to the participant explaining how the participant may choose to resolve the debt, before VA notifies credit reporting agencies and refers the debt to the Department of the Treasury. For purposes of Pell Grants, the FAA will first adjust a student's Title IV aid package during the current award year to eliminate an overpayment and then attempt to recoup the funds from the student before referring the debt to ED's Debt Resolution Services. The onus is primarily on the participant for Post-9/11 GI Bill purposes and on the IHE for Pell Grant purposes. ", "One difference key to every process step is the greater transparency in the Post-9/11 GI Bill program from the perspective of the participant. Many veterans may with little assistance correctly assess their Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility and the payment amounts that they may receive. The eligibility criteria and calculations for Pell Grants would be difficult for students to duplicate accurately. For example, the key criterion for Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility is the individual's service record, which may be obtained from their service unit if the exact dates are not remembered. A key criterion for Pell Grant eligibility is EFC, which is based on calculations using financial information, benefit receipt, and statutory provisions.

This may reduce the amount of some overpayments. Conversely, the VA could induce or penalize SCOs to encourage the timely amendment or adjustment to Certs. Another approach might be for the VA to begin immediate and minimal collection of overpayments from future benefits such that some individuals who choose not to proactively resolve an overpayment in a timely manner could avoid referral to Treasury and credit agencies. The minimal reduction might encourage individual action toward a more beneficial resolution of the overpayment. As an alternative to an automatic and minimal collection rate, the VA could automatically offset each future Post-9/11 GI Bill payment until the overpayment is resolved or the participant makes alternative arrangements.
