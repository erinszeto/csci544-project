However, under limited circumstances\u2014some of which this report addresses\u2014there are certain mechanisms under which the FDA may expand access to a drug or biologic outside the standard regulatory framework. Two such mechanisms are expanded access to investigational drugs , commonly referred to as compassionate use , and emergency use authorization .", "Compassionate Use . One type of compassionate use request may come from a person with a terminal diagnosis who has tried all appropriate FDA-approved drugs. Perhaps a promising drug is being tested in a clinical trial closed to new patients or for which the patient does not qualify. In that case, a physician may ask FDA for permission to get the investigational new drug for the patient outside of the clinical trial. Before approaching FDA, the patient or physician must already have contacted the sponsor of the investigational drug, usually its manufacturer, to ask for the drug, and the manufacturer must have agreed to provide the drug pending FDA authorization.", "In 2014, FDA received 1,882 such requests and approved all but 9. What that 99.5% rate does not reveal is how many people took the first step\u2014requesting access from manufacturers\u2014and how many of those requests companies denied. Companies do not release those numbers. An article in BioCentury related a conversation with bioethicist Arthur Caplan, whom it described as consulting with many companies about expanded access, writing that Caplan \"says it is likely that only a small fraction of the refusals make it into the media.\" Also not revealed by the over 99% FDA approval rate is how many patients and doctors did not pursue expanded access because the FDA process was too involved or lengthy.", "Emergency Use Authorization. Emergency use authorization (EUA) follows another path. When one of the Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, or Homeland Security declares a military, domestic, or public health emergency or potential for such an emergency, FDA, following procedures authorized by law, may issue EUAs for unapproved products.", "Two circumstances have contributed to a recent increase in public and congressional discussion of expanded access to investigational drugs. The first is patients and interested groups who are asking state legislatures to pass right-to-try laws, which aim to bypass FDA authorization. These advocates are using the power of social media to influence manufacturers' decisions to provide investigational drugs. Second is the demand for unapproved medical products to fight Ebola virus disease.", "Members of Congress ask about FDA authorities and practices such as compassionate use, which can apply to one or a few patients, and emergency use authority, which expands access to investigational drugs to protect the public against national security or public health threats.

( Figure 1 illustrates the general path of a pharmaceutical product.)", "Once the IND application is approved, researchers test in a small number of human volunteers the safety they had previously demonstrated in animals. These trials, called Phase I clinical trials, attempt \"to determine dosing, document how a drug is metabolized and excreted, and identify acute side effects.\" If a sponsor considers the product still worthy of investment based on the results of Phase I trial, it continues with Phase II and Phase III trials.

One mechanism is a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), which may limit who may prescribe the drug and which pharmacies may dispense it. A REMS may require patient registries or clinical laboratory tests at the time of dispensing (e.g., for liver function or pregnancy).", "Once FDA has approved a drug (with or without a REMS), it places several ongoing requirements on the manufacturer. These include periodic facility registration and inspection requirements, along with manufacturer reporting requirements regarding any adverse events that may be related to the drug's use.

FDA approval involves weighing the potential risks (including known side effects) against the potential benefits. The threshold for acceptable risk rises with the risk of not acting at all.

Provisions in state right-to-try laws allow a patient to obtain\u2014without the FDA's permission\u2014an investigational drug that has passed the Phase 1 (safety) clinical trial stage. However, several experts have suggested that this state law approach is unlikely to directly increase patient access. First, federal law (the FFDCA), which requires FDA approval of such arrangements, may preempt this type of state law. Second, for a patient who follows FDA procedures, FDA action is not the final obstacle to access.

For FDA to grant that permission, however, the manufacturer must have agreed to provide the drug.", "Why would a manufacturer not give its experimental drug to every patient who requests it? From the perspective of a seriously ill and possibly dying patient, a manufacturer that declines to provide its potentially life-saving experimental drug may seem callous. However, that manufacturer faces a complex decision. Certainly profit plays a role: companies think about public relations problems and the opportunity costs of limited staff and facility resources, but companies must also consider the available supply of the drug, liability, safety, and whether adverse event or outcome data will affect FDA's consideration of a new drug application in the future.", "Available supply. If a manufacturer only has a tiny amount of an experimental drug, that paucity may limit distribution, no matter what the manufacturer would like to do. Sponsors of early clinical research make small amounts of experimental products for use in small Phase I safety trials, and progressively more for Phase II and III trials. Although one or two additional patients may not cause supply problems, a manufacturer does not know how many expanded access requests it will receive. Investment in building up to large-scale production usually comes only after reasonable assurance that the product will get FDA approval. Even for an already approved or licensed product, scaling up production in response to an outbreak may be difficult.", "For a company to redirect its current manufacturing capacity involves financial, logistic, and public relations decisions. A solution\u2014though not immediately effective\u2014might be committing additional resources to increase production. In emergency circumstances, FDA could adapt its facility inspection and application review timetables. It could also contact other manufacturers or consider importing products that have not been approved for U.S. sale. During the recent Ebola outbreak, DOD and HHS funds, as well as those from other countries, have gone to scale up production of drugs and vaccines that are potentially effective against the Ebola virus. Such concentrated investment is less likely for any one of the cancer or Alzheimer's disease drugs in development.", "Liability . In discussing expanded access, some manufacturers have raised liability concerns if patients report injury from the investigational products. In the state right-to-try laws are some attempts to protect manufacturers or clinicians from state medical practice or tort liability laws. If there are legitimate concerns, Congress could consider acting as it has in past, choosing diverse approaches to protect manufacturers, clinicians, and patients in a variety of situations. Whether these concerns become illustrated by court cases and how any issues may be resolved in future laws are beyond the scope of this discussion.", "Limited staff and facility resources. Any energy put into setting up and maintaining a compassionate use program could take away from a company's focus on completing clinical trials, preparing an NDA, and launching a product into the market. While this delay would have bottom-line implications, one CEO, in denying expanded access, portrayed the decision as an equity issue, saying, \"We held firm to the ethical standard that, were the drug to be made available, it had to be on an equitable basis, and we couldn't do anything to slow down approval that will help the hundreds or thousands of [individuals].\" Pointing to ways granting expanded access might divert them from research tasks and postpone approval, he said, \"Who are we to make this decision?\"", "For a small biotech company developing its first commercial product, any diversion of its attention from carrying out the clinical trials that will form the basis of its NDA to FDA could, at best, delay approval and, at worst, allow a competitor to succeed first. However, if the public and Congress perceive a threat to be serious enough, government or private resources could supplement the company's staff and facilities, thereby allowing research to continue while also providing the experimental product to those in need. In less-extreme situations, a manufacturer could (with FDA consultation, perhaps) modify its clinical trial designs to incorporate information gathered from the patients taking the drug through expanded access programs.", "Data for assessing safety and effectiveness . By distributing the drug outside a carefully designed clinical trial, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to collect the data that would validly assess safety and effectiveness. Without those data, a manufacturer would be hampered in presenting evidence of safety and effectiveness when applying to FDA for approval or licensure.", "Disclosure. It is unclear how many people request and are denied expanded access to experimental drugs. This lack of information makes devising solutions to manufacturer-based obstacles difficult. Although FDA reports the number of requests it receives, manufacturers do not. The number of individuals who approach manufacturers is unknown, although some reports suggest that it is much larger than the number of successful requests that then go to FDA.

FDA regulates access mostly through product approval and licensing.

In deadly situations, placebo is often considered unethical. In a deadly situation, though, where available drugs are in short supply, not everyone will receive the drug. A creative design could, within ethical guidelines, either determine who received the drugs or, certainly, keep track of who did and did not receive the drug along with characteristics of the patient, disease stage, and other relevant information. ", "A former FDA Chief Scientist described how lack of data on a new product's use and outcome could lead to a misinterpretation of a product's utility. The illustrative example showed how wrongly thinking a drug was effective and wrongly thinking a drug was not effective could both harm future patients. Upon the American doctor's Ebola-free release from the hospital, the head of the unit that cared for him and the other infected worker said, \"Frankly we do not know if it helped them, made any difference, or even delayed their recovery.\"", "An incorrect assumption of a drug's effectiveness or ineffectiveness might also hurt the larger community, which would lose the opportunity to rigorously assess a drug's safety and effectiveness and then to inform future decisions on whether to use it. Lack of such information could lead to more spending on ineffective or unsafe products in critical situations. Options to solve these issues include emergency use plans that address data collection and explicit decisions about who will have access to those data."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
