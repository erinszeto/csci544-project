In comparison, the Medicare program provided health care benefits to nearly 54 million seniors and certain individuals with disabilities in that same year at a cost of roughly $606 billion to the federal government. Because Medicaid represents a large component of federal mandatory spending, Congress is likely to continue its oversight of Medicaid's eligibility, benefits, and costs.", "Participation in Medicaid is voluntary for states, though all states, the District of Columbia, and the territories choose to participate. The federal government requires states to cover certain mandatory populations and benefits, but the federal government also allows states to cover other optional populations and services. Due to this flexibility, there is substantial variation among the states in terms of factors such as Medicaid eligibility, covered benefits, and provider payment rates. In addition, there are several waiver and demonstration authorities that allow states to operate their Medicaid programs outside of federal rules.", "Historically, Medicaid eligibility generally has been limited to low-income children, pregnant women, parents of dependent children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities; however, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) included the ACA Medicaid expansion, which expands Medicaid eligibility to individuals under the age of 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) (effectively 138% of FPL) at state option.", "The ACA makes a number of other changes, which together represent the most significant reform to the Medicaid program since its establishment in 1965.

", "States must follow broad federal rules to receive federal matching funds, but they have flexibility to design their own versions of Medicaid within the federal statute's basic framework. This flexibility results in variability across state Medicaid programs. Each state has a Medicaid state plan that describes how the state will administer its Medicaid program. States submit these Medicaid state plans to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for approval. ", "Medicaid was designed to provide coverage to groups with a wide range of health care needs that historically were excluded from the private health insurance market (e.g., individuals with disabilities who require LTSS or indigent populations in geographic locations where access to providers is limited). Because of the diversity of the populations that Medicaid serves, Medicaid offers some benefits that typically are not covered by major insurance plans offered in the private market (e.g., nursing facility care or early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment [EPSDT] services). Medicaid also pays for Medicare premiums and/or cost sharing for low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities, who are eligible for both programs and referred to as dual-eligible beneficiaries . For other Medicaid enrollees, out-of-pocket costs generally are nominal, which may not be the case with most employer-sponsored insurance or coverage through health insurance exchanges (also referred to as marketplaces ). The Medicaid program pays for special classes of providers, such as federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health clinics (RHCs), and Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities that provide health care services to populations in areas where access to traditional physician care may be limited. ", "Since its inception, the Medicaid program has expanded in a number of different directions. Federal laws have changed virtually every aspect of the program, affecting eligibility, benefits, beneficiary cost sharing, and fraud and abuse protections, among others. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 as amended) is the most recent federal law to make fundamental revisions to the Medicaid program, including a substantial expansion of Medicaid eligibility that began in 2014. The ACA likely will broaden Medicaid's role in providing health care coverage to the U.S. population and increase the likelihood that, going forward, Congress's attention to health policy issues will involve Medicaid. ", "The ACA was designed to reduce the number of U.S. citizens without health insurance by preserving the existing system of employer-based health insurance, making changes to the individual insurance market, and expanding coverage to the uninsured through Medicaid and health insurance exchanges. Under the ACA, Medicaid and the health insurance exchanges are envisioned to work in tandem to provide a continuous source of subsidized coverage for lower-income individuals and families. Medicaid agencies are required to coordinate with the health insurance exchanges to educate people about new health insurance options and assist them in navigating the enrollment process.", "This report describes the basic elements of Medicaid, focusing on who is eligible, what services are covered, how enrollees share in the cost of care, how the program is financed, and how providers are paid.

These changes necessitated a redesign of the existing Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems for each state.

States use this waiver authority to change eligibility criteria to offer coverage to new groups of people, to provide services that are not otherwise covered, to offer different service packages or a combination of services in different parts of the state, to cap program enrollment, and to implement innovative service delivery systems, among other purposes. Section 1915(b) Managed Care/Freedom of Choice Waivers \u2014Section 1915(b) of the Social Security Act permits states to establish mandatory managed care programs or otherwise limit enrollees' choice of providers. Section 1915(c) Home- and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waivers\u2014 Section 1915(c) authorizes the Secretary of HHS to waive certain requirements of Medicaid law, allowing states to cover a broad range of HCBS (including services not available under the Medicaid state plan) for certain persons with LTSS needs. Specifically, under Section 1915(c) states can waive rules regarding statewideness and comparability of services.

The state agencies involved with program integrity activities include the state Medicaid agencies and the federally required Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs).

States receive higher FMAP rates for selected administrative activities, such as 90% for the startup of MFCUs and 75% for ongoing MFCU operation.", "The ACA included some provisions to increase uniformity among Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP program integrity activities. For instance, the ACA introduced additional provider screening requirements that are applicable to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. The ACA also created an integrated Medicare and Medicaid data repository to enhance program integrity data sharing among federal and state agencies and law-enforcement officials.

The ACA requires most of the individuals covered under the ACA Medicaid expansion to receive ABP coverage (see \" Benefits \" for more information), and the law provides enhanced federal matching rates for coverage of this new eligibility group (see \" Federal Share \" for more information).

However, on June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) v.

If states want to take full advantage of the 100% federal financing for the newly eligible enrollees, however, they must have implemented the expansion on January 1, 2014. The statute explicitly provides the 100% federal funding for the newly eligible enrollees for 2014, 2015, and 2016 rather than for the first three years a state implements the expansion.", "On January 1, 2014, when the ACA Medicaid expansion went into effect, 24 states and the District of Columbia included the ACA Medicaid expansion as part of their Medicaid programs.

", "There are numerous Medicaid eligibility pathways for dual-eligible beneficiaries, but the two main categories of dual-eligible individuals are full dual-eligible beneficiaries and partial dual-eligible beneficiaries. Full dual-eligible beneficiaries receive full benefits from Medicare, and Medicaid provides them with full benefits in addition to financial assistance with their Medicare premiums and cost sharing. Partial dual-eligible beneficiaries receive full benefits from Medicare and financial assistance from Medicaid for Medicare premiums and cost sharing. In FY2011, there were 7.5 million full duals, with Medicaid spending totaling $134.3 billion, and 2.6 million partial duals with $6.0 billion in Medicaid spending.", "Because Medicare and Medicaid are different programs, coordinating care and services for dual-eligible beneficiaries presents challenges. Medicare is a national program administered by CMS, while Medicaid is a federal-state partnership under which each state designs and administers its own version of Medicaid under broad federal rules. Coordination of benefits between these distinct programs is administratively complex. Dual-eligible beneficiaries and their service providers must comply with Medicare and Medicaid program rules and processes, which are not always aligned. In addition, delivery of uncoordinated or poorly coordinated health care and related services can be costly and inefficient, affecting dual-eligible beneficiaries' quality of care and increasing Medicare and Medicaid spending. To reduce spending on dual-eligible beneficiaries and improve the quality of their care, federal and state policymakers are focusing on coordinating care for dual-eligible beneficiaries.", "The ACA established the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office within CMS to improve care coordination for dual-eligible beneficiaries. In addition, the ACA provided CMS with the ability to test innovative payment and service delivery models to improve coordination of care and reduce the cost of dual-eligible beneficiaries.

According to one estimate, approximately 80% of Medicaid enrollees covered by managed care receive coverage from a plan impacted by the ACA fee.", "Some insurance plans have informed shareholders and state insurance regulators that they intend to pass on the cost of the fee to businesses and enrollees in the form of higher premiums. Medicaid MCOs do not have the ability to pass on the cost of the fee to enrollees through higher premiums because few Medicaid enrollees pay premiums and when premiums are charged the federal government requires the premiums to be nominal.", "A number of state governors caution that the ACA health insurance annual fee will result in higher costs to Medicaid. Federal regulations require that the capitated amounts paid to Medicaid MCOs be actuarially sound , which means the state must consider MCOs' costs, including health benefits, marketing and administrative expenses, and taxes.
