The ITGA faces threats to security from three potential directions. ", "First, the country's lack of resources have encouraged a thriving drug trade. Before the Taliban, Afghanistan's majorexport was opium. It produced 75% of the world supply. Under the Taliban, which enforced a ban on opiumcultivation in1999, according to some estimates, opium poppy cultivation dropped from 3,000 tons to 200 tons. However, thesenumbers are deceiving. It is believed that drugs continued to be a lucrative source of income both for the Talibanand theiropponents because large stockpiles built up under Taliban rule, which may well have been intended for the worldmarket,were held back as supply exceeded demand and caused a depression in price. Indeed, this spring may see the largestpoppycrop in recent years. Controlling the drug trade is a huge challenge in a country with few other resources and thepotentialfor profits from heroin on the world market. While the Karzai-led interim government has ordered a ban on theproduction,use, and trafficking of all drugs, the government has little or no power of enforcement. Sources report a recent increase incultivation linked to lawlessness and banditry on the one hand, and the great need among farmers for some formoflivelihood on the other. ", "Second, former combatants can have a direct impact on humanitarian assistance and recovery efforts. If local struggles forpower prevent, delay, or interrupt refugee and IDP returns, this will severely hamper any recovery efforts.

It is estimated that there are still 3 million refugees,mostly in Iran and Pakistan. The approximate number of IDPs remaining to date is roughly 750,000. The totalnumber ofpeople requiring relocation assistance is therefore still considerable. In coordination with government initiatives,UNHCR set up voluntary return programs for refugees.

There is some\"recycling\" ofrefugees-those who repeatedly cross borders for economic and family reasons, flee because of crime and fighting,ormigrate because of lack of food. With no sustainable livelihood, many of these refugees are forced to seekassistance eitherwithin Afghanistan or outside its borders. There is some concern that the budget constraints UNHCR is facing(already ithas had to reduce its welcome home package) may mean inadequate levels of assistance followed by an increasein refugeescrossing back into Pakistan and Iran, repeat migration of former IDPs, or an increase in urban refugees.
