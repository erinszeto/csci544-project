This report focuses on the first component of a CCS system, the CO2 capture process. Unlike the other two components of CCS, transportation and geologic storage, the CO2 capture component of CCS is heavily technology-dependent. For CCS to succeed at reducing CO2 emissions from a significant fraction of large sources in the United States, CO2 capture technologies would need to be deployed widely. Widespread commercial deployment would likely depend, in part, on the cost of the technology deployed to capture CO2. This report assesses prospects for improved, lower-cost technologies for each of the three current approaches to CO2 capture: post-combustion capture; pre-combustion capture; and oxy-combustion capture.", "While all three approaches are capable of high CO2 capture efficiencies (typically about 90%), the major drawbacks of current processes are their high cost and the large energy requirements for operation. Another drawback in terms of their availability for greenhouse gas mitigation is that at present, there are still no full-scale applications of CO2 capture on a coal-fired or gas-fired power plant (i.e., a scale of several hundred megawatts of plant capacity). To address the current lack of demonstrated capabilities for full-scale CO2 capture at power plants, a number of large-scale demonstration projects at both coal combustion and gasification-based power plants are planned or underway in the United States and elsewhere. Substantial research and development (R&D) activities are also underway in the United States and elsewhere to develop and commercialize lower-cost capture systems with smaller energy penalties. Current R&D activities include development and testing of new or improved solvents that can lower the cost of current post-combustion and pre-combustion capture, as well as research on a variety of potential \"breakthrough technologies\" such as novel solvents, sorbents, membranes, and oxyfuel systems that hold promise for even lower-cost capture systems.", "In general, the focus of most current R&D activities is on cost reduction rather than additional gains in the efficiency of CO2 capture (which can result in cost increases rather than decreases). Key questions regarding the outcomes from these R&D efforts are when advanced CO2 capture systems would be available for commercial rollout, and how much cheaper they would be compared to current technology. \"Technology roadmaps\" developed by governmental and private-sector organizations in the United States and elsewhere anticipate that CO2 capture will be available for commercial deployment at power plants by 2020. A number of roadmaps also project that some novel, lower-cost technologies would be commercial in the 2020 time frame. Such projections acknowledge, however, that this would require aggressive and sustained efforts to advance promising concepts to commercial reality.", "Achieving significant cost reductions would likely require not only a vigorous and sustained level of R&D, but also a significant market for CO2 capture technologies to generate a substantial level of commercial deployment. At present such a market does not exist. While various types of incentive programs can accelerate the development and deployment of CO2 capture technology, actions that significantly limit emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere ultimately would be needed to realize substantial and sustained reductions in the future cost of CO2 capture."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congressional interest has grown in carbon capture and sequestration (or carbon capture and storage, CCS) as part of legislative strategies to mitigate global climate change.

The goal of the report is to provide a realistic assessment of prospects for improved, lower-cost technologies for each of the three current approaches to CO 2 capture, namely, post-combustion capture from power plant flue gases using amine-based solvents such as monoethanolamine (MEA) and ammonia; pre-combustion capture (also via chemical solvents) from the synthesis gas produced in an integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant; and oxy-combustion capture, in which high-purity oxygen rather than air is used for combustion in a pulverized coal (PC) power plant to produce a flue gas with a high concentration of CO 2 amenable to capture without a post-combustion chemical process.", "Currently, post-combustion and pre-combustion capture technologies are commercial and widely used for gas stream purification in a variety of industrial processes. Several small-scale installations also capture CO 2 from power plant flue gases to produce CO 2 for sale as an industrial commodity. Oxy-combustion capture, however, is still under development and is not currently commercial.", "The advantages and limitations of each of these three methods are discussed in this report, along with plans for their continued development. While all three approaches are capable of high CO 2 capture efficiencies (typically about 90%), the major drawbacks of current processes are their high cost and the large energy requirement for operation (which significantly reduces the net plant capacity and contributes to the high cost of capture).

To characterize the status of capture technologies and the prospects for their commercial availability, five stages of development are defined in this report: conceptual designs; laboratory or bench scale; pilot plant scale; full-scale demonstration plants; and commercial processes. Current activities at each of these stages are reviewed for each of the three major capture routes.", "Current R&D activities include development and testing of new or improved solvents that can lower the cost of current post-combustion and pre-combustion capture, as well as research on a variety of potential \"breakthrough technologies\" such as novel solvents, sorbents, membranes, and oxyfuel systems that hold promise for even lower-cost capture systems. Most of the latter processes, however, are still in the early stages of research and development (i.e., conceptual designs and laboratory- or bench-scale processes), so that credible estimates of their performance and (especially) cost are lacking at this time. Table 1 lists the major approaches being pursued for post-combustion capture, although many of these approaches apply to pre-combustion and oxy-combustion capture as well.", "Processes under development at the more advanced pilot plant scale are, for the most part, new or improved solvent formulations (such as ammonia and advanced amines) that are undergoing testing and evaluation. These advanced solvents could be available for commercial use within several years if subsequent full-scale testing confirms their overall benefit. Pilot-scale oxy-combustion processes also are currently being tested and evaluated for planned scale-up, while two IGCC power plants in Europe are installing pilot plants to evaluate pre-combustion capture options.", "In general, the focus of most current R&D activities is on cost reduction rather than additional gains in the efficiency of CO 2 capture (which can result in cost increases rather than decreases). A number of R&D programs emphasize the need for lower-cost retrofit technologies suitable for existing power plants. As a practical matter, however, most technologies being pursued to reduce capture costs for new plants also apply to existing plants. Indeed, as the fleet of existing coal-fired power plants continues to age, the size of the potential U.S. retrofit market for CO 2 capture will continue to shrink, as older plants may not be economic to retrofit (although the situation in other countries, especially China, may be quite different)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future Outlook", "paragraphs": ["Whether for new power plants or existing ones, the key questions are the same: When will advanced CO 2 capture systems be available for commercial rollout, and how much cheaper will they be compared to current technology?", "To address the first question, this report reviews a variety of \"technology roadmaps\" developed by governmental and private-sector organizations in the United States and elsewhere. All of these roadmaps anticipate that CO 2 capture will be available for commercial deployment at power plants by 2020. Current commercial technologies like post-combustion amine systems could be available sooner. A number of roadmaps also project that novel, lower-cost technologies like solid sorbent systems for post-combustion capture will be commercial in the 2020 time frame. Such projections acknowledge, however, that this will require aggressive and sustained efforts to advance promising concepts to commercial reality.", "That caveat is strongly supported by a review of experience from other recent R&D programs to develop lower-cost technologies for post-combustion SO 2 and NO x capture at coal-fired power plants. Those efforts typically took two decades or more to bring new concepts (like combined SO 2 and NO x capture processes) to commercial availability. By then, however, the cost advantages initially foreseen for these novel systems had largely evaporated in most cases: the advanced technologies tended to get more expensive as their development progressed (consistent with \"textbook\" descriptions of the innovation process), while the cost of formerly \"high-cost\" commercial technologies gradually declined over time. The absence of a significant market for the novel technologies put them at a further disadvantage. This is similar to the situation for CO 2 capture systems today. Thus, the development of advanced CO 2 capture technologies is not without risks.", "With regard to future cost reductions, the good news based on past experience is that the costs of environmental technologies that succeed in the marketplace tend to fall over time. For example, after an initial rise during the early commercialization period, the cost of post-combustion SO 2 and NO x capture systems declined by 50% or more after about two decades of deployment at coal-fired power plants. This trend is consistent with the \"learning curve\" behavior seen for many other classes of technology. It thus appears reasonable to expect a similar trend for future CO 2 capture costs once these technologies become widely deployed. Note, too, that the cost of CO 2 capture also depends on other aspects of power plant design, financing, and operation\u2014not solely on the cost of the CO 2 capture unit. Future improvements in net power plant efficiency, for example, will tend to lower the unit cost of CO 2 capture.", "Other cost estimates for advanced CO 2 capture systems are based on engineering-economic analysis of proposed system designs. For example, recent studies by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) foresee the cost of advanced PC and IGCC power plants with CO 2 capture falling by 27% and 31%, respectively, relative to current costs as a result of successful R&D programs. No estimates are provided, however, as to when the various improvements described are expected be commercially available. In general, however, the farther away a technology is from commercial reality, the lower its estimated cost tends to be. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in cost estimates for technologies that are not yet commercial, especially those that exist only as conceptual designs.", "More reliable estimates of future technology costs typically are linked to projections of their expected level of commercial deployment in a given time frame (i.e., a measure of their market size). For power plant technologies like CO 2 capture systems, this is commonly expressed as total installed capacity. However, as with other technologies whose sole purpose is to reduce environmental emissions, there is no significant market for power plant CO 2 capture systems absent government actions or policies that effectively create such markets\u2014either through regulations that limit CO 2 emissions, or through voluntary incentives such as tax credits or direct financial subsidies. The technical literature and historical evidence examined in this report strongly link future cost reductions for CO 2 capture systems to their level of commercial deployment. In widely used models based on empirical \"experience curves,\" the latter measure serves as a surrogate for the many factors that influence future technology costs, including the level of R&D expenditures and the new knowledge gained through learning-by-doing (related to manufacturing) and learning-by-using (related to technology use).", "Based on such models, published estimates project the future cost of electricity from power plants with CO 2 capture to fall by as much as 30% below current values after roughly 100,000 megawatts (MW) of capture plant capacity is installed and operated worldwide. That estimate is in line with the DOE projects noted above. If achieved, it would represent a significant decrease from current costs\u2014one that would bring the cost and efficiency of future power plants with CO 2 capture close to that of current plants without capture. For reference, it took approximately 20 years following passage of the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments to achieve a comparable level of technology deployment for SO 2 capture systems at coal-fired power plants.", "Uncertainty estimates for these projections, however, indicate that future cost reductions for CO 2 capture also could be much smaller than indicated above. Thus, whether future cost reductions will meet, exceed, or fall short of current estimates will only be known with hindsight.", "In the context of this report, the key insight governing prospects for improved carbon capture technology is that achieving significant cost reductions will require not only a vigorous and sustained level of R&D, but also a substantial level of commercial deployment. That will necessitate a significant market for CO 2 capture technologies, which can only be established by government actions. At present such a market does not yet exist. While various types of incentive programs can accelerate the development and deployment of CO 2 capture technology, actions that significantly limit emissions of CO 2 to the atmosphere ultimately are needed to realize substantial and sustained reductions in the future cost of CO 2 capture."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2: Background and Scope of Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Global climate change is an issue of major international concern and the focus of proposed mitigation policy measures in the United States and elsewhere.

First is a growing consensus that large reductions in global CO 2 emissions are needed to avoid serious climate change impacts. Because electric power plants are a major source of GHG emissions, their emissions must be significantly curtailed.", "Second is the realization that large emission reductions cannot be achieved easily or quickly simply by using less energy or by replacing fossil fuels with alternative energy sources that emit little or no CO 2 . The reality is that the world (and the United States itself) today relies on fossil fuels for over 85% of its energy use. Changing that picture dramatically will take time. CCS thus offers a way to get large CO 2 reductions from power plants and other industrial sources until cleaner, sustainable technologies can be widely deployed.", "Finally, energy-economic models show that adding CCS to the suite of other GHG reduction measures significantly lowers the cost of mitigating climate change.

Figure 2 illustrates the variety of technical approaches available. The choice of technology depends on the requirements for product purity and on the conditions of the gas stream being treated (such as its temperature, pressure, and CO 2 concentration). Common applications for CO 2 capture systems include the removal of CO 2 impurities in natural gas treatment and the production of hydrogen, ammonia, and other industrial chemicals. In most cases, the captured CO 2 stream is simply vented to the atmosphere. In a few cases it is used in the manufacture of other chemicals.", "CO 2 also has been captured from a portion of the flue gases produced at power plants burning coal or natural gas. Here, the captured CO 2 is sold as a commodity to nearby industries such as food processing plants. Globally, however, only a small amount of CO 2 is utilized to manufacture industrial products and nearly all of it is soon emitted to the atmosphere (for example, from carbonated drinks).", "Since most anthropogenic CO 2 is a by-product of the combustion of fossil fuels, CO 2 capture technologies, when discussed in the context of CCS, are commonly classified as either pre-combustion or post-combustion systems, depending on whether carbon (in the form of CO 2 ) is removed before or after a fuel is burned. A third approach, called oxyfuel or oxy-combustion, does not require a CO 2 capture device. This concept is still under development and is not yet commercial. Other industrial processes that do not involve combustion employ the same types of CO 2 capture systems that would be employed at power plants.", "In all cases, the aim is to produce a stream of pure CO 2 that can be permanently stored or sequestered, typically in a geological formation. This requires high pressures to inject CO 2 deep underground. Thus, captured CO 2 is first compressed to a dense \"supercritical\" state, where it behaves as a liquid that can be readily transported via pipeline and injected into a suitable geological formation. However, the CO 2 compression step is commonly included as part of the capture system, since it is usually located at the industrial plant site where CO 2 is captured."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Post-Combustion Processes", "paragraphs": ["As the name implies, these systems capture CO 2 from the flue gases produced after fossil fuels or other carbonaceous materials (such as biomass) are burned. Combustion-based power plants provide most of the world's electricity today. In a modern coal-fired power plant, pulverized coal (PC) is mixed with air and burned in a furnace or boiler. The heat released by combustion generates steam, which drives a turbine-generator ( Figure 3 ). The hot combustion gases exiting the boiler consist mainly of nitrogen (from air) plus smaller concentrations of water vapor and CO 2 formed from the hydrogen and carbon in the fuel. Additional products formed during combustion from impurities in coal include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter (fly ash). These regulated air pollutants, as well as other trace species such as mercury, must be removed to meet applicable emission standards. In some cases, additional removal of pollutants (especially SO 2 ) is required to provide a sufficiently clean gas stream for subsequent CO 2 capture.", "With current technology, the most effective method of CO 2 capture from the flue gas of a PC plant is by chemical reaction with an organic solvent such as monoethanolamine (MEA), one of a family of amine compounds. In a vessel called an absorber, the flue gas is \"scrubbed\" with an amine solution, typically capturing 85% to 90% of the CO 2 . The CO 2 -laden solvent is then pumped to a second vessel, called a regenerator, where heat is applied (in the form of steam) to release the CO 2 . The resulting stream of concentrated CO 2 is then compressed and piped to a storage site, while the depleted solvent is recycled back to the absorber. Figure 4 shows details of a post-combustion capture system design.", "The same post-combustion capture technology that would be used at a PC plant also would be used for post-combustion CO 2 capture at a natural gas-fired boiler or combined cycle (NGCC) power plant (see Figure 5 ). Although the flue gas CO 2 concentration is more dilute than in coal plants, high removal efficiencies can still be achieved with amine-based capture systems. The absence of impurities in natural gas also results in a clean flue gas stream, so that no additional cleanup is needed for effective CO 2 capture. Further details on the design, performance, and operation of amine-based capture technologies can be found in the technical literature."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pre-Combustion Processes", "paragraphs": ["To remove carbon from fuel prior to combustion, it must first be converted to a form amenable to capture. For coal-fueled plants, this is accomplished by reacting coal with steam and oxygen at high temperature and pressure, a process called partial oxidation, or gasification. The result is a gaseous fuel consisting mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen\u2014a mixture known as synthesis gas, or syngas\u2014which can be burned to generate electricity in a combined cycle power plant similar to the NGCC plant described above. This approach is known as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation. After particulate impurities are removed from the syngas, a two-stage \"shift reactor\" converts the carbon monoxide to CO 2 via a reaction with steam (H 2 O). The result is a mixture of CO 2 and hydrogen. A chemical solvent, such as the widely used commercial product Selexol (which employs a glycol-based solvent), then captures the CO 2 , leaving a stream of nearly pure hydrogen that is burned in a combined cycle power plant to generate electricity, as depicted in Figure 6 .", "Although the fuel conversion steps of an IGCC plant are more elaborate and costly than traditional coal combustion plants, CO 2 separation is much easier and cheaper because of the high operating pressure and high CO 2 concentration of this design. Thus, rather than requiring a chemical reaction to capture CO 2 (as with amine systems in post-combustion capture), the mechanism employed in pre-combustion capture involves physical adsorption onto the surface of a solvent, followed by release of the CO 2 when the sorbent pressure is dropped, typically in several stages, as depicted in Figure 7 .", "Pre-combustion capture also can be applied to power plants using natural gas. As with coal, the raw gaseous fuel is first converted to syngas via reactions with oxygen and steam\u2014a process called reforming. This is again followed by a shift reactor and CO 2 separation, yielding streams of concentrated CO 2 (suitable for storage) and hydrogen. This is the dominant method used today to manufacture hydrogen. If the hydrogen is burned to generate electricity, as in an IGCC plant, we have pre-combustion capture. While pre-combustion CO 2 capture is usually more costly than post-combustion capture for natural gas-fired plants, some power plants of this type have been proposed.

After the particulate matter (fly ash) is removed, the flue gas consists only of water vapor and CO 2 , plus smaller amounts of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ). The water vapor is easily removed by cooling and compressing the flue gas. Additional removal of air pollutants leaves a nearly pure CO 2 stream that can be sent directly to storage, as depicted in Figure 8 .", "The principal attraction of oxy-combustion is that it avoids the need for a costly post-combustion CO 2 capture system. Instead, however, it requires an air separation unit (ASU) to generate the relatively pure (95%-99%) oxygen needed for combustion. Roughly three times more oxygen is needed for oxyfuel systems than for an IGCC plant of comparable size, so the ASU adds significantly to the cost. Typically, additional flue gas processing also is needed to reduce the concentration of conventional air pollutants, so as to comply with applicable environmental standards, or to prevent the undesirable buildup of a substance in the flue gas recycle loop, or to achieve pipeline CO 2 purity specifications (whichever requirement is the most stringent). Because combustion temperatures with pure oxygen are much higher than with air, oxy-combustion also requires a large portion (roughly 70%) of the inert flue gas stream to be recycled back to the boiler in order to maintain normal operating temperatures. To avoid unacceptable levels of oxygen and nitrogen in the flue gas, the system also has to be carefully sealed to prevent any leakage of air into the flue gas. This is a challenge since such leakage commonly occurs at existing power plants at flanges and joints along the flue gas ducts, especially as plants age.", "As a CO 2 capture method, oxy-combustion has been studied theoretically and in experimental laboratory and pilot plant facilities, but not yet at a commercial scale. Thus, a variety of designs have been proposed for commercial systems. Although in principle oxyfuel systems can capture all of the CO 2 produced, the need for additional gas treatment systems decreases the capture efficiency to about 90% in most current designs.", "In principle, oxy-combustion also can be applied to simple cycle and combined cycle power plants fueled by natural gas or distillate oil. These conceptual designs are discussed more fully in \" Chapter 7: Status of Oxy-Combustion Capture .\" As a practical matter, however, they would require significant and costly modifications to the design of current gas turbines and other plant equipment, with relatively limited market potential for greenhouse gas abatement.

This energy \"penalty\" lowers the overall (net) plant efficiency and significantly increases the net cost of CO 2 capture. Table 2 shows that of the three CO 2 capture approaches discussed earlier, post-combustion capture on PC plants is the most energy-intensive, requiring nearly twice the energy per net unit of electricity output as pre-combustion capture on an IGCC plant.", "Lower plant efficiency means that more fuel is needed to generate electricity relative to a similar plant without CO 2 capture. For coal combustion plants, this means that proportionally more solid waste is produced and more chemicals, such as ammonia and limestone, are needed (per unit of electrical output) to control NO x and SO 2 emissions. Plant water use also increases significantly because of the additional cooling water needed for current amine capture systems. Because of the efficiency loss, a capture system that removes 90% of the CO 2 from the plant flue gas winds up reducing the net (avoided) emissions per kilowatt-hour (kWh) by a smaller amount, typically 85% to 88%.", "In general, the higher the power plant efficiency, the smaller is the energy penalty and its associated impacts. For this reason, replacing or repowering an old, inefficient plant with a new, more efficient unit with CO 2 capture can still yield a net efficiency gain that decreases all plant emissions and resource consumption. Thus, the net impact of the CO 2 capture energy penalty must be assessed in the context of a particular situation or strategy for reducing CO 2 emissions. Innovations that raise the efficiency of power generation also can reduce the impacts and cost of carbon capture. Table 3 shows that the overall energy requirements for PC and IGCC plants is divided between electricity needed to operate fans, pumps, and CO 2 compressors, plus thermal energy requirements (or losses) for solvent regeneration (PC plants) and the water-gas shift reaction (IGCC plants). Thermal energy requirements are clearly the largest source of net power losses and the priority area for research to reduce those losses.

For example, higher plant efficiency, larger plant size, higher fuel quality, lower fuel cost, higher annual hours of operation, longer operating life, and lower cost of capital all reduce both the cost of electricity and the unit cost of CO 2 capture. Assumptions about the CO 2 capture system design and operation also contribute to variations in the overall cost. Assumptions vary across the set of studies cited. Since no single set of assumptions applies to all situations or all parts of the world, there is no single estimate for the cost of CO 2 capture. Indeed, the cost ranges would be even broader if other factors such as a larger range of boiler efficiencies or coal types were considered.", "On a relative basis, CCS is estimated to increase the cost of generating electricity by approximately 60% to 80% at new coal combustion plants and by about 30% to 50% at new coal gasification plants. On an absolute basis, the increased cost translates to roughly $40-$70/MWh for supercritical (SCPC) coal plants and $30-$50/MWh for IGCC plants using bituminous coal. As noted earlier, the CO 2 capture step (which includes CO 2 compression) accounts for 80% to 90% of this cost.", " Figure 9 also can be used to calculate the cost per tonne of CO 2 avoided for a plant with capture relative to one without. This cost is equivalent to the \"carbon price\" or CO 2 emissions tax above which the CCS plant is more economical than the plant without capture. For new supercritical coal plants this is currently about $60-$80/tonne CO 2 . For IGCC plants with and without CCS, the avoidance cost is smaller, about $30-$50/tonne CO 2 . Since the cost of CO 2 avoided depends on the choice of \"reference plant\" with no CCS, it is also useful to compare an IGCC plant with capture to a SCPC reference plant without capture. In this case, the cost of CO 2 avoided is roughly $40-$60/tonne CO 2 . In all cases, costs are lower if the CO 2 can be sold for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with subsequent geological storage.

A major contributing factor is the lower thermal efficiency typical of existing (subcritical) power plants, which results in a larger energy penalty and higher capital cost per unit of capacity. Other factors include the added capital costs due to physical constraints and site access difficulties during construction of a retrofit project, plus the likely need for upgrades or installation of additional equipment, such as more efficient SO 2 scrubbers.

Higher amine concentrations are beneficial in reducing the large energy penalty of CO 2 capture, since there is less water in the solution that needs to be pumped and heated in the regeneration process. Capital cost is also less, since higher amine concentrations lead to smaller equipment sizes. On the other hand, amines such as MEA are highly corrosive, so higher amine concentrations require chemical additives or more costly construction materials to prevent corrosion. Tradeoffs among these factors underlie some of the differences in capture system designs offered by different vendors.

Sorbent materials also have lower heat capacity than solvents and thus require less regeneration energy to change their temperature.", "A challenge, however, is how to efficiently get heat into and out of a solid sorbent material. More complicated solids handling equipment also is required compared to solvent solutions, which simply require pumps. In this regard, resistance to physical attrition and deterioration over time is another important property for most solid sorbent applications. Finally, it is not yet clear which of several different absorber designs that can utilize solid sorbents (e.g., fluidized beds, packed bed reactors, transport reactors, or other systems) will be most effective in reducing overall cost.", "In general, the aim of solid sorbent research is to reduce the cost of CO 2 capture by designing durable sorbents with efficient materials handling schemes, increased CO 2 carrying capacity, lower regeneration energy requirements, faster reaction rates and minimum pressure drops. The CO 2 carrying capacity is a key sorbent parameter that depends on the total microscopic surface area of the material. Researchers are thus attempting to identify and design sorbents with very high surface area for CO 2 capture. The capture mechanism can be either a chemical or physical surface interaction. Solid sorbents that rely on chemical mechanisms are similar to liquid solvents.

Two important physical parameters of a membrane are its selectivity and permeability. Selectivity reflects the extent to which a membrane allows some molecules to be transported across the material, but not others. For post-combustion CO 2 capture, the selectivity to CO 2 over N 2 (the main constituent of flue gas) determines the purity of the captured CO 2 stream. The permeability of a membrane reflects the amount of a given substance that can be transported for a given pressure difference. This determines the membrane surface area needed to separate and capture a given amount of CO 2 .", "Among the current laboratory- and bench-scale developments in this area, researchers at the University of Mexico are attempting to incorporate amine functional groups into membrane materials\u2014a development that could help raise the selectivity of CO 2 . Another active research area is gas absorption membranes. Here, CO 2 -laden flue gases contact one side of a membrane while a liquid solvent (such as an amine-based solvent) contacts the other side.

The overall cost of this system is highly dependent on the market value of the ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate byproducts that are produced, as well as on the cost of ammonia, the key reagent for the process.

The furnace limestone injection process promised to be such a technology. Limestone sorbent would be injected directly into the furnace and react with sulfur oxides to achieve only moderate removal efficiencies, but at very low cost. The method was first tested by Wisconsin Power in 1967. In the 1980s and 1990s, DOE supported two methods of furnace sorbent injection (called LIFAC and LIMB), as seen in Figure 40 .", "The LIFAC process combined limestone injection with a humidification system to capture SO 2 . First developed by the Tampella Company in 1983, it was later tested at a commercial scale in Finland. DOE supported demonstrations in the United States starting in 1990, achieving 70% to 80% sulfur removal rates. The LIMB (limestone injection with multi-stage burners) process was first developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It achieved fairly low (approximately 50%) SO 2 removal using limestone, with somewhat higher capture efficiencies using more expensive lime sorbents. Testing of both processes encountered failures of the electrostatic precipitator at the test plants due to the larger volume of solids being collected. Technical solutions added to the cost. The LIFAC process was eventually used commercially at nine facilities outside the United States, but neither LIFAC nor LIMB was adopted commercially for SO 2 control in the United States following the large-scale demonstrations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Duct Sorbent Injection Process", "paragraphs": ["Duct sorbent injection (DSI) is another post-combustion SO 2 capture concept similar to furnace limestone injection, except that the sorbent is injected into the flue gas duct after the boiler where temperatures are lower and physical access is generally easier. This was proposed as a simpler and more cost-effective method of achieving modest SO 2 reductions at existing power plants. Figure 41 shows the process development timeline.", "Babcock and Wilcox began work on a DSI system in 1980 for their SOx-NOx-ROx-BOx (SNRB) combined pollutant control system, which DOE tested 12 years later. Pilot and demonstration projects of DSI for SO 2 capture during the 1980s and early 1990s achieved capture rates rarely exceeding 40% with calcium-based sorbents. Costs and technical complexity were similar to the more effective furnace injection systems. Subsequent process modifications improved the SO 2 capture efficiency, but at a higher cost. There were no commercial adoptions of DSI following the DOE test programs.", "In 1996, DSI was retooled for use in mercury control. It developed into the TOXECON process, which was tested at full scale in 2003, achieving 90% capture of flue gas mercury.

The first is the importance of markets for these environmental technologies. Just as with advanced CO 2 capture systems today, at the time they were being developed there were no requirements for (hence, no significant markets for) high-efficiency combined SO 2 -NO x capture systems, or moderately efficient SO 2 removal systems. This factor alone posed high risks for their commercial success. While that was consistent with the DOE mission to pursue high-risk, high-payoff technologies, the high payoffs that were projected never materialized\u2014in large part because the markets for these technologies failed to develop as expected. Similar risks face advanced carbon capture technologies today.", "As shown in the figures above, the time required to develop a novel capture process from concept to large-scale demonstration was typically two decades or more. During this period the projected economic benefits of the advanced technologies tended to shrink. Not only did their cost tend to rise during the development process (as suggested earlier in Figure 26 ), but the cost of competing options also fell. Thus, the continual deployment and improvement of commercial FGD systems (mainly in the United States) and SCR systems (in Japan and Germany) during the 1980s made it increasingly difficult for combined SO 2 -NO x capture technologies to enter and compete in the marketplace. Indeed, in the United States, there was no market for post-combustion NO x capture at coal-burning plants until the mid-1990s. In the case of furnace and duct sorbent injection processes for moderate levels of SO 2 capture, the anticipated market for such an option did materialize in the United States with passage of the acid rain provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. However, switching to low-sulfur coal proved to be an easier and more economical choice than sorbent injection, especially as low-sulfur western coals entered the marketplace.", "In terms of additional lessons learned, the above discussion suggests that the lengthy time historically required to develop advanced environmental technologies tends to diminish the probability of commercial success, as more mature technologies gain initial market share (assuming the existence of a market). Thus, any efforts that can accelerate the development process can help reduce the commercial risks. Apropos of that, another lesson drawn from this experience is that current commercial technologies do not \"stand still\" (as is often assumed by proponents of new technologies). Advancements in current systems also must be anticipated to more realistically assess the prospects and potential payoffs of advanced technologies that are still under development."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Pace of Capture Technology Deployment", "paragraphs": ["Historical rates of deployment for other power plant environmental technologies can serve as a useful guide for realistically assessing current projections for CCS technologies.", " Figure 42 shows the trends in deployment of post-combustion capture systems for SO 2 and NO x from 1970 to 2000. For FGD systems, the maximum rate of deployment in response to new environmental policy requirements over this period was approximately 15 GW per year (in Germany), with an average rate of about 8 GW per year worldwide. For SCR systems, the maximum rate was about 10 GW per year (again in Germany), with an average global deployment rate of about 5 GW per year. These results suggests that deployment scenarios for CO 2 capture systems that significantly exceed these rate may be unrealistic or will require aggressive new efforts and measures to achieve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rates of Performance and Cost Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Studies also have documented the historical rates of improvement in the performance (capture efficiency) of power plant emission control systems and their rates of cost reduction following commercialization. For example, Figure 43 shows the trend in average SO 2 capture efficiency for power plant FGD systems coming online from 1969 to 1995. Capture efficiencies increased from about 70% to 95% over that period due to the combined effects of technology improvements and regulatory requirements. Since that time the performance of wet FGD systems has continued to improve, with new systems today capturing 98% to 99% or more of the SO 2 . These deep levels of sulfur removal now can facilitate post-combustion CO 2 capture systems, which require inlet SO 2 concentrations as low as one part per million for some commercial amine-based systems. These data, as well as other historical trends of increasing capture efficiencies for power plant particulates and SO 2 and NO x emissions, suggest the potential for future improvements in commercial CO 2 capture systems as well.", " Figure 44 shows the historical trends in capital costs for FGD and SCR systems on standardized coal-fired power plants in the United States. In both cases, the actual or estimated capital cost (as well as O&M costs) increased during the early commercialization of these technologies in order to achieve the levels of availability and performance required for utility operations. Subsequently, costs declined considerably with increasing deployment. On average, the capital cost of these technologies fell by 13% for each doubling of total installed capacity.

This is true as well for CO 2 capture technologies. The adoption and diffusion of a technology also are key elements of the innovation process that improves performance of a product and reduces its cost over time, as depicted earlier in Figure 10 . R&D plays a critical role in this process. But R&D alone is not sufficient without a market for the technology.", "For environmental technologies such as CO 2 capture and storage systems, few if any markets exist in the absence of government actions and policies. What electric utility company, for example, would want to spend a large sum of money to install CCS\u2014even with an improved lower-cost capture process\u2014if there is no requirement or incentive to reduce CO 2 emissions? A costly action such as this provides little or no economic value to the company\u2014indeed, the added cost and energy penalty of CO 2 capture increase the cost of operation. Only if a government action either required CO 2 capture and storage, or made it financially worthwhile to reduce CO 2 emissions, would a sizeable market be created for technologies that enable such reductions.", "Thus, as with other environmental emissions that affect the public welfare, government actions are needed to create or enhance markets for CO 2 emission-reducing technologies.", "Different policy measures influence markets in different ways. Measures such as government loan guarantees, tax credits, direct financial subsides, and R&D funding can help create markets by providing incentives for technology development, deployment, and diffusion. Voluntary incentives such as these are commonly referred to as \"technology policy\" measures. In contrast, regulatory policies such as an emissions cap, emissions tax, or performance standards that limit emissions to specified levels are mandatory, not voluntary. These policies create or expand markets for lower-emission technologies by imposing requirements that can be met only\u2014or most economically\u2014by the use of a low-emission technology.", "Through their influence on markets for environmental technologies (like CO 2 capture and storage systems), government actions also are a critical element of the technological innovation process. Studies of past measures to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from U.S. power plants have documented the ability of regulatory policies to influence both the magnitude and direction of efforts to develop new or improved capture technologies. Figure 45 and Figure 46 , for example, show the century-scale trends in U.S. patenting activity for SO 2 reduction technologies and post-combustion NO x capture systems, respectively. In both cases, the number of new patents filed\u2014a measure of \"inventive activity\"\u2014increased dramatically when new environmental regulations that required or incentivized the use of these technologies came into force. (In the case of NO x control, such regulations for coal plants came first in Japan and Germany; U.S. regulations lagged by more than a decade.)

Toward that end, the report first described each of the three current approaches to CO 2 capture, namely, post-combustion capture from power plant flue gases using amine-based solvents such as monoethanolamine (MEA); pre-combustion capture (also via chemical solvents) from the synthesis gas produced in an integrated coal gasification combined cycle power plant; and oxy-combustion capture, in which high-purity oxygen is used for combustion to produce a flue gas with high CO 2 concentration amenable to capture without a post-combustion chemical process.", "Currently, post-combustion and pre-combustion capture technologies are commercial and widely used for gas stream purification in a variety of industrial processes, including several small-scale installations on power plant flue gases that produce commodity CO 2 for sale. Oxy-combustion capture is still under development and is not currently commercial. The advantages and limitations of each of these three methods are discussed in this report, along with plans for their continued development and demonstration in large-scale power plant applications.", "While all three approaches are capable of high CO 2 capture efficiencies (typically about 90%), major drawbacks of current processes are their high cost and large energy requirements for operation (which contribute significantly to the high cost). This is especially true for the combustion-based capture processes, which have the highest incremental cost relative to a similar plant without CO 2 capture.", "Also discussed in this report are the substantial R&D activities underway in the United States and elsewhere to develop and commercialize improved solvents that can lower the cost of current post-combustion capture processes, as well as research on a variety of potential \"breakthrough technologies\" such as novel solvents, sorbents, membranes, and oxyfuel systems that hold promise for lower-cost capture systems. Most of these processes, however, are still in the early stages of research and development (i.e., conceptual designs and laboratory- or bench-scale processes), so that credible estimates of their performance and (especially) cost are lacking at this time. Even with an aggressive development schedule, the commercial availability of these technologies, should they prove successful, is at least a decade away based on past experience.", "Processes at the more advanced pilot plant scale are, for the most part, new or improved solvent formulations (such as ammonia and advanced amines) that are undergoing testing and evaluation. These advanced solvents could be available for commercial use within several years if subsequent full-scale testing confirms their overall benefit. Pilot-scale oxy-combustion processes also are currently being tested and evaluated for planned scale-up, while in Europe two IGCC plants are installing pilot plants to evaluate pre-combustion capture options.", "At the moment, however, there are still no full-scale applications of CO 2 capture at a coal-based power plant, although a number of demonstration projects are planned or underway in the United States and other countries. Capture projects for other types of industrial facilities also are planned.", "In general, the focus of most current R&D activities is on cost reduction rather than additional gains in the efficiency of CO 2 capture (which can often result in higher overall cost). While a number of programs emphasize the need for lower-cost retrofit technologies suitable for existing power plants, as a practical matter these same technologies are being pursued to reduce capture costs for new plant applications as well. Indeed, as the fleet of existing coal-fired power plants continues to age, the size of the potential U.S retrofit market for CO 2 capture will continue to shrink, as older plants may not be economic to retrofit (although the situation in other countries, especially China, may be quite different).", "Whether for new power plants or existing ones, the key questions are, when will advanced CO 2 capture systems be available for commercial rollout, and how much cheaper will they be compared to current technology?", "All of the technology roadmaps reviewed in this report anticipate that CO 2 capture will be available for commercial deployment at power plants by 2020. For current commercial technologies like post-combustion amine systems, this is a conservative estimate, since the key requirement is for scale-up and demonstration at a full-size power plant\u2014achievable well before 2020. A number of roadmaps also project that novel, lower-cost technologies like solid sorbent systems for post-combustion capture also will be commercial in the 2020 time frame. Such projections acknowledge, however, that this will require aggressive and sustained efforts to advance promising concepts to commercial reality.", "That caveat is strongly supported by our review of recent experience from R&D programs to develop lower-cost technologies for post-combustion SO 2 and NO x capture at coal-fired power plants. Those efforts typically took two decades or more to bring a new concept (like combined SO 2 and NO x capture systems) to commercial availability. By then, the cost advantage initially foreseen had largely evaporated: advanced technologies tended to get more expensive as the development process progressed (consistent with \"textbook\" descriptions of the innovation process), while the cost of formerly \"high-cost\" commercial options gradually declined over time. In a number of cases, the absence of a market for the advanced technology (as is currently the case for CO 2 capture systems) put it at a further disadvantage.", "The good news based on past experience is that the costs of environmental technologies that succeed in the marketplace tend to fall over time. For example, after an initial rise during the early commercialization period, the cost of post-combustion SO 2 and NO x capture systems declined by 50% or more after about two decades of deployment at coal-fired power plants. This trend is consistent with the \"learning curve\" behavior seen for many other classes of technology. It thus appears reasonable to expect a similar trend for future CO 2 capture costs once these technologies become widely deployed. This report also notes that the cost of CO 2 capture also depends strongly on other aspects of power plant design, financing, and operation\u2014not solely on the cost of the CO 2 capture unit. Future improvements in net power plant efficiency, for example, will tend to lower the unit cost of CO 2 capture.", "Some estimates of future electricity generation costs for advanced power plant designs with CO 2 capture and storage offer even more optimistic forecasts of potential cost reductions from advanced technologies. In general, however, the further away a technology is from commercial reality, the lower its estimated cost. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in the projected cost of technologies that are not yet commercial, especially those that exist only as conceptual designs.", "More reliable estimates of future technology costs typically are linked to projections of their expected level of commercial deployment in a given time frame (i.e., a measure of their market size). For power plant technologies like CO 2 capture systems, this is commonly expressed as total installed capacity. However, as with other technologies whose sole purpose is to control environmental emissions, there is no significant market for power plant CO 2 capture systems absent government actions or policies that effectively create such markets\u2014either through regulations that limit CO 2 emissions or through voluntary incentives for its use. The historical evidence and technical literature examined in this report strongly link future cost reductions to the level of commercial deployment of a technology. In empirical \"experience curve\" models, the latter measure serves as a surrogate for the many factors that influence future costs, including expenditures for R&D and the knowledge gained through learning-by-doing (related to manufacturing) and learning-by-using (related to technology use).", "Based on such models, published estimates project the future cost of electricity from power plants with CO 2 capture to fall by up to 30% below current values after roughly 100,000 MW of capture plant capacity has been installed and operated worldwide. That would represent a significant decrease from current costs\u2014one that would bring the cost and efficiency of future power plants with CO 2 capture close to that of current plants without capture. For reference, it took approximately 20 years following passage of the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments to achieve a comparable level of technology deployment for SO 2 capture systems at coal-fired power plants.", "Uncertainty estimates for these projections, however, indicate that future cost reductions for CO 2 capture also could be much smaller than indicated above. Thus, whether future cost reductions will meet, exceed, or fall short of current estimates will only be known with hindsight.", "In the context of this report, the key insight governing prospects for improved carbon capture technology is that achieving significant cost reductions will require not only a vigorous and sustained level of R&D, but also a substantial level of commercial deployment. That will require a significant market for CO 2 capture technologies, which can only be established by government actions. At present such a market does not yet exist. While various types of incentive programs can accelerate the development and deployment of CO 2 capture technology, actions that significantly limit emissions of CO 2 to the atmosphere ultimately are needed to realize substantial and sustained reductions in the future cost of CO 2 capture."], "subsections": []}]}}
