The CRP's original aim was notonly to reduce soil erosion but also to protect soil productivity, control surplus production, andstabilize land prices (which were declining in the mid 1980s). CRP now has a broaderenvironmental focus. Since 1990, FSA has evaluated bids to enroll land in CRP based on anEnvironmental Benefits Index (EBI) score, which reflects the impact enrollment would have onvarious environmental measures (ground water and surface water quality, wind erosion, wildlifehabitat, etc).

WRP,administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), provides long-term protectionto agricultural wetlands by requiring participants to implement approved wetland restoration andprotection plans.

The newest of these, the Conservation Security Program, targets environmental problems on farms,while the others aim to create habitat or preserve especially valuable farmland.

EQIP provides cost-sharing and technical assistance forimplementing specific conservation measures (such as installing buffer strips near streams) toremedy environmental problems on farms and may also provide incentive payments, all toencourage producers to adopt certain practices, so producers can keep lands in production rather thanretiring them. NRCS distributes funds at the national level based on national environmentalpriorities, including reduction of nonpoint source pollution, reduction of air pollution and controlof soil erosion.

The landowner must also implement a conservationplan to reduce soil erosion on any highly erodible land.

This is in contrast to EQIP, whichhelps producers address existing environmental problems. This contrast has caused some analyststo characterize CSP as the most comprehensive U.S. \"green payments\" program. The eligibilitycriteria for CSP reward a producer's historic record of conservation and provide incentives to domore conservation in the future. It uses a three-tiered system that rewards increased levels ofconservation on enrolled lands with increased payments. For the lowest level -- protecting onenatural resource on part of their operation -- producers may earn up to $20,000 annually, while forthe highest level -- protecting all natural resources on all of their operation -- producers may earn upto $45,000 annually. ", "Although CSP was designed to be a true entitlement and widely available for many types ofagricultural operations, the Bush Administration is implementing the program with additionaleligibility criteria designed to reward only the highest levels of conservation, and only in designatedwatersheds (which change from year to year). Congress has contributed to the limitations byrepeatedly reprogramming funds that had been destined for CSP to other purposes such as disasterrelief, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Under the system, farms receiving over EUR 5000 a year in direct payments willhave those payments reduced (i.e., modulated) by 3% in 2005, 4% in 2006, and 5% from 2007onward.

Within the rural development spending category,agri-environmental programs compete with rural restructuring (e.g., investment aids) and non-farmrural economy programs (e.g., agri-tourism or village renewal).

Nevertheless, an idea of how much is spent on this categoryof programs is included in the EU's notification to the WTO of domestic support for agriculture in2000-2001 (marketing year), the most recent year available. (35) The EU reports spendingby the EU and its member states of EUR 5.7 billion for \"protection of the environment andpreservation of the countryside, control of soil erosion, extensification, aid for environmentallysensitive areas; support and protection of organic production by creating conditions for faircompetition; aid for forestry measures in agriculture; (and) conservation of genetic resources inagriculture.\" In contrast, the United States, in its WTO notification, reports spending of $2.7 billionfor various environmental programs in its 2000-2001 notification. (36) "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["This review of U.S. and EU current agri-environmental policies reveals both similarities anddifferences (see Table 4 following this section). Many of the major environmental topics dealt withby U.S. and EU policy and programs are much the same -- soil and water quality, wildlife habitat,farmland preservation and protection, and wetlands protection and restoration, but how they areaddressed is different in many significant ways. One major difference is the extent to whichcross-compliance measures are used in relation to receipt of commodity support payments. AlthoughU.S. agri-environmental policy has emphasized voluntary participation, farmers or ranchers witherodible lands or wetlands must comply with cross-compliance measures as a condition for receivingcommodity payments. In the EU, on the other hand, all farms (as of January 1, 2005) are requiredto meet certain statutory environmental management requirements and observe \"good agriculturaland environmental practices\" in order to receive support payments (provided as a single farmpayment). (37) ", "In the United States, the federal government is primarily responsible for programadministration and funding. It provides technical assistance and financial or cost-sharing assistancedeveloping and implementing conservation plans. In contrast, EU member states are primarilyresponsible for administering agri-environmental programs which are co-financed generously by theEuropean Commission. Farmers receive technical assistance to enable them to meet the compulsoryagri-environmental standards and financial aid as they implement activities to meet the standards. ", "In the United States, integrating agri-environmental programs with rural development policyand shifting funds from commodity to agri-environmental efforts are at issue. To date, United Statespolicy makers have not chosen to make this linkage or to transfer funds. EU policymakers seem tohave made a decision to integrate agri-environmental programs into a broad rural developmentpolicy. The EU, as part of its most recent reform of the CAP, has also made a policy decision to shiftincreasing amounts of funds from commodity to agri-environmental support. Part of the differencebetween the United States and the EU with respect to funding derives from different approaches tobudgeting for agricultural programs in the EU and the United States. While the EU operates on aseven-year fixed budget for agriculture (with inflation factors built in), the United States operateswith budgets decided in annual appropriations legislation, although programs are authorized formulti-year periods.", "Further developments in agri-environmental policy in both the United States and the EU willlikely depend at least in part on outcomes from ongoing multilateral agricultural trade negotiations. If these negotiations result in further restrictions on trade-distorting domestic commodity support,farmers, ranchers, and policymakers may view increased funding for green payments as an attractivealternative for providing support to agriculture. If further restrictions are required, it seems morelikely that the United States and the EU will look at the other's policies and experiences moreclosely. If such an examination demonstrates that historic and current differences are extensive anddifficult to overcome, it may be that a broad and imprecise definition of green payments will servethe interests of diverse parties who participate in farm policy debates. ", "For U.S. policy, the status of these negotiations in early 2007, when crafting the next farmbill is likely to start in earnest, will be particularly important because designers of this legislation andinterest groups will likely give the status and direction of these negotiations strong consideration asthey contemplate farm bill options. If the outcome of the negotiations is uncertain while the farmbill is being debated, this uncertainty will compound the intensity of the debate, and possibly resultin the inclusion of language in legislation giving the Department greater flexibility inimplementation. ", "Congressional discussion of green payments may become contentious for other reasons aswell. One source of that contention may be the translation of the concept into policies and programs. Most interests involved in farm policy who have expressed an opinion support the general conceptof green payments. But as the discussions become more specific, participants may find that theyhave different views about program design, funding allocations, administrative responsibilities andsimilar questions, making it difficult to hold together coalitions of supporters. Among the mostdifficult of these questions may be deciding whether such a program should include a significantincome support component and contribute to the \"bottom line\" of each participant, or should it belimited to covering costs to install and maintain conservation practices. A related question may bedeciding what is to be accomplished through a green payment approach. Some may view it asmeeting international obligations, and seek a minimal program with limited impact to currentdomestic efforts, while others may view it is a major new and positive direction in farm policy, andseek to make it large and far-reaching. One aspect of discussing these options may be over whetherpayments should be based on cost-sharing for individual practices, which has a long history inagri-environmental policies, or on the level of improved environmental performance that results frominstalling practices. ", "Consideration of green payments may also include a debate over questions of scale. To thispoint, all conservation programs are implemented at the scale of an individual farm. Green paymentscould include additional incentives for coordinated and collective action that have much largercumulative benefits than actions on individual farms are likely to result in. Such programs could bedesigned around the magnitude of the benefits that the group provides, and grow or shrink for allmembers of the group as the participation, and therefore the benefits, change. ", "Differences between the United States and the EU in how green payments have been definedand translated into policy and programs may make consideration of EU agri-environmental policyas a model or source of ideas problematic. Some aspects of EU policy, e.g., compulsorycross-compliance with agri-environmental measures as a condition for receiving price and incomesupport, differ substantially from historical U.S. practice, in which cross-compliance has been farmore sparingly applied. Spending on agri-environmental programs in the United States has beenrelatively less than in the EU, both as a portion of total federal spending for agriculture and as anamount spent. Identifying sources of increased funding for agri-environmental programs, even inthe context of possible new WTO restrictions on other forms of farm support, might still be difficultgiven projected budget deficits. Even with new multilateral restrictions on farm subsidies,agri-environmental programs might compete unfavorably with the more conventional forms of farmsupport or with other WTO-compatible programs. Apart from funding considerations, a consensusfor linking agri-environment and rural development with more traditional farm program measureshas not emerged in the United States as it apparently has in the EU. So the extent to which EUagri-environmental policy could serve as a model or source of ideas for U.S. agri-environmentalpolicy remains to be seen. ", " Table 4.
