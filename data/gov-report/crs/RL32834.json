Thus far in the 109thCongress, the Senate Finance Committee has reported S. 667 ( S.Rept. 109-51 ). A billintroduced by House Republican leaders, H.R. 240 , has received approval from theHouse Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Human Resources.", "S. 667 and H.R. 240 are very similar in terms of how they wouldcontinue funding under the TANF program. Both bills extend basic TANF funding at current levels($16.6 billion for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories) through FY2010 andextend supplemental grants provided to 17 states through FY2009. Both bills provide new,categorical grants for marriage promotion activities totaling $200 million per year financed througha reduction in current TANF bonuses to states. The major difference in the TANF fundingprovisions of the two bills is how they provide extra contingency (recession-related) funding to thestates. H.R. 240 essentially extends the current law fund that provides matchinggrants to states experiencing high and increased unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads. S. 667 eliminates the requirement that states expend additional money to accesscontingency funds, and instead bases extra funding on the cost of increased caseloads for states thatmeet revised unemployment or food stamp caseload criteria.", "The two bills would substantially revise the TANF work participation standards that statesmust meet. Under current law, 50% of TANF families with an adult or minor household head mustparticipate, though the 50% rate is reduced by caseload reductions that have occurred since welfarereform. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 would raise this standard to 70%,though under both bills the standard could be reduced through credits (though the credits differbetween the two bills). Both also eliminate a separate 90% participation rate requirement fortwo-parent families. Both bills would raise the minimum hours required of family members in orderto be considered full participants, though H.R. 240 would raise them by morethan would S. 667. The bills also differ in the activities countable toward theparticipation standards: H.R. 240 narrows the list of activities countable,requiring recipients to spend at least 24 hours in work, community service, or work experienceprograms except for a short (usually three-month) period when states may themselves define whatcounts as \"activities.\" S. 667 keeps all activities under current law as countable, andallows states to count a wider range of activities for three months (more under some circumstances).", "Both bills contain non-TANF provisions relating to child support enforcement, responsible\"fatherhood\" programs, and transitional medical assistance (not addressed herein).

Both bills also raise TANF work participationstandards, though the two differ in terms of how much more work would be required and whatactivities count toward the participation standards. This report provides a comparison of the TANFprovisions of S. 667 and H.R. 240. It does not address non-TANF provisionsof both bills, such as revisions to the Child Care and Development Fund, Child SupportEnforcement, Abstinence Education, and transitional Medicaid. One of the key differences betweenS. 667 and H.R. 240 is the level of funding for child care. S. 667would add $6 billion over five years to current levels of mandatory child care funding. H.R.240 would add $1 billion over five years above current levels of mandatory child carefunding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TANF Funding Provisions", "paragraphs": ["S. 667 and H.R. 240 have very similar funding provisions, althoughthey do differ in some details. The major difference in the funding provision between the two billsis that S. 667 would completely revamp the TANF contingency (recession) funds, whileH.R. 240 would make relatively minor revisions to the fund.", "Basic Funding. The 1996 welfare reform law( P.L. 104-193 ) entitled states to a basic TANF block grant equal to peak expenditures in the pre-1996welfare programs during the FY1992 to FY1995 period. It also established a maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement that states continue to spend at least 75% (80% if a state failed TANF workparticipation requirements) of what they spent in these programs in FY1994. Cash welfare caseloadswere at their peak in the mid-1990s; both the basic TANF grant and the MOE are legislatively fixed: they did not change when cash welfare caseloads declined in the mid- and late-1990s, nor did theyincrease when caseloads in some states increased during the recent economic slump. Neither thebasic TANF block grant nor the MOE have been adjusted for inflation.", "Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 would continue both the basic blockgrant and the MOE at their current funding levels (without inflation or caseload adjustment) throughFY2010.", "Supplemental Grants. During the considerationof legislation that led to the 1996 welfare law, fixed funding based on historical expenditures wasthought to disadvantage two groups of states: (1) those that experience relatively high populationgrowth; and (2) those that had historically low grant levels relative to poverty in the state. Therefore,additional funding in the form of supplemental grants was provided to states that met criteria of highpopulation growth and/or low historic grants per poor person. Supplemental grants have beenprovided to 17 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, andUtah.", "Currently, supplemental grants total $319 million per year. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 would continue supplemental grants for the same 17 states at the current funding level through FY2009 (unlike other grants, which expire in FY2010).", "Contingency Funds. The fixed basic grant underTANF also led to concerns of inadequate funding during economic downturns. TANF includes acontingency fund, which is designed to provide extra matching grants to states that meet criteria ofeconomic need (based on unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads) and have stateexpenditures in excess of their FY1994 level.", "The two bills differ substantially in their revisions to the TANF contingency fund. H.R. 240 would continue the fund on existing rules, with some relatively minormodifications: allowing some additional state spending to count toward meeting the FY1994funding level threshold and modifications to increase grants for states that qualify for funds for onlypart of the year.", "S. 667 fully revamps the contingency fund. It would eliminate the requirementthat states increase expenditures from their own funds above the regular TANF MOE level andeliminate the matching requirements. Instead, it requires that unspent TANF balances be below acertain threshold to qualify for contingency funds. S. 667 would base contingency grantson a portion of the estimated cost of increased cash assistance caseloads. It also would revise thecriteria of economic need for a state.", "Uses of Grants and Program Requirements. Federal TANF grants and MOE funds can be used for a wide range of benefits, services, andactivities to assist low-income families with children and to further TANF goals of reducingout-of-wedlock births and promoting two-parent families. TANF grants can also be transferred toother block grant programs: up to 30% of the grant can be transferred to the Child Care andDevelopment Fund (CCDF) and to the Social Services Block Grant. The limit on transfers to SSBGalone is set at 4.25% (though annual appropriations have restored the SSBG transfer limit to itsoriginal limit of 10% set in the 1996 welfare law). Within the overall 30% limit, federal TANFfunds may also be used as the state match for federal reverse commuter grants if the program benefitswelfare families.", "Both bills would set the SSBG transfer limit permanently at 10%. H.R. 240 would raise the overall transfer limit to 50%; S. 667 would retain the current 30%transfer limit.", "Both bills include provisions to ease some rules regarding use of TANF funds. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 would:", "Allow states to use carryover TANF funds for any TANF benefit and service. Current law restricts the use of carryover funds for the provision of\"assistance.\"", "Narrow the definition of \"assistance\" to exclude all child care andtransportation aid. TANF funds spent on assistance trigger certain program requirements, such aswork requirements, time limits, assignment of child support payments, and data reportingrequirements. Under current regulations, child care and transportation aid for nonworking familiesis counted as assistance and triggers these requirements. The bills would eliminate such aid fromthe definition of \"assistance,\" freeing from these requirements nonworking families that receive onlychild care or transportation aid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Work Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 incorporate the Bush Administration's\"universal engagement\" proposal, which requires states to develop a self-sufficiency plan for allTANF adult recipients to monitor progress toward that plan. H.R. 240 also requires statesto end benefits (\"full family sanction\") for families that fail to comply with work participation rules.", "Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 would substantially revise TANF workparticipation standards. Both bills would raise work participation standards that states must meetfrom the current law's standard of 50% to 70%, raise the required hours of working to receive fullcredit and provide partial credit for participating families that do not meet the full credit standard,and revise the list of activities that recipients may participate in for states to receive credit towardTANF standards. However, the bills differ in how they do these three things.", "Participation Standards. Current law requiresstates to have a specified percentage of their families with an adult recipient (or minor head ofhousehold) participating in creditable work activities. The current participation standard is 50%. States are subject to an additional participation rate standard for two-parent families, currently 90%. The participation rate standards may be reduced for caseload reductions (not attributable to policychanges) that occurred before enactment of welfare reform (FY1995). This \"caseload reductioncredit\" has had a large effect on participation standards, reducing the standard considerably from itsstatutory rate. In FY2003, the standard was reduced to 0% for 20 states.", "Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 raise the work participation standard forall families to 70% by FY2010, and eliminate the separate standard for two-parent families. Bothbills also change the credits that reduce these standards from their statutory rate (i.e., reduce the 70%standard to a lower rate), but they do so in different ways. H.R. 240 retains, but revises,the current law caseload reduction credit so that caseload change is measured from a more recentyear (rather than the pre-welfare reform caseload level of 1995). Ultimately, caseload reductionwould be measured based on the most recent four years. The House bill also includes a provisionto give an additional credit to states that achieved a caseload reduction of 60% or more from FY1995to FY2001.", "S. 667 retains the current caseload reduction credit for FY2006 and FY2007,but beginning in FY2008 would replace the caseload reduction credit with a credit for employedwelfare leavers. The bill would also cap all credits against the participation standard, so that theminimum effective standard would be 10% in FY2006, 20% in FY2007, 30% in FY2008, 40% inFY2009, and 50% in FY2010. There is no such minimum effective standard in H.R. 240 .", "Hours Standards. Current law requires that afamily be considered participating only if it participates for a minimum number of hours per weekin a month. Under current law, 20 hours is required for single parents with a pre-school child (underthe age of 6), and 30 hours is required for other families. Higher hours are set for the purposes ofthe two-parent work participation rate.", "Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 raise the hours standards. H.R.240 incorporates a 40-hour workweek standard for full credit, but would also provide\"partial\" credit for families with at least 24 hours of participation. No special lower-hour standardwould be provided for single parents with preschoolers.", "S. 667 also raises the hours standard for full credit, but to a lesser extent thanproposed in the House-passed bill. Single parents with a pre-school child would be given full creditfor participation at 24 hours per week, and other single-parent families would be given full credit at34 hours per week. Partial credit for single parent families would be provided at 20 hours per week. Higher hours requirements would apply to two-parent families.", "Creditable Activities. Current law lists 12activities that may be counted toward TANF work participation standards. The bulk of countableparticipation is in a subset of \"core\" activities focused on work, time-limited job search (countablefor six weeks in a fiscal year, 12 weeks if criteria of economic need are met), time-limited vocationaleducational training (12 months in a lifetime), and community service and work experience. Inmeeting the general 30-hour-per-week standard, hours in educational activities are countable onlyfor families who are also participating in at least 20 hours per week of \"core\" activities. Post-secondary education, other than that considered \"vocational educational training,\" does notcount toward current law federal TANF work participation standards.", "H.R. 240 and S. 667 differ significantly on the types of activitiescountable as core activities toward the participation standards. H.R. 240 narrows the listof core activities by eliminating job search and vocational education. Instead, the bill would givestates almost total discretion to define activities that would be countable for three months in a24-month period (four months to complete training), but once those months are exhausted, the onlyactivities that would count toward the work participation standards are work, on-the-job training,community service, or work experience. Moreover, since job search and vocational education wouldbe countable as sole or primary activities only during the three (or four) months that the state wouldhave discretion, any weeks of participation in job search reduce the number of weeks that vocationaleducation counts toward the participation standards.", "On the other hand, S. 667 retains the current law list of core activities. It tooprovides states additional discretion by permitting states to count an expanded list of activities forthree months in a 24-month period (longer for rehabilitative activities). However, this additionaldiscretion is provided in addition to, rather than instead of, six weeks of job search and 12 monthsof vocational educational training, which are retained as \"core\" activities.", "Both H.R. 240 and S. 667 would give states additional discretionin defining activities countable once a family has met the \"core\" work requirement (generally, 24hours per week in core activities). H.R. 240 would allow states to define activities forfamilies with at least 24 hours in core activities; S. 667 would allow states to count anexpanded set of activities for single-parent families with at least 24 hours per week in core activities.", "S. 667 includes some additional options for counting participation in activitiestoward TANF work standards. It would allow states to have up to 10% of their caseload enrolledin a special program of two- or four-year undergraduate education or vocational educational training. This program is modeled after the \"Parents as Scholars\" program that has operated in Maine usingTANF MOE funds. It also allows for participation in rehabilitative activities for disabled persons(including treatment of drug and alcohol abuse) if they combine rehabilitation with at least 10 hoursof \"core\" activities and if the state develops a collaborative relationship between agencies andentities providing rehabilitative services and the state TANF agency.
