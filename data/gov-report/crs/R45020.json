These broad principles currently include family reunification, labor market contribution, humanitarian assistance, and origin-country diversity.", "The United States has long distinguished permanent immigration from temporary migration. Permanent immigration occurs through family and employer-sponsored categories, the diversity immigrant visa lottery, and refugee and asylee admissions. Temporary migration occurs through the admission of visitors for specific purposes and limited periods of time, and encompasses two dozen categories of visitors, including foreign tourists, students, temporary workers, and diplomats.", "The other side of the immigration policy coin emphasizes the restriction of entry to and removal of persons from the United States who lack authorization to reside in the country, are identified as criminal aliens, or whose presence in the United States is not considered to be in the national interest.

The INA also has civil enforcement provisions, distinct from removal or inadmissibility proceedings, to prosecute individuals and entities that engage in immigration document fraud. Apart from the INA, the U.S. Criminal Code classifies knowingly producing or using fraudulent immigration documents (e.g., visas, border crossing cards) as criminal offenses. ", "In addition to relying on document inspection to determine if noncitizens are eligible for federal benefits, USCIS operates the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system, which provides federal, state, and local government agencies access to data on immigration status. USCIS does not determine benefit eligibility; rather, SAVE enables program administrators to ensure that only those noncitizens and naturalized citizens who meet their own programs' eligibility rules actually receive public benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Unauthorized Aliens", "paragraphs": ["Determining how to address the unauthorized alien population residing in the United States has arguably been among the most divisive immigration issues facing Congress. Unauthorized aliens consist of those who (1) entered the country surreptitiously without inspection, (2) were admitted on the basis of fraudulent documents, or (3) overstayed their nonimmigrant visas. In all three instances, the aliens violated the INA and may be removed. Aliens who attempt to enter the United States illegally and those who assist them also are subject to INA-mandated penalties.", "Because the exact number of unauthorized aliens residing in the United States remains unknown, demographers have developed methods to estimate their population size and characteristics. According to the most recent and widely cited estimates available, the size of the unauthorized alien population increased from 8.6 million in 2000 to a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. It has fluctuated between 11.0 and 11.5 million since that time. Scholars attribute the general decline and changing country-of-origin composition in illegal migration flows in recent years to increased border security, relatively large numbers of alien removals, high U.S. unemployment, crime in Central America, and other factors.", "Options proposed for addressing the unauthorized alien population often emphasize reducing its size. Some approaches would require or encourage unauthorized aliens to depart the United States. Other strategies would grant qualifying unauthorized residents various immigration benefits, including an opportunity to obtain legal immigration status."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Immigration Law Regarding Unauthorized Aliens", "paragraphs": ["Federal law places various restrictions on unauthorized aliens. In general, they have no legal right to live or work in the United States and are subject to removal from the country. At the same time, the INA provides limited forms of immigration relief for some unauthorized aliens to be legally admitted to the country, including crime victims or those seeking asylum. Unauthorized aliens who were present illegally in the United States for between 6 and 12 months are barred from readmission to the United States for 3 years, and those present for more than 1 year are barred for 10 years (the \"3- and 10-year bars\")."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Deferred Action", "paragraphs": ["For unauthorized aliens who cannot obtain LPR status, existing mechanisms enable some to remain in the United States. One such mechanism, deferred action , is defined by DHS as \"a discretionary determination to defer removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion.\" Deferred action is not an immigration status and does not have a statutory authority; it is a form of administrative discretion. Examples of deferred action may include DHS terminating removal proceedings, declining to initiate removal proceedings, or declining to execute a final order of removal. Approval of deferred action means that no action will be taken against a removable\u00a0alien for a specified time or in some cases indefinitely.", "Under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative begun by DHS in June 2012, certain individuals without a lawful immigration status who were brought to the United States as children and who meet other criteria may be granted deferred action for two years, subject to renewal. DACA recipients can apply for employment authorization but are not afforded a pathway to a legal immigration status. DACA was initiated not by congressional legislation but by the Obama Administration. The Trump Administration announced the planned rescission of the DACA initiative on September 5, 2017, but due to federal court orders enjoining the rescission, DACA remains in effect pending the outcome of further litigation."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
