As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure.", "The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows non-privileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation.", "In the 115 th Congress (2017-2018), measures considered under suspension made up 64% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (952 out of 1,498 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (10%) and House resolutions (5%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies.", "Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2017 and 2018, minority-party members sponsored 27% of suspension measures, compared to 14% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (27 measures) and unanimous consent (48 measures). There were no minority-party sponsored bills that were considered under the terms of a special rule.", "Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Natural Resources was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 115 th Congress. Additional committees\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Oversight and Government Reform (now Oversight and Reform), Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs\u00e2\u0080\u0094also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures.", "Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 115 th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 12\u00c2\u00bd minutes.", "The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2017 and 2018. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 115 th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 37% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 316 measures were signed into law.", "This report briefly describes the suspension of the rules procedure, which is defined in House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under this procedure during the 115 th Congress. Figures and one table display statistics on the use of the procedure, including the prevalence and form of suspension measures, sponsorship of measures by party, committee consideration, length of debate, voting, resolution of differences between the chambers, and the final status of legislation.

However, to expedite legislation receiving floor action, the House may temporarily set aside these rules for measures that are not otherwise privileged for consideration. This can be done by agreeing to a special order of business resolution (special rule) or by adopting a motion to suspend the rules and pass the underlying measure. In general, special rules enable the consideration of complex or contentious legislation, such as major appropriations or reauthorizations, while the suspension of the rules procedure is usually applied to broadly supported legislation that can be approved without floor amendments or extensive debate in the chamber.", "Most bills and resolutions that receive floor action in the House are called up and considered under suspension of the rules. The suspension procedure allows non-privileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. Motions to suspend the rules and pass the measure require a two-thirds vote, so the procedure is typically reserved for bills and resolutions that can meet a supermajority threshold. ", "Decisions to schedule bills for consideration under suspension are generally based on how widely supported the measures are, how long Members wish to debate them, and whether they want to propose floor amendments. These decisions are not necessarily related to the subject matter of the measure. Accordingly, measures brought up under suspension cover a wide range of policy areas but most often address government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities.", "This report describes the suspension procedure, which is defined in clause 1 of House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under suspension during the 115 th Congress (2017-2018).

The motion to suspend and pass the measure, though, may provide for passage of the measure in an amended form. That is, the text to be approved may be presented in a form altered by committee amendments or by informal negotiations. Suspension measures that are passed with changes incorporated into the text are passed \"as amended.\" There are no separate votes on the floor approving such amendments.", "Suspension motions are \"debatable for 40 minutes, one-half in favor of the motion and one-half in opposition thereto.\" However, in most instances, a true opponent never claims half the time, and most speakers come to the floor to express support for the measure. Debate time is controlled by two floor managers, one from each party, who sit on a committee of jurisdiction. Each manager makes an opening statement and may yield increments of the 20 minutes they control to other Members to debate the measure.", "Once debate has concluded, a single vote is held on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the measure. The motion requires approval by \"two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum being present.\" Should the vote fall short of the two-thirds required for passage (290, if all Members vote), the measure is not permanently rejected.

", "Measures may be referred to multiple House committees before receiving floor action. When a bill or resolution is referred to more than one House committee, the Speaker will designate one committee as primary, meaning it is the committee exercising jurisdiction over the largest part of the measure. Generally, the chair of the committee of primary jurisdiction works with majority party leadership to determine if and when a measure should be considered under suspension.

For the other committees, suspension measures ranged from 56% to 100% of the total number of the committee's measures receiving floor action ( Figure 5 ).", "Since suspension motions require a two-thirds majority for passage, House committees that handle less contentious subjects tend to have more of their measures considered under the suspension procedure in comparison to other committees. In the 115 th Congress, high-suspension committees included Small Business and Homeland Security (100% of measures receiving floor action); Veterans' Affairs (92%); and Science, Space, and Technology (90%).
