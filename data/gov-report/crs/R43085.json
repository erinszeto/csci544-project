{"id": "R43085", "title": "Bangladesh Apparel Factory Collapse: Background in Brief", "released_date": "2014-02-06T00:00:00", "summary": ["The April 24, 2013, collapse of an eight-story garment factory, called Rana Plaza, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,100 workers. It is reportedly now considered the deadliest accident in the history of the apparel industry. Congress has had a long-standing interest in supporting internationally recognized worker rights in developing countries, and the building collapse has raised concerns about worker conditions in Bangladesh.", "Rana Plaza was allegedly structurally unsound and poorly maintained for apparel production. Apparel production is generally known as an industry under threat of fire, and one where workers need easy access to rapid escape routes. Issues relating to workers' inability to effectively exercise their rights to organize, bargain collectively, and work in a safe workplace may have contributed to the tragedy. For example, workers reportedly noticed cracks in the building and resisted entering, and were told that if they did not report to their jobs, they would not be paid. The factory collapse brought international focus to those parts of global supply chains that may not meet basic safety and health standards.", "The U.S. government supports internationally recognized worker rights through various policies and programs. These include U.S. trade preference programs, free trade agreements, foreign assistance, and Department of Labor initiatives.", "Congressional and U.S. efforts in this regard are part of an international worker rights support structure in place to offer technical assistance and support to countries\u2014especially developing countries. Other major parts of this structure include international organizations, such as the International Labor Organization (ILO), founded in 1919; and corporate codes of conduct, which have arisen from a broader movement of corporate social responsibility that gained strength in the 1980s and 1990s.", "Early analysis of the causes of the Bangladesh tragedy raises questions about what went wrong and about what can be done to help Bangladesh to improve working conditions at factories. Efforts to make changes in Bangladesh are already underway, and developments on this issue are evolving.", "This report provides an overview of the recent tragedy in Bangladesh and the Bangladesh economic environment and culture. It also notes the responses to the tragedy, to date, from Congress, the Administration, the ILO, the Bangladesh government, and the private sector. Finally, it raises some possible issues for Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Overview1", "paragraphs": ["On April 24, 2013, Rana Plaza, an eight-story building, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, collapsed, killing more than 1,100 garment workers. It brought international focus on portions of the global supply chain. It also raised the issue of what might be done to improve working conditions, especially for lower-wage workers in developing countries around the world.", "According to press reports, the day of the building collapse workers arrived and saw cracks in the outside of the building where five manufacturing operations were trying to meet production deadlines on apparel products for the U.S. and European Union (EU) markets. Reportedly, management assured them that the building was safe, and told workers that they would not be paid if they did not work. An hour later, the building collapsed. It has been labeled the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry. ", "The Rana Plaza collapse took place five months after a December 17, 2012, fire at another Bangladesh apparel factory, Tazreen Fashions Limited; the Tazreen fire killed 112 workers. Survivors reportedly stated that their managers locked one exit route and told workers that the fire alarms were false, thereby delaying timely evacuation. The combined tragedies brought the six-month total loss of life in Bangladesh in the garment sector to at least 1,200.", "After the building collapse, reportedly, thousands of workers took to the streets and vandalized vehicles and shops before being dispersed by police. Soon after that, the government shut down a number of apparel factories, for safety reasons, as concerns about industrial safety across the country continued to grow. ", "Bangladesh's major export is apparel, which, along with a small amount of textiles, accounts for more than 80% of the country's $24 billion in exports to the world in 2012, or nearly $20 billion. (See the Text Box , \"Bangladesh in Brief.\") As a result of the Rana Plaza building collapse, some firms, such as Disney, have indicated they may no longer source production from Bangladesh, largely due to concerns over their brand reputation. If this becomes a major trend, one consequence could be that many women, who constitute 80% of the workers in the apparel sector, could lose their jobs. These women, mostly Muslim, have found new independence and an increased standard of living for their families, and have, in many cases, become primary breadwinners. The effect on the economic structure of Bangladesh could be compounded by an ongoing struggle between a secular Bangladeshi identity and a more fundamental/religious Islamic identity.", "A number of factors may have led to the recent building collapse. Bangladesh's economy is labor-intensive, which attracts lower-wage and lower-skilled industries such as apparel. Bangladesh is a densely populated country, where a population half the size of the United States is crowded into a geographic area the size of Iowa. To meet increasing global demand for apparel production, primarily by the United States and Europe, certain buildings may have been converted to multi-story manufacturing operations. In many countries, apparel production is generally carried out in one- or two-story buildings because of the inherent fire hazards associated with this production. Three additional floors that reportedly were illegally constructed were added to the Rana Plaza. ", "According to press reports, working conditions in Bangladesh were theoretically addressed, at least in part, by Bangladesh labor laws and building codes, International Labor Organization (ILO) commitments, codes of conduct held by multinational corporations, and GSP trade preferences. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ILO", "paragraphs": ["Since 1972, Bangladesh has been a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO). The ILO originated in 1919 as a tripartite organization comprised of workers, employers, and governments, to promote \"decent work\" around the world. Under the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work , Bangladesh and all ILO members have an obligation to uphold ILO core labor principles, simply by reason of their status as ILO members, even if they have not ratified the conventions behind the principles. Bangladesh has, however, ratified seven of the eight ILO conventions backing and defining the five core labor principles. These principles are very similar to the U.S. list of internationally recognized worker rights.", "These rights are the following:", "1. freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; 2. the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor; 3. the effective abolition of child labor, including the worst forms of child labor; and 4. the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.", "Whether countries do or do not uphold ILO core labor principles, the ILO has no real enforcement powers other than technical assistance, reporting requirements, publication of information, and moral suasion. An example of ILO activities to enhance worker rights is the Better Work Program, a technical support program which recently went into effect in Bangladesh. It is a joint program with the World Bank that works with government officials, factory owners, and labor groups to ensure safe and decent workplace conditions, and is discussed further below. ", " Figure 2 , below, shows that most of the concepts of the ILO core labor principles plus the ILO occupational safety and health principle, are included in many U.S. trade and investment laws and programs, including the Generalized System of Preferences program, mentioned below, and some private sector codes of conduct. Thus, Figure 2 shows graphically the extent to which similar sets of rights extend through all three parts of the international worker rights support system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Trade Preference Programs12", "paragraphs": ["One area of congressional focus in supporting internationally recognized worker rights has been through provisions in U.S. trade preference programs. These were first introduced in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program in 1985. GSP provides unilateral U.S. tariff preferences for certain products exported by developing countries, to support their economic development. Under GSP, and later introduced in other trade preference programs, the President or his designee is prohibited from designating certain countries as eligible for GSP benefits, based on different criteria, including that a country \"has not taken or is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights.\" These worker rights are defined as", "1. the right of association; 2. the right to organize and bargain collectively; 3. a prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor; 4. a minimum wage for the employment of children; and protection against the worst forms of child labor; and 5. acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health.", "On the basis of these criteria, effective September 3, 2013, the Obama Administration suspended GSP status for Bangladesh, with no timeline for its possible reinstatement. However, that decision was followed by the USTR release of a \"Bangladesh Action Plan 2013,\" outlining a basis for the eventual reinstatement of GSP status for Bangladesh.

Most, if not all, large multinational corporations sourcing apparel from Bangladesh have posted such codes on their websites. These codes may describe the standards to which the business holds its employees, its suppliers under contract, and sometimes its subcontractors. These codes specify worker rights protections and structural and fire hazard standards to varying degrees. A concern raised by some groups is that corporations may contract directly with suppliers, yet have limited knowledge of the conditions under which the products are produced by subcontractors. Corporate codes of conduct are voluntary on the part of corporations. ", "The Rana Plaza collapse has focused greater attention on the worker conditions and laws in Bangladesh, and may impact Bangladesh's continued role as a major supplier of apparel, due to corporate buyer concerns over branding and reputation. Key issues may include whether firms will continue to source apparel from Bangladesh, or whether firms will engage more proactively to improve conditions there, as well as the extent to which corporate codes of conduct have been helpful.", "A number of interested parties, including parties in Europe and the United States, among them President Obama, and a number of Members of Congress, are calling for U.S. and European companies and other stakeholders to work together to solve the problems.

On May 1, 2013, for example, Representatives Sander Levin, ranking Member of the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, and George Miller, ranking Member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, sent a letter to President Obama, urging the Administration to convene representatives of European and American retailers, the Bangladesh garment industry (including their workers and unions), the Bangladeshi government, the ILO, and nongovernmental organizations, to facilitate development of a \"concrete action plan\" to address the range of issues relating to working conditions and worker rights in the garment sector.

Two major stakeholder efforts have resulted: the \"Accord on Fire and building Safety in Bangladesh,\" signed predominantly by European, plus a few U.S. retailers and brands; and the \"Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety,\" signed predominantly by large North American retailers and brands.

The decision to suspend GSP status for Bangladesh, effective September 3, 2013, with no timeline for restoring, it was made after the GSP Trade Policy Staff Committee held hearings in March of 2013, in response to an AFL-CIO petition first submitted in 2007 and updated in 2012, after the Tazreen fire. ", "Implications from the GSP suspension are yet to be determined. The GSP program excludes from eligibility most apparel and textile articles (and other import sensitive products), which constitute 92% of Bangladesh's exports to the United States. Therefore, the decision has little effect on U.S. tariffs on apparel imports, which reportedly average about 16%. On the other hand, some businesses might decide to pull out of Bangladesh for fear that their reputation could be damaged by association with a country that has lost its GSP status for reasons relating to internationally recognized worker rights. If that were to happen, some argue, it could significantly reduce Bangladesh's apparel-making labor force and adversely impact its economy.", "The USTR's \"Bangladesh Action Plan 2013,\" released to the public on July 19, 2013, outlined a basis for possible eventual reinstatement of GSP status for Bangladesh. Its directives encompass Bangladesh's own \"National Tripartite Plan of Action (NTPA) on Fire Safety and Structural Integrity,\" for the garment sector of Bangladesh (discussed further below under the \"Bangladesh Government.\") The USTR Action Plan for Bangladesh, among other things, set forth guidelines for government inspections, labor law reforms, the protection of unions from anti-union discrimination and reprisal, and the extension of freedom of association and collective bargaining rights to export processing zones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bangladesh Government", "paragraphs": ["The Bangladesh government response after the tragedy was to work with the ILO on identifying changes needed to better protect workers.

On July 15, 2013, the Bangladesh Parliament approved some changes to its labor laws. These changes were designed to: (1) make it easier for workers to form labor unions; (2) increase severance and retirement payments for workers with longer tenures; and (3) equalize, for all workers, annual payments under a welfare fund. In addition, the government reportedly plans to add 200 factory inspectors within six months, and to complete a comprehensive safety assessment (extending to fire and structural safety) of all export-oriented garment factories. The government has also been negotiating a new minimum wage for garment workers, who have been protesting against low wages in light of recent inflation. The protesters have sought an increase in the minimum wage from the U.S. equivalent of $38 to $104 per month.

On May 13, 2013, several of the world's largest apparel companies agreed to a legally binding \"Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh\" to help pay for fire safety and building improvements there.

Corporate members of the Alliance have pledged over $100 million in capital to support remediation of factories. In addition, $42 million raised for the Worker Safety Fund reflects a tiered fee structure for members based on exports of apparel products from Bangladesh.

Under the Accord, signatories are obligated to require suppliers to extend certain rights to workers, including the right to refuse work they justifiably believe to be unsafe, and the right to a continued employment relationship and income, while the factory is undergoing required safety improvements. Under the Alliance, workers are not given these rights directly. Rather, they are \"empowered\" to report safety hazards; and 10% of a fund contributed to by the signatories is reserved to support workers temporarily displaced because of factory remediation. Because the programs are still in their early stages of implementation, no reports have yet been issued estimating the effects of either plan.
