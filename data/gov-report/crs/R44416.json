High poverty rates and low income levels in tribal lands\u2014along with the fact that many tribal communities are located in remote rural areas (often with rugged terrain)\u2014are major factors that may explain why tribal areas have comparatively poor levels of broadband access, and why providers may lack an economic incentive to serve those areas.", "Until recently, data on tribal broadband deployment had been scarce. However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Commerce have begun to collect and compile data on tribal broadband deployment.

In the 115th Congress, bills were introduced to direct federal funding specifically for tribal broadband.

While the number of new broadband subscribers continues to grow, studies and data suggest that the rate of broadband deployment in urban/suburban and high-income areas is outpacing deployment in rural and low-income areas. In particular, tribal communities stand out as being among the most unserved or underserved populations with respect to broadband deployment.", "According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), \"[b]y virtually any measure, communities on tribal lands have historically had less access to telecommunications services than any other segment of the population.\" According to Census data, about 28.3% of Native Americans live in households below the poverty level (compared to 15.5% nationally), and tribal communities often lack basic infrastructure such as water and sewer systems, and telecommunications.

According to the FCC's Office of Native Affairs and Policy (ONAP):", "Understanding the complexity of the digital divide in Indian Country requires an appreciation of the unique challenges facing Tribal Nations, which include deployment, adoption, affordability, and access to spectrum, as well as lack of investment dollars and access to credit and start-up or gap financing. Barriers to the deployment of communications services include rural, remote, rugged terrain, areas that are not connected to a road system, and difficulty in obtaining rights-of-way to deploy infrastructure across some Tribal lands\u2014all of which increase the cost of installing, maintaining, and upgrading infrastructure. Affordability of communications services is affected by often endemic levels of poverty. Because Tribal Nations cannot easily collateralize assets that are held in trust by the federal government, and cannot easily access investment dollars, the ability to obtain credit and financing is limited. ", "The presence of robust broadband and improved digital connectivity in tribal areas could play a significant role in revitalizing many tribal communities. The FCC's 2010 National Broadband Plan identified broadband as a basic infrastructure necessary for improving economic growth, job creation, global competitiveness, and a better way of life.

H.R. 5961 (Aderholt), introduced on May 24, 2018, as the FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations bill, funds Community Connect grants and broadband loans, and is accompanied by the House Appropriations Committee report ( H.Rept. 115-706 ), which includes the following:", "Tribal Communities.\u2014The Committee notes that tribal communities continue to struggle with gaining access to broadband service. The Committee encourages the Secretary to provide a report that identifies the specific challenges Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) have in gaining access to broadband service and provide a plan for addressing these challenges, including how the Community Connect program can assist ITOs.", "S. 1116 (Hoeven), introduced on May 11, 2017, as the Indian Community Economic Enhancement Act of 2017, would have directed GAO to conduct a study assessing a range of federal programs (including broadband and telecommunications programs) available to assist Indian communities with business and economic development. Referred to the Committee on Senate Indian Affairs; reported by Committee on October 17, 2017 ( S.Rept. 115-174 ). S. 2205 (Heinrich), introduced on December 7, 2017, as the Tribal Connect Act of 2017, would have improved access by Indian tribes to support from the Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support program (E-rate) of the Federal Communications Commission. Referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.

Many contend that without federal assistance, tribal lands will continue to be on the wrong side of the digital divide. At issue is what role the federal government can play to most effectively and efficiently support broadband deployment on tribal lands. ", "Aside from providing funding for broadband deployment, the federal government has pursued other policies relevant to tribal broadband. These include mechanisms for effective coordination and consultation with tribes on broadband issues, spectrum policies to promote wireless broadband deployment on tribal lands, addressing permitting and environmental review issues for deploying broadband infrastructure on tribal lands, and rights-of-way policies to enable broadband infrastructure deployment on public lands. On January 31, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced the formation of a Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee, which is developing advice and recommendations to the FCC on how to accelerate the deployment of broadband by reducing and/or removing regulatory barriers to infrastructure investment.", "Regarding funding, debate has centered on whether federal funding for tribal broadband is sufficient, and the extent to which portions of federal funds available for broadband generally should be specifically targeted for tribal broadband. The 2010 National Broadband Plan (NBP) found that \"[t]ribes need substantially greater financial support than is presently available to them, and accelerating tribal broadband deployment will require increased funding.\" The NBP recommended that Congress establish a Tribal Broadband Fund, which would be administered by NTIA in consultation with the FCC and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. To date, no legislation has been enacted by Congress that would specifically establish a Tribal Broadband Fund. ", "Currently, the largest overall source of federal funding for telecommunications services is the FCC's Universal Service Fund programs. As these programs transition toward a broadband-centric orientation (e.g., the Connect America Fund), the issue for tribal broadband is how this transition will affect broadband funding to tribal lands, and to what extent these programs might be configured toward addressing the relatively low levels of broadband deployment and adoption in tribal lands. In the 116 th Congress, notwithstanding whether federal broadband funding programs target tribal lands, whether or not tribal lands will receive additional funding for broadband will likely be determined by the ongoing trajectory of overall federal funding for broadband.
