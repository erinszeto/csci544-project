", "Because the CO-OP program uses direct loans, the appropriated amounts for CO-OPs represent the total expected cost to the government over the life of the loans, rather than the total amount of loans that CMS can award. In general, loans and other federal credit programs are scored in the budget in accordance with their subsidy costs . A loan's subsidy cost equals the net present value of expected future receipts (loan principal and interest repayment) less expenditures (loan disbursements). Increases in the risk of default\u2014the failure to repay a loan\u2014reduce expected receipt totals, which increases the subsidy costs of a program. Given a certain budgetary cost, more loans can be issued when the likelihood of default decreases and when interest payments on the loan increase. Total loan disbursements therefore exceed the budgetary costs of the program in many cases. ", "Historical data presented in recent President's budget submissions indicate that the budgetary cost of CO-OP loans totaled $979 million from FY2012 through FY2015.

Changes in interest rates due to shifts in economic conditions or other factors may lead to changes in the expected subsidy costs of a federal program. Moreover, the projected default rates of loans may fluctuate significantly in response to both economic changes and shifts in the market conditions of relevant industries. Default rate estimates may be particularly uncertain for new programs (such as the CO-OP program) with little evidence of what market demand will be and how industry may respond. The expected budgetary cost of loans made under federal credit programs is reestimated each year to take into account updated conditions and assumptions. Revisions made to the original subsidy cost of CO-OP loan and contingency fund disbursements have increased their estimated budgetary cost by $601 million.
