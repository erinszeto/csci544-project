Under the initial concept for GNEP, the United States and other advanced nuclear nations would lease new fuel to other nations that agreed to forgo uranium enrichment, spent fuel recycling (also called reprocessing), and other fuel cycle facilities that could be used to produce nuclear weapons materials. The leased fuel would then be returned to supplier nations for reprocessing.

Existing U.S. commercial nuclear reactors use water to slow down, or \"moderate,\" the neutrons released by the fission process (splitting of nuclei). The relatively slow (thermal) neutrons are highly efficient in causing fission in certain isotopes of heavy elements, such as uranium 235 and plutonium 239. Therefore, fewer of those isotopes are needed in nuclear fuel to sustain a nuclear chain reaction (in which neutrons released by fissioned nuclei then induce fission in other nuclei, and so forth). The downside is that thermal neutrons cannot efficiently induce fission in more than a few specific isotopes.", "In contrast, \"fast\" neutrons, which have not been moderated, are less effective in inducing fission than thermal neutrons but can induce fission in a much wider range of isotopes, including all major plutonium isotopes. Therefore, nuclear fuel for a fast reactor must have a higher proportion of fissionable isotopes than a thermal reactor to sustain a chain reaction, but a larger number of different isotopes can constitute that fissionable proportion.", "A fast reactor's ability to fission most heavy radioactive isotopes, called \"transuranics\" (TRU), makes it theoretically possible to repeatedly separate those materials from spent fuel and feed them back into the reactor until they are entirely fissioned.

Such technologies would involve separation of plutonium, uranium, and other long-lived radioactive materials from spent fuel for reuse in a nuclear reactor or for transmutation in a particle accelerator. Much of the program's research will focus on a separations technology called UREX+, in which uranium and other elements are chemically removed from dissolved spent fuel, leaving a mixture of plutonium and other highly radioactive elements.

The committee was concerned about high costs, the security of fissile material distributed among many sites, and the size and age of the Complex. A task force of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board released its final report in October 2005. It recommended a Consolidated Nuclear Production Center (CNPC) that would make nuclear components (such as those of uranium or plutonium) and would assemble and dismantle nuclear weapons. It recommended consolidating uranium and plutonium, and probably closing several current sites.

A pit is the fissile core of a nuclear weapon that is used to trigger a thermonuclear explosion. The United States has been unable to manufacture pits that can be certified for use in the stockpile since 1989. Los Alamos has a small-scale pit manufacturing facility, called TA-55; NNSA's plan is that TA-55 would be able to manufacture 10 pits per year by the end of FY2007 and 30-50 RRW pits per year by FY2012, but NNSA saw that capacity as insufficient to maintain the stockpile and favored building MPF, with a capacity of perhaps 125 pits per year. H.R. 2419 , the FY2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, as passed by the House, eliminated MPF funds until \"capacity requirements tied to the long-term stockpile size are determined\" and \"until the long-term strategy for the physical infrastructure of the weapons complex has incorporated the Reliable Replacement Warhead strategy.\" The bill as passed by the Senate provided the amount requested for MPF, $7.7 million.

The Administration and Congress sought to shorten it, but there was a dispute over how much. NNSA and the Armed Services Committees favored an 18-month posture on grounds that it would take that long to prepare a test but that any testing should not be delayed beyond that time. The Appropriations Committees favored a 24-month posture, seeing an 18-month posture as provocative and more costly. The FY2006 appropriation was $19.8 million.

As a consequence, environmental problems arising from this past production continue to present challenges today. However, potential health and environmental risks vary considerably among individual sites, depending on the type and quantity of waste and contamination present at each site, and the potential for exposure to wastes and contaminants.", "The adequacy of funding to address health and environmental risks resulting from the past production of nuclear weapons is a long-standing issue. DOE established the Office of Environmental Management in 1989 to consolidate its efforts to administer the cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites. These efforts include the disposal of radioactive and other hazardous wastes, management and disposal of surplus nuclear materials, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated from such wastes, and the decontamination and decommissioning of excess buildings and facilities. Through this program, DOE also administers the disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination at sites where the federal government conducted civilian nuclear energy research. Altogether, there were 114 \"geographic\" sites in 30 states where these activities resulted in the generation of wastes and contamination.", "Some of the ongoing issues associated with the disposal of wastes and the cleanup of contamination have been the adequacy of risk-based approaches to address these needs; the technical soundness of waste treatment facility designs; how to safely remove, treat, and dispose of high-level radioactive waste stored in underground tanks; the effectiveness and cost-savings of incentive-based cleanup contracts; and the pace and adequacy of cleanup overall.

However, the final funding is subject to two across-the-board rescissions, somewhat reducing the appropriation. Nearly all of the $5.75 billion is subject to a 0.91% rescission, whereas $17.5 million of that amount for congressionally designated projects is subject to a higher rescission of 1.6%. These rescissions apply to funding not only for the Environmental Management Program, but to all DOE activities funded in Title III of Division C, as required by Section 312 of that title. Prior to the final bill, the House had proposed a higher amount of $6.21 billion for the Environmental Management Program, and the Senate Appropriations Committee had recommended $6.00 billion. The President had proposed the lowest amount under consideration for FY2008, requesting $5.66 billion for the program. Congress appropriated $6.19 billion for FY2007.", "Although the House initially had proposed the highest amount for FY2008, nearly $200 million of its increase would not have provided additional resources for the program. Rather, this increase was due to the House's proposal to consolidate funding for the Office of Legacy Management with the Environmental Management Program. This office has been funded independently under other accounts, and is responsible for long-term site care after cleanup is complete under the Environmental Management Program. In its initial bill, the Senate Appropriations Committee had rejected the House's proposal, and recommended that the Office of Legacy Management continue to be funded in other accounts independent of the Environmental Management Program. Taking this accounting difference into consideration, the House and the Senate Appropriations Committee had recommended similar levels of funding for the Environmental Management Program as a whole. In the final bill, Congress followed the approach of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and did not consolidate funding for these two functions. See the \"Office of Legacy Management\" section later in this report.", "The FY2008 enacted appropriation of $5.75 billion (prior to rescissions) for the Environmental Management Program is significantly less than the $6.19 billion that Congress appropriated for FY2007. However, this difference in total funding is largely because of a $425.7 million decrease in funds for \"accelerated closure\" sites where all planned cleanup actions are complete under the Environmental Management Program. These sites include Rocky Flats (CO), Fernald (OH), and several other defense sites. Congress had increased funding at these sites for several years to speed the pace of cleanup. These sites were suitable for accelerated cleanup because the challenges were more technically feasible to address than those at more complex sites. Now that most of the work is completed at some sites, and nearing completion at others, there has been a corresponding downward trend in funding as these needs have diminished.", "Although DOE has accomplished much in accelerating cleanup at the above sites, substantial challenges remain at many other sites where cleanup is not complete and large quantities of wastes and contamination are still present. For these and other pending sites, there are varying decreases and increases in funding when comparing the appropriation enacted for FY2008 to the initial recommendations of the House and the Senate Appropriations Committee, the President's FY2008 request, and the appropriation for the prior year in FY2007. (See Table 14 .) These differences in funding are due to differing priorities among other competing needs within the federal budget, opposing views on the adequacy of funding to meet cleanup needs, and varying factors at individual sites, such as the technical complexity of cleanup, the prioritization of remedial actions based on health and environmental risks, scheduling of actions to meet time frames in regulatory agreements, and numerous other considerations.", "The Hanford site is the largest and most complex site administered under the Environmental Management Program. This site alone represents about one-third of the funding for the entire program. The adequacy of funding to clean up Hanford has been particularly controversial for many reasons, including potential risks from radioactive contamination migrating through groundwater into the Columbia River and the delayed construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant. This facility is a key element in DOE's plans to treat the substantial volume of high-level radioactive waste to be removed from the underground tanks at Hanford, and to solidify that waste for permanent disposal in a geologic repository. This task is one of the more costly cleanup challenges across the complex of sites.", "Various engineering and design issues have delayed construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at Hanford. The President had requested $690.0 million for the construction of this facility in FY2008, the same amount as Congress appropriated in FY2007. The request also included $273.4 million for the management of the wastes still stored in the underground tanks, slightly less than the FY2007 appropriation of $277.1 million. Prior to rescissions, the appropriation enacted for FY2008 included $690.0 million for the construction of the waste treatment plant, and $288.4 million for managing the tank wastes while the construction of the plant continues.", "The House initially had proposed $590.0 million for the waste treatment plant, and the same amount as the President requested for managing the tank wastes. In its initial report, the House Appropriations Committee had indicated that its proposed lower funding for the plant could have been augmented with $100.0 million in \"uncosted balances\" carried over from FY2007 because of slow construction progress, raising the total available to the President's request of $690.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee had recommended the full request for the waste treatment plant without the use of these uncosted balances, and had recommended a higher amount of $326.0 million for managing the tank wastes.", " Table 14 indicates appropriations that Congress enacted for the Environmental Management Program for FY2008, compared to the initial recommendations of the full House and the Senate Appropriations Committee prior to the enactment of the final bill, the President's request, and the prior-year appropriation in FY2007.

Accordingly, there has been much debate about how to ensure public health and safety, and the protection of the environment, in the most expedient and cost-effective manner. DOE reports that it had cleaned up 81 of the 114 geographic sites as of the end of FY2006. Although DOE has disposed of substantial quantities of waste and remediated many areas of contamination at the remaining sites, much work remains to be done to complete cleanup at many of them. DOE expects to complete cleanup at certain sites within the next few years. However, the Department anticipates cleanup to continue for decades at the larger and more complex sites, such as Hanford, Savannah River, and the Idaho National Laboratory, where high-level radioactive waste is in need of treatment and disposal, and soil and groundwater contamination are generally more severe. Based on recent assumptions, DOE expects cleanup and disposal of wastes to be complete at Savannah River in 2031, at the Idaho National Laboratory in 2035, and at Hanford in 2042.", "Accurately assessing the time and funding needed to complete cleanup and dispose of all radioactive and other hazardous wastes is difficult at best. Developing reliable estimates is especially challenging for the larger, more complex sites where many final decisions have yet to be made because of technical limitations and uncertainties, such as the \"end state\" of many sites. DOE periodically revises its estimates of outstanding costs to complete cleanup and dispose of wastes as individual project baselines and assumptions change. These estimates have varied widely over time by many billions of dollars. DOE reports its financial liabilities for the Environmental Management Program, and all of its other program responsibilities, in its annual financial statements contained in the Department's performance and accountability reports. DOE's most recent Performance and Accountability Report for FY200 6 estimated that $159 billion would be needed to complete cleanup and dispose of wastes at the remaining sites administered under DOE's Environmental Management Program. The $159 billion estimate is in FY2006 dollars, and DOE notes that \"future inflation could cause actual costs to be substantially higher than the recorded liability.\"", "In addition to inflation, other factors could cause actual costs to exceed the $159 billion estimate. For example, actual costs could be higher than expected, depending on whether federal and state regulators may require more stringent and costlier cleanup actions than DOE plans to take. Costs also could rise if initial cleanup actions prove inadequate to protect human health and the environment over the long-term. Future performance of cleanup actions is especially critical for nuclear waste sites because of the rate of decay of radioactivity, which can be thousands of years, depending on the particular radionuclide. Predicting the effectiveness of methods to contain radioactive wastes over such long periods of time is challenging, if not impracticable, in some cases. Consequently, additional funding could be needed at sites where cleanup was thought to be complete, if the initial cleanup proves inadequate over time.", "DOE's $159 billion estimate also does not include the costs of long-term care of sites once wastes are disposed of, and cleanup remedies are in place, to ensure the protection of human health and the environment into the future. DOE's Performance and Accountability Report for FY2006 estimated that, as of the end of FY2006, $18 billion would be needed for cleanup and post-closure site responsibilities after work under the Environmental Management Program is completed. These responsibilities include surveillance and monitoring, long-term operation and maintenance of soil and groundwater cleanup remedies, and disposal of excess materials remaining on-site after closeout under the Environmental Management Program. DOE estimated that this $18 billion cost would be incurred over 75 years through FY2081. DOE expects some long-term site care to be needed beyond this time, requiring additional funding.

Of this amount, $156.4 million was allocated to defense sites, and $34.2 million was allocated to non-defense sites. The House initially had agreed to the President's total request of $194.2 million for the Office of Legacy Management, while the Senate had recommended a slightly higher amount of $194.7 million.

In its initial report, the House Appropriations Committee had noted its expectation that the Office of Legacy Management continue to operate as a separate office within the Environmental Management Program. The effect of this proposed consolidation would appear to have been a shift in funds among accounts, rather than a change in the office's administration or function. The Senate Appropriations Committee had not recommended this change in accounting, but had proposed funding within the existing account structure, as was adopted in the enacted bill but in a slightly lower amount.", "Although the appropriation enacted for FY2008 is somewhat less than the President requested and the House and the Senate Appropriations Committee had proposed, the enacted amount is still a $126.5 million increase above the FY2007 appropriation. The reason for such a substantial increase is primarily because of greater funding needs for long-term care, and pension and post-retirement benefits, at defense sites transferred from the Environmental Management Program after physical cleanup is complete.
