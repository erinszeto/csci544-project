FFDCA (21 U.S.C. \u00a7346a) requires the establishment of maximum limits (tolerances) for pesticide residues on food in interstate commerce. EPA was also required to reevaluate older, registered pesticides (i.e., \"reregistration\" for pesticides registered prior to 1984, and more recently, \"registration review\") and to reassess existing tolerances to ensure they meet current safety standards. Although U.S. Treasury revenues cover much of the costs for administering these acts, various fees paid by pesticide manufacturers and other registrants have supplemented EPA appropriations for many years as a means intended to, in part, increase the pace of the agency's activities under FIFRA and FFDCA.", "In March 2013, EPA reported the completion of 1,574 pesticide registration-related decisions subject to PRIA 2 during FY2012, for a total of 12,165 decisions since the enactment of PRIA 1 in 2004. For FY2012, EPA reported expending $13.4 million of the $20.3 million in available revenues (composed of $15.6 million in net receipts of new registration service fees collected in FY2012 and $4.7 million carried forward from FY2011). Expenditures decreased by nearly 7% in FY2012 compared to $14.3 million in FY2011, primarily a result of a 35% reduction in expenditures for contracts.", "Authority for collecting pesticide fees dates back to the 1954 FFDCA amendments (P.L. 518; July 22, 1954), which, as passed, required the collection of fees \"sufficient to provide adequate service\" for establishing maximum residue levels (tolerances) for pesticides on food. Authority to collect fees was expanded with the 1988 FIFRA amendments (P.L. 100-532). The 1996 amendments to FIFRA and FFDCA, or the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA; P.L. 104-170), extended EPA's authority to collect certain fees through FY2001. Prior to the enactment of PRIA 1 (P.L. 108-199) in 2004, Congress had extended these fee authorities annually through appropriations legislation. Since 1998, Presidents' budget requests have included proposals to modify existing fee structures to further increase revenues for pesticide activities, but were not adopted in legislation and in some cases specifically prohibited by Congress. The FY2013 President's budget request, submitted to Congress February 13, 2012, did not include similar proposals for supplemental fees, but instead acknowledged the need for reauthorization of the current fees at increased levels to cover a greater portion of relevant program operating costs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The collection of fees to support U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pesticide program activities in the implementation of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA; 7 U.S.C. \u00a7136-136y) and related requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7346a) has been a complex issue for more than 25 years.

Additionally, certain fee collections and apportionment are authorized on a reduced basis through FY2019. In addition, PRIA 3 revised review activities subject to fees and the associated timelines for completion of EPA review decisions.

EPA evaluates proposed pesticide registrations under a set of science-based safety standards. Before a registration can be granted for a \"food use\" pesticide, FFDCA requires that a tolerance (the maximum amount of pesticide residue permitted in or on food and feed) or tolerance exemption be in place. EPA was also required to reevaluate older, registered pesticides (i.e., reregistration) and to reassess existing tolerances (i.e., tolerance reassessment) to ensure they meet current safety standards.", "Under the standards introduced by the 1996 amendments to FIFRA and FFDCA (the Food Quality Protection Act, or FQPA; P.L. 104-170 ), EPA establishes tolerances through rulemaking based on risk assessments and human health criteria to ensure a \"reasonable certainty of no harm.\" For pesticides that are not used on food, FIFRA requires EPA to determine whether and under what conditions the proposed pesticide use would present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. ", "Congress has amended FFDCA and FIFRA over time to authorize the collection of fees to supplement appropriated funds for these and related pesticide review activities, in part, as a means of accelerating the pace of the agency's activities to meet statutory obligations. These activities include review of the science when evaluating new pesticide registrations, and the establishment of the maximum residue allowance (a \"tolerance\") as necessary. Also included is EPA's reevaluation of older pesticide registrations and existing tolerances (i.e., \"tolerance reassessment\") to ensure they meet current standards for protecting human health and the environment (see more detailed discussion in the following section of this report).", "The 1954 amendments to FFDCA authorized the collection of fees to provide adequate service for establishing maximum allowable residue levels (tolerances) for pesticides on food. These amendments remain the basis for current \"tolerance fee\" authority. In May 1988, EPA promulgated a rule for collecting registration fees under the authority of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (IOAA) of 1952 (31 U.S.C. \u00a79701). Shortly after its promulgation, the rule was challenged in court by the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association, which questioned the appropriateness of the statutory authority cited. Collection of these registration fees, as promulgated in May 1988, was temporarily suspended through FY1997 by the 1988 amendments to FIFRA ( P.L. 100-532 Section 4[i][6]). The 1988 FIFRA amendments authorized the collection of a one-time \"reregistration fee\" for active ingredients and, through FY1997, annual \"maintenance fees\" for pesticide registered products in an effort to accelerate reregistration (review of pesticides registered before 1984).", "Collecting registration fees as promulgated in May 1988 continued to be prohibited subsequently by the 1996 FIFRA/FFDCA amendments (FQPA) and in provisions of annual appropriations bills, including the PRIA provisions in the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations. In the 1996 amendments to FIFRA and FFDCA (FQPA; P.L. 104-170 ), Congress, concerned with the continued pace of reregistration, extended EPA's authority to collect the annual maintenance fees through FY2001. In addition, in an attempt to provide resources to address increased responsibilities of implementing new safety standards introduced with the 1996 amendments, maintenance fee authority was expanded to allow a portion of the collected revenue to be used to support the reevaluation of \"old\" existing tolerances (tolerance reassessment). These pesticide maintenance fees, along with tolerance fees based solely on petitions for establishing new tolerances, were the only pesticide fees collected by EPA during the eight years (FY1996-FY2003) prior to the enactment of PRIA 1. (A more detailed overview of fee authorities and revenues collected is presented in \" A Historical Overview of Pesticide Fee Authorities ,\" later in this report.)", "Following the enactment of the 1996 amendments and prior to the enactment of PRIA 1, EPA proposed modifications to the pesticide fee structure in annual fiscal year budget requests to significantly increase revenues, primarily to obtain supplemental resources to support increased administrative costs associated with implementing the requirements of FQPA. Proposals generally focused on finalizing a 1999 EPA proposed rule to substantially revise tolerance fees and on a recommendation that Congress discontinue the legislative prohibition on pesticide registration fee authority promulgated in 1988. The proposed 1999 regulation to restructure the collection of tolerance fees was met with similar resistance as the May 1988 EPA registration fee rule. Industry groups questioned the authority to expand fee collection under FFDCA and the lack of a clearly defined schedule of specific agency activities to be supported by fee revenues. These groups also generally opposed EPA's justification for proposing a tenfold increase, requiring retroactive fee payments, and imposing fees for inert ingredients. Congress prohibited promulgation of a tolerance fee rule that was based on the 1999 proposal in EPA's FY2000 appropriations ( P.L. 106-377 ). Similar proposals to increase tolerance fees in EPA's annual budget requests from FY2001 to FY2004 were prohibited through appropriations legislation.", "PRIA 1, enacted in January of 2004, specifically prohibited collection of any tolerance fees, and temporarily replaced (essentially prohibited) \"other fee\" authority through FY2008. Despite this prohibition, similar EPA proposals to authorize collection of additional tolerance fees and other pesticide fee revenue increases were included in the FY2005 through FY2012 budget requests. These proposals were not adopted by Congress for those fiscal years, and at times, prohibited. Language contained in the FY2005 supplemental appropriations for military funding enacted May 11, 2005 ( P.L. 109-13 \u00a76033), specifically banned EPA from going forward with rulemaking for collecting pesticide tolerance fees. PRIA 2 ( P.L. 110-94 ), enacted October 9, 2007, continued the prohibition of other fee authority through FY2012.", "The President's FY2009 through FY2012 budget requests included similar proposals to allow for the collection of pesticide tolerance fees, as well as proposals for a new fee schedule for registration service fees to increase the overall amount of fee revenue collected, and proposals to raise the current limit for the amount of maintenance fees that can be collected annually. The President's FY2013 budget request, submitted to Congress February 13, 2012, did not include similar proposals for supplemental fees. Instead the FY2013 request acknowledged the need for reauthorization of the current fees at increased levels to cover a greater portion of relevant program operating costs.", "As discussed in more detail below, PRIA 3 extends fee collection authority under PRIA 1 and PRIA 2, with modifications, through FY2017, with phase-out authority at reduced levels for certain fees through FY2019, but also amends FIFRA by eliminating historical reregistration fee collection provisions established under the 1988 FIFRA amendments ( P.L. 100-532 ). ", "The funding mechanism in PRIA\u2014using fee revenue to support a particular program to ensure agency performance\u2014has been used in other regulatory programs. For example, the Clean Air Act (CAA) Title V permitting program operates in part using fees collected from permit applicants and permittees, based on authority for EPA and state agencies to collect \"... all reasonable (direct and indirect) costs required to develop and administer the permit program\" (CAA \u00a7502(b)(3)(B)(1); see CRS Report RL33632, Clean Air Permitting: Implementation and Issues , by [author name scrubbed]). As with PRIA, this provision was based in part on a desire to expedite agency actions (i.e., pesticide registration decisions and air permits).

These stakeholders jointly favored the acceleration of EPA's decision process, the simplification of the fee authority, and the detailed schedule of activities determining the allocation of fees collected. The changes reflected in PRIA 2 generally continued to receive similar support from various groups. PRIA 2 amended certain PRIA 1 provisions under FIFRA, most notably the adding 40 new registration application categories and clarifying existing categories, and modifying small business fee waiver options. PRIA 2 also extended the baseline appropriations protection for EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP); if congressional appropriations fell below the amount allocated to OPP for FY2002 by more than 3%, authority to assess fees would be suspended under PRIA 1 and PRIA 2. Noting several key advancements attributed to PRIA 1 and PRIA 2, in July 2012 an array of stakeholders urged reauthorization of PRIA with modifications to further enhance the pesticide registration processes.", "PRIA 3 further revised the schedule of registration application categories (including the addition of new categories and subcategories of existing categories), clarified existing categories, and revised associated fee amounts and review/process decision completion deadlines.

PRIA 3 also added authority for the EPA Administrator to provide a percentage reduction of maintenance fees for certain small business entities, and added new provisions for the enhancement of pesticide decision information tracking systems and for conducting preliminary screening of the content of a registration applications. Unlike PRIA 1 and PRIA 2, which had temporarily suspended the one-time reregistration fee provisions established under the 1988 FIFRA amendments, PRIA 3 amended FIFRA by eliminating these provisions. PRIA 3 also extended the baseline budget protection for the EPA's OPP; however, the minimum baseline for annual congressional appropriations is set at the amount allocated to OPP for FY2012, compared to no less than 3% of the FY2002 level as had been previously defined in PRIA 1 and PRIA 2.", "In addition, PRIA 3", "extended authority to collect \"maintenance fees\" through FY2017; renewed authority for EPA to collect \"registration service fees\" through FY2017, and on a phased out schedule at reduced levels in FY2018 and FY2019.(The phased out schedule applies only to registration fees not maintenance fees); continued the authority for use of funds in the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund to include use for \"registration review\" as stipulated initially under PRIA 2; pesticide registrations are to be reviewed every 15 years, as established under PRIA 2; continued to require EPA to identify reforms to the pesticide registration process to substantially reduce the decision review periods, and to provide annual reports summarizing activities and process improvements; and added a new requirement for EPA to provide a report analyzing the impact of maintenance fees on small businesses to the House Committee on Agriculture and the Senate Committee in Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry by October 1, 2016.

Most notably, EPA has reported that the PRIA 1 and PRIA 2 provisions requiring specific decision process and schedule reforms, in conjunction with increased fee revenues, have led to more timely completion of certain registration applications and the completion of the reregistration reviews. A coalition of industry stakeholder organizations and health and environmental advocacy groups confirm that advancements have been made and supported the enactment of PRIA 3. The prescriptive detailed schedules for the service fees included in PRIA 1 and PRIA 2, and as modified in PRIA 3, are widely deemed more commensurate with the specific EPA actions required than previous legislative provisions related to registration and tolerance fees, which were more generic. Many have noted that the implementation of PRIA 1 and PRIA 2 resulted in improved efficiencies in the overall process, including the completion of reregistration decisions and the reevaluation of older tolerances of those pesticides registered prior to 1988. ", "It is anticipated that PRIA 3's even more prescriptive fee schedule, including additional and consolidated fee categories and subcategories, will likely result in further efficiencies of the processing of registration applications.

Sustained improvement in the efficiency of EPA's decision-making process with the enactment of PRIA 3 is dependent on the agency's ability to continue to establish and effectively implement reforms while maintaining the protection of human health and the environment required by the statutes. EPA continuously develops and refines its scientific protocols and guidelines with input from stakeholders and the scientific community through various public forums.
