Other noteworthy reductions in the proposal included significant cuts in \"Related Programs\" accounts, which fund a number of nongovernmental institutions (see Table 3 ). For example, the FY2018 request sought to end direct appropriations for the Asia Foundation and the East-West Center (the State Department said in its request that these organizations would remain eligible to compete for federal grant funding opportunities and receive private sector contributions). The request also looked to cut the direct appropriation for the National Endowment for Democracy by 39% from the FY2017 actual level (see Table 3 ).

In addition, the Senate measure would have provided around 1% more funding than the House committee bill.

Excluding FY2017 supplemental funding, this proposal marked an increase of 1%. The Department of State maintained that congressional action to fully fund WSP with \"no-year\" appropriations created an ample pipeline of unobligated funds. It added that a large share of the difference between the FY2018 request and FY2017 figure owed to nonrecurrent OCO expenditures. However, the department cautioned that the increasing percentage of recurring DS operations at overseas facilities funded in the WSP account through OCO may present future year challenges, as it anticipated that OCO funding would be significantly reduced in the years ahead. With regard to non-OCO funds, the Administration's $871 million request for DS funds through WSP comprised a $46.4 million net decrease reflecting \"prior-year efficiencies\" and did not make mention of future efficiencies to be realized.

The Administration's $1.14 billion request for ESCM constituted a 62% decrease relative to the FY2017 actual figure of $3.01 billion. However, the department intended to draw on its balance of unobligated funds to increase actual ESCM total direct obligations from an estimated $2.19 billion in 2017 to $2.29 billion in 2018.

The department maintained that these carry-over funds and requested new funds totaling $337.7 million for this purpose for FY2018, and additional funds provided through Machine Readable Visa (MRV) fees would have been sufficient to meet its required share of contributions to CSCS and MCS.

With regard to WSU, the bill would have provided $1.49 billion, or over $1.1 billion more than what the Administration requested. The appropriations report accompanying H.R. 3362 noted that the committee recommendation did not include the Administration-requested authority to use prior year funds to augment its CSCS contribution for the Department of State. The committee instead recommended that the department obligate no less than $956.152 million made available for ESCM in this legislation for its CSCS and MCS obligations.

Despite appropriating less total funds for ESCM than the House committee bill, S. 1780 would have designated far more ($158.82 million, compared to $71.78 million in the House committee measure) for OCO. Within this amount, the Senate committee measure provided $1.30 billion for WSU, or over $900 million more than the Administration's request. The appropriations report accompanying S. 1780 included funding recommendations for several programs and activities funded by ESCM, including $1.12 billion for CSCS and MCS obligations. This indicated that, as with the House committee measure, the Senate bill conflicted with the department's intended approach of using prior-year funds to account for a significant proportion of its FY2018 CSCS and MCS contributions. Among other provisions, the appropriations report also called for making available at least $160.5 million of MCS program funds for the compound renovation project at Embassy Moscow and $32 million of such funds for an American Center at Embassy Moscow. As in the House committee bill, all funds provided under this measure would have comprised no-year appropriations.

While the ESCM appropriation and the House committee measure appropriated identical funds for OCO ($71.78 million), P.L. 115-141 provided a slightly smaller proportion of the broader enduring appropriation ($1.48 billion) for WSU than was provided in the House bill ($1.49 billion). However, the sum of the overall ESCM appropriation ($2.42 billion) in P.L. 115-141 and the House committee measure was identical. The overall appropriation for ESCM was 23% less than the FY2017 actual level for this account. The explanatory statement accompanying this law, as did the appropriations report accompanying S. 1780 , provides $1.12 billion for the State Department's CSCS and MCS obligations, in effect rejecting the department's aforementioned intent to use prior-year funds to meet a large share of its FY2018 contributions.

However, the department did not clarify how much it intended to contribute to individual entities in FY2018.

The Administration's request for the CIO account totaled $996.43 million, a 27% decrease from the FY2017 actual level of $1.36 billion. The department stated that inherent in this request was the expectation that organizations to which the United States contributes would cut costs and distribute funding burdens more evenly across member states. The budget request noted that the department would lead an interagency review of U.S. contributions to international organizations, adding that priority would be given to organizations that \"most directly support U.S. national security interests\" and \"American prosperity.\" The request also provided three means through which the department was considering significantly reducing U.S. contributions to international organizations: (1) reducing the levels of international organizations' budgets, including through cooperating with key allies that have supported previous efforts to limit budget growth; (2) reducing the U.S. assessment rate; and/or (3) possibly not paying U.S. assessments in full.

This amount was an approximately 45% increase compared to the Administration's FY2018 request, a 7% increase relative to the FY2017 actual figure, and a 24% increase from the House committee measure. The appropriations report noted \"the importance of United States engagement with international organizations, including the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the World Trade Organization\" and stated the committee's view that \"fully meeting U.S. commitments to such organizations, combined with robust engagement to promote transparency and accountability to member states, is important to U.S. security and economic interests.\" The report also called on the Secretary of State to provide a cost-benefit analysis of each contribution made to an international organization receiving $5 million or less in the most recent report of U.S. contributions to international organizations. The committee stated that such analysis shall include information regarding \"(1) the extent to which the U.S. contribution and the mission of such organization align with the U.S. national interest; (2) the efficacy and cost effectiveness of the operations and programs conducted by such organization; and (3) whether the organization conducts or funds programs and activities similar to other organizations included in the report, and the extent of any such overlap.\" ", "The $1.47 billion appropriation for CIO in P.L. 115-141 was 8% higher than the FY2017 actual figure, 25% higher than the House committee measure, and 1% higher than the Senate committee measure.

The department asserted that because the United States would not have an opportunity to achieve a reduction in its U.N. peacekeeping assessment rate until December 2018, reduced U.S. funding had to be achieved through reductions in overall U.N. peacekeeping budget levels or reduced U.S. contributions. The department added that while U.N. peacekeeping missions help achieve U.S. government objectives, these missions must be implemented in a more effective manner, enabling them to better \"address conflicts, support political solutions, and meet the needs of the people they are intended to help.\" The request also included a call to other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to join the United States in a strategic review of each peacekeeping mission, and more equitable mission cost sharing among U.N. member states.", "H.R. 3362 would have provided $1.50 billion for CIPA.

The appropriations report noted that the committee recommendation provided the resources necessary to fund the assessed cost of peacekeeping missions at the statutory level of 25%. It also stated the committee's concern about the scope, duration, and costs of U.N. peacekeeping missions and supported U.S. efforts to bring down costs while maintaining U.S. interests and international security.
