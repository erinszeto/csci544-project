The report of the Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States (the Overseas Basing Commission), created by Congress, concluded that the Department of Defense (DOD) plan for withdrawing forces from long-standing garrisons in Europe and Asia is moving too fast and that DOD has not engaged in substantive consultation with other agencies whose operations would be affected by the changes. The funding of the construction of military infrastructure in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq), whether continuing through emergency supplemental appropriations or transitioning to the normal annual appropriation cycle, has also been discussed in hearings. Veteran Benefits: Entitlement spending is rising as the number of beneficiaries is increasing, education benefits are being augmented, and annual cost of living adjustments are being granted. Benefits such as disability compensation, pensions, and education are mandatory payments and constitute more than half ($36.6 billion) of the VA appropriation of approximately $70 billion. Veteran Medical Care: The Administration has again requested legislative changes to increase certain co-payments and other cost-sharing fees for veterans in lower priority categories. After VA announced a shortfall of more than $1 billion from its FY2005 enacted appropriations for veterans health programs, $1.5 billion in supplemental appropriations was added by P.L. 109-54."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Recent Developments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs Appropriations (H.R. 2528)", "paragraphs": ["The House Committee on Appropriations reported its Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill ( H.R. 2528 ) on May 23, 2005 ( H.Rept. 109-95 ).

Instead of including this recommendation in its own list, the BRAC Commission realigned Cannon, directing the Air Force to redistribute the aircraft based there according to its own master allocation plan, but keeping the base open by retaining an enclave on the site and instructing the Secretary of Defense to \"seek other newly-identified missions with all military services for possible assignment\" to Cannon. The recommendation was conditional in the sense that, should no new mission be identified and assigned by December 31, 2009, Cannon shall be closed. During early December 2005, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Moseley informed Senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman that the service was working on finding that new mission.", "Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia . NAS Oceana is a Navy Master Jet Base and home to the Navy's Atlantic Fleet inventory of F-14 fighters and F/A-18 strike fighters. The Secretary of Defense made no recommendation regarding NAS Oceana. Nevertheless, the Commission was concerned that decades of real estate development near the air station could threaten the training and operation of the Navy's air fleet and the safety of the station's surrounding population. It therefore recommended that Oceana be realigned \"by relocating the East Coast Master Jet Base to Cecil Field, Florida, if the Commonwealth of Virginia and the municipal governments of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Chesapeake, Virginia, fail to enact and enforce legislation to prevent further encroachment of Naval Air Station Oceana by the end of March 2006.\" The Commission added other conditions predicated on actions by the State of Florida and the City of Jacksonville, the location of the former NAS Cecil Field, a Navy jet base closed during a previous BRAC round. After facing opposition from community groups, John Peyton, the mayor of Jacksonville, withdrew his support for the plan to reopen NAS Cecil Field.
