Together with local communities, HUD began in 2001 to implement a series of Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS). Two categories of federal fund recipients are required to participate in HMIS: organizations that receive grants through the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program and organizations that receive HUD Homeless Assistance Grants. The HOPWA program provides housing and supportive services for persons living with HIV/AIDS, while the Homeless Assistance Grants fund transitional and permanent housing, as well as services, for homeless individuals.", "Local jurisdictions called \"Continuums of Care\" (CoCs)\u2014typically cities, counties, or combinations of both\u2014are the entities that implement HMIS. Homeless service providers in these CoCs collect and store information about homeless individuals they serve, and the information is aggregated in computer systems at the CoC level. The data in these systems are being used by some CoCs to assess client needs and to better direct their services.", "Congress initially allocated funds for data collection regarding homeless persons in the FY2001 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-377), and has continued to allocate funds in all HUD spending bills from FY2002 through FY2009. Local communities can then apply to HUD for available funds that they may use to implement HMIS. The last time that HUD reported to Congress about the progress of HMIS (in 2007), community implementation of the data systems had increased. According to HUD, 91% of local CoCs were implementing HMIS in 2006 (compared to 72% in 2005), meaning that they had established systems into which data are entered. Because more CoCs were implementing HMIS in 2006, the percentage that were only in the planning stage had decreased from 20% in 2005 to approximately 9%. As of 2006, only 1% of CoCs were not yet planning an HMIS (compared to 7% in 2005).", "HUD released its fourth analysis of data from a sample of participating HMIS jurisdictions\u2014the fourth Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR)\u2014in July 2009. The fourth AHAR used HMIS data from a sample of 222 communities (compared to 98 in the previous AHAR) to derive a national-level estimate of the number of homeless persons from October 2007 through September 2008. The fourth AHAR is the second report in which HUD used data from an entire 12-month period to estimate the number of people who were homeless (the first and second AHARs used three months and six months, respectively). For the first time, then, an entire year's worth of data can be compared to that from the previous year. In addition to the AHAR estimates using HMIS data, local CoCs conduct point-in-time counts of homeless individuals on one day in January at least every two years.

In addition, comprehensive attempts to count homeless individuals were made in both the 1980s and 1990s, first via Census data and then through a national collaborative survey called the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients. However, no systematic method for collecting information about homeless persons has existed until recent years. In response to a directive from Congress in 1998, HUD began in 2001 to develop a system to collect information about homeless individuals; the processes of data collection, organization, and storage systems, which take place at the local level, have been termed Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS).

CoCs are local boards formed by communities\u2014typically cities, counties, or combinations of both\u2014made up of representatives from nonprofit service providers, advocacy groups, local government, and other interested organizations. Local boards identify the needs of homeless persons in their communities and try to ensure that they receive the appropriate mix of preventative assistance, emergency services, transitional housing, supportive services, and permanent housing. Local homeless services providers submit requests for funding to their local CoCs, which each in turn submit single consolidated applications to HUD. As of 2009, there were approximately 450 CoCs, including those in the territories.", "Two types of organizations are required to participate in HMIS: those that receive funding through the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program and those that receive Homeless Assistance Grants.

The Homeless Assistance Grants, enacted as part of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act ( P.L. 100-77 ), consist of both formula grants, which are distributed through the Emergency Shelter Grants program, and competitive grants, which are available through the Shelter Plus Care program, Supportive Housing Program, and Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Assistance for Single Room Occupancy Dwellings program.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, about the time that the Continuum of Care system developed, HUD required applicants for Homeless Assistance Grants to include in their applications information about the number of persons receiving assistance and the type of assistance they received. Initially this was done in narrative form. However, by 2003, the grant application required CoC applicants to complete a housing activity chart that included a point-in-time count of homeless individuals and families receiving services, though HUD did not specify when this count should take place. The 2003 application also asked applicants to categorize subpopulations served, including the number of chronically homeless individuals, veterans, those with severe mental illnesses, those with HIV/AIDS, and victims of domestic violence. Some CoCs used database systems similar to HMIS to keep track of homeless individuals who were served; these predecessor systems are sometimes referred to as \"legacy systems.\"", "The 2005 HUD point-in-time count of homeless persons marked the first time that HUD required all CoCs to conduct a count of both sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals, and to do it at a particular time of year. HUD directed CoCs to conduct a one-night count during the last week of January of both clients who used homeless services and those who were on the street. HUD continues to require CoCs to conduct point-in-time counts every two years, though some CoCs choose to conduct counts every year. For example, in 2008, approximately 67% of CoCs voluntarily conducted counts. The most recent point-in-time count in which all CoCs participated occurred in January 2009.

Specifically, Congress directed HUD to produce an unduplicated count of homeless persons and to collect information about homeless individuals surveyed such as age, race, sex, disability status, health status, and income; the types of services that homeless clients received; and client outcomes such as length of stay in transitional housing, success in acquiring permanent housing, and employment status.

Congress also requested that HUD provide Congress with a report on its findings containing an unduplicated count of homeless persons and a descriptive profile of the population.

In 2008, there was an increase in the proportion of adults in families coming from some type of housing of 7.1 percentage points.

Persons in families continued to stay in emergency shelters a median length of 30 nights. In the case of transitional housing, both individuals and persons in families increased their median length of stay from the previous year.

Conversely, those identifying as White, non-Hispanic/Latino; White, Hispanic/Latino; or those identifying as other racial groups (including those who identify as multiple racial groups) made up larger proportions of persons in families who stayed in emergency shelters more than 180 days in 2008.
