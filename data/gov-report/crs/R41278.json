Health reform was one of President Obama's top domestic policy priorities during his first term, driven by concerns about the growing ranks of the uninsured and the unsustainable growth in spending on health care and health insurance. Improving access to care and controlling rising costs were seen to require changes to both the financing and delivery of health care. This report\u2014one of a series of CRS products on ACA, as amended\u2014focuses on the law's workforce, public health, health care quality, and related provisions. It includes summaries of these provisions, explores some of their implications for health policy, and contains an associated timeline.", "This report is primarily for reference purposes. The material in it is intended to provide context to help the reader better understand the intent of ACA's individual provisions at the time of enactment. The report does not track or discuss ongoing ACA-related regulatory and other implementation activities.", "ACA includes numerous provisions intended to increase the primary care and public health workforce, promote preventive services, and strengthen quality measurement, among other things. It amends and expands many of the existing health workforce programs authorized under Title VII (health professions) and Title VIII (nursing) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA); creates a Public Health Services Track to train health care professionals emphasizing team-based service, public health, epidemiology, and emergency preparedness and response; and makes a number of changes to the Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payments to teaching hospitals, in part to encourage the training of more primary care physicians. The new law also establishes a national commission to study projected health workforce needs.", "In addition, ACA creates an interagency council to promote healthy policies and prepare a national prevention and health promotion strategy. It establishes a Prevention and Public Health Fund to boost funding for prevention and public health; increases access to clinical preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid; promotes healthier communities; and funds research on optimizing the delivery of public health services. Funding also is provided for maternal and child health services, including abstinence education and a new home visitation program. ACA also establishes a national strategy for quality improvement; creates an interagency working group to advance quality efforts at the national level; develops a comprehensive repertoire of quality measures; and formalizes processes for quality measure selection, endorsement, data collection, and public reporting of quality information. It creates and funds a new private, nonprofit comparative effectiveness research institute.", "Other key provisions in ACA include new requirements for the collection and reporting of health data by race, ethnicity, and primary language to detect and monitor trends in health disparities; and electronic format and data standards to improve the efficiency of administrative and financial transactions between health care providers and health plans; programs to prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; a new regulatory pathway for licensing biological drugs shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with a licensed biologic; new nutrition labeling requirements for chain restaurant menus and vending machines."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law a comprehensive health reform law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The following week, on March 30, 2010, the President signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA), which amended numerous health care and revenue provisions in ACA.", "Among its many provisions, ACA restructures the private health insurance market, sets minimum standards for health coverage, and, beginning in 2014, will require most U.S. residents to obtain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty. The law provides for the establishment by 2014 of state-based health insurance exchanges for the purchase of private health insurance. Qualifying individuals and families will be able to receive federal subsidies to reduce the cost of purchasing coverage through the exchanges.", "In addition to expanding private health insurance coverage, ACA requires state Medicaid programs to expand coverage to all eligible nonelderly, non-pregnant individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Under ACA, the federal government will initially cover 100% of the expansion costs, phasing down to 90% of the costs by 2020. Medicaid law allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to withhold existing federal Medicaid matching funds if states refuse to comply with the expansion. However, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , the U.S. Supreme Court found that the Medicaid expansion violated the Constitution by threatening states with the loss of their existing federal Medicaid matching funds. The Court precluded the HHS Secretary from penalizing states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion (see text box). ", "ACA also amends the Medicare program in an effort to reduce the rate of its projected growth; imposes an excise tax on insurance plans found to have high premiums; and makes many other changes to the tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In addition to changes to private insurance and these federal health programs, ACA includes numerous provisions intended to increase the primary care and public health workforce, promote preventive services, and strengthen quality measurement, among other things. ", "ACA is projected to have a significant impact on federal direct spending and revenues. The law includes direct spending to subsidize the purchase of health insurance coverage through the exchanges, as well as increased outlays for the expansion of state Medicaid programs. ACA also includes numerous mandatory appropriations that provide billions of dollars to fund temporary programs to increase access and funding for targeted groups, provide funding to states to plan and establish exchanges, and support many other research and demonstration programs and activities. The costs of expanding public and private health insurance coverage and other spending are offset by revenues from new taxes and fees, and by savings from payment and health care delivery system reforms designed to slow the growth in spending on Medicare and other federal health care programs.", "Implementing ACA also is likely to affect discretionary spending, which is provided in and controlled by annual appropriations acts. The law established numerous new discretionary grant programs and provided for each an authorization of appropriations. It also reauthorized funding for many existing discretionary grant programs. While the authorizations of appropriations for most of these existing programs expired prior to ACA's enactment, typically they continued to receive an annual appropriation. Funding for all these discretionary programs, both new and existing, is subject to action by congressional appropriators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Report Overview", "paragraphs": ["This report\u2014one in a series of CRS products summarizing ACA that were issued after the law's enactment\u2014describes the law's workforce, public health, quality, and related provisions.

The provisions summarized in this report are for the most part found in Title II (Medicaid, maternal and child health); Title III (Medicare, quality of care); Title IV (prevention and wellness); Title V (health workforce); Title VI (comparative effectiveness research, elder justice); Title VII (drugs and biologics); and Title IX (revenues). Title X, which was added as a manager's amendment to the underlying bill, amended (and in some cases repealed) numerous existing provisions in Titles I through IX and added several new provisions. As already noted, ACA was further amended by the companion reconciliation legislation, HCERA. Table A-1 in Appendix A at the end of the report, shows which of the ACA sections discussed in this report were amended by Title X and/or HCERA.", "The summaries of the ACA provisions are grouped and discussed under the following section headings: (1) Health Centers and Clinics; (2) Health Workforce; (3) Prevention and Wellness; (4) Maternal and Child Health; (5) Teen Pregnancy Prevention and Adoption Support; (6) Quality; (7) Nursing Homes and Other Long-Term Care Facilities and Providers; (8) Comparative Effectiveness Research; (9) Health Data Collection; (10) Health Information Technology; (11) Emergency Care; (12) Pain Care Management; (13) Elder Justice; (14) Biomedical Research and Medical Products; (15) Biosimilars; (16) Nutrition Labeling; (17) 340B Drug Pricing; and (18) Medical Malpractice and Liability Reform.

Health centers are a key component of the nation's health care safety net and are required to furnish comprehensive and affordable primary care to the community residents they serve. Health centers also often provide case management, health education, and other supportive services to meet the needs of their patients. Health centers must be located in (or serve) medically underserved communities or populations. Approximately half of all health centers serve rural populations. In order to ensure that services are accessible to the entire community, health centers must treat all patients without regard to their ability to pay. Centers offer sliding-scale fee arrangements based on patients' financial circumstances. Prior to the ACA, there were more than 1,100 health centers operating over 7,500 service delivery sites in every U.S. state and territory. According to HRSA, in FY2008 these facilities served more than 17 million unique patients and responded to over 67 million patient visits. A substantial body of evidence shows that health centers increase access to primary health care services. This helps improve the health of the community by lowering infant mortality, reducing racial and ethnic disparities in health and increasing access to health care, and lowering spending by averting more expensive emergency room visits.", "At the time of enactment some thought that health centers could provide access to care to those who would become newly insured under the ACA. ACA provides a total of $11 billion in supplemental funding for community health centers over the five-year period FY2011 through FY2015. The law creates a multi-billion Community Health Center Fund, from which the Secretary is required to transfer $9.5 billion for center operations and patient services. A separate appropriation provides the remaining $1.5 billion, which is for health center construction and renovation. These ACA funds add to the $2 billion in FY2009 supplementary funds that were provided for the health centers program in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ). The ARRA funds included $1.5 billion for health center construction and renovation, and $500 million for center operations and patient services. In addition to the supplemental appropriations, ACA increases the amounts authorized to be appropriated for health centers under the regular annual appropriations process and permanently authorizes the health centers program. The program had been authorized through the end of FY2012. ", "ACA also appropriates funds for a grant program to establish school-based health centers (SBHCs) and authorizes grants for the operation of such centers. SBHCs are not explicitly authorized in the PHSA, but have been established pursuant to the general authority to establish community health centers. Another ACA provision establishes a grant program to fund the operation of nurse-managed health clinics to provide primary health care to vulnerable and underserved populations. Funding for this program is subject to future action in annual appropriations bills.", "Two additional ACA provisions are summarized at the end of this section. Neither specifically mentions health centers or clinics, though both address access to care among the medically underserved.

Transforming the nation's health care delivery system\u2014from one focused on fragmented specialty care for acute illness to one that places more emphasis on primary care, disease prevention, and the coordination and management of care for chronic illness across settings\u2014will require significant changes in health workforce education and training. Health policy experts are concerned about the current size, specialty mix, and geographic distribution of the healthcare workforce. Certain geographic areas, such as inner cities and rural areas, experience significant healthcare provider shortages. HRSA, which administers most of the federal health workforce programs, estimated that, prior to ACA, an additional 7,000 physicians would be needed in federally designated health professional ", "shortage areas (HPSAs). Existing health care provider shortages are projected to increase based on growing patient demand for services. HRSA estimates that by 2020 there will shortages in a number of physician specialties and nearly 67,000 too few primary care physicians. Additionally, a federal advisory group on the nursing workforce estimates that as of 2000 there was a 6% shortage of nurses and that this shortage is expected to grow to 20% in 2020. Enactment of ACA is likely to further exacerbate health workforce shortages as the newly insured seek health care services. ", "The federal government has a long-standing role in the education and training of the health workforce. PHSA Title VII supports health professions workforce development\u2014including the education and training of physicians, dentists, physician assistants, and public health workers\u2014through grants, scholarships, and loan repayment. Title VII includes a number of programs to support physician training in primary care, including training in rural or otherwise underserved areas, and student loan repayment programs to encourage medical students to enter primary care. Some researchers have found that Title VII programs increase the number of primary providers and the primary care competency of the physician workforce as a whole. Title VII also includes programs to encourage racial and ethnic diversity in the health care workforce. In the early 1970s, annual funding for Title VII programs reached over $2.5 billion (in 2009 dollars); in recent years, it has been about $200 million.", "ACA reauthorizes and expands numerous existing PHSA health workforce programs. The law also creates several new PHSA workforce programs to increase training experiences in primary care, in rural areas, and in community-based settings. Research has found that location and experience during residency training is an important factor in determining future practice. ACA includes programs that provide training opportunities and fellowships to increase the supply of other types of providers with identified shortages such as pediatric subspecialists, public health workers, and geriatricians. Finally, ACA modifies Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payment policy. Medicare subsidizes medical residency training through GME payments to teaching hospitals. ACA's changes to GME payments, along with a new health center grant program and a number of other provisions, are intended to promote primary care training in nonhospital settings.", "The summaries of the ACA health workforce provisions that follow are grouped as follows: (1) National Health Service Corps; (2) physician workforce; (3) dental workforce; (4) nursing workforce; (5) geriatric and long-term care workforce; (6) public health workforce; (7) U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps; (8) workforce diversity training; (9) allied health workforce; (10) mental and behavioral health workforce; (11) health workforce evaluation and assessment; and (12) Medicare GME payments. Each of these sections begins with some additional background and discussion of the impact of ACA's provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Health Service Corps", "paragraphs": ["PHSA Title III authorizes the National Health Service Corp (NHSC) program, which provides scholarships and student loan repayments for medical students, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and others who agree to a period of service as a primary care provider in full-time clinical practice in a federally designated HPSA\u2014a geographic area, population group, medical facility, or other public facility that the Secretary has designated as having an inadequate supply of qualified health care providers (such as physicians, dentists, mental health providers or other health care providers). NHSC clinicians may fulfill their service commitments in health centers, rural health clinics, public or nonprofit medical facilities, or within other community-based systems of care. The NHSC serves as a major source of providers for health centers. HRSA estimates that more than half of NHSC clinicians fulfill their service commitment in a health center. However, there is far more demand for NHSC clinicians than supply. There are also many more clinicians interested in scholarships or loan repayment opportunities than can be met under the program's budget. ", "ACA provides a total of $1.5 billion in supplemental funding for the NHSC over the five-year period FY2011 through FY2015. This funding adds to the $300 million in FY2009 supplementary funds that were provided for the NHSC in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 , ARRA). In addition, ACA increases the amounts authorized to be appropriated for the NHSC under the regular annual appropriations process and permanently authorizes the NHSC program. The program had been authorized through the end of FY2012.", "ACA modifies the NHSC program by permitting NHSC clinicians to fulfill their service commitments through part-time work. It is believed that this strategy may encourage more younger providers, particularly newly graduated physicians interested in work-life balance, to participate in the program. In addition, female physicians, on average, work fewer hours than do their male counterparts. Thus, part-time service opportunities may also encourage female physicians to participate in the NHSC.", "ACA also includes provisions to encourage medical residency training in community-based sites, called teaching health centers (discussed below under \"Physician Workforce\"). These sites include health centers and rural health clinics, two settings that frequently use NHSC providers. As a corollary to this provision, ACA amends the NHSC program to permit its providers to count time spent teaching toward fulfillment of their NHSC service commitment.", "Finally, ACA requires the Secretary to redefine how HPSAs are designated. The HPSA designation\u2014which is currently based on a service area's physician-to-population ratio\u2014determines where NHSC clinicians are placed. Over time, the HPSA designation has been used for other purposes such as to establish preference for federal grants programs administered by HHS. GAO has raised concerns that the methodology used to designate HPSAs does not effectively identify shortage areas and is not updated often enough. HHS has been working since 1998 to develop alternative methodology to designate HPSAs. ACA sets a timeline for developing and finalizing a new HPSA designation methodology. ACA also amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to clarify that amounts received from state-operated loan repayment programs that aim to bring health professionals to shortage areas are not taxable income. Prior to the ACA, amounts received from the NHSC were excluded from taxable income, but amounts received under state programs were not, which reduced the value of the state loan repayment program awards and made participation less attractive to health professionals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sec. 5207.

First, direct graduate medical education (DGME) payments help cover the costs of the residency training program, including resident salaries and benefits, supervisory physician salaries, and administrative overhead expenses. DGME payments are calculated based on the product of three factors: a hospital-specific per resident amount, a weighted count of full-time equivalent (FTE) residents supported by the hospital, and the hospital's Medicare patient share. Second, indirect medical education (IME) payments, which vary with the intensity of a hospital's residency program, are intended to compensate hospitals for the higher costs of patient care in teaching hospitals. Those costs may be the result of such factors as having sicker patients and the fact that inexperienced residents may order more tests. The IME adjustment is a percentage add-on to a hospital's Medicare payments for inpatient care and is based, in part, on the hospital's resident-to-bed ratio. Medicare includes the time that residents spend in both patient care and non-patient care activities, including didactic activities, when calculating DGME payments. When calculating IME payments, however, only the time spent in patient care activities is included. In 2008, Medicare DGME and IME payments totaling an estimated $9 billion were paid to more than 1,100 teaching hospitals to educate and train about 90,000 residents, equivalent to approximately $100,000 per resident. While health policy analysts view Medicare GME payments as a potentially important instrument for influencing health workforce policy, to date they have largely not been used to shape the physician workforce. ", "With certain exceptions, Medicare caps the number of residents used to calculate GME payments for individual teaching hospitals at the level reported at the end of 1996. The cap was implemented because of concerns that there would be an oversupply of physicians. Now with experts concerned that physician supply may be insufficient to meet demand, a number of physician and hospital groups have called for additional Medicare-supported residency slots. ACA increases the number of residents that Medicare supports through provisions that would redistribute unused residency slots and preserve residency positions from closed hospitals, but does not remove the limit on Medicare-supported residency slots. Although Medicare does not set targets for the type or mix of resident physicians that a hospital trains, under ACA the redistributed slots must largely be used for training in primary care or general surgery.", "Medicare allows teaching hospitals to receive DGME and IME payments for the time residents rotate in nonhospital settings provided (1) they are performing patient care, and (2) the hospital pays all or substantially all (i.e., 90%) of the costs of the training at the nonhospital site, costs which include the resident stipends and fringe benefits and those associated with supervising physicians. Time spent in non-patient care activities in the nonhospital setting is not counted when calculating either type of payment. A hospital that jointly operates a residency program with another hospital cannot include the time spent by residents working at a nonhospital site if it incurs all or substantially all of the costs for only a portion of the residents in that program at the non-hospital site. Additional regulatory requirements discourage rotations in nonhospital settings. Moreover, hospitals have a financial incentive to retain the often lower-cost clinical labor that residents provide. While experts see value in having residents gain experience in nonhospital settings such as community health centers and nursing facilities, residency programs today are largely based in inpatient, acute-care teaching hospitals. Some have argued that this may make residents less likely and less prepared to be a community-based provider. Research has found that residents who train in health centers are more likely to provide care to the underserved, including by working at a health center.

Cost-sharing was waived for some, but not all, preventive services. ACA now requires that Part B also cover an annual wellness visit and health assessment, and waive any cost-sharing for almost all previously covered preventive services. In addition, ACA allows the Secretary to modify coverage of preventive services to comport with USPSTF recommendations, including by withholding payment for services that the USPSTF recommends against using. Finally, ACA provides that FQHCs may be reimbursed for providing Medicare-covered preventive services. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Actuary projected that, in aggregate, these expansions of covered benefits will incur a net cost for the Medicare program (although the provision that authorizes the withholding of payments for ineffective services was projected to be cost-saving). These provisions are summarized below in the section \" Prevention Under Medicare .\"", "State Medicaid programs must cover a suite of preventive services under the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Services program (EPSDT) for beneficiaries under 21 years of age. Neither preexisting law nor ACA explicitly require state plans to cover preventive services for adults, although coverage may be required if a service meets another applicable requirement, such as a physician's service. However, ACA requires state Medicaid plans to cover tobacco cessation counseling and drug therapy for pregnant women. In addition, ACA provides for enhanced federal Medicaid matching funds for states that opt to cover without cost-sharing a complete package of preventive services for eligible adults recommended by the USPSTF, as well as recommended immunizations. The CBO and the CMS Actuary projected a net cost to the Medicaid program for the state option to cover adult preventive services, and net savings for the provision that provides coverage of tobacco cessation services for pregnant women. These and additional provisions are summarized below in the section \" Prevention Under Medicaid .\"", "Prior to ACA, federal law did not require private insurers to cover preventive services. Under ACA, group health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and individual markets must now cover specified evidence-based clinical preventive services, including immunizations, without any cost-sharing. Preexisting health plans are \"grandfathered\" and are exempt from this requirement. In addition, beginning in 2014, qualified health plans that participate in insurance exchanges must cover a package of preventive services that are defined by the Secretary.

Previously, the panel recommended that routine screening for women begin at age 40; it now recommends that routine screening begin at age 50 and continue through age 74. The ACA provision negates the November 2009 recommendations and directly affects the expansions of benefits covered under Medicaid and private insurance. Although the Secretary has more discretion with respect to the application of this provision under Medicare, Secretary Sebelius signaled when the revised USPSTF recommendations were announced that she did not intend to change federal coverage policies in response, and Medicare policy continues to provide coverage for annual screening mammography for women beginning at age 40."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wellness Programs Provided by Employers and Insurers", "paragraphs": ["Employers and insurers, faced with rising health care costs, have adopted various strategies to reduce these costs including incentivizing healthy behaviors through wellness programs. Such programs offered by employers may be subject to a number of federal laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the PHSA, and the IRC to improve portability and continuity of health coverage. Prior to ACA, HIPAA created certain nondiscrimination requirements, which prohibit a group health plan or a group health insurance issuer from basing coverage eligibility rules on health-related factors including health status (physical or mental), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability, or disability. In addition, a group health plan or health insurance issuer may not require that an individual pay a higher premium or contribution than another \"similarly situated\" participant, based on these health-related factors. However, HIPAA clarifies that this requirement \"do[es] not prevent a group health plan and a health insurance issuer from establishing premium discounts or rebates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health promotion and disease prevention [i.e., wellness programs].\" ", "The HIPAA wellness program regulations issued prior to ACA divide wellness programs into two categories. First, if a wellness program provides a reward based solely on participation in a wellness program (or if the wellness program does not provide a reward), the program complies with the HIPAA nondiscrimination requirements without having to satisfy any additional standards, as long as the program is made available to all similarly situated individuals. Second, if the conditions for obtaining a reward under a wellness program are based on an individual meeting a certain standard relating to a health factor, then the program must meet additional requirements. Under one of these additional requirements, a reward offered by this type of wellness program must not exceed 20% of the cost of employee coverage under the plan.", "ACA essentially codifies the HIPAA wellness program regulations, but for applicable rewards, it raises the cap on the allowed value of the reward to 30% of the cost of employee coverage, and gives discretion to the Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury to increase the reward value up to 50%. ACA also establishes reporting requirements for certain plans and insurers that implement wellness and health promotion activities; establishes grant programs to assist employers in establishing and evaluating workplace wellness programs; requires the Secretary to evaluate wellness initiatives for the federal workforce; and bars wellness programs from collecting information about the lawful possession of firearms.

ACA provided a total appropriation of $5 billion to this new fund for the period from FY2010 through FY2014, and a permanent annual appropriation of $2 billion for each year thereafter, with the stated purpose \"to provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs to improve health and help restrain the rate of growth in private and public sector health care costs.\" ", "The PPHF and several new grantmaking authorities in ACA (such as the Community Transformation Grants) mark a shift in focus in federal prevention activities, away from disease-specific or \"categorical\" programs (e.g., those for heart disease, cancer, etc.) and toward preventable or modifiable risk-factors for disease, such as poor nutrition, sedentary behavior, and tobacco use. Regular appropriations to CDC have generally been provided for disease-specific activities. However, the agency asserts that this approach is limiting, and has asked Congress for authority to give state grantees greater flexibility in their use of appropriated funds, saying \"The existing resources dedicated to preventing and reducing chronic diseases, conditions and risk factors do not reflect with (sic) the burden of chronic diseases and the risk factors that cause them. Limited resources could be more effectively and efficiently managed if CDC and states were provided with flexibility to use resources to enhance collaborations among key chronic disease and risk factor prevention programs.\" In order to assure the effective application of funding to risk-based rather than disease-based programs, ACA requires reviews, evaluations, and reports for specific prevention programs, as well as a comprehensive review by GAO, at least every five years, of every federal disease prevention and health promotion initiative, program, and agency. In addition, many of the community-based prevention activities authorized in ACA must comport with recommendations of the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (TFCPS). The TFCPS, administered by CDC, conducts evidence reviews to determine the effectiveness of community (i.e., population-based) interventions, using a process similar to that of the USPSTF, discussed earlier.

In addition, a number of approaches that seek to improve the delivery of health care services, and thus both quality and efficiency, had gained attention, including efforts focused on improved coordination of care; the development of new patient-centered care models, for example, medical homes; and the enhancement of patient safety. However, these efforts had not generally been guided by a single federal strategy, entity, or set of priorities or goals, nor had they benefitted from a coordinated infrastructure specifically devoted to improving health care quality.", "ACA employs a multi-faceted approach to improving the quality of health care, which relies for the most part on a collection of incremental steps that together aim to make progress toward addressing the key issues outlined above. ACA specifically leverages three broad mechanisms to improve the quality of health care: ", "1. Codifying a series of provisions which together comprise a national-level approach to the improvement of health care quality, quality measurement, and the use of quality data; 2. Supporting quality improvement and patient safety activities through research support, grants to implement research findings, and educational efforts; and 3. Incentivizing the development or implementation of, or facilitating, a number of health service delivery reforms (such as care coordination through medical homes or other approaches) including those that target quality improvement reforms across the spectrum of payers, including private health insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid. ", "Regarding the first of these mechanisms, the ACA seeks to create a coordinated strategy for quality measurement. Prior to ACA's enactment, health care quality improvement efforts were largely uncoordinated, although in some cases efforts were led by AHRQ and CMS. These efforts\u2014spanning quality improvement activities at the delivery level, measure development, measure endorsement, measure selection and implementation, public reporting of quality data, and inter-agency coordination of health care quality activities\u2014were often linked, but were not systematically coordinated. In addition, progress in these areas was not necessarily being assessed for comprehensiveness. ACA aimed to take steps to address these issues by including a series of five provisions focusing on the development of a national strategy, priorities, and strategic plan to improve health care quality; coordination of health care quality activity at the federal level; measure development and endorsement; public reporting of quality data; and the coordinated selection of measures for use in federal quality programs through a pre-rulemaking process. ", "Regarding the second mechanism, ACA includes provisions that aim to support both quality improvement and patient safety activities. Specifically, ACA includes a provision tasking an existing center at AHRQ with carrying out research on best practices in a number of areas and establishing a grant program to assist entities with implementation and adoption of the research findings of this center. The ACA also includes patient safety related provisions that aim to enhance the education of health care providers in this area and that establish an effort to publicly report on measures for hospital acquired conditions (HACs) that are currently utilized by CMS for the adjustment of payment to hospitals based on rates of hospital-acquired infections; and through provisions that aim to improve the quality and safety of care delivered to nursing home residents. For more information on these provisions, see the section \"Nursing Homes and Other Long-Term Care Facilities and Providers.\" ", "Regarding the third mechanism, health care delivery reforms have often sought to improve the efficiency of the delivery of services, as well as improving the quality or value of service delivery. ACA includes a number of provisions that aim to improve the coordination of the delivery of health care across settings. Many of these provisions specifically focus on patient-centered models of care, such as medical homes, and on improving care for chronic conditions. Specifically, the ACA authorizes funding for several types of programs aimed at enhancing the coordination of care. Some programs seek to improve the delivery of health care services by supporting medical homes, medication management services, primary care extension programs, the co-location of mental and other health services, or community-based collaborative care networks. Others aim to empower patients by facilitating shared decisionmaking among patients, caregivers and providers, or modifying requirements for patient navigator services. The ACA care coordination-related provisions incentivize the improvement of the coordination of care by broadly encouraging reforms in various settings, with different patient populations, with different payer sources, and by attempting to educate and empower patients to improve coordination of their care. Specifically, ACA includes numerous provisions that expand value-based purchasing in the Medicare program; that target improvements in the quality of care provided through the Medicaid program; and which extend to private insurers' quality reporting requirements relating to both covered benefits and reimbursement structures that improve health outcomes and patient safety. The application of health care quality requirements to private health plans governed by the PHSA, ERISA and the IRC, and not as a condition of participation in a public program, is a noteworthy departure from law prior to ACA.", "The following sections provide an overview of the specific provisions related to developing and coordinating health care quality activities at the national level, quality improvement/patient safety related reforms, and health care service delivery reforms related to care coordination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Strategy to Improve Health Care Quality and Quality Measurement", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sec. 3011.

Prior to ACA, Congress established most quality requirements for Medicare-certified SNFs and Medicaid-certified NFs under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA87; P.L. 100-203 ). OBRA87 defined standards that nursing homes must meet in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid payment (called conditions of participation). OBRA87 also contained a range of sanctions that state and federal officials could impose on facilities that failed to meet the federal standards\u2014including civil money penalties (CMPs), payment denial for new admissions, termination from federal health programs, installation of temporary management, and directed plans of action. For example, as a condition for participation, certification, or re-certification, SSA Sec. 1124 requires Medicare and Medicaid entities to disclose full and complete information for each person with ownership or control interest. ", "As part of the shared federal and state responsibility for enforcing SNF and NF quality requirements, CMS contracts with state survey agencies to conduct periodic inspections and investigate complaints, both of which contribute to whether or not SNFs and NFs meet federal standards. Generally, state agencies follow federal regulations for surveying facilities; however, some survey activities and policies are determined by state survey agencies, including hiring and retaining a surveyor workforce, training surveyors, reviewing deficiency citations, and managing regulatory interactions with the industry and public . State surveyors generally first propose sanctions based on deficiencies identified during inspections. CMS regional office officials will then review and implement the state surveyor recommendations. ", "Prior to ACA enactment, there were no provisions in law requiring use of a standardized complaint form. However, there were mechanisms to ensure nursing facilities met certain minimum patient safety and quality standards\u2014standard surveys and complaint investigations. Every SNF or NF undergoes a standard survey at least every 15 months, and the statewide average interval for these surveys must not exceed 12 months. During a standard survey, surveyor teams assess how well SNFs and NFs meet comprehensive federal quality-of-care and fire safety requirements. In contrast, complaint investigations generally focus on specific allegations of substandard resident care or safety violations. Complaint investigations provide an opportunity for state surveyors to intervene promptly if problems arise between standard surveys. Complaints may be filed against a home by a resident, the resident's family, or a nursing home employee verbally, via a complaint hotline, or in writing, but there were not standard reporting forms that helped document the complaint for investigators or helped in collecting comparable data. Surveyors generally follow state procedures when investigating complaints, but must comply with certain federal guidelines and time frames. In resident abuse cases, such as pushing, slapping, beating, or otherwise assaulting residents by individuals to whom their care has been entrusted, state survey agencies may notify state or local law enforcement agencies that can initiate criminal investigations. States must maintain a registry of qualified nurse aides, the primary caregivers in nursing homes. The registry contains any findings where aides were responsible for abuse, neglect, or theft of residents' property, which constitutes a ban from further nursing home employment ban.", "Overall, ACA's nursing home transparency, enforcement, and staff training provisions expand federal quality and accountability requirements for SNFs and NFs. These provisions require SNFs and NFs to disclose ownership and organizational relationships, implement ethics and compliance programs, and report direct care staff expenditures. ACA also requires the Secretary, among other activities, to develop and disseminate a standardized complaint form, refine and update Medicare's Nursing Home Compare website, and implement a national independent monitor demonstration program. In addition, GAO is required to conduct a study and report to Congress on CMS's Five-Star Quality Rating System.

A biosimilar, often called a \"follow-on\" biologic, is similar to a brand-name biologic while a generic drug is the same as a brand-name chemical drug. Chemical drugs are small molecules for which the equivalence of chemical structure between the brand-name drug and a generic version is relatively easy to determine. In contrast, comparing the structure of a biosimilar and the brand-name biologic is far more scientifically challenging. A biologic is a preparation, such as a drug or a vaccine, that is made from living organisms. Most biologics are complex proteins that require special handling (such as refrigeration) and are usually administered to patients via injection or infused directly into the bloodstream. In many cases, current technology will not allow complete characterization of biological products. Additional clinical trials may be necessary before the FDA would approve a biosimilar.", "Congressional interest in an expedited pathway for the licensure of biosimilars is the same as it was for generic chemical drugs in 1984; namely, cost savings. The pathway for biosimilars is analogous to the FDA's authority for approving generic chemical drugs under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 ( P.L. 98-417 ). Often referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, this law allows the generic company to establish that its drug product is chemically the same as the already approved innovator drug, and thereby relies on the FDA's previous finding of safety and effectiveness for the approved innovator drug.", "The generic drug industry achieves cost savings by avoiding the expense of clinical trials, as well as the initial drug research and development costs that were incurred by the brand-name manufacturer. The cost of brand-name biologics is often prohibitively high. For example, the rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis treatment Enbrel costs about $15,000 per year. A pathway enabling the FDA approval of biosimilars may allow for market competition and reduction in prices, though perhaps not to the same extent as occurred with generic chemical drugs under Hatch-Waxman. Based on its analysis of published studies of the impact of follow-on biologics on health care spending, CBO estimates that establishing a regulatory pathway for approving such products would result in a net savings to the federal government of $9.2 billion over a 10-year period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sec. 7001.
