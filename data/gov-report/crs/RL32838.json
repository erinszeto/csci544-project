{"id": "RL32838", "title": "Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR): Votes and Legislative Actions Since the 95th Congress", "released_date": "2016-12-14T00:00:00", "summary": ["Current law forbids the federal government from offering energy leases or from allowing activities leading to energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR, or the Refuge) in northeastern Alaska. For several decades, a major energy debate has been whether to approve energy development in ANWR, and if so, under what conditions, or to continue to prohibit development to protect the area's biological resources. ANWR is rich in fauna, flora, and commercial oil potential. Its development has been debated for more than 50 years, and the level of debate fluctuates with gasoline and natural gas prices, terrorist attacks, infrastructure damage from hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and turmoil in the Middle East.", "This report provides a summary of legislative attempts to address issues of energy development and preservation in the Refuge from the 95th Congress (1977-1978) onward. (The substance of the issue is covered in other CRS reports.) There have been several periods of active congressional consideration, punctuated by periods of less activity and debate. In the 96th Congress (1979-1980), multiple floor votes occurred in the House and Senate, leading ultimately to the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (P.L. 96-487). In the 104th Congress (1995-1996), floor votes related to ANWR development measures contained in budget reconciliation bills occurred in both bodies. These led, eventually, to a presidential veto. The 107th Congress (2001-2002) saw votes in both bodies in the context of measures to address energy resources. Ultimately, no ANWR provisions were approved. In the 108th and 109th Congresses (2003-2006), multiple floor votes occurred in both the House and the Senate, in some cases over amendments that were identical in each Congress. The ANWR development provisions were considered as parts of bills concerning energy programs, budget resolutions, and defense authorization.", "Although no floor votes on the Refuge occurred in the House or the Senate during the 111th Congress, in the 112th Congress, the House approved H.R. 3408 on February 16, 2012. The measure included a provision to open the 1.5 million acre Coastal Plain to energy development. On March 13, 2012, the Senate rejected S.Amdt. 1826 to S. 1813, which would have expanded drilling into areas including the ANWR Coastal Plain. No House or Senate floor votes related to the Refuge occurred in the 113th Congress.", "In the 114th Congress, there were House floor votes that related to the Coastal Plain, either directly or indirectly. One amendment (H.Amdt. 961) to designate the Coastal Plain as wilderness was rejected by the House; three amendments would block funds to implement a wilderness recommendation in a Refuge planning document.

Its 1.5 million acre Coastal Plain on the North Slope of the Brooks Range is viewed by industry as one of the more likely undeveloped U.S. onshore oil and gas prospects. In its last economic assessment in 2005, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that, at $55/barrel (bbl) in 2003 dollars ($72.26 in 2016 dollars), there is a 95% chance that 5.0 billion bbl or more could be economically recovered and a small (5%) chance that 10.9 billion bbl or more could be recovered on the federal lands in the Coastal Plain; the mean estimate was 7.3 billion bbl. (For comparison, U.S. oil consumption from all sources was about 7.1 billion bbl in 2015.) There is a small chance that, taken together, the fields on this federal land could hold as much economically recoverable oil as the giant field at Prudhoe Bay, found in 1967 on the coastal plain west of ANWR. That state-owned portion of the coastal plain is now estimated to have held 11 billion-13 billion barrels of oil at the time.", "The Refuge, and especially its coastal plain, is home to a wide variety of plants and animals.

What factors should determine whether to open the area? If it is opened, how can damages be avoided, minimized, or mitigated? To what extent should Congress legislate special management of the area (if it is developed), and to what extent should federal agencies be allowed to manage the area under existing law?

First, the Committee on Natural Resources reported its version of H.R. 3407 , providing for oil drilling on the Coastal Plain, on February 9, 2012. Then, on February 15, the House adopted H.Res. 547 , a complex special rule proposed by the Committee on Rules to specify how the House would consider the proposals embodied in H.R. 3407 and several other bills. The resolution provided that the House would first take up H.R. 3408 (on development of shale oil resources), as amended with a substitute for the entire text of the measure, in advance of floor consideration. The substitute, specified by the Committee on Rules, included not only H.R. 3408 itself as reported by the Committee on Natural Resources, but also a version of H.R. 3407 (on ANWR development); H.R. 3410 (on the further development of outer continental shelf oil and gas); and H.R. 3548 (authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline, from the Committee on Energy and Commerce).", "After adopting H.Res. 547 , the House proceeded to consider H.R. 3408 in the form specified by the resolution (which included ANWR development), and on February 16, 2012, after considering several floor amendments, passed it (yeas 237, nays 187; Roll Call #71). Pursuant to additional provisions of H.Res. 547 , however, the House did not transmit its version of H.R. 3408 , as amended (with the provisions on ANWR development and other subjects), to the Senate for action. Instead, H.Res. 547 provided that the House would consider first a version of H.R. 3813 (increasing the contributions of federal employees to their retirement program) and then a version of H.R. 7 (reauthorizing federal highway and transportation programs, as amended by inclusion of a version of H.R. 3864 , which would have funded the programs through revenues from, among other things, offshore leasing and any federal share of ANWR revenues). H.Res. 547 did not provide for final action by the House on H.R. 7 . Action on H.R. 7 would have occurred under some future special rule, to be adopted later. H.Res. 547 provided, however, that if the House had passed H.R. 3813 and H.R. 7 , as well as H.R. 3408 , the provisions of all three bills as passed would have been incorporated into H.R. 7 , which would then have been transmitted to the Senate in that form. However, the House did not take up H.R. 3813 or H.R. 7 under the provisions of H.Res. 547 . As a result, H.R. 3408 (including the ANWR development provisions and other matters) did not move forward. ", "On March 13, 2012, the Senate rejected S.Amdt. 1826 (Roberts, Kansas) to S. 1813 that would have opened up the Coastal Plain oil and gas drilling (yeas 41, nays 57; Roll Call #38). Under the Senate agreement of March 7, 2012, approval of the amendment would have required 60 votes in the affirmative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative History of the Refuge, 2013-2014", "paragraphs": ["There were no floor votes in either Chamber during the 113 th Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative History of the Refuge, 2015-2016", "paragraphs": ["On April 3, 2015, the Obama Administration issued a Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) for the Refuge. Although the CCP outlined management plans for the entire refuge, controversy focused on the plan's recommendation that the Coastal Plain be designated as wilderness. Such designation would require passage of legislation by Congress and signature by the President. Given the remoteness of the refuge and the existing prohibitions on energy development in Section 1003 of ANILCA, the recommendation had little effect on existing refuge management. However, concern over any possible future effects resulted in legislative efforts to ensure no effect. On July 7, 2015, the House approved H.Amdt. 577 by Representative Young (AK) on a voice vote. The amendment prevented the use of funds provided in H.R. 2822 to implement the CCP.
