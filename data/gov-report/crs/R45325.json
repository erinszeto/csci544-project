These modifications have affected eligibility, the size of the benefit, and the interactions of the benefit with other federal benefits, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). In nearly every instance, these changes have made the SBP more generous. The program's eligibility requirements and enrollment processes are complex, and modifications over time have added to the complexity.", "The SBP is a $3.7 billion program, administered by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), which provides annuities to approximately a quarter of a million survivors of military servicemembers and retirees. SBP participation and costs have grown over time as Congress has made changes to increase the generosity of the program. SBP coverage is provided at no cost for active servicemembers. Those who die on active duty are generally assumed to have retired with full disability and elected full SBP coverage on the day they die. Military retirees' monthly SBP premiums are generally deducted from the retiree's monthly annuity payment. Because the premiums do not cover the full liability, part of the benefit cost is borne by the government.", "The amount of the annuity is a percentage of the base retired pay a member is eligible to receive, with a maximum of 55% of the base amount of retired pay and a minimum of $300.

As a result, it could be expensive for the retiree. In addition, the decision to elect RSFPP coverage had to be made by the prospective military retiree before his or her 18 th year of military service. As such, the methods used in computing the RSFPP's cost and benefit could change between the time at which the servicemember elected to provide coverage and the time at which the member actually retired. Therefore, the costs and benefits remained an unknown quantity, limiting the ability of the retiree to make future financial plans.

", "The computational formula for determining the amount of retired pay withheld is based on the date the member entered the service and/or the type of retirement the servicemember is entitled to receive (see Table 3 ). The basic formulas are discussed below as the Original Computational Formula and the Flat Rate Formula . Military personnel who entered the service on or after March 1, 1990, and who are not entitled to retired pay under either Chapter 61 of Title 10 United States Code (Retirement or Separation for Physical Disability, also known as disability retired pay), or Chapter 1223 (Retired Pay for Non-Regular Service, also known as reserve retired pay), are to have their withholdings computed under the Flat-Rate method. For those military personnel who first became a member before March 1, 1990, or those who have their retired pay computed under either Chapter 61 or 1223 (regardless of the date of retirement), DFAS is to compute SBP withholdings under the formula (Original or Flat-Rate) that is more financially advantageous to the individual. ", "DFAS generally withhold premiums from retired pay in any month in which there is an eligible spouse (or former spouse) beneficiary. Reductions to retired pay (i.e., SBP premiums) are not considered taxable income. In 1999, Congress expanded the generosity of the SBP by enacting the so-called \"paid-up\" provision. Under this language, reductions in retired pay made to cover the retiree's share cease when two conditions are met: (1) the retiree reaches age 70, and (2) the retiree has participated in the SBP for 360 months. As enacted, these provisions became effective October 1, 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Original Computational Formula", "paragraphs": ["Under this method, the retiree's contribution to the total cost of providing the SBP benefit is computed as 2.5% of a threshold amount (indexed to inflation) of base retired pay plus 10% of the remaining base amount of retired pay. This contribution is withheld from the retiree's total monthly retired pay. For example, a hypothetical retiree who is eligible for the original formula receives a monthly base amount of military retired pay of $1,616 as an E-5 with 20 years of service. The cost of providing survivor protection for this retiree is $101. In other words, $101 is deducted from this hypothetical retiree's base amount of monthly retired pay of $1,616 to insure that upon the retiree's death, his or her surviving spouse will receive a monthly survivor benefit of 55% of his or her base amount of retired pay, or $888 per month. If the retiree received more than $1,616 per month in total military retired pay\u2014say as an E-8 with 20 years of service, or $2,557\u2014but elected to provide less than the maximum coverage (by using $1,616, rather than total retired pay, as the base amount), the computation of costs and benefits would remain the same. If an individual's retired pay increases as the result of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), the amount deducted from his or her retired pay and the potential SBP benefit to his or her designated survivor usually will increase proportionately as well.

The lump sum may either be 25% or 50% of the discounted present value of retired pay entitlement for the time between the date of retirement and the date of social security eligibility. In addition, the retiree is to continue to receive a monthly annuity of the remaining percentage of retired pay (75% or 50%) to which they are otherwise entitled. ", "A participant in SBP who elects the lump sum payment is to have coverage at the full base amount unless the member elects to reduce the base amount. The full base amount will be equal to the amount of the retiree's unreduced monthly retired pay. As such, \"SBP premiums for members who elect lump sums under BRS will be equivalent to what they would have been without the lump sum, and consequently, the survivors' annuities will be equivalent to what they would have been without the lump sum.\" ", "Premiums are to be deducted from the portion of retired pay that the member continues to receive after the lump sum payment. As an example, consider two retirees with base monthly retired pay of $1,616. In this example, both retirees have an SBP monthly premium of $101. If one of the retirees elects a 50% lump sum, he or she will receive an $808 monthly annuity, less the $101 premium payment for a total of $707 monthly. The retiree who does not elect the lump sum will have a monthly annuity of $1,515 ($1,616 with a deduction of $101). However, in both cases, a spouse survivor would receive a survivor annuity of $889 ($1,616 x 0.55).

Consequently, SBP serves a two-fold purpose: (1) to provide full survivors coverage in cases where no Social Security or VA-related benefits are payable and (2) to provide supplemental survivor coverage in cases where Social Security or VA-related benefits are insufficient to provide a reasonable level of support (generally 55% of the servicemember's retired pay).", "When a surviving spouse (or surviving former spouse) is entitled to both SBP and VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), SBP law requires that the SBP benefit be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount of the DIC benefit. If the surviving spouse's DIC benefit is less than the SBP benefit, then the surviving spouse receives a reduced SBP benefit in an amount that, when combined with the DIC benefit, equals the unreduced SBP benefit. If the surviving spouse's DIC benefit is equal to or greater than the SBP benefit, then no SBP benefit is payable and the surviving spouse receives only the DIC benefit. The partial or full reduction in the SBP benefit due to receipt of DIC is commonly known as the SBP-DIC offset . In lieu of receiving full SBP benefits, surviving spouses and surviving former spouses subject to the SBP-DIC offset receive a refund of the deceased retiree's SBP premiums based on the amount of the offset. ", "There is no DIC offset for children who are designated as the SBP recipient. As such, younger surviving spouses of active duty personnel may designate their children, if any, as the recipient of the SBP benefit. Unlike retirees, active duty personnel do not designate a beneficiary. Unmarried children remain eligible to receive SBP until they reach age 18 or 22 (if a student); or for life if mentally or physically incapacitated and if the incapacitating condition existed prior to age 18. Eligibility terminates if the child marries.", "The total of DIC and offset-SBP payments combined is, at least, equal to the full SBP benefit. Also, if DIC is paid to an SBP-eligible surviving spouse or former spouse, a percentage of the deceased retiree's original contributions to the SBP offset by DIC is to be returned to the surviving spouse or former spouse. In other words, if the SBP is offset by DIC, the proportion of deductions from the deceased retiree's retired pay that financed the offset portion of the SBP is to be refunded to the surviving spouse or former spouse. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SBP-DIC Offset and Remarriage", "paragraphs": ["In general, a surviving spouse or former spouse who remarries loses his or her entitlement to DIC payments. Upon losing DIC, however, the remarried spouse or former spouse has his or her full SBP benefit restored, provided the remarriage\u2014in accordance with SBP restrictions\u2014occurs after age 55. SBP payments can be restored, if the beneficiary becomes ineligible for DIC and remains eligible for SBP, provided that any refunded SBP premiums are returned to the government. As a result of a 2009 court decision (sometimes referred to as the Sharp Decision) , surviving spouses who remarry after attaining the age of 57 are eligible to receive the full SBP and DIC benefit without an offset, provided any refunded SBP premiums are returned to the government. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA)", "paragraphs": ["Most un-remarried surviving spouses who receive both an annuity from DOD as a beneficiary of the SBP and from the VA's DIC have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC. Effective 2009, Congress created the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance or SSIA to offset that reduction. The original authorization provided an additional $50 per month to those subject to the offset. This amount was scheduled to be increased by $10 each year until 2014, when it would reach $100. The benefit was scheduled to sunset in 2016. During the 111 th Congress, SSIA was made more generous in that for the years 2014 through 2017, the amount would increase from $150, to $200, $275, and finally, $310, after which the benefit was to terminate on October 1, 2017. However, Section 621 of the NDAA for FY2018, P.L. 115-91 , permanently authorized the SSIA.", "In 2018, the SSIA benefit was $310 per month and is to be adjusted to the COLA for each calendar year beginning in 2019. Both the SBP annuity and the SSIA are taxable while DIC is not taxable income. The amount received under SSIA may not be greater than the amount of the SBP offset. Table 7 shows hypothetical examples of how SSIA might apply to monthly payments to survivors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposals to Eliminate the SBP-DIC Offset", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, several bills have been introduced that would eliminate the SBP-DIC offset completely. Supporters of a full repeal refer to the offset as the \"widow's tax\" , and argue that the benefits are different types of compensation,", "There are two different survivor benefits. The SBP is a purchased annuities benefit, or type of insurance benefit. This is purchased out-of-pocket by military retirees for their surviving spouses. The SBP is our service members' earned benefit, not an entitlement received from the DOD. The other benefit is DIC. DIC is an indemnity payment, received from the VA. DIC serves as an indemnity payment for death. Since death is the ultimate disability the surviving spouses should be entitled to concurrent receipt of both SBP and DIC.", "In addition, military spouse advocates have argued that the inability for families to receive both benefits in full creates financial hardship. Lastly, changes in how the offset is applied based on the status of the beneficiary (i.e., age, remarriage age, or child v. spouse) has led to confusion and charges of inequitable treatment among eligible recipients.", "On the other hand, some point to long-standing laws preventing receipt of two benefits from the government for the same period of service (also known as double-dipping ) . One argument is that because the federal government pays the full DIC cost and subsidizes the SBP coverage, allowing survivors to receive both SBP and DIC is inherently unfair to the taxpayer. Some contend that repealing the SBP-DIC offset would allow certain survivors to triple dip in that they could receive full SBP and DIC benefits as well as Social Security benefits from the federal government for the same period of employment.", "The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC), established by Congress in the FY2013 NDAA, offered another option to address dissatisfaction with the SBP-DIC offset. The MCRMC recommended adding a new SBP option under which members would fully fund the SBP costs, but would no longer be subject to the offset. This option would have higher costs (premiums) for the servicemember, but would provide a greater overall benefit under certain circumstances. Under this option, the legacy, subsidized SBP would remain an option; however, the full SBP-DIC offset would apply.", "Most recently, language in the House version of the FY2019 NDAA would have expressed a sense of Congress that (1) surviving spouses and dependent children will not be subject to a full offset of survivor benefit plan payments by dependency and indemnity compensation; and (2) Congress must work to eliminate the widows' tax entirely. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of eliminating this offset would be $7 billion over the 2010-2019 period.", "Appendix A.
