Congress specifically authorized the states' role in the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71011-1015), and state primacy in insurance regulation has been recognized in more recent laws shaping the financial regulatory system, such as the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA; P.L. 106-102) and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203). The system of multiple state regulators, however, has faced criticism over the years, with frequent focus on its efficiency. One particular aspect of regulation that has been criticized by some as overly burdensome and inefficient is the licensure of insurance agents and brokers, known collectively as insurance producers. Every state requires specific licenses, sometimes with differing criteria, and insurance producers have identified the need to have multiple licenses as a significant expense.", "Organizations such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) create model laws and undertake other steps to harmonize insurance regulation and laws across the country, including the NAIC's promulgation of models for insurance producer licensing. The individual states, however, are sovereign entities, and any models suggested by the NAIC or NCOIL must first be enacted by state legislatures. The state authorities may amend models or completely reject suggestions from outside groups. Often this is done with the argument that laws and regulations need to be adapted to particular local circumstances or risks, such as hurricane risks along coastal areas.", "Federal proposals addressing multiple state insurance producer licensing requirements through the creation of a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) appeared as far back as the 102nd Congress, and a version of NARAB was included in GLBA. These GLBA provisions, known generally as \"NARAB I,\" were conditional and would not come into effect if a majority of states passed laws providing for uniformity or reciprocity in insurance producer licensing. Although a sufficient number of states met the GLBA requirements and thereby prevented the creation of NARAB, insurance producers continued to identify issues in the state licensing system. As a consequence, \"NARAB II\" legislation, mandating the creation of a NARAB organization, has been introduced in every Congress since the 110th. It was passed by the House in the 110th and 111th Congresses.", "In the 113th Congress, the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Act was introduced in both the Senate and the House and similar provisions were included in bills addressing flood insurance and terrorism insurance. Legislation including NARAB II provisions passed both the House and the Senate, but because they differed in some respects, no bill was sent to the President. In the 114th Congress, both the House and the Senate passed NARAB II provisions included as Title II of H.R. 26, which became P.L. 114-1. Under P.L. 114-1, membership in the NARAB organization will permit insurance producers to operate in multiple states without obtaining specific licenses from these states. To become a NARAB member, an insurance producer will be required to have a license from at least one state, pass a criminal background check, and meet other requirements. The law requires that these additional requirements be not \"less protective to the public\" than the NAIC model law on insurance producer licensing. The association is to be governed by a 13-member board made up of 8 current or former state insurance commissioners and 5 insurance industry experts. The President is to appoint the board, with advice and consent of the Senate, and retain the ability to remove the board and override the NARAB organization's rules or actions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Insurance Regulation and Federal Legislation", "paragraphs": ["The individual states have been the primary regulators of insurance in this country for the past 150 years.

Individual states typically require insurance producers operating within their borders to obtain a license from that state, with different licenses often required for different lines of insurance. Such licensure provides a mechanism for insurance regulators to enforce standards of conduct, particularly with regard to consumer protections, as well as a revenue source to help defray the cost of the insurance regulatory system. Aspects of insurance producer licensing include specific education or knowledge requirements, such as passage of a written exam prior to licensing and continuing education afterward, and, in some states, criminal background checks. ", "The NAIC has adopted model laws regarding licensure and a model insurance producer license form, but individual states are free to modify such models, or not adopt them at all, resulting in variability in licensing requirements across the country. The number of insurance producers potentially affected by the variability of state licensing laws appears relatively large; in one survey, 83% of producers reported having licenses in at least 2 and up to 10 states. Larger insurance agencies tend to hold a greater number of licenses, with 47% of the firms of more than 500 financial advisors having licenses in 21 or more states. Insurance producers that operate in multiple states have long sought increased uniformity and reciprocity across states to reduce their costs resulting from the multiplicity of license requirements. Insurance producers report, for example, that, on average, 3% of agency operating expenses are spent on \"licensing compliance efforts,\" with higher figures (4.3%) at the smallest agencies. Although insurance producers consider the multiplicity of licenses to be a burden, others consider the requirements for local licenses and knowledge of specific local risks or legal requirements to be important consumer protections by others. One consumer representative has argued, for example, that \"[property and casualty] insurance varies too much state to state as respects law and risk to not maintain local control of licensure.\"", "GLBA attempted to address the multiplicity of different requirements among states for insurance producer licensing. Although many states satisfied the GLBA statutory requirements for reciprocity by 2002, insurance producers continued to identify inefficiencies and costs of the state licensing system in the years following. In 2008 testimony before a House subcommittee, for example, an insurance agent representative indicated that states continued to \"impose additional conditions and requirements\" on nonresident agents despite the reciprocity called for in law. In 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) cited issues regarding fingerprinting and background checks as particular barriers to uniformity or reciprocity in producer licensing and as potentially creating uneven insurance consumer protection in states in which full-background checks were not able to be performed. GAO also determined that differences in licensing requirements and insurance line definitions could potentially be creating inefficiencies that \"could result in higher costs for insurers, which in turn could be passed on to consumer[s].\" In addition to concerns about the substance of the reciprocity in place, reciprocity laws have not been adopted by every state. The NAIC ultimately certified 47 states as reciprocal, but the 3 states not certified\u2014California, Florida, and Washington\u2014together represented nearly 20% of the nation's population.", "In addition to the costs that might result from the specific aspects of the insurance licensing system, any professional licensing regime acts as a barrier to entry for those who might be interested in providing services that require a license. Economic theory suggests such barriers increase consumer costs to some degree and have the potential to be used as a protectionist measure to prevent competition, allowing license holders to extract economic rents from consumers. Whether the public benefits resulting from licensure outweigh the costs is determined by policy makers on a case-by-case basis. Some form of licensure for those in the financial services industry has been generally accepted and is required in federal law for people involved in securities transactions with the public, for example."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act in the 114th Congress", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "H.R. 26/P.L. 114-1, Title II", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 26 in the 114 th Congress was identical aside from technical corrections to the amended version of S. 2244 that passed the House in the 113 th Congress.
