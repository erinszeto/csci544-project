", "With respect to \"forum shopping,\" U.S. IIAs typically provide that an investor cannot seek local remedies in the form of monetary compensation after consenting to arbitration under the agreement. For example, under the 2012 Model BIT, an investor must, as a condition of pursuing a claim under the ISDS provisions, agree to waive \"the right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of either Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach ...\" except to the extent that the investor seeks interim injunctive relief during the pendency of the arbitration.

A party to the dispute challenges the qualification of an arbitrator by submitting its concerns to the Secretary General; the arbitrator in question has the right to respond to such a submission.

", "It appears that many challenges to an arbitrator's qualifications to sit on a tribunal arise from prior existing relationships between the arbitrators and the disputing parties. For example, one arbitrator, in 2013, was disqualified from Blue Bank v. Venezuela because the arbitrator in question was a partner at a law firm that was representing the claimant in a different ISDS proceeding against Venezuela that dealt with issues similar to the case he was set to decide. However, tribunals have also held that \"the mere existence of some professional relationship with a party is not an automatic basis for disqualification of an arbitrator.\" In one case, the arbitrator in question advised the disputing parties that one of the partners in his law firm had worked for the claimant-company's predecessor on an unrelated tax issue but the panel did not find this relationship warranted disqualification. ", "However, prior relationships with disputing parties are not the only reason that an arbitrator can be disqualified. Arbitrators can also be removed from a panel if they have biases against the law in dispute or the specific subject at issue. One such example, involving a successful challenge, came when the United States, during a NAFTA arbitration conducted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, challenged the appointment of an arbitrator who had previously given a speech on the U.S. law at issue in the dispute. The arbitrator, in his speech, referred to the U.S. law in question as \"harassment.\" The ICSID Secretary General, who was authorized to make the final determination on the issue as the appointing authority, informed the arbitrator that ICSID would be issuing an opinion upholding the challenge. In response, the arbitrator resigned and the ICSID did not issue a written opinion on the matter.", "In cases where the qualification of an arbitrator has been challenged under the ICSID rules, tribunals have held that the requirement that an arbitrator be able to provide \"independent judgment\" means that the arbitrator must \"be both independent and impartial.\" At least one tribunal has held that the analysis for independence and impartiality are separate questions. An analysis of independence requires examination of whether the arbitrator has a relationship with one of the disputing parties, while the impartiality of an arbitrator concerns whether he or she is biased toward one of the disputing parties. Therefore, despite differences in language, both the UNCITRAL and ICSID Arbitration Rules require arbitrator independence and impartiality.", "Tribunals have differed in their interpretation of the ICSID Convention disqualification language \"manifest lack of the qualities required.\" Some tribunals have interpreted this in a way that imposes a high burden of proof on the party attempting to disqualify an arbitrator. That tribunal noted that in order to show a \"manifest lack\" of impartiality, the party would have to show a clear or obvious inability for the arbitrator to judge impartially. In a similar vein, another panel provided that \"the party challenging an arbitrator must establish facts, of a kind or character as reasonably to give rise to the inference that the person challenged clearly may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment in the particular case where the challenge is made.\" On the other hand, other tribunals appear to have interpreted the provision to impose less of a burden on the challenging party. One tribunal stated \"if the facts would lead to the raising of some reasonable doubt as to the impartiality of the arbitrator or member ... a challenge by either party would have to be upheld.\" This tribunal's use of a \"reasonable doubt\" standard appears to contradict other tribunals' requirement that a party \"clearly\" or \"obviously\" demonstrate that an arbitrator would be biased.

The Mauritius Convention opened for signature on March 17, 2015 and provides for the Rules on Transparency to apply to IIAs entered into by both parties prior to April 1, 2014 by stipulating that if both parties have signed the Mauritius Convention, they will be deemed to have agreed to apply the Rules on Transparency to such IIAs.

It appears that the first instance of an arbitration tribunal accepting amicus briefs during an investor-state arbitration occurred in 2001 in Methanex Corp. v.

In that case, the tribunal determined that it had the power to allow submission of third-party briefs pursuant to the tribunal's authority under Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to \"conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate.\" Since that case, there have been significant changes to both the ICSID and UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to provide for third-party submissions.", "The ICSID Arbitration Rules were amended in 2006 to permit submission of amicus briefs expressly.

For example, in Biwater Gauff Ltd. v.

When considering whether to grant the petition, the tribunal must consider if the non-party has a significant interest in the proceeding, if the submission would assist the panel in deciding factual or legal issues related to the proceeding, and if the submission would address an issue within the scope of the case. At least some tribunals have held a broad view with regard to the requirement that the submission be within the scope of the dispute at issue.

To the contrary, it arguably makes it all the more important that each tribunal renders its case-specific decision with sensitivity to the position of future tribunals and an awareness of other systemic implications.", "Thus, the extent to which investment arbitration tribunals follow precedent remains within each tribunal's discretion.

The interpretation provided the following with regard to the MST:", "1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.", "2. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.", "3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).", "The interpretation sought to clarify and reaffirm that the host country's MST obligations depend on the content of customary international law, which, in this case, looks to how other countries have treated aliens in the past out of a sense of legal obligation ( opinio juris ). However, tribunals appear to disagree over what constitutes an authoritative source of customary international law, including whether prior arbitral awards or provisions of other investment treaties may represent authoritative sources. The 2012 Model BIT includes language similar to the NAFTA Free Trade Commission's interpretation.", "Thus, despite attempts to clarify the MST obligation by state parties to IIAs and tribunals, its precise content remains unclear, even under NAFTA. For example, tribunals disagree over whether the customary international law standard remains \"frozen in time\" at the high threshold established in the 1926 case of Neer v. United Mexican States , or whether the standard has evolved over time. However, NAFTA tribunals seem to agree that to violate the MST, a host country does not necessarily have to act in bad faith. It also appears that violations of an investor's \"legitimate expectations\" regarding host country treatment of its investment may result in a breach of the MST only if the host country created the expectations to induce the investment and the investor relied on the host country's representations.

Direct expropriation of an investment occurs when the host country deprives the investor of the value of its investment by, for example, transferring title in the investment to the state. By contrast, an indirect expropriation occurs when the investor retains title to the investment but cannot make economic use of the investment for a significant period of time because, for example, of government regulations that substantially interfere with the investor's use of the investment. ", "As with tribunals' interpretations of the MST, some observers raised concerns about early NAFTA decisions interpreting the legal standard for indirect expropriation. For example, in Metalclad Corp. v. Mexico , the tribunal wrote that an indirect expropriation includes \"not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\" To address concerns raised by these decisions, the 2012 Model BIT contains an annex that specifically spells out the factors a tribunal must consider when determining whether an indirect expropriation has occurred. These factors mirror those in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Penn Central , a case that determined the test for regulatory takings under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The factors consist of:", "(i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;", "(ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and", "(iii) the character of the government action.", "An investor's reasonable expectations have played a key role in the outcome of arbitral decisions on expropriation. As with many of the NAFTA tribunal decisions involving the MST, for an indirect expropriation claim to succeed, an investor's reasonable investment-backed expectations must generally result from \"targeted\" promises made by the host state to the investor regarding treatment of its investment. However, when the law in a particular field is uncertain, the investor may have difficulty establishing that it had reasonable investment-backed expectations regarding regulation of its investment. In addition, when an investor enters a heavily regulated field (e.g., manufacture and sale of tobacco products), it may expect that its investment will be further regulated.", "Recent U.S. IIAs have specifically provided that nondiscriminatory regulatory measures generally do not result in indirect expropriations.

A measure of a host country (e.g., a law, regulation, or practice) may discriminate against a foreign investor or investment on its face ( de jure discrimination) or when applied to the investor or investment ( de facto discrimination). Some U.S. IIAs require that a host country provide the investor or investment with the better of national treatment or MFN treatment for the full life cycle of the investment.", "To establish a national treatment violation under an IIA, one NAFTA tribunal has indicated that a claimant must show that the investors or investments \"(i) were accorded treatment by the Respondent with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments; (ii) were in like circumstances with the identified domestic investors or investments; and (iii) received treatment less favourable than that accorded to the identified domestic investors or investments.\" Similarly, to prove a violation of MFN treatment, the claimant must establish the same criteria, except that \"the applicable comparator in step (ii) above is a foreign (non-US based) investor or its investments.\"", "As indicated above, a key element in establishing a violation of these nondiscrimination provisions involves identifying a comparator \"in like circumstances\" with the claimant or its investment. A tribunal determining whether a comparator is \"in like circumstances\" with the investor or investment must typically engage in a fact-specific inquiry. At least one NAFTA tribunal has held that the host country must regulate a comparator in the same manner as the claimant or its investment. ", "One controversy involving the MFN treatment standard is whether an investor may claim that it deserves treatment accorded to foreign investors under provisions in another IIA in force for the host country. In ADF Group Inc ., a Canadian investor argued that it should be able to import the purportedly more favorable MST from the U.S.-Albania BIT and U.S.-Estonia BIT into NAFTA. The tribunal appeared to acknowledge that the investor was entitled to the MST in these BITs; however, it disagreed with the investor that these BITs established a more favorable standard for the investor. In a more recent NAFTA arbitration, a tribunal declined to decide the issue but noted that the NAFTA parties agree that the MFN clause cannot be used in this manner.

Although, to date, the United States has yet to lose a claim brought against it under an IIA, if it were to lose a claim in the future, the arbitration panel would not be able to amend, void the application of, or repeal the laws of the United States.", "Moreover, the United States has negotiated agreements that limit the remedies that an arbitration tribunal may award. For example, in both NAFTA and the 2012 Model BIT, the ISDS provisions state that a tribunal may award only monetary damages and/or restitution of property. Furthermore, if a tribunal elects to award restitution of property, the respondent state has the option of paying monetary damages in lieu of such restitution.

In addition, by limiting the available remedies, these provisions preclude an arbitration tribunal from requiring amendment, repeal, or passage of any statute or regulation in U.S. law.", "However, a tribunal's inability to change the laws or regulations of the United States directly does not mean that arbitration awards cannot be substantial.

The tribunal rendered that award, which is one of the largest awards in favor of a claimant under ISDS arbitration, after finding that Ecuador violated an investment agreement by expropriating Occidental's property in response to Occidental transferring some of its economic interests under an oil production contract in contravention of Ecuador law. Therefore, although a tribunal lacks authority to alter a U.S. statute directly, some commentators believe that the possibility for such large monetary damages potentially could influence lawmakers and regulators when they consider proposed laws or regulations that may run afoul of IIA obligations.
