A number of infectious disease outbreaks over the past decade, such as H5N1 avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have heightened concerns about how infectious diseases might threaten global security. International air travel and trade have complicated efforts to detect and contain infectious diseases. People could cross borders carrying a highly contagious disease before an infectious agent causes symptoms.", "Non-health officials are becoming increasingly aware of the threat that infectious diseases pose. An event that illuminated the issue occurred in May 2007, when a man known to be carrying a drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (TB) crossed a number of international borders unabated. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that someone contracts TB every second and that about one-third of all people in the world carry TB; most of these cases, however, are latent. In 2006, an estimated 14.4 million people were living with TB globally, including 9.2 million who contracted the disease that year. About 1.7 million people carrying TB died in 2006, including 200,000 people co-infected with HIV/AIDS. About 80% of all estimated new TB cases arising in the world each year occur in 22 high-burden countries (HBCs).", "WHO indicates that the global incidence of TB per capita peaked around 2003 and since then, incidence per 100,000 population stabilized in Europe and declined in all five WHO regions, although the absolute number of new cases increased between 2005 and 2006 in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Southeast Asia. In sub-Saharan Africa, weak health systems, minimal access to health facilities, insufficient staffing and little human resource development, ill-equipped and substandard laboratories, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) co-infection have limited countries' ability to contain TB.", "In FY2008, Congress funded U.S. global TB operations at unprecedented levels. Through FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations, Congress provided $162.2 million to international TB programs and an additional $840.3 million for a U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria (Global Fund). The House passed and the Senate Foreign Relations Committees reported out companion TB bills, Stop TB Now Act (H.R. 1567 and S. 968) to support global TB efforts and authorize $330 million in FY2008 and $450 million in FY2009. They also authorized $70 million and $100 million for anti-TB programs at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in FY2008 and FY2009, respectively. Although Congress voted to increase support for global TB efforts, some Members expressed concern that the additional funds might be provided at the expense of other global health programs. The Administration requested $97.1 million for FY2009 global TB efforts, some $55 million less than appropriated in FY2008.

In 2003, when the disease was ultimately contained, scientists called the agent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). That same year, Influenza A/H5N1 (bird flu) reemerged and spread to more than 50 countries. As of April 17, 2008, 381 people have contracted H5N1, 240 of whom died.

Those with active TB who do not receive treatment and are not properly quarantined infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people every year.

Among the 15 countries with the highest estimated TB incidence rates, 13 were in Africa, due in part to relatively high rates of HIV co-infection (see Table A-2 in the Appendix ). In 2006, about 3.10 million people in Southeast Asia were newly infected with TB (109 per 100,000 people) and about 2.81 million in sub-Saharan Africa (363 per 100,000). The actual number of TB-related deaths and the mortality per capita rates were higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in Southeast Asia. About 514,699 people died of TB in southeast Asia (30 per 100,000 infected), while some 639,089 people died of TB in sub-Saharan Africa (83 per 100,000 infected).

People living with HIV/AIDS are at greater risk of contracting TB because of their weakened immunity. Each disease accelerates the advancement of the other. TB considerably shortens the survival of people with HIV/AIDS and quickens the progression of HIV into AIDS. Meanwhile, HIV/AIDS is the most potent risk factor for converting latent TB into active TB. Many people infected with HIV/AIDS in developing countries develop TB as the first manifestation of AIDS. The two diseases represent a deadly combination, since they are more destructive together than either disease alone. Other key facts about HIV/AIDS-TB co-infection include:", "In HIV-positive people, TB is harder to diagnose, progresses faster, is almost always fatal if undiagnosed or left untreated, and kills up to half of all AIDS patients worldwide; People with HIV/AIDS are up to 50 times more likely to develop TB in a given year than HIV-negative people; and About 90% of people living with HIV/AIDS die within four to twelve months of contracting TB if they are not treated for TB.", "In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS and TB co-infection is becoming a growing problem. In 2006, about 85% of all HIV-positive people with TB were found in Africa. That year, an estimated 709,000 people were co-infected with HIV/AIDS and TB, some 606,000 of whom were African. About 205,000 of the 231,000 co-infected patients who died from TB were African, representing 89% of those deaths. In countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, HIV/TB co-infection poses a significant health challenge. In Swaziland, for example, 75% of TB patients were HIV-positive. South Africa, with 0.7% of the world's population and the most number of people living with HIV/AIDS, had 28% of all HIV/TB co-infection cases and 33% of HIV-positive cases in sub-Saharan Africa.", "In many high-burden countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, TB patients are not yet routinely tested for HIV, and HIV patients are not yet routinely tested for TB. HIV testing for TB patients has increased, however, between 2002 and 2006. In 2002, nine countries reported testing 21,806 TB cases for HIV, representing less than 1% of notified TB cases. By 2006, 112 countries had reported testing 687,174 patients for HIV, equivalent to about 12% of notified TB cases. In Africa, 287,945 patients were tested for HIV\u2014some 22% of all notified TB cases. In Africa, HIV testing of TB patients increased from 7.5% to 35% from 2004 to 2006. The testing increase was driven primarily by Kenya and South Africa. In spite of improvements in HIV testing in Africa, the region still lagged behind other countries.

Drug resistance mostly arises from poor treatment adherence or incorrect drug usage. Adherence means taking accurately prescribed drugs in the right amounts at the correct time. If the wrong drugs or the wrong combinations of drugs are prescribed, providers fail to ensure that they are taken correctly on schedule, or patients do not take their medicine for the full term, TB may become resistant to the drugs.", "The development of MDR-TB is particularly troubling to scientists, because MDR-TB carriers can transmit resistant forms of TB to others. MDR-TB is transmissible, even among those who have never had TB. Research has indicated that patients are less likely to complete regimens for treatment-resistant forms of TB, in part, because resistant forms take longer to cure. Non-resistant forms of TB take between six and nine months to cure, while MDR-TB takes about two years to cure. MDR-TB treatments are also more toxic, more expensive, often of limited availability in resource-limited settings, and generally less effective, especially among HIV-positive people. If patients adhere to treatment regimens, cure rates for non-resistant TB range between 80% and 95%; cure rates for MDR-TB range between 50% and 60%.", "WHO advises that health care providers treat MDR-TB patients in separate facilities than those with HIV/AIDS. Separating MDR-TB patients from HIV/AIDS", "patients can be particularly challenging in resource-limited settings, where hospitals are frequently overcrowded, ill-equipped, and unable to house individuals for the entire treatment term. In areas with high HIV-prevalence, efforts to care for MDR-TB patients separately from HIV/AIDS patients are often complicated by the high proportion of hospital beds filled with HIV/AIDS patients.", "In February 2008, WHO released a report on TB drug resistance that summarized findings from surveys conducted between 2002 and 2006 in 81 countries. Based on those surveys, WHO estimates that almost 490,000 MDR-TB cases emerged in 2006, representing about 5% of all new TB cases\u2014though MDR-TB rates varied widely from 0% in some western European countries to over 35% in some former Soviet states. Among the 490,000 MDR-TB cases, 285,718 were new cases and 203,230 had been previously treated.", "WHO estimated that, of the countries for which adequate data exist, China, India, and Russia are estimated to have the highest number of MDR-TB cases. China and India hold about 50% of all MDR-TB cases and Russia comprises another 7%. Russia has the greatest proportion of MDR-TB cases among new ones, however. About 13% of all new TB cases were MDR-TB, 19% of all TB cases were MDR-TB, and almost 50% of previously treated TB cases were identified as MDR-TB. Although no other HBC reported equally high MDR-TB rates, a number of Eastern European countries are estimated to have greater proportion of MDRT-TB prevalent rates. WHO has identified 27 countries, which together account for about 86% of all global MDR-TB cases; 15 of them are in Eastern Europe (see Figure A-1 and Table A-3 in the Appendix ).", "Although WHO's report provided greater insight into the prevalence of drug resistant forms of TB, little is known about resistance in Africa. The findings included in the report were estimated to have measured about one-half of all drug-resistant TB cases, because the surveys were conducted only in those countries with the capacity to conduct drug resistance surveys. Such capacity remains limited in Africa. Findings from six countries in sub-Saharan Africa were included in the analysis (Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Rwanda, Senegal, and Tanzania). Data from South Africa were included in the illustrations and tables throughout the report, but not in the analysis, because WHO used a different methodology to analyze data previously collected from South Africa.", "Based on available data, WHO estimates that in 2006, some 2% of all TB cases were MDR-TB in Africa, 7% in the Western Pacific Region, and 19% in Eastern Europe (see Table A-4 in the Appendix ). WHO asserts that although it can use available data to approximate the global burden of MDR-TB, it cannot detect global changes in MDR-TB prevalence, because data in many high-burden countries are unavailable, incomplete, and/or have only recently begun to be compiled. The organization can, however, extrapolate trends in key areas. WHO found that MDR-TB cases declined in China and the United States; were stable in Thailand, some parts of Vietnam, and three Baltic countries; and increased in the Republic of Korea and Peru. In Peru, a decline in TB notification rates suggests weaknesses in TB control. In Korea, the TB burden is shifting to the elderly and the number of MDR-TB cases among new TB cases is increasing. Two regions in the Russian Federation are showing increases in the proportion of MDR-TB among new cases at a very rapid rate, while the TB notification rate in those regions is falling slowly.", "WHO has indicated that similar outbreaks of drug resistance with associated high mortality are likely occurring in other African countries but are going undetected because of insufficient laboratory capacity. MDR-TB patients are not yet routinely checked for HIV/AIDS in Africa, though they are extremely susceptible to the disease. Botswana, Mozambique, and South Africa are reportedly the only countries in sub-Saharan Africa that routinely test drug-resistant TB cases for HIV.

In high-quality health facilities, XDR-TB treatment is successful in 30% of the cases. In low-resource settings, XDR-TB is almost always fatal. WHO is uncertain about the extent of XDR-TB prevalence, in large part because drug resistance testing to second-line drugs is not available in most high-burden countries. The majority of countries that reported XDR-TB cases to WHO were low-burden countries and do not reflect the global magnitude of the phenomenon. WHO estimates that XDR-TB is widespread, with 45 countries having reported at least one case.", "A survey conducted by WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on data from 2000-2004 found that XDR-TB occurs in all regions of the world, but most frequently in the countries of the former Soviet Union and Asia. In the United States, 4% of MDR-TB cases met the criteria for XDR-TB. In Latvia, a country with one of the highest rates of MDR-TB, 19% of MDR-TB cases met the XDR-TB criteria.", "Concern about the spread of XDR-TB rose in May 2006 when an outbreak caused several deaths in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. Many health experts were alarmed by the high mortality rates. South African officials invited CDC and WHO to assess the situation. Five hundred forty-four patients were studied; 221 were diagnosed with MDR-TB, including 53 cases determined to be XDR-TB. Forty-four of the 53 XDR-TB cases were tested for HIV/AIDS; all were HIV/AIDS-positive. Only one of the 53 patients with XDR-TB survived.

More than a century after its development, in most developing countries, TB is primarily identified through microscopic examination of sputum. This tool, however, only detects from 40% to 60% of TB cases, and as little as 20% of HIV co-infected cases. Although sputum testing has limited reliability, this procedure is the most widely used in developing countries and is usually performed only after TB treatment has failed\u2014after which the patient could have transmitted the disease to others. About 85% of all countries who reported TB testing practices to WHO indicated that all suspected pulmonary TB cases undergo sputum testing. Of the 22 HBCs, 7 did not meet the minimum requirement of at least one sputum testing laboratory per 100,000 persons (see Table A-7 in the Appendix ).", "Health experts also advocate for improved access to advanced testing technology, because sputum tests do not reliably detect smear-negative TB cases, particularly among HIV-positive patients. Culturing, a process requiring laboratory diagnosis, is the most definitive method of detecting TB, particularly in smear-negative cases. WHO recommends that countries have at least one laboratory per 5 million people that is capable of culturing samples. Seven of the 22 high-burden countries meet this minimum requirement: Brazil (5.1), Cambodia (1.1), China (1.4), Russia (34.0), South Africa (1.3), Thailand (5.1), and Vietnam (1.0) meet this criteria. South Africa is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that meets this criteria.", "In order to prescribe medications properly, laboratories must be capable of conducting drug susceptibility tests (DST). Prescribing the wrong medication or dosage not only minimizes the effectiveness of TB treatments, but can also lead to drug resistance. WHO recommends that countries have at least one DST lab per 10 million people. Of the 22 high-burden countries, Bangladesh and Nigeria have no DST labs, nine countries have one DST lab to serve their entire population (about one-third of high-burden countries), and nine meet the minimum of one per 10 million people: Brazil, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and Vietnam.", "In many countries, patients might experience lapses in TB treatments, because clinics might not have the medicines in stock. Irregular drug deliveries are often caused by poor data collection, deficient road and transport conditions, and poor-quality distribution systems. Inconsistent use of medication can reduce the potency of TB treatments, extend the term of use, and result in drug resistence. Health advocates argue that in order to boost the impact of TB programs, congressional support for TB efforts must be accompanied by funding of health systems, including laboratory systems.", "The African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2007 ( H.R. 3812 / S. 805 ) aims to address some of these issues. The bills authorize funds to improve health care capacity on the continent. Related activities include training African health care workers, providing incentive to retain health worker, and establishing off-site HIV/AIDS testing and treatment facilities for health care providers. The bill also requires the President to develop a strategy that would coordinate health-related strategies with other donors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Address Health Worker and Health Center Shortages", "paragraphs": ["Shortages of properly trained health care workers and sufficiently equipped health centers in high-burden countries, particularly in Africa, complicate efforts to properly contain and treat TB cases. Most of the 22 high-burden countries do not have enough health workers to meet the most basic health care needs, including identifying and treating TB cases and monitoring drug usage (see Table A-8 in the Appendix ). In addition, many health centers are unable to contain airborne infections like TB.", "High HIV prevalence in some parts of Africa further complicates shortage issues, because HIV and TB patients are usually housed within close proximity of each other in poorly equipped facilities. WHO maintains that in order for countries to effectively control TB and prevent increases in MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases, HIV/AIDS and TB patients should be housed separately and teams of health workers should be trained specifically to manage drug resistance and work in hospitals or isolation units dedicated to TB patients. Another challenge is that in some countries with high HIV prevalence, a significant number of health workers are HIV-positive, posing a risk to themselves and their patients. WHO contends that all of these issues converge to cause the extremely high mortality in KwaZulu-Natal.", "It is widely understood that MDR-TB is caused in large part by poor treatment adherence. Health worker shortages lessen the likelihood that the dispensing of medication will be properly supervised. WHO fears that the inability to manage sufficiently first- and second-line treatments will lead to a rise in XDR-TB cases.

Early diagnosis and treatment of both diseases can extend life expectancy and, in the case of TB, decrease transmission rates. Greater awareness about the intersection of these diseases has led many health practitioners to routinely test TB patients for HIV. While WHO applauds those efforts, it has expressed concern that HIV patients are not yet routinely tested for TB in most high-burden countries. WHO asserts that countries could significantly improve TB case identification if health professionals would routinely test all those newly diagnosed with HIV for TB. Proponents of this idea contend that the practice could ameliorate outcomes of HIV and TB programs, reduce overall program costs, and make TB and HIV/AIDS efforts more efficient. In FY2006, OGAC reportedly spent nearly $50 million on TB efforts in the 15 Focus Countries and about $120 million on addressing HIV/TB co-infection in FY2007. Health advocates urge Congress to increase funding for programs that integrate HIV/AIDS and TB responses.

The low quality of some health facilities in high-burden countries complicates arguments about involuntary detention. A number of individuals being forcefully isolated in South African health centers reportedly held protests and walked out of facilities, complaining of poor treatment and prison-like conditions. One patient was reportedly shot while attempting to leave the premises. Several provinces in South Africa have reportedly taken legal action to force drug resistant TB patients to stay in hospitals in isolation units surrounded by wire fences and protected by guards.", "The South African Medical Research Council (MRC) asserts that forcibly quarantining individuals is a complicated issue, because MDR- and XDR-TB patients might never be cured (MDR- and XDR-TB are difficult to cure in low-resource settings), forcing the patients to be confined until death.

About 10 million South Africans\u2014about 25% of the population\u2014receive some form of social welfare.
