Public entities that provide broadband service can be local governments or public utilities, for example, and may construct and manage broadband networks either solely or in partnership with private companies. There are a number of municipal broadband models that have been implemented across the nation. Since each community is different and each faces unique challenges, there is no one size that fits all.", "Municipal broadband is controversial, because it involves governmental entities entering a commercial telecommunications marketplace that had previously been the exclusive domain of private sector providers. Supporters of municipal broadband argue that in view of substandard broadband service, communities and local governments should be able to provide this service to meet their citizens' needs and to support the community's economic development. Municipal broadband opponents argue that public entities are ill-equipped to efficiently develop, operate, and maintain commercial broadband networks, and that municipally owned and supported broadband networks constitute unfair competition to private sector providers, which may ultimately impede private investment in broadband infrastructure.", "With under 500 municipalities across the nation embarking on some form of municipal broadband, 20 states have passed laws placing restrictions (or in some cases, bans) on local broadband networks. The issue for Congress is whether municipal broadband should be promoted or discouraged, and more specifically, whether those state restrictions on municipal broadband should be overridden or affirmed.", "On March 12, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting the petitions filed by two municipal broadband providers in Wilson, NC, and Chattanooga, TN, to preempt state laws in their respective states that restricted the expansion of community broadband services. The Order and the decision by the FCC to rely on Section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act for its authority remain controversial. Both states filed petitions for review consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals, 6th Circuit, Cincinnati, challenging the FCC's authority to preempt these restrictions. The court, in an August 10, 2016, decision, reversed the FCC's Order.", "Four bills (S. 240, S. 597, H.R. 1106, and H.R. 6013) were introduced and one draft measure was released in the 114th Congress addressing the municipal broadband debate, but none of these measures were enacted. The role of municipal broadband and the appropriate role of the states and the FCC to address the relationship between the public and private sector is just one facet in the overall debate regarding broadband deployment.

", "While broadband deployment has been rapid and robust overall, there are parts of the nation where broadband is less deployed (primarily rural areas) and there remain regions and communities that are dissatisfied with the level of broadband service currently offered by private sector providers. These communities point to problems ranging from low download and upload speeds, obsolete technology, poor reliability, high prices, and/or a lack of choice in providers. With the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) moving to define the minimum speed of broadband at 25 Mbps, more communities may perceive a lack of adequate broadband service, especially those communities in rural areas.", "As a solution, some communities have turned to public entities as possible broadband providers.

Municipal broadband models can include public ownership, public-private partnership, and a cooperative model. ", "With public ownership , the local government is the principal entity building, financing, and operating the broadband network. The network can be run by the local municipal electric utility (Chattanooga, TN, and Lafayette, LA, are examples), or it can be run by a city department such as the information technology (IT) department (as in Santa Monica, CA). There are also instances where a publicly owned and built network might be opened to private providers to provide retail Internet access or other services to the public. ", "Public-private partnerships can come in many different forms, from public and private sector entities sharing capital and operations costs, to governments providing access to public rights-of-way or other city infrastructure (e.g., conduits, pole attachments) for privately funded and operated networks, to government-funded projects contracting with private providers to build, operate, and/or maintain the network. Partners can include private for-profit companies, local nonprofits, and even local residents.", "Finally, there is a cooperative model , which refers to electric and telephone cooperatives, many of which were originally created during rural electrification in the 1930s. These cooperatives, in rural areas, have begun in some instances to provide broadband service. Many of the cooperatives providing broadband service have received or are eligible for federal loan and grant support from the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). There are also a few cooperatives that have been recently formed specifically for providing broadband service. These typically rely on support from local governments and include the East Central Vermont Community Fiber Network (ECFiber) and the WiredWest project in western Massachusetts.

Municipal networks", "may provide wholesale service (\"middle-mile\" infrastructure, where retail providers connect into the municipal network), \"last mile\" retail service directly to customers, or both; may provide service solely to anchor institutions or also include businesses and residences; may serve solely within municipal boundaries or may be extended to surrounding municipalities and counties; may provide data or data bundled with video and/or voice, or may include smart grid capacity; and while most recent and proposed municipal broadband projects utilize fiber infrastructure, other broadband technologies such as wireless or cable have also been deployed.

Many local communities cite low speeds, high prices, a lack of competition, or even an absence of any broadband service in particularly sparsely populated areas, and argue that they should be able to provide this service to meet their citizens' needs and to support the community's economic development. Pro-municipal broadband arguments include ", "Municipal broadband can enable small and mid-sized municipalities, often in rural areas, to offer higher download and upload speeds. This is especially important given that the FCC continues to identify a persistent \"digital divide\" between rural areas (where 53% of Americans do not have broadband speeds of at least 25 Mbps download/3 Mbps upload) and urban areas (where only 8% do not have access to those speeds). Overall, 16% of American households are in areas without a single provider of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps fixed services. Municipal networks can inject competition in markets where there may be a limited number of providers. According to the FCC, 45% of households have only a single provider of broadband offering 25 Mbps/3 Mbps. A lack of competition can lead to high prices, poor customer service, limited and restrictive service packages, and delayed or no investment in advanced technologies such as ultra-fast gigabit networks. A municipal broadband network, in some cases, can induce private providers to lower prices and increase speeds in order to compete. Municipal broadband can address unmet public interest needs. Private providers tend to favor middle- to upper-income households which will generate adequate revenue. Municipal broadband entities that are publicly owned may be more likely to offer broadband to low-income households at affordable prices. Municipal broadband follows the tradition of municipal utilities, which have been providing basic utilities such as water, natural gas, and electricity for many years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arguments Opposed to Municipal Broadband", "paragraphs": ["The main argument against municipal broadband (typically referred to by some opponents as \"government-owned broadband\") is that it is inappropriate for government-sponsored, -owned, or -supported networks to compete with private providers. Municipal networks have unfair inherent advantages over existing private networks, including preferential treatment with respect to rights of way and other local regulatory barriers, and financing by direct taxpayer subsidies or government bonds with below-market interest rates. This advantage can result in market-distorting effects that can unfairly skew the competitive playing field between private and public providers. Anti-municipal broadband arguments include", "Deploying broadband systems is inherently high-risk, because unlike basic utilities like water or electricity, there are typically competing providers and not all customers will necessarily sign up for service. Governments can be ill-equipped to plan, operate, and maintain efficient commercial broadband systems, and if they fail, the taxpayers will be liable for the cost of that failure. Taxpayer money should more appropriately be directed toward basic infrastructure needs\u2014such as roads, bridges, and water systems\u2014that are traditionally under the purview of government. In the United States, broadband is primarily provided by the private sector. Public money that is directed toward municipal broadband is money that is taken away from other, more critical infrastructure needs. According to the FCC, \"private industry continues to invest billions of dollars to expand America's broadband networks.\" Because of the market-distorting effects of municipal broadband, continued private sector investment in broadband networks might be discouraged in some cases. The broadband market is subject to rapid technological change and intense competition. The bureaucracy of government is not well suited to making policy decisions in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. This poses the risk of municipal broadband networks being reliant on soon-to-be obsolete technologies.

With hundreds of municipal broadband projects to choose from, there will always be examples to fit whichever definition of \"success\" or \"failure\" that observers choose to apply. In general, municipal broadband supporters point to projects that have provided improved services, lower prices, increased competition, and an improved climate for private-sector investment in the local economy. Municipal broadband opponents cite examples where government-owned networks have not been profitable, have discouraged private competition, and have been subject to managerial inefficiency or technological obsolescence.", "In some cases, both proponents and opponents of municipal broadband have cited the same municipal broadband project to bolster their arguments. For example, in 2005, the community of Lafayette, LA, voted to build a municipal fiber network called LUS Fiber. LUS Fiber, financed by bond revenues, was built in 2008 and connected to its first customers in 2009. ", "According to the White House report Community-Based Broadband Solutions: The Benefits of Competition and Choice for Community Development and Highspeed Internet Acces s , LUS Fiber's network has increased customer savings and strengthened local anchor institutions: ", "As competing firms adjusted their plans to account for LUS Fiber's market entry, residents who weren't customers of the network started to see lower prices. Cox Communications, a major regional provider which had raised rates six times in four years, kept its rates stable from 2004 to 2007 to account for LUS's possible market entry. Still, LUS's prices have been consistently lower than those offered by Cox. Terry Huval, the director of LUS, estimates that the community saved $4 million from these deferred rate increases. Using estimates of Cox's average competing discounts and LUS Fiber's lower rates, LUS projects the fiber system will create total savings of between $90 and $100 million over its first 10 years. ", "The fiber network has brought in companies eager to obtain fast service at lower prices. Pixel Magic brought 100 to 200 jobs when it built an office in Lafayette to accomplish work on the movie \"Secretariat.\" The high speed capability of the broadband network was a big factor in their eventual decision to maintain their office in Louisiana permanently. The tech startup firm Skyscraper Holding moved from Los Angeles to Lafayette to obtain 100 Mb/s speeds at a fraction of the cost the company was charged on the west coast. ", "Municipal broadband opponents have a different take on LUS Fiber, stating the network is 30% short of its revenue projection as set out in its business plan, more than $160 million in debt, and struggling to compete with cable, telephone, wireless, and satellite service providers in terms of price, performance, and service options. The think tank R Street noted that LUS Fiber received a warning from city auditors about low revenues and stated:", "Lafayette's auditors voiced similar concerns in their reports the last two years. In 2012, they punctuated it with a calculation that the $140-million system was costing the city $45,000 a day. ", "Now, after six years of operation, prospects aren't much better. The city's financial reports, provided by a source in Lafayette, show that for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, 2013, LUS Fiber reported $23 million in operating revenues, compared to $36.7 million that was forecast in its feasibility study. The system incurred a $2.5 million operating loss for the year. According to the original plan, this was to be the point where the operation swung to a profit of $902,000. The most staggering number, however, is LUS Fiber's deficit, which stood at $47 million at the end of October, up from $37.1 million the year before."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Role of the Federal Communications Commission", "paragraphs": ["The FCC, an independent federal agency charged with regulating interstate and international communications, has taken an active role in promoting the deployment of broadband services and broadband infrastructure.

These barriers are in clear conflict, the Order states, with Section 706, which directs the FCC to take action to remove such barriers. More specifically the Order concludes that in the case of the EPB petition \"the territorial restriction in Tennessee Code Section 601 is a barrier to broadband deployment and infrastructure investment and limits competition.\" With regard to the Wilson petition, the Order concludes that the geographic restrictions and other, but not all of the remaining provisions of North Carolina law cited in the petition, when considered holistically, represent a barrier to broadband infrastructure investment or thwart competition. Therefore the Wilson petition is granted in part to the extent discussed in the Order and otherwise denied.

That is, the FCC cannot require a state to allow municipal broadband networks, but it can preempt laws that impose restrictions on an existing network if they are creating barriers to deployment of such networks.

These include loans and grants for broadband infrastructure deployment; universal service reform; tax incentives to encourage private sector deployment; regulatory and deregulatory measures; and spectrum policy to spur roll-out of wireless broadband services. Some of these policies may be considered in the context of efforts to rewrite the Communications Act of 1934. To the extent that Congress may consider the various options for promoting broadband, a central issue is how to strike a balance between providing government support for broadband in areas where the private sector may not be providing acceptable levels of broadband service, while at the same time minimizing any deleterious effects that government intervention in the marketplace may have on competition and private sector investment."], "subsections": []}]}}
