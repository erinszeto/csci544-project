Plants use sunlight to convert CO2, water, and nutrients into sugars and carbohydrates, which accumulate in leaves, twigs, stems, and roots. Plants also respire, releasing CO2. Plants eventually die, releasing their stored carbon to the atmosphere quickly or to the soil where it decomposes slowly and increases soil carbon levels. However, little information exists on the processes and diverse rates of soil carbon change.", "How to account for changes in forest carbon has been contentious. Land use changes\u2014especially afforestation and deforestation\u2014can have major impacts on carbon storage. Foresters often cut some vegetation to enhance growth of desired trees. Enhanced growth stores more carbon, but the cut vegetation releases CO2; the net effect depends on many factors, such as prior and subsequent growth rates and the quantity and disposal of cut vegetation. Rising atmospheric CO2 may stimulate tree growth, but limited availability of other nutrients may constrain that growth.", "In this context, timber harvesting is an especially controversial forestry practice. Some argue that the carbon released by cutting exceeds the carbon stored in wood products and in tree growth by new forests. Others counter that old-growth forests store little or no additional carbon, and that new forest growth and efficient wood use can increase net carbon storage. The impacts vary widely, and depend on many factors, including soil impacts, treatment of residual forest biomass, proportion of carbon removed from the site, and duration and disposal of the products. To date, the quantitative relationships between these factors and net carbon storage have not been established.", "Some observers are concerned that \"leakage\" will undermine any U.S. efforts to sequester carbon by protecting domestic forests. By leakage, they mean that wood supply might shift to other sites, including other countries, exacerbating global climate change and causing other environmental problems, or that wood products might be replaced by other products that use more energy to manufacture (thus releasing more CO2). Others counter that the \"leakage\" arguments ignore the enormous disparity in ecological systems and product preferences, and discount possible technological solutions.", "Several federal government programs affect forestry practices and thus carbon sequestration. Activities in federal forests affect carbon storage and release; timber harvesting is the most controversial such activity. Federal programs also provide technical and financial help for managing and protecting private forests, and tax provisions affect private forest management.

Bush signed this treaty, which was then ratified by the U.S. Senate.", "Subsequent negotiations led to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, under which the developed nations agreed to specified reductions in their emissions of greenhouse gases. President Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol, but did not submit it to the Senate for ratification. Early in 2001, the George W. Bush Administration decided to reject the Kyoto Protocol, and withdrew from active participation in negotiations on the issues that remain to be resolved. Although enough other parties have ratified the Protocol to bring it into force, the lack of U.S. involvement means that the United States will not participate in the emissions trading or other elements of the Kyoto Protocol activities that might relate to carbon sequestration.", "The most voluminous greenhouse gas produced by humans is carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). In calculating overall carbon emissions, the Protocol allows certain removals of carbon by a nation's forests and soils\u2014\"carbon sinks\"\u2014to be counted and deducted from emissions. Thus, one option for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions\u2014and thus possible climate change\u2014is to increase the amount of carbon stored in forests.", "Carbon sequestration, and the extent to which it can be counted as a reduction in a nation's carbon emissions, have been the focus of substantial controversy in international negotiations subsequent to the Kyoto Protocol. The United States, with its extensive forests, argued that the carbon absorbed by them should be allowed to offset emissions, with no quantitative limit to the amounts that can be counted in this way. The European Union argued strongly in negotiations prior to 2001 that there should be fairly strict limits on how much carbon absorbed by \"sinks\" such as forests could be counted against emissions. In final negotiations during 2001 on rules to implement the Kyoto Protocol, after the United States had withdrawn from the negotiations, a compromise was reached that allows significant credit for carbon sinks (removals and storage of carbon). The Members of Congress attending the negotiations prior to 2001 followed this debate with interest, and were aware of the potential impacts of the various possible results of the negotiations. In particular, if emissions trading were to begin under the Kyoto Protocol, forest owners and managers in countries that were parties to the treaty might be able to receive credits and participate in the trading regime.", "Administration and congressional interest in carbon sequestration continues, but U.S. participation in the Kyoto process is moot at this time. It is not clear whether a domestic forest carbon program might be established, although options have been discussed in legislative proposals. Protecting forests in developing countries, which might earn credits under the Kyoto Protocol, is already supported under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act ( P.L. 105-214 ; 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72341, et seq.).", "Mitigating climate change by enhancing forest carbon sequestration may be a relatively low-cost option and would likely yield other environmental benefits.

Nonetheless, as more photosynthesis occurs, more CO 2 is converted into biomass, reducing carbon in the atmosphere and sequestering (storing) it in plant tissue (vegetation) above and below ground.", "Plants also respire, using oxygen to maintain life and emitting CO 2 in the process. At times (e.g., at night and during winter seasons in non-tropical climates), living, growing forests are net emitters of CO 2 , although they are generally net carbon sinks over the life of the forest.", "When vegetation dies, carbon is released to the atmosphere. This can occur quickly, as in a fire, or slowly, as fallen trees, leaves, and other detritus decompose. For herbaceous plants, the above-ground biomass dies annually and begins to decompose right away, but for woody plants, some of the above-ground biomass continues to store carbon until the plant dies and decomposes. This is the essence of the carbon cycle in forests\u2014net carbon accumulation (sequestration) with vegetative growth, and release of carbon when the vegetation dies. Thus, the amount of carbon sequestered in a forest is constantly changing with growth, death, and decomposition of vegetation.", "In addition to being sequestered in vegetation, carbon is also sequestered in forest soils. Carbon is the organic content of the soil, generally in the partially decomposed vegetation (humus) on the surface and in the upper soil layers, in the organisms that decompose vegetation (decomposers), and in the fine roots. The amount of carbon in soils varies widely, depending on the environment and the history of the site. Soil carbon accumulates as dead vegetation is added to the surface and decomposers respond. Carbon is also \"injected\" into the soil as roots grow (root biomass increases). Soil carbon is also slowly released to the atmosphere as the vegetation decomposes.

Some forests begin on spacious sites, with little or no existing vegetation, that may have been cleared by a natural disaster (most commonly wildfire) or by human activities (e.g., for agriculture). Other forests are relatively continuous, with natural clearings typically limited to the area occupied by one or a few large trees killed by lightning, disease, and such. Regardless of the size or origin of a clearing, most forests begin from essentially bare land, with some carbon stored in the soil (how much depends on the environment and history of the site, especially the last clearing process).", "As trees and other woody plants become established, carbon stored on the site increases as woody biomass increases and as annual vegetation (e.g., tree leaves and herbaceous plants) typically grows faster than it decomposes. Productivity for commercially usable wood generally follows an S-shaped curve, with the volume growing at an increasing rate for many years, to a point known to foresters as the culmination of mean annual increment (generally taking 20 to 100 years or more, depending on the fertility of the site and the tree species), and then growing at a decreasing rate for many more years. In theory, forests can eventually become \"over-mature,\" where the loss of commercial volume through tree mortality equals or exceeds the additional growth on the remaining trees. However, one study has shown that some old-growth (\"over-mature\") forests continue to accumulate carbon in their soils.", "The relationship between commercially usable wood produced and carbon sequestered varies substantially in three ways. First, the proportion of carbon in a tree's commercial wood (compared to the noncommercial biomass in bark, limbs, roots, and leaves or needles) varies among species; some (e.g., pines and other conifers) have a greater proportion of their total carbon in commercial wood. Second, the proportion of carbon in a tree's commercial wood undoubtedly changes over time; while a temporal graph of carbon storage is probably also S-shaped (as for commercial wood productivity), the changes in timing and rates of increase (that cause the characteristic S shape) almost certainly differ. Finally, a significant portion of the vegetative carbon sequestered in a forest is in other plants\u2014noncommercial species of trees, shrubs, grasses, and other herbaceous plants. The amount of carbon stored in this other (noncommercial) growth varies widely among forests. Thus, although many research studies assume a fixed relationship between commercial wood inventories and the amount of carbon stored, the traditional measures of commercial wood production might not be very accurate for estimating carbon sequestration in forests.", "Eventually, trees die. They may be cut down, burned in a wildfire, blown over or snapped off in a wind or ice storm, or killed by insects or diseases. Death can happen to a single tree in a forest, creating a small opening, or to all or most trees in an area. How quickly the carbon is released to the atmosphere depends on the cause of tree death, on whether it is harvested for use, and on various environmental factors. As noted above, fires quickly break down biomass and release an enormous amount of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Natural death and decay may require several weeks to several decades to completely decompose the biomass (depending on site conditions), putting some carbon into the soil and some directly into the atmosphere. Timber harvesting can store some vegetative carbon for very long periods in solid wood products with long-term uses (e.g., construction lumber in houses), while tree tops and limbs and noncommercial species are left to decay or to be burned.

Tropical deforestation, if a pasture replaces the forest, could release carbon and substantially reduce carbon sequestration, since tropical savannahs store less than half as much carbon on average as tropical forests. In contrast, in temperate zones, forest conversion to native grasslands would likely release carbon but might actually increase carbon sequestration, since temperate grasslands store 50% more carbon on average than do temperate forests.

Slash treatments include rolling, chopping, and crushing, all of which are designed to compact the biomass and accelerate its deterioration, which typically takes several weeks to several years, depending substantially on the climate. Burning is also common, and leads to deterioration (and release of some of the carbon to the atmosphere) in minutes or hours, rather than weeks, months, or years.

The dead carbon in the soil (i.e., not the decomposers or fine plant roots, which comprise the living carbon in the soil) slowly continues to decompose, changing from organic to inorganic forms; the inorganic forms eventually (1) dissolve in percolating rainwater and leach through the soil into groundwater and surface waters; (2) oxidize and get released directly to the atmosphere; or (3) are absorbed by new vegetation.

This study found that thinning only increased total carbon storage in dense, young stands where severe competition significantly reduced growth rates; in other cases, the practice was \"redistributing stand growth to a smaller number of larger trees,\" with little overall change in carbon storage. The author also noted that thinning may increase the loss of soil carbon, by reducing canopy cover and disturbing the surface and thus accelerating decomposition rates. In contrast, release in a southern pine ecosystem was found to increase total carbon storage over the life of the stand, and to promote soil carbon storage. Thus, forestry practices that reduce vegetative competition apparently increase carbon sequestration in some circumstances, but not in others, limiting generalizations about their potential for increasing carbon sequestration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Growth Improvement", "paragraphs": ["Other forestry practices are also intended to increase tree growth rates. Pruning removes the lowest branches of a commercial tree, which may stimulate some upward growth, but generally emphasizes wood value (growing clear wood, without knots) rather than growth. It is not used much, because it has been found to be unprofitable in most situations.", "Fertilizing forest stands is another practice to increase tree growth. Applying fertilizers to forests can significantly increase growth rates, if the nutrient being applied (nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, etc.) is in short supply in the forest soil. Furthermore, fertilization is likely to stimulate all vegetative growth, not just tree growth. This is borne out in research on the impact of forestry practices on carbon sequestration. An important question, whose answer is not apparent from the research, is whether the accelerated growth rate from fertilization persists for a long time (i.e., whether the growth rate remains higher for an extended period), whether it produces a short-term increase for which the pre-fertilized rate is sustained for a long time (i.e., whether the pre-fertilization growth rate is maintained after the short-term increase); or whether other factors limit long-term growth rates (i.e., whether growth rates after the short-term increase are less than the pre-fertilization growth rates, because other nutrients are overdrawn by the fertilizer-stimulated growth).", "Some have suggested that greater atmospheric CO 2 levels could fertilize forests, stimulating tree growth. A number of studies artificially increased CO 2 levels in tree plantations, and found that growth rates did increase; others, however, question whether the increased growth rate can be sustained. At the broader scale, in at least some areas, other nutrients (especially nitrogen) are likely to limit the ability of forests to expand growth with more CO 2 available.", "Another forestry practice, which is becoming more widely used, is prescribed burning\u2014intentionally setting fires in certain forest areas under specified weather and fuel conditions. Prescribed burning typically produces many forest benefits, including less competing vegetation (akin to release or thinning), lower fuel loads that may contribute to catastrophic wildfires, and a flush of nutrients (since fire reduces biomass to its mineral components). However, prescribed fires also present a risk, since they occasionally escape from the prescribed areas and can cause damage; they also generate substantial amounts of carbon dioxide (one of the mineral components of biomass) and other air pollution. In the short term, prescribed fires clearly increase atmospheric carbon levels. To the extent that prescribed burning reduces catastrophic wildfires, this practice may be shifting one source of carbon emissions (wildfire) to another (prescribed fire); however, to date, no quantitative relationship has been established between prescribed burning and the extent and severity of wildfires. In addition, at least for dead biomass on a site, prescribed burning merely concentrates into a few minutes or hours the carbon release that otherwise occurs over a few weeks to a few years in other forms of biomass decomposition. Thus, it is not clear how much of the carbon release from prescribed burning is in addition to the carbon release that might otherwise occur from forests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timber Harvesting", "paragraphs": ["For wood that has been removed from the forest, the rate of carbon release depends on what is done with the wood. For sawtimber (logs of at least 11.5 inches in diameter), about half is converted into solid wood products (primarily lumber and plywood); another 10% is bark, and the remaining 40% is sawdust and wood scrap. Lumber and plywood have differing usable lives, depending on the use of the wood, and ranging from less than 10 years for shipping pallets to 100 years or more for residential construction. Clearly, some wood\u2014broken pallets, furniture, concrete forms, etc.\u2014is disposed in landfills (and probably sequesters carbon there) and some is burned, but the majority of carbon in solid wood products remains sequestered in those products for decades. Most (more than 95%) of the bark and sawdust are either used as pulp to make paper or burned to produce energy (thus substituting for timber used in papermaking or for fossil fuels); less than 5% of waste wood from sawmills ends up in landfills.", "For pulpwood (logs or bolts less than 11.5 inches in diameter and usually less than 8 feet in length) and waste from sawtimber processing, virtually all the wood fiber (the cellulose and hemi-cellulose) is used in paper products. The spent pulping liquors (the chemicals that dissolve the lignin, the \"glue\" which holds cellulose in a rigid structure) are generally used to produce energy. Any waste paper in the production facility is generally recycled into pulp. Other than in energy production (which substitutes for fossil fuels), there is little paper waste that returns carbon directly to the atmosphere. In contrast to solid wood products, which may sequester carbon for decades, most paper products have relatively brief duration, releasing their carbon to the atmosphere relatively quickly\u2014in less than a year for many paper products, and in less than 10 years for most paper products. However, paper can also be recycled\u2014dissolved, cleaned, and made into new paper products. Increasing the recycling of post-consumer waste paper (the paper thrown away by consumers and most likely to end up in landfills) can reduce the carbon released by paper production and use.", "The carbon impacts of commercial timber harvesting have been debated extensively, but with little resolution. Some have calculated that harvesting timber from an \"over-mature\" forest can sequester substantial additional carbon, because (a) the forest is currently sequestering little additional carbon (the amount stored is large, but annual addition from tree growth is small or even negative), (b) the timber can continue to store carbon for decades in long-term solid wood products, and (c) the newly established stand can sequester large amounts of carbon through its vigorous growth. Others have calculated that the carbon released by harvesting operations substantially exceeds the additional carbon sequestered by new forest stands. One source has stated that timber harvesting (in a heavy thinning or selection harvest) reduces carbon storage, \"because the growth of residual trees is less rapid than the decomposition of the detritus and harvested wood products.\" Another study has shown that some old-growth forests continue to accumulate carbon in their soils. All of these conclusions may be valid in certain circumstances; the consequences probably depend on a variety of factors, such as which products are manufactured, how those products are used, how much carbon is left on the site, and what happens to it. There are, of course, other considerations associated with discussions of harvesting old-growth forests. Thus, the carbon consequences of timber harvesting, or delaying or preventing timber harvesting, are uncertain, being highly variable and highly site-specific.", "In addition, reduced impact logging (RIL) has been developed primarily to reduce the damage that timber harvesting can do to soils and to residual trees. It is becoming more widely discussed, especially for tropical forest harvests, but descriptions of RIL are generally either lacking in details or highly site-specific with limited general applicability. This is probably because the practices that will reduce logging damages depend on a variety of site conditions, such as soil type and water content, tree species diversity, etc. Nonetheless, as RIL becomes more widely practiced, it seems likely that logging damages (including carbon release) will decline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Wood Energy", "paragraphs": ["Using wood residues for energy production has occurred for many years at wood production facilities. The old \"teepee\" burners for disposing of wood waste are all defunct, and as noted above, the wood waste not used for paper production is already being used to produce energy to operate lumber and plywood mills. Even 30 years ago, less than 4% of the woody biomass removed from forests ended up as unused wood residues.", "Wood can be used to produce energy either by burning it directly, modifying it to produce more consistent burning characteristics (e.g., by pulverizing it and compressing it into pellets), or by digesting it to produce liquid fuel (methanol or ethanol). The biomass remaining from ethanol production is also burnable, and can be used to power the ethanol production instead of using fossil fuels. Many have noted that abnormally high biomass levels are exacerbating risks of forest fires, and have proposed removing much of that biomass to protect forests and communities located near forests. Such woody forest residues could be used to produce energy.", "Using wood for energy has some significant drawbacks. Although wood could replace some fossil fuels, it still produces CO 2 (and water vapor and some other by-products) when burned. Wood residues in the forest\u2014from timber harvesting, thinning, or other forestry practices\u2014are widely dispersed; haul distances (and thus costs) may limit the scale of wood energy production facilities. More important, perhaps, is that wood residues are highly variable in size, ranging from tree tops (4 inches or more in diameter) to twigs. Thus, collecting residues is a very labor-intensive activity. The cost to collect and transport forest residues to a wood energy facility can be a major hindrance to using woody forest residues for energy production. In addition, wood energy capacity to use wildfire fuels could exceed the long-term sustainable harvests from the forests, and become redundant or damage future forests. Finally, some wood residue is needed to sustain the productive capacity of forest soils. If too much woody biomass is removed from the forest, soil productivity and future forest growth could decline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Leakage", "paragraphs": ["Changes in land use practices to sequester carbon in the United States can also have more subtle impacts on carbon storage globally. Practices to store carbon by reducing or delaying timber harvested domestically can have an effect commonly called leakage \u2014by shifting land uses geographically (e.g., more tropical forest harvests to offset less temperate forest harvests) or by shifting demand to other products that require more carbon to produce (e.g., steel or aluminum studs to replace wood studs in homebuilding)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Land Use Leakage", "paragraphs": ["The primary concern, expressed in numerous articles, is that forest protection and logging restrictions in the United States will lead to more timber harvesting and associated environmental damage elsewhere\u2014especially in tropical forests\u2014to satisfy U.S. demand for wood products.

These critics assert that U.S. federal and state environmental laws are stricter and more rigorously enforced than other nations' environmental laws for protecting air and water quality, maintaining animal habitats, and preserving rare plants and animals. Thus, they argue, more domestic forest harvesting leads to less forest destruction and greater soil protection, both of which would lead to less carbon release following timber harvesting. In addition, most states (and federal law for federal lands) require reforestation following timber harvests (except for planned conversions to other uses), so deforestation is less common in the United States.", "Other reasons are also given for why leakage is undesirable. One is that harvesting in tropical forests typically results in more waste. Tropical forest harvests typically focus on the most valuable species, leaving most of the trees, many of which are damaged; temperate forests have less diversity of plant species, which can lead to greater efficiency in biomass utilization, and thus less biomass waste to return carbon to the atmosphere. Also, temperate forests have less carbon per acre, on average, to release when timber is harvested than do tropical forests. In addition, others note, \"[t]imber extraction is often the first step towards opening up the tropical forest and clearing the land for agricultural production. What is more, in many developing countries, property law establishes deforestation as a prerequisite of formal claim over the land for those settling in forested areas.\" Tropical timber harvests can thus lead to permanent deforestation.", "These rationales are supported by substantial anecdotal evidence, but others counter that such assertions have limited empirical foundation. Concerns generally focus on the potential impacts on tropical forests, but the preferred timber species for U.S. consumption are softwoods, not the hardwoods found in the tropics. It is not clear how much tropical timber would substitute for domestic softwood timber. Imports from tree plantations in Chile and New Zealand and from virgin forests in eastern Russia seem more likely, but the environmental effects probably differ substantially from the presumed impacts of leakage to tropical forests.
