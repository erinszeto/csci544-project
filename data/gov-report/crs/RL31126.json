The current lobbying registration and disclosure provisions establish clearer criteria and thresholds for determining when an organization should register its employees or staff as lobbyists or when a lobbying firm or individual lobbyist needs to register and identify clients. The act is directed at professional lobbyists, that is, those who receive payments to lobby for an employer or a client, and requires the registration and reporting of certain identifying information and general, broad financial data. In addition to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the Foreign Agents Registration Act requires the registration and reporting from those who act as agents of a foreign government or foreign political party, and who engage in \"lobbying\" or other similar political advocacy activities on behalf of their foreign principal.", "Various provisions of federal law have been enacted and regulations promulgated to restrict the use of any federal funds for lobbying purposes, either by the agencies of the federal government or by federal contractors or grantees.", "In attempts to limit what has been perceived to be potential undue or improper influence in governmental processes, restrictions have been adopted to limit the post-employment lobbying of certain high ranking officials of the federal government for a period of time after they leave government service (\"revolving door\" laws). Additionally, to deal with similar perceptions of undue or improper influence and access, both Houses of Congress have adopted internal rules regarding the acceptance of gifts and favors by Members, officers or employees of the House or Senate from private sources, particularly from registered lobbyists or agents of foreign principals, or their clients. No gifts may be accepted by Members, officers, or employees except as permitted in the rules of the respective chamber; and thus even small gifts, as well as more significant travel expenses for conferences or \"fact finding\" events provided to congressional Members and staff from private parties such as lobbyists and their clients, are regulated and restricted by the provisions of House and Senate rule. Under the new \"ethics and lobbying\" law ( P.L. 110-81 ), registered lobbyists must be familiar with these restrictions and regulations on gifts to Members of Congress in House and Senate rules, and must certify to the Government that they have not offered gifts or things of value to Members or staff which would violate these rules."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["This report is intended to provide a brief overview and summary of the federal laws, ethical rules, and regulations which may be relevant to the activities of those who lobby the United States Congress.

For those who act in a representative capacity for a client, lobbying the legislature for a change in the state of the law may be an important part of the services provided to the client. However, because of the substantial potential for undue or wrongful influence from those who are paid to influence the legislative process, there has developed a body of law and rules to regulate lobbying activities, as well as to regulate the activities of public officials in their interactions with those who lobby, particularly with reference to the potentially corrupting effect of large sums of money on the legislative process. There are several federal statutory laws, as well as rules of the House and Senate, which either apply to lobbying directly, or which are relevant to congressional lobbyists because the provisions bear upon a Member's or congressional employee's dealings with those who attempt to influence the legislative process. Although the internal House and Senate rules apply directly only to those who come within their respective jurisdictions, the new statutory provisions amending the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 require a registered lobbyist to be familiar with the House and Senate ethics rules on gifts and reimbursements, prohibit lobbyists from offering gifts the receipt of which would violate those congressional rules, and require lobbyists to certify that no gifts have been offered to Members of Congress or staff which would be in violation of the chamber's rules.", "Concerning the regulation of lobbying generally, because of First Amendment protections and guarantees, the federal \"regulation\" of lobbying activities engaged in by private citizens principally takes the form of disclosure and reporting of such activities and the financing behind those activities, as opposed to any specific limitations or restrictions on advocacy. Even when regulation on lobbying merely requires disclosures and reporting, such regulation, in the area of political and public-policy advocacy, may still be subject to careful scrutiny by the courts. Court decisions in this and related areas have looked to determine whether there exists any \"chilling\" of, or deterrent to the exercise of, citizens' First Amendment rights caused by such required disclosures, and if so, whether any theoretical or indirect chilling of speech is counter-balanced by important governmental and societal interests promoted by the regulations, such as transparency and openness in government, and the protection of basic governmental processes from undue influences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, As Amended", "paragraphs": ["In 1995 Congress completely rewrote the 50-year old law (the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act of 1946) which had required certain registrations and disclosures of lobbying activities directed at Members of Congress.

However, under certain circumstances, when the bundled campaign contributions exceed $15,000 (excluding the individual's own contribution and that of his or her spouse) in a six-month reporting period, the recipient campaign committee, when the bundler is \"reasonably known\" by the recipient to be a lobbyist, a registered organization with lobbyists, or a committee controlled by them, must separately report the bundled contributions in the required campaign reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bribery, Illegal Gratuities, and \"Honest Services\" Fraud", "paragraphs": ["Whenever things of value are offered to a public official, consideration should be given to the federal criminal law provisions that concern bribery and illegal gratuities, and to those provisions of federal criminal law proscribing fraudulent deprivation of the \"honest services\" of a public official.", "Under the bribery law, a federal official may not \"corruptly\" receive or solicit, and no one may corruptly offer or give, anything of value \"in return for ... being influenced in the performance of any official act.\" The \"corrupt\" nature of the transaction is part of the required intent which is characteristic of a \"bribe.\" This element of the offense\u00e2\u0080\u0094a corrupt agreement or bargain\u00e2\u0080\u0094has been described as requiring some express or implied quid pro quo involved in the transaction, that is, something given in exchange for something else. The bribe under these circumstances must be shown to be the thing that is the \"prime mover or producer of the official act\" performed or agreed to be performed. Even a campaign contribution could be the \"thing of value\" given as a bribe, since the recipient public official need not benefit personally from a bribe that is received by a third party, such as a campaign committee. In United States v. Anderson , the court upheld the conviction of a registered lobbyist for a mail-order company for bribing a Senator with \"campaign contributions\" to vote on certain postal rate legislation, when the evidence was sufficient to indicate a \"corrupt intent\" to influence by means of such payments, as opposed to the permissible activity of merely giving \"campaign contributions inspired by the recipient's general position of support on particular legislation.\"", "In addition to the bribery clause, the so-called \"illegal gratuities\" section of the same statute prohibits the giving or the receipt of something of value, other than as provided by law, \"for or because of\" an official act done or to be done. Campaign contributions given for a political candidate who is a federal officeholder are unlikely to be involved in the case of illegal gratuities, since the thing of value given in the case of an illegal gratuity (unlike for a bribe) must be received for the official \"personally\" or for himself.", "However, as to personal gifts to a public official, it should be noted that the \"illegal gratuities\" clause is less exacting than the bribery clause as to the required intent. The \"illegal gratuities\" section does not require a specific \"corrupt\" intent, nor a corrupt bargain or quid pro quo such that the gift or other thing of value is the \"motivator\" or the influence for the official act, as is required in the bribery provision. Rather, the illegal gratuities provision requires merely that the thing of value given or received was \"other than as provided by law,\" and was given or received \"for or because of\" some identifiable official act. Since the illegal gratuity need not be the motivator of an official act, nor is it required that the illegal gratuity be intended to influence an official act, an illegal gratuity may even be given after an act has already been performed, as a \"thank you\" or in appreciation for the official act. The Supreme Court explained the differing intents required in the two clauses as follows:", "The distinguishing feature of each crime is its intent element. Bribery requires intent \"to influence\" an official act or \"to be influenced\" in an official act, while illegal gratuity requires only that the gratuity be given or accepted \"for or because of\" an official act. In other words, for bribery there must be a quid pro quo \u00e2\u0080\u0094a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act. An illegal gratuity, on the other hand, may constitute merely a reward for some future act that the public official will take (and may have already determined to take), or for a past act that he has already taken.", "Although no specific illegal bargain, or \"corrupt\" intent, in giving or receiving an illegal gratuity need be shown, there is nevertheless a criminal intent requirement embodied in the characterization \"illegal gratuity\" (the criminal receipt of a payment) as distinguished from a mere \"gift\" unrelated to any official act. That intent has been described as knowingly being compensated or rewarded (or intending to compensate or reward an official), other than as provided by law for one's salary, for an official governmental act already performed or to be performed in the future by the official. While some cases in the circuits had gone so far as to find that a specific official act need not be contemplated or identified for a payment or gift to constitute an \"illegal gratuity,\" as long as the payment or gift was given to a recipient who is in a \"position to use his authority in a manner which could affect the gift giver,\" the Supreme Court in the Sun-Diamond case confirmed that such so-called \"status gifts,\" unconnected to any identified official act, were not violative of the criminal illegal gratuities provision. Such so-called \"status gifts,\" without the requisite criminal intent of a connection to any official act, are regulated and controlled by federal regulations and administrative provisions for executive branch officers and employees, and in the case of Members and employees of Congress are governed by the House and Senate rules discussed above.", "It should be noted that Congress in 1988 amended the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes to expressly include within the scope of those criminal laws a \"a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\" Under the current mail fraud and wire fraud statutes, therefore, when a Member of Congress receives something of value, such as a \"gift\" from a lobbyist or another private individual, and there can be shown some connection between the gift and public services provided, or some influence intended by the donor or recipient on the performance of an official \"service\" by the Member of Congress, then a violation of this law might be established. The exact parameters of the prohibition, the required connection or \"nexus\" of the gift to a particular \"service,\" and the precise kinds of \"official acts\" that would constitute the \"services\" contemplated by the law are, however, not entirely settled as matters of federal law."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Further Ethical Considerations for Attorneys", "paragraphs": ["As a profession, attorneys may be called upon more often than others to provide legislative representational services for clients. When lobbying the Congress, as in providing other professional services for a client, there are certain ethical rules, guidelines, and considerations which are unique to and need to be recognized and observed by attorneys.", "The American Bar Association has promulgated Model Rules of Professional Conduct , which have been adopted in one form or another within the various jurisdictions. These rules discuss ethical considerations and norms for attorneys in not only representing clients before courts, but also in representing clients in non-adjudicatory matters, such as before a legislature:", "RULE 3.9: Advocate in Non-adjudicative Proceedings", "A lawyer representing a client before a legislative or administrative tribunal in a non-adjudicative proceeding shall disclose that the appearance is in a representative capacity and shall conform to the provisions of Rules 3.3(a) through (c), 3.4(a) through (c), and 3.5.", "COMMENT:", "[1] In representation before bodies such as legislatures, municipal councils, and executive and administrative agencies acting in a rule-making or policy-making capacity, lawyers present facts, formulate issues and advance argument in the matters under consideration.

A lawyer appearing before such a body should deal with the tribunal honestly and in conformity with applicable rules of procedure.", "[2] Lawyers have no exclusive right to appear before non-adjudicative bodies, as they do before a court. The requirements of this Rule therefore may subject lawyers to regulations inapplicable to advocates who are not lawyers. However, legislatures and administrative agencies have a right to expect lawyers to deal with them as they deal with courts.", "The ethical rules referenced in Rule 3.9 concern, among other items, duties of attorneys not to knowingly make false statements, or to fail to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when such non-disclosure may further a fraud or criminal act of the client (Rule 3.3), as well as specific prohibitions on improper and undue influence of an officer (Rule 3.5). The Model Rules of Professional Conduct also note that it is \"professional misconduct\" for a lawyer to \"state or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official\" (Rule 8.4(e)).", "Attorneys should also be aware that in addition to federal post-employment \"revolving door\" laws, under the American Bar Association Model Rules after a lawyer leaves public employment he \"shall not represent a private client in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee, unless the appropriate government agency consents after consultation.\" This may in some instances limit the representational activities of attorneys for clients before Congress when the attorneys have left public employment; the issue would most likely not arise in the context of general lobbying activities by the attorney, but rather in his or her capacity as counselor for someone subject to such proceedings as committee investigatory proceedings and hearings."], "subsections": []}]}}
