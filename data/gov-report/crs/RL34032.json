When Congress passed the District of Columbia Government Reorganization and Self-Government Improvement Act (the Home Rule Act, P.L. 93-198, 87 Stat. 774), in 1973, granting the city limited home rule authority, it included provisions retaining its constitutional authority to exercise exclusive legislative control over the District's affairs, including the budget process.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to \"exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever\" pertaining to the District of Columbia. In 1973, Congress granted the city limited home rule powers and empowered citizens of the District to elect a mayor and city council. At the same time, however, Congress retained the power to review and approve all District laws including the District's annual budget.", "Under the District's home rule charter, the mayor must submit operating and capital budgets to the city council for review and adoption by a date specified by the council. The charter also mandates that the proposed budget submitted by the mayor must assume that expenditures will not exceed resources, and requires that certain elements be a part of the mayor's budget submission. In addition, the charter requires that the proposed budget include a four-year financial management plan outlining the projected long-term impact of current spending. When appropriate, the mayor may prepare, at his discretion or at the direction of the council, a supplemental or deficiency budget to address the need for additional expenditures and must identify the potential sources of revenues that will be used to address the deficiency.", "The council must act on the budget and any supplemental appropriations, including the reprogramming of funds, which must be offset by reductions, within 56 calendar days of receiving the budget from the mayor. The approved budget must then be transmitted to the President, who forwards it to Congress for review, modification, and approval. Both the President, through his annual budget submission, and Congress may propose financial assistance to the District in the form of special federal payments in support of specific activities or priorities. Congress must approve the District's budget as one of the appropriations bills.", "District of Columbia appropriations acts typically consist of three titles or parts. Title I includes special federal payments or contributions for specific activities or priorities. These are additional sums granted to the District, outside of the normal federal grant process, to address specific congressional priorities. Most recently, these special federal payments have included, but have not been limited to: funding of court operations and defender services; emergency planning and security; and education initiatives, including college tuition assistance, support for public schools, school choice scholarships (vouchers), and public charter schools.", "Title II of District appropriations acts consists of the District's operating and capital budgets, including enterprise funds. The operating budget is supported by revenues from local taxes, fees, charges, and federal assistance available to all eligible state and local governments. The capital budget is sustained through bond sales and annual appropriations.", "Title III consists of general provisions governing various aspects of the operations and functions of District government. The general provisions included in recent District of Columbia appropriations acts can be grouped into six categories that:", "address fiscal and budgetary matters related to deficit spending, limits on the reprogramming of funds, prohibitions of the use of sole-source contracts, and requirements for emergency and contingency reserve funds; impose administrative controls; facilitate congressional oversight and reporting; limit use of appropriated funds for advocacy of District statehood or congressional voting representation; address educational issues related to the payment of attorney fees in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) actions; and impose limits, restrictions, and prohibitions on the use of federal or local funding to carry out specific social policies such as abortion services, needle exchange, and medical marijuana.", "On occasion, Congress has used the District's appropriations act to authorize specific initiatives including school vouchers, the Chief Financial Officer act, and charter schools under a fourth title.", "Once forwarded by the President to Congress, typically during the first weeks of June, the District's budget moves through the congressional appropriations process. This includes subcommittee hearings, which may take place before the actual budget submission to Congress, subcommittee and committee markups in both houses, committee reports and votes, floor action, reconciliations and conference report consideration, and final passage. All of this is supposed to happen within approximately 120 calendar days before the beginning of the District's fiscal year on October 1. City leaders have consistently expressed concern that Congress has repeatedly delayed passage of the appropriations act for the District (in which Congress approves the city's budgets) well beyond the start of its fiscal year. The city's elected leaders contend that delay in Congress's approval of its budget hinders their ability to manage the District's financial affairs and negatively impacts the delivery of public services.", "During the past decade the approval of the District's annual budget has been delayed by complications in the congressional appropriations process. Rather than being enacted on its own, the District of Columbia appropriations act has often been folded into omnibus or consolidated appropriations acts, and continuing resolutions. As documented in Table 1 , FY1997 was the only year out of the past 12 years for which the D.C. appropriations act was enacted before the start of the fiscal year (on October 1 of the prior-numbered year)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary and Analysis of Provisions of H.R. 733", "paragraphs": ["The District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2007, H.R. 733 , 110 th Congress, introduced on January 20, 2007, by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, is the latest in a series of bills dating back to 1981 that would provide budget autonomy for the District of Columbia.

Code that dictate the timing and content of the budget process would remain in effect during a control year. For non-control years, the policy implications of H.R. 733 are highly dependent upon the nature of the laws that would eventually be enacted by the District. Should Congress approve H.R. 733 , the District would have the power to change its fiscal year or otherwise alter its budget processes to better serve its constituents without having to go through Congress. A change in the fiscal year may more closely reflect the needs of the District. Decoupling the District general budget from the appropriations process could result in a shorter budget cycle, allowing for more accurate revenue and expenditure estimates. The current budget approval process involves the mayor, the council, the congressionally created Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the President, the Office of Management and Budget, the Appropriation Committees of the House and Senate, and the full Congress. The process requires at least 15 months to complete; typically, the process has exceeded 15 months.", "Enactment of H.R. 733 would not prevent Congress from intervening in District budgetary matters. Even if autonomy were granted for the part of the District's budget financed by locally raised revenues, Congress would still need to appropriate federal funds for certain functions that are carried out by the District but financed by the federal government as special federal payments. This includes, for example, corrections; courts and defender services; security and emergency planning; and selected education initiatives, such as the college access program, school choice scholarships, and public charter schools. Furthermore, H.R. 733 may not prevent Congress from adopting future proposals, including so-called \"social policy\" provisions, that would limit the District's ability to spend its own funds (as well as federal funds) on certain goods or services. Congress could always pass freestanding legislation restricting the use of the District's own source revenues, or include such restrictions or prohibitions as general provisions in a District appropriations bill. Such actions would run counter to the intent of H.R. 733 and the principles of home rule. Moreover, the rules of both chambers bar the inclusion of legislation in appropriation bills. Any attempt to include \"social riders\" or other legislative provisions in District appropriation bills could be challenged on a point of order. However, the House or Senate could adopt procedural rules governing federal appropriations for the District that would allow for the inclusion of legislative provisions that would impose restrictions on the use of District funds or authorize new programs. For instance, during consideration of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2004, H.R. 2765 , the House approved a rule ( H.Res. 334 ), which allowed the consideration of an amendment ( H.Amdt. 368 ) authorizing a school choice program.

In addition to eliminating the requirement that the District budget be approved by an act of Congress prior to becoming effective, these bills sought to provide the District with the authority to hire employees and to allow the District Council to override a mayoral disapproval of a budget with a two-thirds majority. The bills also sought to waive the period of congressional review required before District acts took effect. Fiscal Protection Act, 104 th Congress.

These bills sought to allow enactment of the District's budget without congressional approval, as well as the hiring of employees. They also sought to alter the role of the CFO by repealing sections of the Home Rule Act pertaining to the CFO and providing for the enactment of the Independence of the Chief Financial Officer Establishment Act.

District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Acts (House versions): 105 th , 106 th , 108 th - 110 th Congresses. This series of bills represented a return to similar bills in the 97 th - 99 th Congresses. These bills, in common with the current bill under consideration, H.R. 733 , sought to amend the Home Rule Act to eliminate congressional review, allowing the District budget to take effect upon its approval by the city council and the mayor. H.R. 733 would also eliminate previous federal mandates governing the District budget, financial management, and borrowing.

There was enough political support for self-government for the District to pass the Home Rule Act, but the prospect of budget autonomy was ultimately rejected. The bill that became law contained provisions requiring that the District of Columbia transmit its budget to Congress, and that Congress approve the budget before the budget could take effect. Although the Home Rule Act became law in 1973, it took several years before the District was governed under its own rule, with elections of a Mayor and the Council in 1974 and the establishment of other institutions in the following years. Congress proposed the Voting Rights Amendment, seeking to give the District voting representation in Congress in 1978, but the amendment was not ratified by the states. In 1980, voters called for the creation of a state constitution.", "One of the earliest bills seeking to provide budget autonomy to the District was the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act ( H.R. 1254 , 97 th Congress), introduced by the District's Delegate to Congress, Walter Fauntroy, in January 1981. The bill sought to amend the Home Rule Act to grant autonomy to the District over expenditures of own-source revenues. It also set forth procedures by which the Council could exercise control over its budget processes. It was introduced without cosponsors and referred to committee, where it received no action. Over the next two Congresses, virtually identical bills were introduced by Delegate Fauntroy, also without cosponsors, but never made it out of committee.", "In 1989, Delegate Fauntroy was a cosponsor of the District of Columbia Budgetary and Legislative Efficiency Act of 1989 ( H.R. 52 , 101 st Congress), the first in a series of bills that sought not only to provide budgetary autonomy, but also to eliminate the congressional review period required before laws passed by the District Council take effect. The bill died in committee.

In June 1994, a federal audit made it clear that the District was in financial distress, running out of cash on hand. These and other problems for the District government contributed substantially to Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's defeat in the 1994 Democratic primary. Former Mayor Marion Barry was returned to office in the subsequent general election. In April 1995, Congress passed the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995, establishing what came to be known as the Control Board, and defining a \"control period\" as any period where the District failed to service its debt, defaulted on any loan, had a large cash deficit, or requisitioned funds from the U.S. Treasury.", "In the bills introduced after the establishment of the Control Board, provisions relating to budget autonomy\u2014in particular, the ability of the District to expend own-source revenues without prior congressional approval\u2014were conditioned on the fiscal year in question not being a control year.

The Senate version contained Title II: District of Columbia Independence of the Chief Financial Officer Act of 2003, which again sought to expand the authority of the District's CFO. The bill passed in the Senate on September 9, 2003, and was sent to the House, where it was not reported out of committee.", "In the 109 th Congress, the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2005 was introduced in both the House and the Senate. Both bills were very similar to their counterparts in the previous Congress. Neither bill made it out of committee.", "Finally, in the 110 th Congress, H.R. 733 seeks to amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act by making large portions of the act inapplicable so long as the District in not in a \"control period\" as defined by the criteria established by the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 ( P.L. 104-91 ). The bill's stated intent is \"To amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to eliminate all federally imposed mandates over the local budget process and financial management of the District of Columbia and the borrowing of money by the District of Columbia.\"", "References", "CRS Report 97-213, Appropriations for FY1998: District of Columbia , by [author name scrubbed] (pdf).", "CRS Report 98-213, Appropriations for FY1999: District of Columbia , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL30213, Appropriations for FY2000: District of Columbia , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL30513, Appropriations for FY2001: District of Columbia , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL31013, Appropriations for FY2002: District of Columbia , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL31313, Appropriations for FY2003: District of Columbia , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL31813, Appropriations for FY2004: District of Columbia , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL32313, Appropriations for FY2005: District of Columbia , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL32994, District of Columbia: FY2006 Appropriations , coordinated by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL33563, District of Columbia: Appropriations for 2007 , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
