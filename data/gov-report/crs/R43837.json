Some in Congress view the CFPB as an important protector of consumers and families against predatory financial actors. Others believe the CFPB is an institution not subject to sufficient accountability that imposes undue regulatory burdens on providers of financial services and limits credit available to households. This policy disagreement among Members of Congress has been on display during the controversy surrounding the confirmation of the CFPB's director, in oversight hearings, and in legislation that has been introduced.", "This report focuses on selected legislation related to the CFPB that has seen committee or floor action during the 113th Congress. Most of these proposals address one of two main policy topics, the structure of the CFPB and the substance of the CFPB's rulemaking.", "On the first policy question, many acknowledge that the structure of a government agency may affect the policies an agency creates. Financial regulators generally are structured in statute to have characteristics that increase their independence from the President or Congress, which may make policymaking related to these regulators more technical and less political or partisan, for better or worse. Independence may also make regulators less accountable to elected officials and can reduce presidential or congressional influence.", "Since the CFPB was established, some have argued that it has too much independence and not enough accountability. Critics point to structural issues, such as the presence of a director rather than a board and funding that is outside the traditional congressional appropriations process. Supporters of the CFPB highlight other aspects that they argue provide transparency and accountability, including the CFPB director's biannual testimony before Congress and the cap on the CFPB's non-appropriated funding. Other structural characteristics, they argue, are important for ensuring that the CFPB is somewhat insulated from political pressures and can focus on the technical aspect of policymaking.", "With regard to the second policy question, one of the long-standing issues in the regulation of consumer financial services is the perceived trade-off between protecting consumers and ensuring that the providers of financial goods and services are not unduly burdened. If regulation intended to protect consumers increases the cost of providing a financial product, a company may reduce how much of that product it is willing to provide and to whom it is willing to provide it. Those who still receive the product may benefit from the enhanced disclosure or added legal protections of the regulation, but that benefit may come at the cost of a potentially higher price for the product and reduced availability for others.", "Some Members of Congress believe the CFPB has struck the appropriate balance in its rulemaking between protecting consumers and ensuring that credit availability is not restricted due to overly burdensome regulations on financial institutions, especially small banks. Others counter that some of the CFPB's rules have imposed compliance costs on lenders of all sizes that will result in less credit available to consumers and restrict the types of products available. An analysis of whether recent rulemaking has restricted the availability of credit is complicated by the effects of the financial crisis on the supply of and demand for credit, as well as the fact that many of the more significant CFPB rulemakings only took effect in early 2014."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been a controversial product of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act).

Is the CFPB as an institution structured appropriately so as to achieve the correct balance between independence on the one hand and transparency and accountability on the other? 2. Has the substance of the CFPB's rulemaking struck an appropriate balance between protecting consumers from abuse and ensuring that consumers have access to financial products while lenders are not unduly burdened by new regulations?", "Congress has assessed these questions using a range of its authorities, including holding oversight hearings and providing advice and consent during the confirmation of the CFPB's director.

The Dodd-Frank Act states that the purpose of the CFPB is to implement and enforce federal consumer financial law while ensuring that consumers have access to financial products and services. It also instructs the CFPB to ensure the markets for consumer financial services and products are fair, transparent, and competitive. To fulfill its mandate, the CFPB can issue rules, examine certain institutions, and enforce consumer protection laws and regulations.", "The Dodd-Frank Act further established that the CFPB is to be headed by a director, appointed by the President and subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, for a five-year term. After the expiration of the term, the director may continue to serve until a successor has been appointed and qualified. The CFPB is located within the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board, however, cannot veto a rule issued by the CFPB, although the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) can set aside a CFPB-proposed rule with the vote of two-thirds of its members. The CFPB, which is not subject to the congressional appropriations process, is funded through the earnings of the Federal Reserve System. The Dodd-Frank Act caps the CFPB's funding at 12% of the Federal Reserve's operating expense as reported in its FY2009 Annual Report, subject to annual adjustment based on a formula set in statute. For FY2015, the transfer cap is estimated to be $618.7 million. ", "The CFPB has the authority to enforce many of the federal financial consumer laws, primarily for large depository institutions (such as banks) with assets of more than $10 billion as well as for some nonbank institutions, such as mortgage lenders, mortgage servicers, payday lenders, and private education lenders. However, some consumer protection responsibilities were not given to the Bureau. The CFPB is not the primary consumer protection regulator of depositories with less than $10 billion in assets. The prudential regulators that regulate the smaller institutions for safety and soundness continue to regulate these institutions for consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides some industries with exemptions from CFPB regulation.

It procures data from publicly available sources (such as other federal entities), requests information from entities it supervises, receives complaints directly from consumers about their experiences with certain financial products and services, conducts surveys and interviews with consumers, and purchases data from data vendors. The CFPB is generally not focused on the actions of individual consumers but on aggregated information about consumers that highlights the functioning of consumer markets. The Bureau does, however, have access to data containing personal identifiers in some instances, such as when it collects information on borrowers from a particular company whose actions have harmed borrowers in the course of ensuring that those borrowers receive restitution. The CFPB has instituted policies related to data that contain personally identifiable information about consumers. These policies are intended to ensure that the data are protected and that employees and third parties have limited access to it only under specified conditions.", "A September 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of the CFPB's data collection found that the CFPB collects a significant amount of data but that other financial regulators, such as the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), \"collect similarly large amounts of data.\" GAO found that the CFPB \"has taken steps to protect and secure these data collections,\" including removing personal identifiers from the data where possible and establishing an information-security program. GAO also determined that \"additional efforts are needed in several areas to reduce the risk of improper collection, use, or release of consumer financial data.\" GAO made 11 recommendations for the CFPB that were divided into three broad categories: (1) establishing additional written procedures for data collection and privacy practices; (2) completing the implementation of security and privacy steps; and (3) complying with the Paperwork Reduction Act by receiving Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for certain data collections. GAO reports that the CFPB \"agreed with GAO's recommendations and noted steps they plan to take or have taken to address them.\" ", "Critics of the CFPB's data collection argue that the Bureau is amassing a significant amount of data on consumers. Learning what information the CFPB has collected and having the ability to opt out of collection efforts, they argue, could afford consumers more control over the data the government collects on them and increase the transparency and accountability of the CFPB. Part of the concern stems from questions about the security of the data held by the CFPB. Destroying some types of data after a certain period of time and requiring a confidential security clearance, the argument goes, would provide added protections to consumers. ", "Opponents of the proposals counter that preserving the CFPB's ability to collect data is essential to ensuring that the Bureau makes informed decisions in fulfilling its mission. They also contend that keeping data for extended periods of time allows the CFPB to observe important long-run trends in consumer markets. Additionally, opponents assert that the data the CFPB collects is, for the most part, scrubbed of personally identifiable information. The additional requirements that the proposals would impose on the CFPB, they argue, would go beyond what other financial regulators must follow even though these regulators also collect data about consumers.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that \"enacting H.R. 3183 would increase direct spending by $18 million over the 2015-2024 period\" and \"enacting H.R. 4604 would cost the CFPB $83 million over the 2015-2024 period, thus increasing direct spending by that amount.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "H.R. 3193, the Consumer Financial Freedom and Washington Accountability Act25", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 3193 was passed by the House on February 27, 2014.

Commissioners could only be removed for cause and would serve a five-year term. They would be appointed by the President subject to Senate confirmation, and not more than three commissioners could be members of the same political party. A chairperson would be selected by the President from among the commissioners and would exercise the executive and administrative functions of the bureau. Under the bill as modified, the CFPB would become a stand-alone, independent agency and would no longer be an autonomous bureau of the Federal Reserve. H.R. 3193 as passed by the House would eliminate the statutorily required revenue transfers from the Fed to finance the CFPB's budget and subject that budget to the congressional appropriations process. It would authorize \"such sums as may be necessary\" to be appropriated through FY2015 and place CFPB employee pay on the federal government's general schedule. It would also govern the CFPB's use of confidential information.", "Supporters of H.R. 3193 as passed by the House argue that the different pieces of the proposal are collectively intended to increase the transparency and accountability of the CFPB.

The CFPB may use the fund to compensate victims of activities for which penalties have been imposed. If the victims cannot be located or payments are otherwise not practicable, the CFPB may use the funds for consumer education and financial literacy programs. The CFPB also sets aside money from the fund to cover administrative expenses associated with hiring third-party vendors to distribute the funds to affected consumers. As of May 2014, the CFPB had deposited $119 million into the fund; approximately $31 million was allocated to consumers and $13.4 million was allocated to a consumer education and financial literacy program (the unallocated money remains in the fund).

By contrast, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have funds for penalties that, although all are different, share similarities with the CFPB's Civil Penalty Fund.", "Supporters of H.R. 3389 as ordered reported take issue with the CFPB's Civil Penalty Fund for multiple reasons. During the markup of the bill, H.R. 3389 's supporters argued that because they believed the CFPB lacked sufficient accountability, it was inappropriate for the CFPB to have discretion to allocate money from a fund for purposes besides compensating victims, especially when many of the CFPB's settlement agreements already require covered financial institutions to remediate harmed consumers.

Pursuant to Sec. 1101 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB was established as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve System. As will be described in greater detail below, the Federal Reserve System is explicitly exempted from FACA. FACA, therefore, arguably does not apply to the CFPB.

FACA, for example, requires that committee membership be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented\" and that the advice provided by committees be objective and accessible to the public. Additionally, FACA requires that committee meetings be open to the public, unless the material discussed meets certain requirements.

Members of Congress presented two arguments for exempting the Federal Reserve System from FACA's requirements at the time of the law's enactment.", "1. One goal of FACA was to reduce federal costs by eliminating duplication of committees. These committees are usually provided federal appropriations to support their operations. The Federal Reserve's Federal Advisory Council was funded through Federal Reserve Banks' earnings, and, therefore, applying FACA would not reduce federal appropriations. 2. Another goal was to protect the potential improper release of sensitive information or opinions. Some Members of Congress and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board asserted that \"premature publication of views candidly expressed at meetings\" on delicate subjects of \"monetary policy, the international payments system, and liquidity conditions in the banking system ... could prove harmful.\" ", "Supporters of the H.R. 4262 may argue that applying FACA to an advisory committee may improve both the perception and reality of transparent governmental operation and accessibility, thereby increasing confidence and trust in an advisory body's findings or recommendations. As some opponents of FACA's application have stated, however, FACA's requirements may also place a number of additional chartering, record-keeping, notification, and oversight requirements on the entity. In particular, some agencies have claimed that compliance with the various FACA requirements is cumbersome and resource intensive, reducing the ability of committees to focus on substantive issues in a spontaneous and timely fashion. Other scholars have argued that the scope of the openness requirements could have the practical effect of stifling candid advice and discussion within a committee. Congress can choose to exempt certain congressionally mandated advisory committees from all or some of FACA's provisions to allow them to operate more quickly than FACA might permit. For example, the requirement that all meetings be posted \"with timely notice\" in the Federal Register can slow down the daily operations of an advisory committee, which will typically not hold meetings until 15 days after the notice is published. Congress can choose to exempt a committee from this publication requirement. Additionally, Congress may determine that the subject matter discussed at advisory board meetings is substantively sensitive and should be withheld from public record.

H.R. 4466 as ordered reported would require the CFPB and other financial regulators to assess their existing federal regulations and orders prior to issuing a new regulation or order. Each agency's assessment must consider whether the new proposal is in conflict with, inconsistent with, or duplicative of any previously issued regulations or orders and whether those previously issued orders are outdated. If any previously issued regulations are determined to have any of these characteristics, the agency would be required to \"take all available measures under current law to resolve any duplicative or inconsistent existing regulation or order with any proposed regulation or order before issuing a final regulation or order.\" The bill also would require each agency to submit a report to Congress on its assessment, including in the report any recommendations to Congress for statutory changes that may be needed before the agency can repeal or amend any regulations identified.", "The proposed requirements in H.R. 4466 would be similar to existing requirements in various executive orders that do not currently apply to independent regulatory agencies, including the CFPB. In 1993, President William Clinton issued Executive Order 12866, which is still in effect, in which he stated that agencies should \"avoid regulations that are inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative with [their] other regulations.\" In January 2011, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13563, which reaffirmed Executive Order 12866 and directed executive agencies (not including the CFPB or other independent regulatory agencies) to undertake an examination of their current rules and eliminate or update any that were \"outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome.\" Executive Order 13579, issued by President Obama later in 2011, encouraged independent regulatory agencies, including the CFPB, to conduct a similar review of their regulations. Specifically, the order asked the independent regulatory agencies to \"consider how best to promote retrospective analysis of rules that may be outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them in accordance with what has been learned.\"", "Following the issuance of Executive Order 13579, many independent regulatory agencies did engage in a retrospective review of rules, including the CFPB, which instigated a review of its inherited regulations in December 2011. The CFPB stated in its Federal Register notice announcing that review that it was \"based in part on guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget\" pertaining to Executive Order 13579. There has been some debate over whether the President can and should assign independent regulatory agencies such a task. Regardless of that debate, however, having a requirement for retrospective review in statute would emphasize the importance to Congress, as well as the President, of retrospective review at the CFPB and other covered agencies.", "One might argue that the other agencies covered by H.R. 4466 , all of which have been in existence longer than the CFPB, may find retrospective review more fruitful for identifying previously issued rules that should be amended or eliminated. The CFPB may have more limited success in such a retrospective review simply because it is a newer agency and has been issuing rules only for a few years. ", "On the other hand, the CFPB inherited rulemaking authority from several federal agencies and, as the CFPB demonstrated in the review it instigated in December 2011 referenced above, a retrospective review could take these inherited regulations into account. Furthermore, H.R. 4466 would require the CFPB and the other agencies to undertake this consideration process each time a new regulation or order is issued, which could help to prevent a buildup of duplicative or inconsistent regulations in the future.

Following Director Cordray's comments, the CFPB published a notice in the Federal Register on October 16, 2014, seeking comment on its proposed Policy of No-Action Letters. Under the proposal, a company would be able to ask the CFPB for a no-action letter with regard to a new product or service.

They contrast the CFPB's approach with those of agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), SEC, and FTC that provide formal opinions in different formats. The IRS, for example, provides written determinations in which it advises taxpayers on certain issues under its jurisdiction. The SEC may provide a no-action letter to entities that are unsure as to whether a product or service would violate a federal securities law if the SEC staff concludes that it \"would not recommend that the Commission take enforcement action against the requester based on the facts and representations described in the individual's or entity's request.\" The FTC provides advisory opinions \"to help clarify FTC rules and decisions, often in response to requests from businesses and industry groups.\" Supporters argue that the approaches offered by the IRS, SEC, and FTC provide more certainty to businesses than the one used by the CFPB. ", "Critics of H.R. 4662 counter that the requirement that the CFPB respond within specified time frames is unworkable, especially if the CFPB is inundated with requests. The need to respond to many requests in a narrow time frame, they argue, would limit the CFPB's ability to pursue its other activities for protecting consumers. Some of the critics who were still generally supportive of the bill suggested charging a fee to those who ask for an advisory opinion (which is an approach used by some but not all of the agencies described previously) and removing or modifying the time limits for a response from the CFPB.

The supervisory powers for small depositories remain with the institutions' prudential regulator (i.e., the OCC, FDIC, National Credit Union Association, and Federal Reserve), although the CFPB does have some limited supervisory authority over smaller depository institutions. For instance, the Bureau, \"on a sampling basis,\" may participate in examinations of smaller depository institutions conducted by prudential regulators.

For example, the CFPB brought enforcement attorneys, who (among other things) investigate potential violations of consumer protection laws, on some supervisory examinations before reversing its policy in 2013. Some argued that the presence of enforcement attorneys created an adversarial dynamic between the CFPB and the financial institution. Additionally, the deadlines mandated in H.R. 4804 for the CFPB to complete its examination and provide feedback to the institution on its performance are similar to the timeliness guidelines the CFPB has instituted for itself, although a March 2014 OIG report stated that the CFPB \"did not meet internal timeliness requirements for examination reporting.\" ", "Supporters of H.R. 4804 argue that the bill would provide clarity and certainty about supervisory examinations while also reducing the CFPB's discretion.

H.R. 1779 as ordered reported would affect the market for manufactured housing by amending the definitions of mortgage originator and high-cost mortgage in the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA). Manufactured homes, which are often located in more rural areas, are a type of single-family housing that is factory built and transported to a placement site rather than constructed on-site. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the definitions for mortgage originator and high-cost mortgage to provide additional protections to borrowers, and those changes may affect the market for manufactured homes. H.R. 1779 would modify the definitions again with the goal of increasing the credit available for manufactured homes.", "A mortgage originator is someone who, among other things, \"(i) takes a residential mortgage loan application; (ii) assists a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain a residential mortgage loan; or (iii) offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan.\" The current definition excludes employees of manufactured-home retailers under certain circumstances, such as when the employees do not advise consumers on the terms of a loan that the consumer could receive to purchase the manufactured home. H.R. 1779 would expand the exception such that retailers of manufactured homes or their employees would be considered mortgage originators for the purposes of TILA if they received more compensation for a sale that included a loan than for a sale that did not include a loan.", "The definition of mortgage originator is relevant to the manufactured-housing industry because some rules issued by the CFPB, such as the Ability-to-Repay (ATR) rule, require compensation paid to a mortgage originator to be included in the definition of points and fees. When points and fees are above certain thresholds, consumers may receive certain additional protections that could impose additional costs on lenders. The more types of costs included in the definition of points and fees, the more likely it is that the caps will be breached and lenders may be subject to additional legal liability. If the definition of mortgage originator is modified by H.R. 1779 as ordered reported so that certain fees paid to manufactured-home retailers would not be included in the points and fees cap, then the points and fees thresholds would be less likely to be breached and the risk to lenders would be reduced (although borrowers would also be less likely to receive added consumer protections). A lender, in that instance, may be more willing to offer credit for a manufactured-housing loan. The CFPB has noted that the treat ment of manufactured - home retailers is one of the issues on which it has received feedback and stated that it \" will continue to conduct outreach with the manufactured - home industry and other interested parties to address concerns about what activities are permissible for a retailer and its employees without causing them to qualify as loan originators. \"", "H.R. 1779 as ordered reported would also narrow the definition of high-cost mortgage. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the protections available to high-cost mortgages, and the CFPB issued a rule implementing those changes. A mortgage is deemed a high-cost mortgage if the annual percentage rate (APR) or the points and fees for the mortgage exceed certain thresholds. The definition of high-cost mortgage is particularly important for the manufactured-home market because a loan used to purchase a manufactured home is generally more likely to be a high-cost loan than a mortgage for a non-manufactured home. As described previously, H.R. 1779 would amend the points and fees definition, making it less likely that the high-cost mortgage threshold would be triggered. As described below, H.R. 1779 also would increase the APR trigger for certain types of high-cost mortgages. Both changes would make it less likely for a manufactured-home loan to be deemed a high-cost mortgage.", "If a mortgage is high cost, then a lender is limited in the types of fees it can charge, is restricted in the features it can offer on the mortgage (such as a balloon payment), and must provide additional disclosures about the terms of the loan. In addition, a borrower must receive housing counseling if a mortgage is high cost. Although consumers may benefit from these protections, the protections may impose additional costs on lenders and make it less likely that a lender will extend credit to a borrower whose mortgage is above the high-cost threshold.

For example, the ATR rule has an additional compliance option that allows small lenders operating in rural or underserved areas to originate balloon mortgages, subject to some restrictions. The compliance option for rural lenders is specified in the Dodd-Frank Act, but the definition of rural is left to the discretion of the CFPB. Balloon mortgages originated by lenders in areas that are not designated as rural may be ineligible for qualified mortgage (QM) status (although the CFPB has established a two-year transition period to allow small lenders to originate balloon mortgages, subject to some restrictions).

The ATR rule requires a lender to determine based on documented and verified information that at the time a mortgage loan is made, the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. Lenders that fail to comply with the ATR rule could be subject to legal liability. A lender is presumed to have complied with the ATR rule when it offers a QM. A QM is a mortgage that satisfies certain underwriting and product-feature requirements, such as being below specified debt-to-income ratios, having a term of 30 years or fewer, and having fees associated with the mortgage below certain thresholds. There are several different categories of QM, including ones related to mortgages made by small lenders and lenders in rural or underserved areas. There is also a category for mortgages that meet the standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Unlike the other QM compliance options, the additional QM compliance option that would be created by H.R. 2673 would have no underwriting or product-feature requirements; any mortgage could receive QM status so long as the mortgage is held in the portfolio of the lender that originated it.", "Some argue that the ATR rule has negatively affected lenders, especially those that originate mortgages and hold them in their portfolios. Lenders that hold the mortgage, the argument goes, should have discretion over what types of mortgages they originate and to whom they lend because the lender bears the consequences of a potential default by the borrower when the mortgage is held in portfolio. The lender, therefore, has \"every incentive to ensure that the mortgage is conservatively underwritten and that the borrower has the ability to repay.\" Proponents of H.R. 2673 argue that mortgages retained in portfolio by the original lender should receive QM status without the need to satisfy additional underwriting and product requirements.", "Critics of H.R. 2673 contend that the retained risk of the mortgage held in the lender's portfolio may be insufficient to align the incentives of the lender and the borrower. In a period of rising house prices, the lender may be able to sell the home of a delinquent borrower for enough to cover the amount of the loan. In such a scenario, the lender may be more concerned about the value of the underlying house than about the borrower's ability to repay the loan even if the lender holds the loan in its portfolio. The lender may be protected from losses, but the consumer would bear some of the consequences of the foreclosure.

Certain fees paid for comparable services provided by independent or unaffiliated companies, such as for title insurance, are already excluded from the definition of points and fees. By excluding additional types of costs that are currently included in the definition of points and fees, more expensive mortgages would be likely to fall within the points and fees threshold and therefore be eligible for QM status.

H.R. 4521 as ordered reported would make two modifications to CFPB mortgage rules to reduce the regulatory burden of small lenders. H.R. 4521 would (1) exempt from certain escrow requirements a mortgage held by a lender with assets of $10 billion or less and (2) exempt from certain servicing requirements a servicer that annually services 20,000 or fewer mortgages. ", "An escrow account is an account that a \"mortgage lender may set up to pay certain recurring property-related expenses ... such as property taxes and homeowner's insurance.\" Property taxes and homeowner's insurance are often lump-sum payments owed annually or semiannually. To ensure a borrower has enough money to make these payments, a lender may divide up the amount owed and add it to a borrower's monthly payment. The additional amount paid each month is placed in the escrow account and then is drawn on by the mortgage servicer that administers the account to make the required annual or semiannual payments. Maintaining escrow accounts for borrowers may be costly to some banks, especially smaller lenders. An escrow account is not required for all types of mortgages but was required for at least one year for higher-priced mortgage loans even before the Dodd-Frank Act. A higher-priced mortgage loan is a loan with an APR \"that exceeds an 'average prime offer rate' for a comparable transaction by 1.5 or more percentage points for transactions secured by a first lien, or by 3.5 or more percentage points for transactions secured by a subordinate lien.\"", "The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, extended the amount of time an escrow account for a higher-priced mortgage loan must be maintained from one year to five years, although the escrow account can only be terminated after five years if certain conditions are met. It also provided additional disclosure requirements. The CFPB issued a rule implementing these requirements. The CFPB's rule also included exemptions from escrow requirements to lenders that (1) operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas; (2) extend 500 or fewer mortgages; (3) have less than $2 billion in total assets; and (4) do not escrow for any mortgage they service (with some exceptions). An exempted lender must maintain an escrow account for a higher-priced mortgage loan, however, if at the time the loan is made the lender intends to sell the loan to another party (\"is subject to a forward commitment\"). An exempted lender does not need to maintain an escrow account for a loan that it intends to hold in portfolio. H.R. 4521 would expand the exemption such that a lender would not have to maintain an escrow requirement for a mortgage so long as the mortgage is held by the lender in its portfolio and the lender has $10 billion or less in assets. ", "The second part of H.R. 4521 addresses mortgage servicers. A mortgage servicer functions as an intermediary between the mortgage holder and the borrower. The role of the servicer may be performed by the same institution that made the loan to the borrower or by another institution. Servicers collect payments from borrowers that are current and forward them to the mortgage holder, work with borrowers that are delinquent to try to get them current, and extinguish the mortgage (such as through foreclosure) if a borrower is in default. ", "Servicers received added attention from Congress after the surge in foreclosures following the bursting of the housing bubble. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed additional requirements on servicers to protect borrowers through amendments to TILA and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). The CFPB issued rules implementing those changes. The CFPB regulations included, among other things, additional disclosure requirements about the timing of rate changes, requirements for how payments would be credited, obligations to address errors in a timely fashion, and guidance on when foreclosure could be initiated and how servicers must have continuity of contact with borrowers. ", "For the rules implemented under TILA, servicers \"that service 5,000 mortgage loans or less and only service mortgage loans the servicer or an affiliate owns or originated\" are considered small servicers and are exempted from certain requirements related to disclosures and periodic statements. For the rules implemented under RESPA, some of the requirements were specific mandates in Dodd-Frank and some were implemented at the discretion of the CFPB; small servicers are exempted from those implemented at the discretion of the CFPB but must comply with those mandated by Dodd-Frank. For example, small servicers are exempted from the continuity-of-contact requirements but must comply with certain disclosure requirements for changes in interest rates. H.R. 4521 would modify the exemption for the rules implemented under RESPA by directing the CFPB to provide exemptions to or adjustments for the RESPA servicing provision for servicers that service 20,000 or fewer mortgages. In providing exemptions or adjustments, the CFPB would be directed to \"reduce regulatory burdens while appropriately balancing consumer protections.\"", "Supporters of H.R. 4521 argue that small financial institutions were not the cause of the financial crisis and should be exempted from many of the regulations that apply to larger institutions to reduce the regulatory burden on smaller lenders. Although the CFPB's rules that would be affected by H.R. 4521 already have some exemptions for small lenders, H.R. 4521 would expand those exemptions to include more lenders. Additionally, supporters argue that the exemption for escrow accounts would only apply to lenders below the $10 billion threshold that hold the loan in their portfolio. The lender would have additional incentive, the argument goes, to make sure the borrower will pay taxes and insurance even without the escrow account because the lender is exposed to some of the risk by keeping it in its portfolio.
