Indonesia, a major producer of clove cigarettes, challenged the Tobacco Control Act's ban on non-menthol flavored cigarettes before a World Trade Organization (WTO) panel, claiming, among other things, that it violated Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). Article 2.1 requires WTO members to ensure that domestic regulations setting forth product characteristics treat like imported products no less favorably than like domestic products. Article 2.2 requires that such regulations be no more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. The panel hearing the dispute agreed with Indonesia on Article 2.1 but found for the United States on Article 2.2. The United States appealed the panel's finding on Article 2.1.", "On April 4, 2012, the Appellate Body issued a decision. Although the Appellate Body disagreed with certain legal standards applied by the panel, it ultimately upheld the panel's conclusion that menthol cigarettes and clove cigarettes are like products and that the Tobacco Control Act's ban of non-menthol flavored cigarettes treats imported clove cigarettes less favorably than domestic menthol cigarettes. The Appellate Body stated that this case involved de facto discrimination and drew on jurisprudence developed under Article III:4 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), which is similar to Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, to hold that \"likeness in Article 2.1 [] is based on the competitive relationship between and among products.\" The Appellate Body accepted that domestic regulations may legitimately distinguish between products to serve a public health interest. However, it found that the differential treatment of menthol and clove cigarettes in the Tobacco Control Act did not stem from a legitimate regulatory distinction. The Appellate Body, therefore, found that Section 907(a)(1)(A) violated Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement.", "The panel found that Section 907(a)(10)(A), in providing a period of three months before the ban took effect, violated Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement, which requires a \"reasonable interval\" between publication of the law and its effective date. The United States appealed. The Appellate Body rejected Indonesia's argument that paragraph 5.2 of the Doha Ministerial Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns, which interpreted \"reasonable interval\" within Article 2.12 to mean \"a period of not less than six months,\" was a legally binding interpretation of Article 2.12 under Article IX:2 of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement). However, the Appellate Body found that paragraph 5.2 was a \"subsequent agreement\" under Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Appellate Body stated that under Article 2.12 the complaining Member must establish a prima facie case by demonstrating that the technical regulation provides an interval between publication and effective date of less than six months; then the burden shifts to the responding Member to demonstrate that the interval provided is reasonable.", "In response to the Appellate Body's decision, the United States has suggested that it will likely maintain the ban on clove cigarettes while fulfilling its obligations under the WTO Agreement. It appears the United States has not yet settled on how it will accomplish this. The United States and Indonesia agreed that the United States would comply with the Appellate Body decision by July 24, 2013."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to curb youth smoking, Section 907(a)(1)(A) of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) banned all flavorings in cigarettes except menthol. The ban took effect three months after the Tobacco Control Act became law. This ban was in response to the burgeoning market for cigarettes with flavors, like spice, fruit, and candy, that appealed to youth. Although menthol cigarettes also appeal to youth, they represent over a quarter of all the cigarettes smoked, meaning they have broad appeal among adults also. Rather than ban menthol cigarettes, therefore, Congress authorized the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to \"ban or modify the use of menthol in cigarettes based on scientific evidence.\" The FDA is studying the matter and has taken no action to date with respect to banning menthol in cigarettes. Clove cigarettes, which are banned by the Tobacco Control Act as non-menthol flavored cigarettes, are primarily imported from Indonesia, while menthol cigarettes are primarily produced domestically.", "The United States and Indonesia are Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral international economic organization created by the Marrakesh Protocol, which was signed in 1994. The Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement) includes a number of agreements to which all WTO Members must agree. Among these agreements are the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994). Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement requires WTO Members to treat \"like\" imported products no less favorably than \"like\" domestic products with respect to domestic regulations that set forth product characteristics. Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement provides that such regulations cannot be \"more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non-fulfillment would create.\" ", "Indonesia brought a claim before the WTO, arguing, among other things, that imported clove cigarettes are like domestically produced menthol cigarettes; that the Tobacco Control Act treats clove cigarettes less favorably than menthol cigarettes in violation of Article 2.1; and that the Tobacco Control Act is more trade restrictive than necessary under Article 2.2. Indonesia also claimed that the ban, in taking effect after three months, violates Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement, which requires a \"reasonable interval\" between a law's publication and its taking effect. The panel hearing Indonesia's claim agreed with Indonesia as to Articles 2.1 and 2.12, but rejected its argument with respect to Article 2.2. The United States appealed the panel's finding with respect to Articles 2.1 and 2.12 to the Appellate Body. Indonesia did not appeal the panel's finding with respect to Article 2.2.", "Although the Appellate Body disagreed with the panel's interpretation of certain terms, it upheld the panel's conclusion that the Tobacco Control Act violated Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, concluding that clove cigarettes are like menthol cigarettes and that clove cigarettes receive less favorable treatment under Section 907(a)(1)(A) than menthol cigarettes. In reaching this conclusion, the Appellate Body treated this as a case of de facto , not de jure , discrimination. It concluded that Article 2.1 should be interpreted in conjunction with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 and that likeness under Article 2.1, therefore, is based on the competitive relationship of the products. The Appellate Panel stated also that detrimental impacts on like imported products are permissible provided they are due exclusively to legitimate regulatory distinctions. The Appellate Body rejected that the United States had a legitimate reason for banning clove cigarettes, while not banning menthol cigarettes. The United States had argued that because millions of adults smoke menthol cigarettes, a ban would result in the development of a black market for menthol cigarettes and the health care system being overwhelmed by the many people who satisfied their nicotine addiction by smoking menthol cigarettes. The Appellate Body focused on the purpose of the ban, which was to ban cigarettes with characterizing flavors that mask the harshness of cigarette smoke because such cigarettes appeal to youth smokers. However, the Appellate Body stated that menthol cigarettes share with clove cigarettes the very characteristic that justified the ban\u2014they have a characterizing flavor that masks the harshness of tobacco smoke. Moreover, the Appellate Body questioned the likelihood of the development of a black market and the health care system being overwhelmed by menthol smokers in the event the United States were to ban menthol cigarettes, noting that regular cigarettes contain nicotine and would remain available. Therefore, the Appellate Body found that the decision to exempt menthol cigarettes from the ban on flavored cigarettes was not justified by a legitimate policy distinction. However, it reiterated that public health concerns, such as curbing youth smoking, are legitimate regulatory ends. ", "As mentioned above, Indonesia claimed that the Tobacco Control Act was more trade restrictive than necessary in violation of Article 2.2, but the panel found that Indonesia failed to make its case. Indonesia did not appeal that conclusion. In particular, the panel found that the ban's purpose, to reduce youth smoking, was a legitimate regulatory end; that Indonesia failed to demonstrate that the ban would make no \"material contribution\" to the goal of reducing youth smoking; and that Indonesia had failed to establish that there were less trade restrictive measures that the United States could take that would achieve a comparable reduction in youth smoking. Accordingly, the panel concluded that Indonesia had failed to establish that the ban on clove cigarettes was more trade restrictive than necessary. Because Indonesia did not appeal that part of the decision, the panel's conclusion stands.", "Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement requires a \"reasonable interval\" between publication of a technical regulation and its effective date. Indonesia complained that the Tobacco Control Act provided an interval between publication and effective date of three months while the term \"reasonable interval\" meant not less than six months. Indonesia based this claim on the fact that paragraph 5.2 of the Doha Ministerial Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns (Doha Ministerial Decision) interpreted \"reasonable interval\" within Article 2.12 to mean not less than six months. Paragraph 5.2, Indonesia argued, was a legally binding interpretation under Article IX:2 of the WTO Agreement. Without finding that paragraph 5.2 was a legally binding interpretation under Article IX:2, the panel determined that it must \"guide\" the panel's interpretation of \"reasonable interval.\" In the alternative, the panel found that paragraph 5.2 could be considered a subsequent agreement of the parties within Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Vienna Convention). Ultimately, it found that the Tobacco Control Act violated Article 2.12. ", "The Appellate Body determined that paragraph 5.2 was not a legally binding interpretation under Article IX:2 of the WTO Agreement, but it was a subsequent agreement under Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention. Therefore, the burden to present a prima facie case that the interval provided by the Tobacco Control Act is less than six month fell on Indonesia, as the complaining Member, and the burden to rebut this prima facie showing by demonstrating that the interval is reasonable fell on the United States, as the responding Member. Because the Appellate Body concluded that Indonesia presented a prima facie case which the United States failed to rebut, it held that the Tobacco Control Act violated Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement.", "In response to the Appellate Body's decision, the United States suggested that it will likely maintain the ban on clove cigarettes and stated that it will act in a way that respects its obligations under the WTO Agreement.

Noting that the two Articles share the same core terms\u2014\"like products\" and \"treatment no less favourable\"\u2014and the same scope of application, the Appellate Body determined that \"in interpreting Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, a panel should focus on the text of Article 2.1, read in the context of the TBT Agreement, including its preamble, and also consider other contextual elements, such as Article III:4 of the GATT 1994.\" Therefore, the Appellate Body recognized the similarity of Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement and Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 for their core terms (\"like products\" and \"less favourable treatment\"), as well as their similarity in providing room for Members to regulate for domestic purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relevance of Regulatory Purpose of the Technical Regulation to the Likeness Determination", "paragraphs": ["One of the issues before the Appellate Body was the extent to which the regulatory purpose of the technical regulation at issue should influence the likeness analysis.

It explained that \"the concept of 'like products' serves to define the scope of products that should be compared to establish whether less favourable treatment is being accorded to imported products.\" The Appellate Body \"consider[ed] that the determination of likeness under Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, as well as under Article III:4 of the GATT 1994, is a determination about the nature and extent of a competitive relationship between and among the products at issue.\" Regulatory concerns behind a technical regulation may nonetheless play a role in the likeness determination \"[t]o the extent that they are relevant to the examination of certain 'likeness' criteria and are reflected in the products' competitive relationship.\" As explained below, however, regulatory concerns primarily relate to analyzing less favorable treatment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Like Products", "paragraphs": ["There are four traditional likeness criteria in GATT 1994 jurisprudence: physical characteristics; end-uses; consumer tastes and habits; and tariff classification.

The panel, the United States argued, should have considered the tastes and habits of adult smokers also.", "The Appellate Body agreed with the United States that the panel should have considered adult smokers as well as youth smokers: \"In an analysis of likeness based on products' competitive relationship, it is the market that defines the scope of consumers whose preferences are relevant.\"", "The proportion of youth and adults smoking different types of cigarettes may vary, but clove, menthol, and regular cigarettes are smoked by both young and adult smokers. To evaluate the degree of substitutability among these products, the Panel should have assessed the tastes and habits of all relevant consumers of the products at issue, not only of the main consumers of clove and menthol cigarettes, particularly where it is clear that an important proportion of menthol cigarette smokers are adult consumers.", "Although the Appellate Body agreed with the United States that the consumers whose tastes and habits should be considered included adult and youth smokers, it sustained the panel's conclusion that menthol and clove cigarettes were like for the criterion of consumer tastes and habits. The Appellate Body explained:", "In order to determine whether products are like under Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the products are substitutable for all consumers or that they actually compete in the entire market. Rather, if the products are highly substitutable for some consumers but not for others, this may also support a finding that the products are like.", "The Appellate Body noted, therefore, that substitutability did not have to exist throughout the market in order for products to be like. Rather it is enough that the products are substitutable within a segment of the market.", "[T]he mere fact that clove cigarettes are smoked disproportionately by youth, while menthol cigarettes are smoked more evenly by young and adult smokers does not necessarily affect the degree of substitutability between clove and menthol cigarettes. The Panel found that, from the perspective of young and potential young smokers, clove-flavoured cigarettes and menthol-flavoured cigarettes are similar for purposes of starting to smoke. We understand this as a finding that young and potential young smokers perceive clove and menthol cigarettes as sufficiently substitutable.

This suggests, in our view, that Article 2.1 should not be read to mean that any distinction, in particular those that are based exclusively on particular product characteristics or their related processes and production methods, would per se accord less favorable treatment within the meaning of Article 2.1.", "Next, the Appellate Body considered Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement: \"Members shall ensure that technical regulations are not prepared, adopted or applied with a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade. For this purpose, technical regulations shall not be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non-fulfillment would create.\"", "The Appellate Body stated, \"The context provided by Article 2.2 suggests that 'obstacles to international trade' may be permitted insofar as they are not found to be 'unnecessary,' that is 'more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate object.'\" To the Appellate Body, this meant that \"Article 2.1 does not operate to prohibit a priori any obstacle to international trade.\"", "Next, the Appellate Body considered the sixth recital of the TBT Agreement's preamble. The sixth recital explicitly provides that Members may take \"measures necessary for, inter alia, the protection of human life or health, provided such measures 'are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination' or a 'disguised restriction on international trade' and are 'otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.'\"", "Looking again at the object and purpose of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body wrote that, given that the purpose of the TBT Agreement is to \"strike a balance between, on the one hand, the objective of trade liberalization and, on the other hand, Members' right to regulate,\" \"Article 2.1 should not be interpreted as prohibiting any detrimental impact on competitive opportunities for imports in cases where such detrimental impact on imports stems exclusively from legitimate regulatory distinctions.\" Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, therefore, prohibits de jure and de facto discrimination but allows detrimental impacts on imported products if those impacts arise exclusively from legitimate regulatory distinctions.", "The Appellate Body next outlined the jurisprudence concerning less favorable treatment developed under Article III:4 of GATT 1994, which it considered instructive in assessing the meaning of this concept. After reviewing a number of cases, the Appellate Body stated, \"the 'treatment no less favourable' standard of Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 prohibits WTO members from modifying the conditions of competition in the marketplace to the detriment of the group of imported products vis-\u00e0-vis the group of domestic like products.\" ", "The Appellate Body elaborated on how its standard should be applied when de facto discrimination is alleged: ", "Accordingly, where the technical regulation at issue does not de jure discriminate against imports, the existence of a detrimental impact on competitive opportunities for the group of imported vis-\u00e0-vis the group of domestic like products is not dispositive of less favourable treatment under Article 2.1. Instead, a panel must further analyze whether the detrimental impact on imports stems exclusively from a legitimate regulatory distinction rather than reflecting discrimination against the group of imported products. In making this determination, a panel must carefully scrutinize the particular circumstances of the case, that is, the design, architecture, revealing structure, operation, and application of the technical regulation at issue, and, in particular, whether that technical regulation is even handed in order to determine whether it discriminates against the group of imported products.", "Therefore, the Appellate Body agreed with the United States that detrimental impact on a group of like imported goods is not sufficient to establish a violation of Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement.

First, the Appellate Body noted that the panel found that virtually all clove cigarettes imported into the United States in the three years prior to the ban came from Indonesia and that the vast majority of clove cigarettes consumed in the United States came from Indonesia. Moreover, the United States had confirmed that non-clove flavored cigarettes subject to Section 907(a)(1)(A)'s ban were on the market for a very short time and represented a relatively small market share.

If these producers can adapt their products or production methods to the requirements of an importing Member's technical regulation in less than six months, a period of six months or more cannot be considered to be a \"reasonable interval\"\u2026.

In particular, the United States appreciated that the Appellate Body recognized that Members may make \"legitimate regulatory distinctions between like products, even where there is a detriment to the competitive conditions for the group of like imported products compared to the group of like domestic products.\" However, the United States stated that the Appellate Body's findings and analysis on Article 2.1 are \"problematic\" because it fails to appreciate that, \"from the perspective of public health regulation, there is a clear difference between a product, such as clove cigarettes, that is smoked in the United States experimentally by a small number of young people but relatively few adults, and a product such as menthol cigarettes, that is not only used by youth during initiation but also by tens of millions of addicted adults.\" ", "Because the Appellate Body recognized that the panel failed to explain why it rejected the U.S. regulatory approach and, therefore, made no factual findings, the United States asserted, the Appellate Body should have overturned the panel's conclusion.

The Appellate Body concluded that clove cigarettes and menthol cigarettes are like products: with respect to end-uses, they are both capable of satisfying a nicotine addiction and creating a pleasurable smoking experience; and, with respect to consumer tastes and habits, they compete with each other and are substitutable within the youth segment of the overall market. The Appellate Body also determined that Section 907(a)(1)(A) treats clove cigarettes less favorably than menthol cigarettes and that this less favorable treatment is not justified by a legitimate regulatory distinction. The United States had argued that because millions of adult smokers are addicted to menthol cigarettes, banning them would run the risk of menthol smokers overwhelming the health care system as they sought treatment for nicotine withdrawal and turning to a black market to obtain menthol cigarettes. However, the Appellate Body noted the addictive ingredient in cigarettes is nicotine and that regular cigarettes, which contain nicotine, would continue to be available.", "The Appellate Body also found that Section 901(a)(1)(A) violated Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement because it did not provide a \"reasonable interval\" between its publication and its effective date. In arriving at this finding, it determined that paragraph 5.2 of the Doha Ministerial Decision is not a legally binding interpretation of \"reasonable interval\" under Article IX:2 of the WTO Agreement because it did not satisfy the procedural requirements of Article IX:2. The Appellate Body determined, however, that paragraph 5.2 of the Doha Ministerial Decision constituted a subsequent agreement on the meaning of \"reasonable interval\" within Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention. It also determined that a complaining Member establishes a prima facie case by establishing that the technical regulation allows less than six months between publication and effective date. A responding Member rebuts a prima facie case by establishing that the time provided by the technical regulation is reasonable.", "The U.S. statement in response to the Appellate Body's decision seems to suggest that the United States intends to maintain the ban on clove cigarettes, while at the same time respecting its obligations under the WTO Agreement. It appears the United States has not yet decided how it intends to accomplish this goal. The United States and Indonesia agreed to a compliance date of July 24, 2013."], "subsections": []}]}}
