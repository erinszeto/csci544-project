Permanence refers to the goal of ensuring that children do not spend too many of their formative years in foster care. Accordingly, if a child enters foster care the state must work to quickly and safely reunite a child with his or her parents, or, if that is not possible or appropriate, to quickly find another safe and permanent home for the child.

Title IV-E agencies are required to take certain steps to identify relatives with whom a child in foster care may be safely placed, and they must work to maintain sibling relationships for children. Title IV-E agencies are required to \"consider giving preference\" to an adult relative over a non-related caregiver when determining where a child in foster care should live, provided the adult relative meets all the state's relevant child protection standards.

While federal law spells out specific instances when a Title IV-E agency must initiate efforts to achieve TPR, it does not dictate that TPR be accomplished in any given case. The TPR process, like family law matters generally, is governed by state laws, and all states have established standards to determine when parental rights may be involuntarily severed.

Unlike adoption, establishment of legal guardianship does not require termination of parental rights (TPR) of the child's parents. States that elect to offer Title IV-E kinship guardianship must amend their Title IV-E plan to say they will enter into these agreements. (As of September 2014, 30 states and one tribe had an approved Title IV-E plan that included provision of kinship guardianship, and an additional state had submitted a plan amendment seeking to provide this assistance.) Further, for each child whom the state determines that the permanency plan is kinship guardianship, the state must include certain findings in the child's written case plan regarding the appropriateness of guardianship (instead of reunification or adoption), efforts to discuss the guardianship with the child's parent, reasons for any separation of siblings during the placement, and the child's eligibility for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance.

Separately, under the Title IV-B, Subpart 1 program (Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services), a state must ensure that the state child welfare agency and the agency that administers Medicaid in the state develop a health oversight plan for each child in foster care. This requirement is not a part of the Title IV-E plan and so is not discussed further here.

Some information available suggests that states do not always compile these records, or do not compile them completely and, further, that the record is not always supplied to a foster parent. Ensuring that necessary information is available to the child welfare agency in a manner consistent with federal privacy laws related to sharing medical and educational information may require planning, cross-agency communication and cooperation, court facilitation, and/or clarifying state laws and regulations. The Uninterrupted Scholars Act ( P.L. 112-278 ), enacted in January 2013, addressed this concern with regard to education records. Specifically, it amended the federal education privacy law (known as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA) to permit educational agencies to share education records of children in foster care with an agency caseworker or other representative of a state or tribal child welfare agency (that is legally responsible for the child without first securing the consent of the child's parent). The law also permits educational release of these records (without additional notice to the child's parent) if a judge orders the information released as part of a child abuse and neglect or dependency hearing to which the child's parent is a party.

Federal law provides that state child welfare agencies must assure coordination with local educational agencies (LEAs), but there is no comparable requirement for LEAs (or state educational agencies) to coordinate with child welfare agencies on these issues. However, HHS and the U.S. Department of Education (ED) have sought to engage both agencies to meet the educational needs of children in foster care, alerting state education and child welfare leaders to the education planning and stability requirements in an August 2011 letter; co-hosting a foster care and education summit in November 2011 to bring together representatives of state child welfare, education, and court systems to plan for cross-system collaboration to meet the educational needs of children in foster care; and issuing a new joint letter in May 2014. That most recent letter noted that while the \"educational stability requirements of the Fostering Connections Act apply most directly\" to state child welfare agencies, \"compliance is contingent on routine coordination\" between those agencies and local educational agencies (LEAs).

Among 50 state child welfare agencies that responded to a recent survey, 40 reported that their agency \"typically\" pays transportation costs to enable a child to remain in his/her school of origin (when this is in the child's best interest). Nearly all of these (37) reported that the agency sought federal Title IV-E funding (reimbursement) for these transportation costs. States may not claim Title IV-E reimbursement for these school transportation costs on behalf of children in foster care who do not meet the Title IV-E foster care eligibility requirements.", "State child welfare agencies have long been required to take into account the proximity of a child's education setting when placing a child in foster care.

The performance outcome: \"Children receive appropriate services to meet their educational needs,\" was determined achieved in 87% of all child welfare cases reviewed (across all states) as part of the 2007-2010 federal Child and Family Services Review (CFSR). The review found that states were more successful at achieving this outcome for children who were in foster care (91%) than for children served in their own homes (72%). Common challenges to achieving this education outcome were reported as failure to assess a child's educational needs (identified in 30 states); failure to address a child's educational needs (identified in 23 states); and \"challenges in maintaining or coordinating educational services for children in foster care, due in part to a lack of communication among schools and with the [child welfare] agency, delays in transferring Individual Educational Plans and credits, and delays in enrollment\" (identified in 24 states)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Help Youth Transition Successfully From Foster Care to Adulthood", "paragraphs": ["Youth who are discharged from foster care when they reach the age of majority, and without reunification or placement in a new permanent family, are said to have \"aged-out\" or been \"emancipated\" from care.

Further, the law changes the language of current policy to indicate these services (as well as those previously provided for in the law) are intended to ensure a youth may make a successful transition from foster care to adulthood. The effective date for each of these P.L. 113-183 changes is generally September 29, 2015.

They require that youth be informed of certain rights they have with regard to education, health, visitation, court participation, access to key documents if aging out, and the \"right to stay safe and avoid exploitation.\" Further, in addition to a prior focus on transition services planning for older youth in care, the new provisions added by P.L. 113-183 explicitly incorporate youth participation in both development and revision of all case and permanency planning done on their behalf, including by allowing the youth to select up to two individuals\u2014who are not the youth's foster parent or caseworker\u2014to be a part of the youth's case planning and permanency planning. (The state may reject an individual so selected if it has good cause to believe the individual would not act in the child's best interest.) ", "The new requirements also focus on getting an earlier start on equipping youth to be successful once they leave foster care (requirements apply at age 14 versus age 16) and enhancing their ability for success when they age out of care. Currently states are required to provide a credit report, annually, to each youth in care who is age 16 or older. This requirement, which will apply to youth in care at age 14 or older as of September 29, 2015, is intended to help identify and correct any errors in the report that result from identity fraud. , Additionally, states are now required to work with each youth who is in foster care and is within 90 days of aging out of that care to develop a transition plan that includes specific options regarding housing, education, mentoring, support services, employment and workforce support services, health insurance, and health care decision making. Further, states are currently required to provide any youth aging out of care a free copy of his or her health and education record. As part of its effort to aid a youth's successful transition to adulthood, P.L. 113-183 also requires states to provide additional key documents. As of September 29, 2015, states must also ensure that no youth who is aging out leaves care without an official or certified copy of his or her U.S. birth certificate, an official Social Security card, and a state-issued driver's license or identification card that meets the standards of the REAL ID Act.

In that law, Congress sought to strengthen the permanency planning requirements in child welfare policy and to end \"long-term\" foster care that resulted from a lack of state effort or planning for permanency. As part of this, the addition of APPLA to the law appears to have been intended to ensure that deliberate thought and reasoning preceded any long-term stay for a child in foster care. Children who are assigned APPLA as a permanency plan may live in any kind of foster care setting (e.g., foster family home, group home, or institution), and they are likely to age out of care. That is because unlike the preferred permanency plans\u2014reunification, adoption, legal guardianship, or placement with a fit and willing relative\u2014the APPLA plan does not include any specific pathway (or goal) for how a child will leave that foster care setting to live with a permanent family.
