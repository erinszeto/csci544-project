Assistance has not been limited to outlays by the Treasury, or to actions explicitly authorized by Congress, or to measures which imposed a net cost on taxpayers on an unadjusted cash-flow basis. Sometimes, the industry distress was being driven by external shocks, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks or the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and other times it was driven by long-term secular trends, such as changes in the economic outlook for the railroad industry. Past assistance has involved such instruments as loan guarantees, asset purchases, capital injections, direct loans, and regulatory changes, with the specific mix of policies varying significantly from case to case.

", "In some of the cases reviewed in this report, the government was able to recoup much or all of its assistance through fees, interest, warrants, and loan or principal repayments. In others, there were no arrangements made for recoupment or repayment. But the fact that a beneficiary of government assistance repaid a loan or gave the government shares that ultimately increased in value does not necessarily mean that the government \"broke even\" or \"made a profit.\" The government had to borrow, incurring interest payments, to finance these programs, and adjusting federal outlays and receipts for inflation may not account fully for this. In most cases, although not all, government assistance was provided under the assumption that it would be repaid, exposing the government to risk of credit loss that is not accounted for simply by adding up expenditures and receipts. ", "An economist would typically determine whether the government received full compensation for credit assistance by comparing the government's terms to what a private investor would have required for the loan or loan guarantee. Making such adjustments would increase the reported value of federal assistance and in some instances would indicate that taxpayers were not fully compensated\u00e2\u0080\u0094although it is fair to question what terms would have been required, for example, by a hypothetical commercial lender in the depths of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when private credit markets were not functioning normally. In any case, if such a standard were used, it would be a more demanding one than the government typically uses to measure the costs of federal credit and guarantee programs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has provided assessments of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) adjusting for borrowing costs and market risk, but CBO has not offered such estimates of other government assistance.", "The final disposition of assets and liabilities arising from assistance often can take years. But not all sources continued to consistently report data long after the initial intervention.

One large railroad, the New York, Ontario and Western, which had been in financial distress since the 1930s, was liquidated in 1957. Rail industry leaders advocated for one or more of the following in order to counter this trend: permission to shut down unprofitable routes, especially passenger routes; direct subsidies to continue operations; and/or encouragement of large-scale mergers to create economies of scale. Congress' initial legislative response, the Transportation Act of 1958 ( P.L. 85-625 ), created a loan guarantee program for railroads and gave the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) sole authority over proposals to curtail service, circumventing the previous role of state agencies. Still, the industry underwent a wave of mergers, consolidating from 110 Class I railroads in 1957 to 71 in 1970. The process culminated in the 1968 merger of arch-rivals Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad into the Penn Central, the largest railroad in the world at the time. ", "By this time, a wave of bankruptcies was well underway. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad had gone into bankruptcy in 1961 and was merged into the Penn Central in 1969, its inclusion having been a condition of the Penn Central-New York Central merger's approval by the ICC. The Central Railroad of New Jersey failed in 1967. Then, in declining financial condition due to falling revenues, badly rundown infrastructure, high property taxes, incompatible systems, and high labor costs, the Penn Central itself declared bankruptcy in June 1970, less than three years after its creation. Other railroads operating in the Northeast and Midwest also went bankrupt and could not be reorganized, some having suffered severe damage caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The other troubled carriers included the Ann Arbor Railroad, the Reading Railroad, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Boston and Maine Railroad, and the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, itself the result of a merger of former competitors completed in 1960.", "In addition to disrupting passenger and freight transportation, the railroad industry's distress exposed a number of major banks and financial institutions to large potential losses. The commercial paper market, in which firms issue short-term securities to meet near-term financial needs, experienced disruptions following the Penn Central bankruptcy, leading to concerns that the Penn Central's problems could endanger companies in other industries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Executive or Regulatory Agency Action and Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Several federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation, the Department of Defense, and the Federal Reserve, were unwilling or unable to assist troubled railroads with loan guarantees.

The first, FSA, is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and receives federal appropriations to make direct loans and guarantees to farmers who do not qualify for commercial credit.

Since the FCS had exposure to only a single industry, it held a loan portfolio that developed large delinquencies, much of which was eventually written off as uncollectible. The farm financial crisis caused the FCS to experience operating losses of $2.7 billion in 1985 and $1.9 billion in 1986, for example, which jeopardized its financial stability, including its ability to repay bondholders in private capital markets.
