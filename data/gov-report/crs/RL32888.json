General Shinseki's intent was to make the Army lighter, more modular, and\u2014most importantly\u2014more deployable. General Shinseki's deployment goals were to deploy a brigade in 4 days, a division in 5 days, and five divisions in 30 days. As part of this transformation, the Army adopted the Future Combat System (FCS) as a major acquisition program to equip the Objective Force.", "This transformation, due to its complexity and uncertainty, was scheduled to take place over the course of three decades, with the first FCS-equipped objective force unit reportedly becoming operational in 2011 and the entire force transformed by 2032. In order to mitigate the risk associated with the Objective Force and to address the near-term need for more deployable and capable units, the Army's transformation plan called for the development of brigade-sized units called the Interim Force in both the active Army and the Army National Guard. These Interim Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) were the predecessors to the Army's current Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).", "General Shinseki's vision for the FCS was that it would consist of smaller and lighter ground and air vehicles\u2014manned, unmanned, and robotic\u2014and would employ advanced offensive, defensive, and communications/information systems to \"outsmart and outmaneuver heavier enemy forces on the battlefield.\" In order to initiate the FCS program, General Shinseki turned to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), not only because of its proven ability to manage highly conceptual and scientifically challenging projects, but also because he reportedly felt that he would receive a great deal of opposition from senior Army leaders who advocated heavier and more powerful vehicles such as the M-1 Abrams tank and the M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. In May 2000, DARPA awarded four contracts to four industry teams to develop FCS designs, and in March 2002, the Army chose Boeing and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to serve as the lead systems integrators to oversee certain aspects of the development of the FCS's 18 original systems. On May 14, 2003, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) approved the FCS's next acquisition phase, and in August 2004 Boeing and SAIC awarded contracts to 21 companies to design and build its various platforms and hardware and software."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Overview10", "paragraphs": ["The Army described FCS as a joint (involving the other services) networked \"system of systems.\" FCS systems were to be connected by means of an advanced network architecture that would permit connectivity with other services, situational awareness and understanding, and synchronized operations that are currently unachievable by Army combat forces. FCS was intended to network with existing forces, systems currently in development, and systems that would be developed in the future.

The MGV program was intended to field eight separate tracked combat vehicle variants built on a common chassis that would eventually replace combat vehicles such as the M-1 Abrams tank, the M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, and the M-109 Paladin self-propelled artillery system. Secretary Gates was concerned that there were significant unanswered questions in the FCS vehicle design strategy and, despite some adjustments to the MGVs, that the vehicles did not adequately reflect the lessons of counterinsurgency and close-quarters combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. Secretary Gates was also critical that the FCS program did not include a role for Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicles that have been used successfully in current conflicts. After reevaluating requirements, technology, and approach, DOD planned to relaunch the Army's vehicle modernization program, including a competitive bidding process. ", "The Army halted the current FCS program shortly after the completion of a May 2009 Systems of Systems Preliminary Design Review. The successor to the FCS program is called the Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization (ABCTM) program, which is to be responsible for developing and fielding a new ground combat vehicle (GCV) and spinning out remaining FCS technologies to the Army's 73 BCTs. The FCS program's lead systems integrators\u2014Boeing and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)\u2014are not to be retained for the GCV program. Boeing and SAIC are expected to receive about $350 million in cancellation penalties due to the decision to discontinue their services as lead systems integrators for the MGV program.
