For each hospital, the report must include the following information: the hospital-specific DSH limit, the Medicaid inpatient utilization rate, the low income utilization rate, state-defined DSH qualification criteria, Medicaid basic payments, other supplemental payments, total Medicaid uncompensated care, total uninsured uncompensated care, federal Section 1011 payments, and DSH payments. ", "The annual independent certified audits must verify that hospitals retain the DSH payment; DSH payments are made in accordance with the hospital-specific DSH limits; uncompensated care only includes inpatient and outpatient services; and the state separately documented and retains records of DSH payments (including the methodology for calculating each hospital's DSH payments). ", "The annual independent certified audits must be completed by the last day of the federal fiscal year ending three years from the end of the SPRY under audit. The annual DSH reports are due at the same time as the independent certified audits. If a state does not submit the independent certified audit by this deadline, the state could lose the federal DSH matching funds for the SPRYs subsequent to the date the audit is due.", "To ensure a period for developing and refining the reporting and auditing techniques, findings of state reports and audits for SPRY2005 to SPRY2010 were not to be given weight except to the extent that the findings draw into question the reasonableness of the state uncompensated care cost estimates used for calculations of prospective DSH payments. For SPRY2011 and after, audit findings demonstrating that DSH payments exceed the hospital-specific cost limit are regarded as discovery of overpayment to providers requiring the state to return the federal share of the overpayment to the federal government (unless the DSH payments are redistributed to other qualifying hospitals)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Since DSH allotments were implemented in FY1993, DSH payments have remained relatively stable. Total DSH expenditures have dropped as a percentage of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures from 15.0% in FY1992 to 3.5% in FY2015. ", "Over the next few years, DSH expenditures are to continue to decline as a percentage of Medicaid medical assistance expenditures due to the DSH reductions. The impact of these reductions will vary by state according to the uninsurance rate of each state; whether a state is a \"low DSH state\"; and how a state targets its DSH payments. ", "Currently, the DSH reductions are slated to end in FY2025 with state DSH allotments returning to the level states would have received without the DSH reduction for FY2026 and subsequent years. However, the future of Medicaid DSH payments is uncertain because Congress may decide to change the DSH reductions again. Also, as states build experience with the ACA Medicaid expansion, the role of DSH in Medicaid may be revisited and modified by Congress.", "Appendix A. A Chronology of State DSH Allotments Calculations", "The Medicaid Voluntary Contribution and Provider-Specific Tax Amendments of 1991 ( P.L. 102-234 ) established ceilings on federal Medicaid DSH funding for each state. Since FY1993, each state has had its own DSH limit, which is referred to as \"DSH allotments.\" These allotments are calculated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and promulgated in the Federal Register . The methodology for calculating these allotments has changed a number of times over the years, and these different methodologies are described below.", "FY1993", "The original state DSH allotments provided in FY1993 were based on each state's FY1992 DSH payments. This resulted in funding inequities because states that had been providing relatively more DSH payments to hospitals in FY1992 locked in higher Medicaid DSH allotments (and vice versa). As a result, the DSH allotment a state receives is not entirely based on the number of DSH hospitals in the state or the hospital services provided in DSH hospitals to low-income patients.", "FY1994 to FY1997", "The DSH allotments for FY1994 to FY1997 were based on each state's prior year DSH allotment. The annual growth for each state's DSH allotment depended on whether a state was classified as a \"high-DSH\" or \"low-DSH\" state. States with DSH expenditures greater than 12% of their total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures (i.e., federal and state Medicaid expenditures excluding expenditures for administrative activities) were classified as \"high-DSH\" states, and \"high-DSH\" states did not receive an increase to their DSH allotment. States with DSH expenditures less than 12% of their total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures were classified as \"low-DSH\" states, and the growth factor for the DSH allotment for \"low-DSH\" states was the projected percentage increase for each state's total Medicaid expenditures (i.e., including federal and state spending) for the current year. However, \"low-DSH\" states' DSH allotments could not exceed 12% of each state's total medical assistance expenditures. ", "FY1998 to FY2000", "Provisions included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA; P.L. 105-33 ) reduced Medicaid DSH expenditures by replacing the state DSH allotment calculations with fixed state DSH allotments specified in statute for FY1998 through FY2002. The aggregate fixed allotments for FY1998 totaled $10.3 billion, which was a 50% decrease from the aggregate FY1997 DSH allotments. The aggregate allotments for FY1999 and FY2000 decreased to $10.0 billion and $9.3 billion respectively. ", "Adjustments for Specific States", "A number of legislative adjustments were made to the BBA fixed DSH allotments. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 ( P.L. 105-78 ) increased the FY1998 DSH allotments for Minnesota and Wyoming. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 ( P.L. 105-277 ) increased the FY1999 DSH allotments for Minnesota, New Mexico, and Wyoming. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2000, P.L. 106-113 ) increased the FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002 DSH allotments for the District of Columbia, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Wyoming.", "FY2001 and FY2002", "The fixed state allotments were supposed to last through FY2002 with the aggregate DSH allotments slated to decrease in FY2001 and again in FY2002. However, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA, which was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, P.L. 106-554 ) eliminated the DSH reductions for FY2001 and FY2002 and provided states with increases to their DSH allotments. Specifically, the DSH allotments for those two years were determined by increasing each state's prior year DSH allotment by the percent change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the prior fiscal year. These state DSH allotments could not exceed 12% of a state's total medical assistance expenditures for the allotment year. This is referred to as the 12% rule.", "Extremely Low DSH States", "BIPA also established a special rule for DSH allotments for \"extremely low DSH states,\" which were defined as states with FY1999 DSH expenditures greater than 0% and less than 1% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures (i.e., federal and state Medicaid expenditures excluding expenditures for administrative activities). The FY2001 DSH allotments for extremely low DSH states were increased to 1% of each state's FY2001 total medical assistance expenditures.

For most states, the FY2002 state DSH allotments provided by BBA were less than the actual state allotments states received in FY2002. As a result, in general, FY2003 DSH allotments were lower than the allotments states received in FY2002. This was not the case for extremely low DSH states, which received FY2003 DSH allotments based on their actual FY2002 DSH allotment increased by percentage change in CPI-U for FY2002.

This change was effective as of October 1, 2005. Increasing the District of Columbia's DSH allotments for FY2000 to FY2002 was done for the purposes of determining the District of Columbia's FY2006 DSH allotment. This change made the District of Columbia's DSH allotment for FY2006 $57.7 million, which was a $20.0 million increase over what the District of Columbia would have gotten without the change.

Then, states' FY2010 DSH allotments were 102.5% of each state's FY2009 DSH allotment as determined under ARRA. For both years, the ARRA DSH provisions were not applied to the DSH allotments for states that would have had a higher DSH allotment as determined without application of the ARRA DSH provisions.

Two distinct differences are (1) the proportion of DSH payments going to hospitals and IMDs and (2) total DSH payments as a percent of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures (i.e., including federal and state expenditures and excluding expenditures for administrative activities).", "Nationally, 84% of Medicaid DSH expenditures are allocated to hospitals, and the remaining 16% is distributed to IMDs and other mental health facilities. This distribution varies by state. As shown in Table C-1 , in FY2015, most states targeted their DSH expenditures to hospitals with 15 states allocating all of their DSH expenditures to hospitals. However, some states focused their DSH expenditures on IMDs and other mental health facilities. One state (Maine) used all of its DSH expenditures for IMDs and other mental health facilities.", " Table C-1 also shows FY2015 total DSH expenditures (i.e., including both federal and state expenditures) as a percentage of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures (i.e., including federal and state expenditures and excluding expenditures for administrative activities).
