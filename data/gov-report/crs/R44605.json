They typically include measures such as: trade embargoes, restrictions on particular exports or imports, denial of foreign assistance, loans, and investments, or control of foreign assets and economic transactions that involve U.S. citizens or businesses. The decision to apply economic trade and aid sanctions can be based, to some extent, on a country's record with respect to human rights, religious freedom, international terrorism, terrorist financing, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, disruption of regional stability, treaty violations, international narcotics trafficking, trafficking in persons, trafficking in protected natural resources and endangered species, child abduction, interference with democratic processes, war crimes, corruption, cyber espionage, and money laundering.

Imports from China do not qualify for duty-free treatment afforded to certain imports from developing countries under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes the GSP, requires a communist country to meet certain conditions before the President may designate it as a \"beneficiary developing country\" to become eligible for preferential trade treatment. Among the rationales for withholding GSP beneficiary states that are applicable to communist countries include ineligibility for MFN/NTR status and nonmembership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and International Monetary Fund (IMF). China cleared these hurdles when it joined the WTO in 2001, the United States granted it permanent NTR (PNTR) status in 2002, and it joined the IMF in 1980. The third condition to be met by communist countries is that the country in question \"is not dominated or controlled by international communism.\" Conditions applicable to communist countries are not waivable. In addition, China may be denied for its political system or for a number of other reasons stated in the law, including intellectual property rights protection or workers' rights.

Export regulations implement U.S. law and various international control regimes to which the United States is a party (i.e. , the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, or the Australia Group for chemical and biological weapons). They generally are not cast as economic sanctions because their goal is not to change the particular objectionable behavior of a targeted country but to meet U.S. legal and international obligations. The application of export controls, however, can have the same appearance and effect as an economic sanction imposed for foreign policy or national security objectives.", "Several executive branch departments and two independent commissions have export control responsibilities. The lion's share, however, is assigned to the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). BIS promulgates the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). The EAR include the Commerce Control List (CCL), which categorizes all goods, services, and technology for which export licenses are required for a range of national security and foreign policy reasons.", "An export license is required for commercial goods, services, or technology intended for China for reasons of: chemical and biological weapons proliferation, nuclear proliferation, national security, missile technology, regional stability, and crime control. This means that exporting most items on the CCL to China would require a license. For some goods and services, further guidance is provided in the form of license exceptions.", "Computer equipment, assemblies and components, for example, are controlled for national security reasons, but trading partners are sorted into two groups or tiers. China is listed in the more restricted Tier 3, for which a computer may be sold and shipped if it is a slower processor, if the end-user is clearly identified, and if the end-use does not pertain to nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile activities. Each license application is thus scrutinized by the Department of Commerce, and may also be reviewed by the Departments of State, Defense, or Energy.", "The United States' trading partners are also sorted into four country groups. Country Group A is reserved, mostly, for countries that are participants in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, and the Missile Technology Control Regime. The most restrictive group, Country Group E, is reserved for those countries identified by the State Department as supporters of international terrorism. China is in Country Group D for national security reasons and for determinations related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons and missile technology. A Country Group D listing further limits the likelihood of export licenses being granted for China for most CCL items, though for China the general policy is to approve licenses except in certain, very specific, instances. For example, it is general policy \"to restrict the export and reexport of items that would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any other country or combination of countries that would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States.\" In the case of China, however, according to Commerce Department regulations:", "...there is a general policy of approval for license applications to export, reexport, or transfer items to civil end-uses.

In addition to the presumption of denial of export licenses for some goods, on the grounds described above, beginning in mid-2007, the EAR has also generally prohibited the export of goods that have a military end-use in China. The nine categories of prohibited goods range from depleted uranium, chemicals, toxins, machine tools and parts with particular application, high-performance computers, x-ray components, telecommunications equipment, sensors, lasers, navigation equipment, avionics, underwater equipment, and some aircraft. Chinese entities for which this additional scrutiny of military end-use exports is required are listed in Appendix A .", "Satellites. President George H.W. Bush suspended export licenses for satellites contracted to be launched in China after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, an action re-enforced by Congress a few months later when it enacted the Tiananmen Square sanctions in 1990. The restriction remains in law but was waived on a case-by-case basis by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Clinton, who each found it in the U.S. national interest to do so. Following several controversial issuances of export licenses for satellites during the Clinton Administration, the President has been required, since 1998, to provide a detailed description and justification of each waiver applicable to satellites or related items. The State Department suspended the processing of export licenses for satellites to China in February 2000. Each year since FY2002, Congress has enacted legislation to require 15-days advance notification of any licensing for export to China of satellites or satellite components.", "Proliferation-Related Sanctions.

Nonetheless, entities and individuals in China have been found to be in violation of U.S. laws pertaining to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Over the years, Chinese entities and individuals have been linked to sales or transfers of controlled nuclear and missile technology to Iran, North Korea, Libya, Syria, and Pakistan.
