Created in 1937, the low-rent public housing program was the first major federal rental housing assistance program. The program initially subsidized the construction, and later the ongoing operation and maintenance, of multifamily rental housing properties for low-income families. While public housing is a federally created and funded program, the properties are owned and managed at the local level by quasi-governmental public housing authorities (PHAs) under contract with the federal government. Given this unique federal-local relationship, the program is governed in part by federal rules and regulations and in part by policies set at the local level.", "The public housing program serves some of the poorest families in the nation, including persons who are elderly, persons who are living with disabilities, and other families with and without children. Families who live in public housing generally pay rent equal to 30% of their adjusted gross income; average rents paid by public housing families lag substantially behind private market rents paid by similar families.", "Public housing properties themselves can be high-rise buildings, low-rise buildings, scattered site properties, and even part of mixed-income housing developments. Construction and acquisition of new public housing units effectively ended after the federal government stopped funding new development in the mid-1990s, although they began significantly decreasing much earlier as other models of providing housing assistance grew in popularity. As public housing properties have fallen into disrepair and been demolished, the number of public housing units has begun to decrease. Today, there are roughly 1.2 million units under contract and receiving federal funding, down from over 1.4 million units at the program's peak. Federal funding comes from two main formula grants\u2014the Public Housing Capital Fund and the Public Housing Operating Fund\u2014which are meant to supplement the rents collected by PHAs to meet the operation, maintenance, and capital needs of public housing. There have also been several competitive grant programs that provide additional funding to PHAs, including the HOPE VI program. In recent years, regular annual appropriations for public housing have generally been in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion per year, with an additional $4 billion provided by the 2009 economic stimulus legislation.", "In response to concerns about the adequacy of federal funding levels\u2014paired with federal restrictions on tenant rents\u2014to meet the capital needs of public housing, proposals have been introduced to promote private investment in public housing in order to preserve the existing stock. An increasing number of PHAs have pursued private financing to meet their capital needs in recent years. However, recent proposals calling for an expansion in the role of private finance in public housing have been met with concerns about the potential for the \"privatization\" of public housing and a loss of affordability. As the program continues to decline in terms of the number of families it serves, questions are arising about the role the program plays, and should play in the future, in terms of federal housing policy.", "This report is meant to serve as an introduction to the federal public housing program.

Most housing in this country is privately built and owned and most regulation of that process is done at the state and local level. However, the federal government has played a role for many years in assisting in the provision of safe, decent, and affordable housing for families of modest means. The low-rent public housing program was the original effort through which the federal government supported this policy goal. While public housing is a federally created and funded program, administered at the federal level by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the properties are owned and managed at the local level by quasi-governmental public housing authorities (PHAs) under contract with the federal government. Given this unique federal-local relationship, the program is governed in part by federal rules and regulations and in part by policies set at the local level. ", "The program was controversial from the start, with opponents contending that it subverted local control and interfered with private enterprise. Later, criticism grew about the conditions of the housing the program provided. Concern was expressed about the quality of life public housing provided to the families it served, as well as the character of the tenants the program served and the effect public housing was having on the communities in which it was located. Over time, in response to these critiques and others, the public housing model\u2014publicly owned and subsidized apartment buildings for poor families\u2014was replaced with other models of assistance. While no new public housing is authorized to be funded and built, much of the existing stock of public housing built under the original program remains. ", "Today's roughly 1.2 million units of public housing are home to some of the poorest families in the nation, including persons who are elderly, persons living with disabilities, and other families with and without children. In some cases, these families live in high-quality housing in neighborhoods of opportunity; in other cases, these families live in housing that is physically decrepit, socially isolated, and plagued by social ills. The federal government currently pays roughly $6 billion to $7 billion per year to support the remaining stock of public housing and there are differences of opinion about whether this program is a worthwhile federal investment or whether recent funding levels reflect an inadequate federal investment.

Its purpose was intended to be twofold: the housing created would respond to a lack of sanitary housing available at a low cost to families who had fallen on hard times, and the construction of the housing would lead to the creation of jobs and economic growth. However, the idea of the federal government providing housing proved to be controversial. Opponents saw government involvement in housing as a step towards socialism, the building industries thought that they could handle the nation's housing problems without government intervention, and some local governments were concerned that federal housing would encroach on their sovereignty. ", "The Housing Act of 1937 (P.L. 75-412) attempted to balance some of these concerns in the way that it designed the low-rent public housing program. Under the terms of the act, public housing properties would be built and owned only by state-chartered and locally governed public housing authorities (PHAs). This gave states and localities the right to choose whether or not to participate in the program by deciding whether or not to create PHAs. The federal government would provide capital financing under long-term Annual Contributions Contracts (ACCs). These contracts would spell out the federal requirements of the program; however, many of the decisions about how the housing was designed, where it was located, and who could live in it would be left to the PHAs. Public housing's operations would be sustained primarily on tenant rents, which meant that families would be required to have incomes high enough to pay the rents charged for public housing units. However, in part to prevent competition with the private market, the authorizing statute dictated that families who wanted to live in public housing could not have incomes that exceeded five times the rents (six times in the case of large families). Further, the law required that for each new unit of housing built, an unsafe or unsanitary unit had to be eliminated (a concept often referred to as \"slum clearance\").", "Not long after the program was created, World War II shifted the focus of federal involvement in housing. The Lanham Act of 1940 halted new development under the low-rent public housing program in favor of government construction of housing for war workers. The act also gave war workers priority for existing public housing units. By the end of the 1940s, around 200,000 public housing units had been built and were under contract.", "The earliest residents of public housing were primarily working class families who were \"temporarily poor\" because of the Depression. Later, many war workers moved into public housing. As the nation began to prosper again, many families in public housing had income above what was considered to be low income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Housing Act of 1949: Expansion and Ties to Urban Renewal", "paragraphs": ["After being diverted to support the war effort, the low-rent public housing program was restarted at the end of the decade by the Housing Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-171). That act created a federal policy goal of \"a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family.\" It authorized the Urban Renewal program\u2014formalizing the policy of slum clearance evident in the 1937 act\u2014and required communities to give preference for public housing units to families displaced by Urban Renewal. The act expanded the authorization for new public housing units, calling for the creation of 810,000 units by 1954 (or 135,000 units per year). At the same time, the act added new requirements. Out of concern about crowding out private market housing, the act instituted construction cost limits and added a requirement that public housing rents be at least 20% below prevailing market rents for safe and decent housing. Given that upper income eligibility limits were tied to rents (i.e., incomes could not exceed five times the rents), this meant that income eligibility limits would be lowered. Additionally, the act required that the Annual Contributions Contracts be amended to require the eviction of tenants whose income exceeded the limits. ", "While the 1949 act restarted the public housing program, its goal of 810,000 units in six years was not met. The year after the enactment of the 1949 act, President Truman lowered the rate of construction to roughly half the authorized level in response to concerns about materials shortages resulting from the outbreak of hostilities in Korea. Congress followed suit by further lowering the authorized annual level of public housing construction starts each year in the appropriations acts. Also, opposition from local communities made it difficult for some PHAs to get approval to build public housing. As a result, fewer units were built in the 1950s than were envisioned by the 1949 act. By the end of 1957, only about 210,000 of the 810,000 units authorized by the 1949 act were under management.", "The characteristics of the tenants served in public housing also began changing during this period. The policy changes included in the 1949 act, taken together, would mean that public housing would serve families with income lower than what was originally required under the 1937 act. This change in the income character of tenants is evident in the fact that from 1952 to 1962, the number of families in public housing receiving income from private or public assistance programs rose from 29% to 46%. Further, given that public housing development was explicitly tied to Urban Renewal after 1949, the program began to house more families of color, particularly black families, who had been uprooted and displaced by Urban Renewal. From the beginning of the 1950s to the end, the percentage of nonwhite families living in public housing increased from 36% to 46%. In an era of legal segregation and discrimination, the increasing proportion of black families living in public housing led to great opposition to new public housing development in some predominantly white communities and to the perpetuation of segregation in public housing properties themselves."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1960s: New Forms of Assistance and the End of Legal Discrimination", "paragraphs": ["The 1960s brought a new vision with regard to federal housing assistance. Several new programs were developed to subsidize privately owned rental properties, as opposed to publicly owned properties, including the Section 236 rent supplement program serving low-income families and seniors; the Section 202 program serving the elderly; and the Section 221d(3) program serving families with incomes too high for public housing but too low to afford housing in the private market. Another program, the Section 23 leased housing program, was a new public housing program designed to utilize private market units. It permitted PHAs to lease private market units on behalf of public housing-eligible families. Also, by the late 1960s the Turnkey model of public housing began growing in popularity; under the Turnkey approach, a private developer builds housing on land he owns and then sells the property to a PHA to use as public housing. These new models of assistance, because they utilized private market participants, were thought to be more efficient and timely. Despite the introduction of new programs, the number of public housing units increased significantly during the 1960s to over 800,000 units, an increase from about half a million units at the beginning of the decade.", "The 1960s brought other important changes for public housing related to the social aspects of the program. A presidential order, Supreme Court cases, and civil rights legislation worked to make it illegal to deny public housing assistance to families based on their race and to systematically segregate public housing residents by race, which had been common since the inception of the program. While such discriminatory actions were officially outlawed during this period, desegregation and changes in community attitudes towards integrated public housing were not immediate and courts had to intervene. Out of concern about the ramifications of concentrations of poverty, the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 prohibited the construction of new high-rise public housing projects for families. ", "The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 made a fundamental change to the rent structure in public housing; the Brooke Amendment capped tenant contributions toward rent at 25% of family income. This change was made out of concern that rents charged for public housing were becoming too high for poor families to afford. To help meet the operating needs of public housing, the 1969 act also authorized HUD to begin providing operating assistance to PHAs, in addition to capital funding to cover the costs of the bonds they had issued to build public housing.", "Over this period, the income character of the tenants in public housing had also continued to change. Policy changes (such as the limit on the number of over-income families who could live in public housing, reductions in income eligibility standards, and preferences for families displaced by urban renewal) partnered with market changes (such as the post-war housing boom, increasing rates of homeownership, and suburbanization) resulted in public housing serving the poorest tenants, many of whom were receiving other public assistance. Until passage of the Brooke Amendment, the rents these very poor families paid were, in many cases, higher than what might be considered \"affordable\" to them, but not high enough to provide sufficient income to allow PHAs to properly maintain public housing properties. Although Congress eventually began providing additional operating subsidies to public housing after passage of the Brooke Amendment, some public housing developments, facing inadequate rental income and insufficient federal subsidies to maintain their properties, fell into severe disrepair. These realities\u2014poorer tenants paying lower rents, insufficient operating income, and deteriorating units\u2014shaped the public housing debates of the decade to follow. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 1970s and the Rise of Section 8", "paragraphs": ["By the early 1970s, construction programs were subject to growing criticism for taking too long to develop and being too expensive. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 required that at least 30% of new public housing units be created through the Section 23 leased housing program, which utilized the existing housing stock rather than new construction. The act also authorized a demonstration, called the Experimental Housing Allowance Program, to test the feasibility and effectiveness of giving families housing allowances in lieu of subsidized units. In 1973, President Nixon imposed a moratorium on all new housing construction commitments, including those under public housing. He argued that the existing programs needed revisiting because they did not provide decent housing to families and cost the federal government too much to build and maintain.", "The Nixon Moratorium was ended as Congress authorized funding for new units of public housing and created new housing assistance programs. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 created the Section 8 program, which continued the shift to subsidizing privately owned housing by pairing rental subsidies with private market housing units. The Section 8 program was designed to respond to the criticisms of the earlier programs by including subsidies for private units and relying less heavily on new construction. ", "After the moratorium, the focus of federal housing assistance policy had shifted away from constructing new public housing units to new models using the existing and private housing market through the Section 8 program. Public housing averaged fewer than 37,000 reservations for new units of public housing per year between 1975 and 1979, compared to an average of more than 275,000 reservations for new Section 8 assisted units per year over the same period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 1980s: Withdrawing Further from Public Housing", "paragraphs": ["The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 made several significant changes to public housing. It raised tenant rent contributions toward rent (as established by the Brooke Amendment at 25% of family income) to 30% of family income. Estimating that increased rents would decrease the need for federal operating subsidies, the act limited increases in funding for operating subsidies. At the same time, the act more deeply targeted assistance to the poorest families. Eligibility was largely restricted to families with incomes below 50% of the local area median income and federal preferences were set to target assistance to the households assumed to have the greatest need, including those who were homeless, those who were severely cost burdened, and those living in substandard housing.", "The trend away from public housing continued with the Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983, which limited new construction of public housing to instances in which it would be less than the cost of acquiring existing housing. At the same time, the act limited the ability of PHAs to demolish or dispose of public housing to cases where the unit could not be reasonably rehabilitated or the demolition/disposition would result in the acquisition of new housing. The 1983 act also authorized a demonstration testing a new form of Section 8 assistance, a portable voucher with more flexible standards. The voucher program was made permanent in 1988 and fully replaced the original Section 8 program. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 further limited new public housing construction to only those cases where the PHA could certify that family housing demand could not be met through Section 8. New public housing starts dropped off significantly during the 1980s in favor of the new Section 8 program.", "During the 1980s, concern continued to grow about the state of the existing public housing stock\u2014both the physical soundness as well as the social health of public housing communities. In 1989, Congress established a National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing. The commission was mandated to identify those public housing projects that were in a severe state of distress; assess the most promising strategies for improvement; and develop a national action plan. In 1992, the commission issued its findings and recommendations on the state of the nation's public housing. It reported finding residents living in fear of crime, high unemployment and limited opportunities for employment, insufficient resources to address the needs of residents, disincentives to self-sufficiency, and housing that had deteriorated to the point that it was physically dangerous. The commission issued a wide range of recommendations, including increased social services for residents, increased funding for public housing capital needs, better performance assessment for PHAs, and experimentation with new forms of public-private partnerships. The commission labeled 6% of the public housing stock as severely distressed; at the time, this equaled 86,000 units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1990s to Present: The End of Public Housing Development and Decline in Units", "paragraphs": ["The National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 reacted to some of the concerns about public housing echoed by the National Commission. It authorized the Family Self Sufficiency program, designed to provide incentives for assisted families to increase their employment. It also required HUD to establish a formal PHA management assessment system, including mechanisms for intervening in cases of troubled housing authorities, and it established a new source of safety and security funding, the Drug Elimination Grant program. Shortly thereafter, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 created the Revitalization of Severely Distressed Public Housing program\u2014commonly referred to as HOPE VI\u2014which authorized HUD to make competitive grants to PHAs to undertake major redevelopment of distressed public housing.", "In 1995, the Clinton Administration proposed the \"Reinvention Blueprint,\" which called for most public housing developments to be converted to vouchers. At the same time, some Members of Congress were calling for the abolition of HUD. While the Blueprint was not fully undertaken and HUD was not abolished, reform proposals, many of which were included in the Blueprint, were considered throughout the 1990s. ", "These efforts culminated with the passage of a major reform bill in 1998, the Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1998 (QHWRA; P.L. 105-276 ). QHWRA included provisions designed to promote local control, including the elimination of federal preferences. It established a requirement that PHAs develop annual and five-year plans detailing how they were using their local discretion. It gave PHAs the authority to convert their public housing properties to vouchers, and in some cases, required that conversion if it proved cost effective. Influenced by the welfare reform debates of the mid-1990s that were focused on promoting work, QHWRA established a requirement that non-elderly, non-disabled residents be working or participating in community service or self-sufficiency activities for eight hours per month and created a disregard of newly earned income for some families. The act included authority for PHAs to leverage their public housing properties and funding in order to secure private resources (loans) for redevelopment. It also required HUD to develop a new formula for distributing operating funding to PHAs. Importantly, the act prohibited PHAs from using any federal capital or operating funding to develop net new public housing units. While Congress had not provided funding for the development of new public housing units since FY1994, this provision of QHWRA effectively prohibited any net new development, even if funds were available.", "More than a decade after enactment of QHWRA, the number of public housing units nationally has declined steadily, as more units are torn down than are rebuilt (see Figure 1 ). The HOPE VI program, which had become at least partly responsible for declines in the number of units, has had its funding reduced substantially, in part in reaction to concerns about slow spending, and in part in reaction to concerns about displaced residents. With the exception of an infusion of funding from the economic stimulus legislation in 2009, capital funding has remained relatively level, despite a backlog in unmet capital needs. While PHAs have begun leveraging their public funds to raise private capital, the potential for leveraging sufficient funds to meet the full backlog of needs is limited. Given the reality of declining units, questions remain about the future of the public housing stock and the program's role in the future of federal housing assistance.

At the outset of a PHA's designation as troubled, it must develop a plan for its improvement with HUD. In addition to helping agencies develop these plans, HUD has a number of options for aiding troubled agencies. HUD can appoint a recovery team to help develop remedies, provide technical assistance and training, impose financial sanctions, or develop flexible arrangements with agencies tailored to their specific conditions.

In 1996, Congress enacted a requirement that any property with more than 300 units and a vacancy rate of over 10% be assessed to determine its viability. This was referred to as the Section 202 mandatory conversion requirement. If the assessment determined that it would cost more to rehabilitate the property than to provide residents with vouchers, then the property was to be removed from the public housing inventory in five years. The Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Act of 1998 (QHWRA; P.L. 105-276 ) rewrote and reinforced the mandatory conversion requirement (renaming it \"required conversion\") and added a voluntary conversion policy. Specifically, under QHWRA PHAs are required to assess for conversion all of their developments with 250 or more units and low occupancy. Covered developments must be converted to vouchers if the cost of modernizing them and operating them as public housing exceeds the cost of providing tenant-based vouchers. PHAs may choose to voluntarily convert developments in cases where it would (1) be beneficial to the residents, (2) be beneficial to the surrounding area, and (3) not have an adverse effect on the availability of affordable housing in the area. Voluntary conversions must also be cost-effective.

This same assessment may be used by PHAs to determine whether or not to pursue voluntary conversion, although additional factors (the impact on residents, the surrounding community, and affordable housing) must be taken into account.", "As of 2009, over 180,000 units of public housing had been removed through demolition or disposition and over 16,000 units had been removed through conversion.

Comparing the median income of all households living in public housing to the two-person poverty guidelines for 2010 ($14,570), the median income of families living in public housing was only about two-thirds of the poverty guideline. Comparing the median income of non-elderly, non-disabled families with children to the three-person poverty guidelines ($18,310), median family income for these households was less than half of the poverty guideline in 2010.

Most households headed by persons with disabilities reported receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and/or other Social Security or pension income. Non-elderly, non-disabled (NEND) families with children reported receiving income from a variety of sources. Over half reported income from work, 45% reported some income from welfare (defined as payments from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program or state General Assistance (GA) programs), and over one-fifth reported some income from child support payments. About 5% of all households reported receiving no income from any source.", "Over the past several decades, social assistance programs have increasingly focused on promoting work and work activities among recipients of benefits, particularly non-elderly and non-disabled families. The community service and economic self-sufficiency requirement in public housing is an example of such a policy. Given the policy interest in increasing work effort among non-elderly, non-disabled families, Table 6 is provided to offer a closer look at the sources of income for these families. Among non-elderly, non-disabled families, just over half received income from work. The majority of working families were not receiving welfare income (defined as TANF or GA) in 2010. Dividing this population into those with and without children, in both cases the plurality of families received income from work and not welfare, although families without children were receiving income from work at a higher rate than families with children. Twenty-six percent of not-elderly, not-disabled households received income from welfare but not from work; among those families, those with children were more likely to receive income from welfare and not work. Given the work requirements in the federal TANF program, it is likely that most of those families receiving income from welfare are or will be subject to work requirements as a condition of receiving assistance. Just over a quarter of NEND families with children, and just under a fifth of NEND families without children, report receiving no income or receiving income only from non-work and non-welfare sources. These families are the most likely to be subject to the community service requirement in public housing, assuming they are not otherwise exempt.", "As noted earlier in this report, families living in public housing pay income-based rents. Because the incomes of families living in public housing are quite low, the rents paid by those families are also quite low. As shown in Table 7 , looking at all households, the median rent paid by tenants in 2010 was $224 per month. Non-elderly, non-disabled families with children paid the lowest rent (under $200), which is not surprising, given that they tend to have the lowest incomes. ", "In order to provide a sense of the financial benefits to families of living in public housing, Table 7 also compares the difference between what tenants pay in rent each month and the fair market rent (FMR) in their local communities. In 2010, the median difference was $563 per month for all households. Not-elderly, not-disabled families with children had the greatest difference between the rents they pay to live in public housing and the local FMR, a benefit of nearly $700 per month, or over $8,300 per year.

Once a family is leasing a public housing unit, the family can continue to renew that lease until it is no longer eligible, either because the family's income increases too much to maintain eligibility or because the family violates program rules in some way. The data presented in Figure 5 provide a snapshot of the length of tenure of families living in public housing in December 2010. The bars provide a distribution of households by the number of years they have lived in public housing and household type, and the box in the center of the graph presents median and mean length of stay by household type. More than half of all families living in public housing in 2010 had lived there for five years or less. The greatest share of households living in public housing had been in public housing for between one and two years; the next greatest share had been living in public housing for less than one year, although almost the same number had been living in public housing for more than 20 years. While families with children make up the greatest share of those families that have been living in public housing for less than one year, elderly-headed families make up the greatest share of those families that have been living in public housing for more than 20 years.

Under the formula, the calculation for determining a PHA's operating subsidy eligibility uses two components: expenses (meant to represent the cost of running public housing) and income (meant to represent the amount collected in tenant rents). HUD subtracts a PHA's income from its expenses, and the amount by which the income is short of the expenses is the PHA's operating subsidy eligibility.", "For a number of years, the amount of appropriations provided by Congress was not sufficient to fund 100% of PHAs' formula eligibility; therefore, amounts provided to PHAs had to be prorated to fit within the amount of appropriations available. From 2005 to 2009, proration levels ranged from about 83% to about 89%. In 2010, the operating fund proration level was over 100%.

According to data from HUD, in 2009, an estimated 61% of PHAs' revenues nationally came from federal operating funds, 34% came from tenant rents, and 5% came from other sources (e.g., investment income, fee income). HUD also provided estimates of how PHAs used their funds: 22% of PHA operating expenditures nationally covered the cost of utilities, 30% went toward administrative expenses, 31% went toward maintenance costs, 11% went toward general expenses, and 3% each went toward tenant services and protective services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Housing Drug Elimination Grants", "paragraphs": ["The Public Housing Drug Elimination Grant program (PHDEP) was funded between FY1991-FY2001.

The 1998 study found that, nationally, public housing properties were accumulating roughly $2 billion in capital needs each year, and that there was a backlog of $18 billion-$20 billion in unmet needs. Since that study was done, many public housing units have been demolished or redeveloped; at the same time, capital fund appropriation levels have only hovered around the annual accrual needs level (see Table 8 for recent funding levels). In the FY2008 appropriations act, Congress directed HUD to conduct a new Capital Needs Assessment in order to obtain a more current estimate of the capital needs of public housing. HUD released the results of the new study in mid-2011. It found that the backlog of capital needs in public housing now stands at about $20.7 billion and that annual needs are accruing at a rate of over $3.4 billion per year.

The Obama Administration has proposed replacing the HOPE VI program with a new initiative, referred to as the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CNI), which would expand the concept of HOPE VI beyond public housing to other distressed neighborhoods and increase requirements related to tenant relocation.

Bush Administration (and later, by the Obama Administration). Beginning with FY2007, funding began to rise again; apart from the $4 billion in stimulus capital funding provided in FY2009 by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ), FY2010 total funding for public housing was at the highest level since the modern funding system for the program was adopted.

The majority of the public housing stock is several decades old and much of the stock has not had the level of ongoing maintenance and major rehabilitation needed to keep it viable and habitable. Complicating matters, in some cases, is that properties were not built in such a way as to promote long-term viability (in some cases due to the use of poor quality materials or poor design, perhaps resulting from low per unit cost caps). The declining physical state of the public housing stock may be due in part to federal funding levels that, paired with federal rent collection rules, left PHAs with inadequate budgets to meet their properties' capital needs. In some cases, it may also be due to poor management decisions at the local level. Regardless of the cause, there is an acknowledged backlog of unmet capital needs in public housing that current federal funding levels, unless they increase substantially, are unlikely to address (notwithstanding the one-time increase in funding provided in the economic stimulus legislation in FY2009). As properties fall into disrepair, they are more likely to be candidates for removal from the public housing stock through demolition, disposition, or conversion.", "The HOPE VI program was designed, in part, to address the unmet capital needs of those properties that are in the worst condition. As HOPE VI grants became smaller, leveraging expectations increased and PHAs began using their HOPE VI grant funding to secure additional private financing. Today, many PHAs have become adept at leveraging private resources, even without HOPE VI grants, by pledging other federal funding, primarily their capital funding. However, there are limits to the extent that PHAs can access these private mixed-finance markets. In order to prevent PHAs from becoming over-leveraged, HUD limits the share of future capital funding PHAs can pledge toward repaying debt. PHAs are further limited in that they are not currently permitted to pledge their future operating fund dollars to repay debt, nor are they permitted to pledge the underlying property itself as security to leverage private funding. Additionally, PHAs seeking funding in the private market are dependent on the willingness of lenders to provide them with capital on terms that are agreeable. ", "If there is a policy desire to preserve the existing public housing stock, additional funding would likely be needed. This could come in the form of increased federal appropriations. The economic stimulus legislation in the 111 th Congress provided one of the largest infusions of capital funding for public housing in recent years. At nearly $4 billion dollars, it should have been sufficient to address around 20% of the estimated backlog in capital needs ($18 billion-$20 billion). These funds were designated as emergency supplemental funding, meant to stimulate the economy during the recession, and were therefore provided outside of the budget constraints of the regular annual appropriations process; it is unclear if similar future infusions will be forthcoming. In light of tight budget constraints and political questions about the popularity of the public housing program, future large infusions of federal funding are uncertain. ", "Federal rent policies could be changed to allow PHAs to collect higher payments from tenants. However, such a change would violate current standards of affordability and it is unclear, given the extremely low incomes of residents, if they could pay additional rent sufficient to meet unmet capital needs. Other options include making changes to existing policies to allow PHAs to better access private capital markets. These options could include permitting PHAs to leverage their operating fund dollars, permitting PHAs to mortgage the underlying value of their public housing properties, and/or creating instruments, such as mortgage insurance programs through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), to encourage or provide incentives to lenders to make loans to PHAs on favorable terms. ", "Some steps have been taken to increase the ability of PHAs to leverage private capital. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) is an Obama Administration initiative designed to test changes to the way that public housing is funded to permit PHAs to access private capital, in part by removing the limitations on mortgaging public housing properties. In the FY2012 HUD appropriations law ( P.L. 112-55 ), Congress authorized a version of RAD, which makes up to 60,000 units of public housing eligible to convert to project-based Section 8 contracts.

The public housing program began as a construction program designed to help stimulate the economy coming out of the Great Depression. Its role evolved over time: first, to meet housing shortages during and after World War II; later, to address shortages of decent housing in conjunction with Urban Renewal efforts; and finally, to address shortages of decent housing that was affordable to the poorest families. In this last role, as a provider of affordable housing to poor families, the program has declined in prominence as other models of providing direct housing assistance to the poor have been developed. First, there were programs promoting the construction of properties owned by private market participants (through FHA insurance programs and later Section 8 rental assistance contracts), and later there were programs subsidizing families' housing costs in the existing housing stock (through the Section 8 voucher program). This last model, the Section 8 voucher program, is the only direct rental assistance program serving poor families that has grown to serve more families in the last several decades. At least part of that growth is attributable to declines in the number of public housing units, as families being displaced from public housing have received vouchers. These other models were developed in direct response to perceived shortcomings\u2014lack of mobility, cost effectiveness, and efficiency\u2014in the public housing program.", "With policies like mandatory and voluntary conversion of public housing to vouchers, the question may be raised as to whether the \"vouchering-out\" of public housing is an inevitability, or if public housing itself is valuable enough to warrant taking steps to preserve it. Critics of public housing point to its often poor locations and conditions and argue that it traps the most vulnerable families in the worst housing conditions. They point to high rates of crime at some developments and low levels of social capital development and work effort, contending that public housing denies poor families choice and the option to live in communities of opportunity. Moreover, it is argued that the rent structure does little to promote self-sufficiency and may even discourage it. Advocates for public housing argue that the most vulnerable families are the least likely to have their needs met by the private market, even with a Section 8 rental voucher. Landlords are not required to accept vouchers and are permitted to screen families for suitability. PHAs, on the other hand, have a social mission to serve the poorest families. Further, advocates contend that high-quality public housing, particularly when it is enriched with services, can itself provide opportunities for families. They point to successful HOPE VI mixed-income communities and research on how place-based interventions can promote family success, particularly for persons who are elderly, but also for families with children. ", "In addition to the policy arguments for and against preserving public housing, the issue of cost is relevant. In recent years, the average annual \"cost\" to the federal government of providing a voucher to a family has been greater than the per unit funding provided to public housing. This could serve to bolster arguments in favor of retaining public housing as a more cost-effective way of providing rental assistance to low-income families. However, the low cost of public housing reflects what most agree is an underfunding of public housing. If public housing was funded at its full funding needs\u2014particularly in light of the backlog of capital needs\u2014the cost to the federal government of public housing would likely be much higher, and potentially higher than the cost of vouchers. However, in order to fully evaluate the costs and benefits of public housing one may wish to consider the underlying value of the public housing properties themselves, which were built with federal assistance and maintained with federal funds. Questions about to whom that value belongs may also be considered when evaluating the costs and benefits of the program in light of potential changes. These questions about underlying value, which are beyond the scope of this report, may be difficult to answer and different observers may come to different conclusions."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
