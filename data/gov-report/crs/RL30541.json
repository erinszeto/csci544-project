FY2000 allocated funding for Colombia,from appropriations made in 1999, already totalssome $164.0 million. At the same time, the Administration requested $318 million for FY2001 assistance toColombia and other regional efforts, in addition tothe $150 million that it previously indicated it had planned to allocate to Colombia in FY2001.", "The Clinton Administration's \"Plan Colombia\" program, as it became known, was intended to substantially increase the assistance provided to Colombia. Theproposal's centerpiece was funding for the \"Push into Southern Colombia\" program, which would include trainingand equipping two new army CN battalions,and providing funding to purchase new and sustain existing Blackhawk and Huey helicopters to transport them.Other assistance was included for interdiction,resettlement of displaced persons, economic development, and programs to improve Colombian National Police(CNP) eradication capabilities and to supporthuman rights monitors, improve the justice system and strengthen the rule of law.", "The 106th Congress commenced action on the request on March 9, 2000, when the House Appropriations Committee approved an emergency supplementalappropriations bill ( H.R. 3908 , H.Rept. 106-521 ) that included some $1.4 billion in funding for FY2000 andFY2001 counternarcotics efforts inColombia, its neighbors, and other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. On March 30, the House approvedthat amount, placing conditions on the militaryassistance. On May 9, the Senate Appropriations Committee included $1.1 billion in FY2000 emergencysupplemental Plan Colombia funding in its FY2001Military Construction ( S. 2521 ) and Foreign Operations ( S. 2522 ) bills, placing extensive conditionson the assistance in both bills. These three measures were dealt with in the conference on the military construction appropriations bill ( H.R. 4425 , H.Rept. 106-710 ) with some $1.3billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for Plan Colombia. As approved and signed into law ( P.L.106-246 ) on July 13, the bill included five humanrights and two other conditions on aid to Colombia. Certification that these conditions had been met was required before the obligation of FY2000 and FY2001funds, but the President could waive them on national security grounds. President Clinton waived six of the sevencertification criteria on August 22, 2000, andhe determined a second certification was not required on January 19, 2001, but submitted a report on progressregarding certification criteria.", "On April 9, 2001, the Bush Administration requested $731 million in FY2002 funding for a broader regional strategy called the Andean Counterdrug Initiativethat would include funding from the International Narcotics Control account (INC) for not only Colombia, but alsoBolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, andVenezuela.

The United States hasprovided equipment, supplies, and other aid for the counternarcotics efforts, initially largely to the ColombianNational Police (CNP), but recently increasingly tothe Colombian military. As of FY2000, more is being provided to the military. Most of the funding has supportedthe tracking, interdiction and arrest oftraffickers, the destruction of laboratories, and eradication efforts. Of pre-Plan Colombia assistance, a small amountsupported reforms to the judicial system, andalternative development. This amount was increased greatly in the Plan Colombia legislation.", "The State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) has been the primary agency in counternarcotics efforts. INL runs the airwing which supplies aircraft for the narcotics crop eradication program in South America, in which Colombia isa major participant. INL also coordinates theactivities of other civilian agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Agency forInternational Development, and the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI), providing them with funds from the State Department's International Narcotics Control (INC)account. These agencies have worked withColombia's judicial system to improve law enforcement capabilities, criminal justice procedures, and theaccessibility and fairness of the justice system. Theyalso have assisted Colombia's eradication and interdiction efforts.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) also has been a major source of funding and support for Colombian counternarcotics efforts, mainly through programs whichare not considered \"traditional foreign aid\" programs. (1) Under defense legislation, DOD provides support for efforts to detect and monitor illicit narcoticsoperations, principally the maintenance of five radar sites in Colombia. DOD also conducts surveillance overflightsfrom locations outside Colombia. During1999, DOD helped establish, train and equip the first special Colombian Army counternarcotics battalion (CACB)of some 950 troops, which commencedoperations towards the end of that year. (2) Thebattalion was set up to conduct its own CN missions, as well as to provide security for the police counternarcoticsforces in their operations. DOD also sponsors a riverine CN program, training personnel of the Colombian Navyand Marines to control narcotics traffickingalong Colombia's extensive network of rivers. (3) Thenumbers of U.S. uniformed military personnel assisting in these efforts has varied in the low hundreds. ", "The U.S. military and other agencies also have provided other support to the Colombian military and police. Through Section 506 (a) of the Foreign AssistanceAct of 1961, as amended, DOD and other agencies (see Tables 1 and 6 ) have provided substantialamounts of equipment to the Colombian military and police. (4) In addition, the United States has funded the construction of the Joint Intelligence Center (JIC) at TresEsquinas in southwest Colombia to strengthen police andmilitary intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities, and to encourage them to share intelligence.", "Many of the critics of military assistance have argued that although the aid is provided for counternarcotics purposes, it can be used to further counterinsurgencyefforts. News reports in the summer of 1998 alleged that the United States had provided covert assistance to theColombian military for counternarcotics andcounterinsurgency operations, including the participation of active duty military personnel and private contractors. (5) At the same time, the press reported thepresence of U.S. special operations forces who were training with Colombian military units under the JointCombined Exchange Training program (U.S.C. Title10, Section 2011), (6) which some interpreted asproviding de facto counterinsurgency aid. ", "Although the Clinton Administration denied that the United States was providing counterinsurgency assistance, analysts acknowledged that some types of U.S.counternarcotics training provide lessons that can also be applied to counterinsurgency operations. The ClintonAdministration had also held that assistanceprovided to police and military forces in operations targeted at guerrilla drug production or protection activities fitwithin the definition of counternarcotics aid. InMarch 1999, however, the Clinton Administration expanded the conditions under which it provided intelligenceto Colombian security forces, routinely providinga Colombian police-military Joint Task Force with intelligence information related to the guerrillas. Although theUnited States provided the information to assistwith counternarcotics operations, the General Accounting Office reported that the U.S. Embassy in Colombia didnot have a system to ensure that the informationwas used only for counternarcotics purposes.
