Among those states, 19 permit voters without ID to cast a ballot through alternative means, such as signing an affidavit; 13 strictly enforce the ID requirement. The other 18 states and the District of Columbia have a range of nondocument requirements instead.", "Over the last two decades, the number of states requiring voter IDs has tripled. The stringency of those requirements is controversial. States vary substantially in the range of IDs accepted, the information they must contain, and the ease with which a voter can procure an ID. Although all states requiring voter ID accept a local driver's license, no two states have the same overall requirements. Among states with voter ID laws, 18 require photographic identification (photo ID), while 14 permit a nonphoto ID. In addition, eight states require ID for voters casting absentee or mail-in ballots.", "Several states enacted voter ID laws that have been struck down by courts or are not yet in effect. Recent congresses have seen a number of bills with voter ID provisions, including H.R. 885, H.R. 2867, H.R. 3277, H.R. 3364, H.R. 5557, S. 1659, and S. 1912 in the 114th Congress. State legislatures also continue to consider the issue.", "Supporters of the more stringent requirements often emphasize the need to prevent voter fraud, while opponents emphasize the need to avoid disenfranchising legitimate voters who do not have ready access to an accepted ID. Polling data suggest that most voters and most local election officials support a voter ID requirement but that many are also concerned about the risk of disenfranchisement. Both voter fraud and disenfranchisement pose potential risks to the integrity of the electoral process, but the policy debate is being conducted in the absence of a consensus about the evidence pertaining to those risks, with available studies producing a broad range of results.", "As with the 2014 election, leading up to the November 8, 2016, presidential election, state voter photo ID laws have been challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA), and state constitutional provisions. Such challenges have drawn attention in view of a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment of a voter photo ID law, and because some suits have been brought under Section 2 of the VRA, which in the past, has generally been invoked in the context of redistricting. As the case law challenging voter photo ID laws under Section 2 of the VRA is just beginning to develop, it ultimately may be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.", "Election administration is complex, and changes in voter ID requirements may affect elections in unanticipated ways, such as a need for more provisional ballots, increased waiting times at polling places, and misapplication of the rules by pollworkers. The longer that election officials have to implement changes to voting procedures, the lower the risk of unintended and potentially harmful consequences may be.", "The impact of state voter ID laws is likely to continue to be a topic of high interest beyond November 2016. It seems likely that state legislators will continue to consider such legislation in the future. The 2016 election may provide useful data on the implementation and performance of voter ID laws, which Congress may choose to examine, and which may lead to greater consensus about the benefits and disadvantages of voter identification requirements."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction and Overview", "paragraphs": ["More than half the states require a voter to provide a specified identification document (ID) to cast a ballot at the polling place, and a few extend the requirement to absentee or mail-in voting.

Requirements for voters to present an ID have reportedly been in force in some states since at least the 1950s. By the year 2000, about a dozen states had voter ID requirements. After the 2000 election, numerous studies and reports assessed the nation's voting process, or aspects of it, and made policy recommendations. Perhaps the best known study was issued in August 2001 by the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, often referred to as the \"Carter-Ford Commission.\" The study was sponsored by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia and The Century Foundation, and it was co-chaired by former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter. The report noted that states should work to improve \"verification of voter identification at the polling place\" and recommended that they", "require those who are registering to vote and those who are casting their ballot to provide some form of official identification, such as a photo ID issued by a government agency (e.g., a driver's license). A photo ID is already required in many other transactions, such as check-cashing and using airline tickets. These Commissioners point out that those who register and vote should expect to identify themselves. If they do not have photo identification then they should be issued such cards from the government or have available alternative forms of official ID. They believe this burden is reasonable, that voters will understand it, and that most democratic nations recognize this act as a valid means of protecting the sanctity of the franchise. ", "Many of the report's recommendations were incorporated in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA, P.L. 107-252 ) which was enacted in October 2002. Title III of HAVA includes requirements for states on voting systems, voter information, provisional voting, and voter registration. Since 2006, states have been required to maintain a single, computerized list of all registered voters that every election official in the state can access. ", "Title III also includes a limited voter identification requirement. An individual who registers to vote by mail and has not previously voted in a federal election in the jurisdiction must provide a current, valid photo ID or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document with the voter's name and address, whether voting in person or by mail. The requirement does not apply to a voter who registers under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA, P.L. 103-31 , also known as the \"motor-voter\" law), and submits with the registration application one of the required identifications, or who provides a driver's license number or the last four digits of the voter's Social Security number that matches an existing state record with the same number, name, and date of birth as provided in the registration. A voter who does not provide required documentation may submit a provisional ballot that is counted in accordance with state law if the appropriate election official determines that the voter is eligible.", "Another provision in HAVA made clear that states are free to adopt more stringent election administration requirements than those imposed by the act:", "The requirements established by this title are minimum requirements and nothing in this title shall be construed to prevent a State from establishing election technology and administration requirements that are more strict than the requirements established under this title so long as such State requirements are not inconsistent with the Federal requirements under this title or any law described in section 906.", "Following passage of HAVA, states enacted laws to implement the act's identification requirement, and in some cases, more stringent requirements, leading to a doubling over the next few years in the number of states with voter ID requirements. ", "After the 2004 election, another study was issued in September 2005 by the Commission on Federal Election Reform. Often referred to as the \"Carter-Baker Commission,\" it was organized by the Center for Democracy and Election Management at American University and co-chaired by former President Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker, III. Its report repeated the recommendation of the Carter-Ford Commission for states to adopt an ID requirement for voters. Further, it recommended that states require a photo ID that meets requirements specified in Title II of the REAL ID Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-13 ), and that states provide IDs with no charge to voters without them. However, some members of the commission considered that recommendation \"troublesome,\" for reasons similar to the concerns of some observers about stringent photo ID requirements discussed in the section on \" Implementation Issues and Policy Considerations .\"", "Some attempts have been made to enact federal photo ID requirements. A notable bill from the 109 th Congress, H.R. 4844 , passed the House of Representatives in September 2006. It would have required photo ID and proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. It would also have required that voters who cast a provisional ballot because they did not have the required ID present an approved ID within 48 hours for the ballot to be counted. The bill included an exception for military and overseas voters. It would have required states to provide photo IDs to qualified voters who did not have them, and to provide them to indigent voters at no cost. It would have authorized appropriations to cover the costs of providing such IDs to indigent voters. The bill was not taken up by the Senate before the 109 th Congress adjourned, but several states have adopted similar requirements (see Table A-1 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Opinion on Voter ID Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Much of the public discussion about voter ID focuses on how to balance the goals of preventing voter fraud and protecting voter rights (see \" Impacts on Turnout and Voter Fraud \"). Public opinion surveys over the past decade have consistently found significant majority support for requiring a photo ID to vote. The wording of the questions has varied, with some surveys providing more context about the issues than others. Although all of the surveys described broad categories of ID, several specified that they be \"valid,\" \"official,\" or \"government\" documents. Some points from the surveys relevant to this report are summarized below:", "According to one study that compared results from 19 polls between 2006 and 2014, overall support for voter ID has decreased somewhat, from more than 80% in 2006 to about 75% in 2014. In a 2012 survey by the Pew Research Center, respondents were asked if they possessed the needed identification, and 98% said they did. Other studies, however, have found a broader range, from 80% to 95%. A Washington Post poll from 2012 asked whether voter fraud was a problem in presidential elections. About half of respondents said they believed it to be a major problem, one-third considered it a minor problem, and about one in six said it was not a problem. The same poll asked whether voter suppression\u2014described as eligible voters taken off registration lists or denied the right to vote\u2014was a problem in presidential elections. About 40% of respondents believed it to be a major problem, one-third believed it a minor problem, and 20% believed it not to be a problem. One question from that poll joined those two concepts by asking which was more of a concern to the respondent, the potential for vote fraud or the potential that eligible voters could be denied the right to vote. The response was about evenly split, with a few percent more stating they thought vote fraud was more of a concern. ", "It is not clear to what extent respondents in any of the polls were aware of evidence on the degree to which voter fraud occurs; nor is it possible to know how such information would have affected their opinions. ", "No information was found in the surveys about how voters respond to the different specific kinds of photo ID that different states permit (e.g., a driver's license, an employee ID card, a passport). These and similar policy concerns remain factors in the ongoing debate about whether obtaining required ID presents an undue hardship for some who wish to vote, or whether voter IDs are essential, despite any such hardships, to prevent voter fraud (see \" Implementation Issues and Policy Considerations \")."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Voter ID Legislation in the 114th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Several bills introduced in the 114 th Congress contain provisions pertaining to voter ID.

It would amend Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) relating to the requirement for federal courts to block procedures that deny or abridge voting rights. It would expand the kinds of violations that would trigger such actions by the courts, but it would exclude voter photo ID requirements from the list of violations under the section. H.R. 2867 and S. 1659 would restrict the use of voter ID. It would amend the VRA to require preclearance under Section 4 of state changes to voter ID requirements that would make them more stringent than either those required of first-time voters under HAVA or, for voter registration, those in effect in the state at the time of enactment of the bill. H.R. 3277 would eliminate voter ID requirements. It would amend HAVA to prohibit election officials from requiring photo ID for registering to vote or for voting.

The bill would require states to make preprinted statements available to absentee voters and at the polls, and it would prohibit a state from requiring a voter who presents the form to be required to vote a provisional ballot. Similar proposals for first-time voters were debated in Congress when HAVA was being considered. Several states that do not require voter ID currently require an affidavit or signature by a voter before the voter can cast a ballot. H.R. 5557 would restrict voter ID requirements.

McCrory , the court held that the 2013 law was enacted with a racially discriminatory intent in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 2 of the VRA. Reversing and remanding a lower court ruling, the court enjoined implementation of the law. On August 31, by a 4-4 vote with regard to the voter photo ID provision, the U.S. Supreme Court denied North Carolina's request for a stay of the appellate court ruling. As a result, the law will not be in effect for the November 8 election.", "As a threshold matter, the Fourth Circuit observed that, similar to laws that expressly discriminate on the basis of race, if a law is discriminatorily motivated, it is unconstitutional. In determining whether discriminatory intent motivates a facially neutral law, the court interpreted Supreme Court precedent as requiring consideration of several factors, including first, the historical background in a case. Here, the appellate court determined that the lower court clearly erred in finding minimal evidence of official discrimination in North Carolina since the 1980s, and instead identified evidence of attempts by the legislature \"to suppress and dilute\" African American voting rights. Second, a court is required to consider the sequence of events leading to the challenge. According to the court, the record of the case showed that immediately after a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that rendered the preclearance requirements of the VRA inoperable, the North Carolina legislature substantially expanded an earlier photo ID bill and \"rushed through ... the most restrictive voting legislation seen in North Carolina since enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\" The court held that the lower court erred by not drawing \"the obvious inference\" of discriminatory intent from this sequence of events. Third, Supreme Court precedent recognizes the relevance of legislative history. In this case, the court determined it relevant that the legislature requested and utilized racial data, including a breakdown by race of DMV-issued ID ownership, absentee and early voting, and same-day registration, which showed that African Americans disproportionately use such procedures. When compared to the \"unpersuasive non-racial explanations the State proffered for the specific choices it made,\" the court considered this element of the legislative history probative. Last, a court is instructed to consider whether the law impacts one race more than another. The court found error in the lower court's conclusion that the voting procedures eliminated by the law were simply \"more convenient,\" and \"preferred\" by African Americans. African-American voters disproportionately use the voting procedures eliminated or reduced by the challenged law as a result of socioeconomic disparities, the court held, and such use is not borne from a simple \"preference.\" The court concluded: \"Registration and voting tools may be a simple 'preference' for many white North Carolinians, but for many African Americans, they are a necessity.\"", "The court was also careful to note that its holding was not meant to suggest that any member of the North Carolina legislature \"harbored racial hatred or animosity toward any minority group.\" The court concluded that the totality of the circumstances evidenced that the law was enacted to \"entrench\" the majority party's control of the legislature, and even if enacted for such \"partisan ends,\" the court held, \"targeting voters who, based on race, were unlikely to vote for the majority party ... constituted racial discrimination.\" Finally, the court held that the challenged provisions of the North Carolina law, including the voter photo ID requirement, were not tailored to achieve the stated justifications, and in several ways, were \"solutions in search of a problem.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Texas", "paragraphs": ["Also in July 2016, issuing a plurality opinion, a divided en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit) ruled that a Texas voter photo ID law must be administered in such a manner to rectify a discriminatory effect on voters who do not have the required ID or are unable to obtain such ID reasonably. Affirming a lower court, in Veasey v. Abbott , the plurality found that the law has a discriminatory effect on minorities' voting rights and therefore violates Section 2 of the VRA. While the court did not invalidate the law, it remanded for consideration by the district court of an appropriate remedy. The court also held that the indirect cost on voters who were not born in Texas to obtain an ID was not the equivalent of a poll tax. On the issue of whether the law was enacted with a discriminatory intent , however, in contrast to the Fourth Circuit ruling discussed above, the court reversed the lower court's judgment and remanded for the district court to consider in light of guidance that the appellate court provided. In August, the district court entered an order approving a plan that, among other things, for the November 8 election, allows certain Texas voters without the required voter photo ID, and who cannot obtain such ID due to a reasonable impediment, to cast a ballot after completing a \"reasonable impediment declaration.\" Furthermore, in September, the district court ordered the State of Texas to insure that voter education materials accurately reflect the court's August order setting forth how the voter photo ID law is to be administered for the November 8 election. ", "In Veasey , regarding the finding that the voter photo ID law has a discriminatory effect in violation of Section 2 of the VRA, the plurality opinion invoked Supreme Court precedent. As required under such precedent, the opinion determined that the challengers showed not only that the law imposes a burden on minorities, but also that it interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities of minority voters to elect preferred representatives. The opinion approved of the lower court's analysis and resulting determination that (1) the law burdens Texans living in poverty, who are less likely to have, or to be able to procure, the requisite ID; (2) a disproportionate number of Texans living in poverty are African Americans and Hispanics; and (3) such minority voters are more likely to be living in poverty because they bear the socioeconomic effects of historical racial discrimination. Further, the opinion determined that the district court thoroughly evaluated the totality of the circumstances, with each finding well supported, and that the State of Texas had failed to contest many of the factual findings.", "On September 23, the State of Texas filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing for a reversal of the Fifth Circuit's holding that the law has a discriminatory effect.

In 8 others (Alabama, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin), the November 2016 election will mark the first time the current requirements will be in effect in a presidential election. In addition, lawsuits that could affect voter ID requirements for that election have been filed in some states.", "The administration of federal elections by state and local jurisdictions is a complex, interconnected process, in which changes to any part may have both expected and unexpected effects, not only on what those changes affect directly, but on other parts of the process, and on individual voters, as well. Implementing such changes may reduce the resources available for other tasks before the election, or may have unforeseen effects that would require correction. It may therefore be advantageous for policymakers to provide as much time as possible for implementation, so that election officials, pollworkers, and voters have time to adjust.", "Some changes, such as moving the location of an individual polling place, affect a limited number of voters. Others, such as changing voting systems or identification procedures, may affect all the voters in the state. Election officials may be required to educate the voting public about the changes and make the necessary adjustments to pollworker training and procedures before the election to ensure a smooth implementation on Election Day. Voters need to understand the changes and may need to undertake actions, such as obtaining an ID, to insure that they do not jeopardize their ability to cast a ballot.", "Other issues that could arise because of new photo ID laws include the potential for long lines and the possibility that pollworkers could misapply the rules. Long lines may develop in high-turnout elections, such as presidential ones, if new check-in procedures require each voter to present an ID. Voters who are unaware of such new requirements and those who do not have an acceptable ID may cause delays and complications if they need to execute affidavit votes or cast provisional ballots. ", "Finally, there is the possibility that some pollworkers will not be sufficiently trained to know which IDs are acceptable (particularly in states that accept a range of federal, state, and other IDs), which voters, if any, are exempt from the requirement, the procedures to be followed if a voter lacks the proper ID, and how to interpret an ID photograph, especially if the voter has changed in appearance in some way, such as hair color or facial hair. Pollworker training is one of several kinds of costs that state and local governments may incur in implementing voter ID requirements. ", "Such considerations suggest that implementation of new or newly modified voter ID requirements could increase the risk of polling-place problems, but that such risks can be mitigated through administrative preparation, training of pollworkers, and timely education of voters. According to survey data, most local election officials believe that pollworker training and voter education can be important factors in preventing problems at the polling place, and many have said there is a need for improvement. While no systematic studies were available for this report on the effects of changes in election procedures, examples can be found where problems are attributed to such changes.

Voter ID laws would appear to be best suited to preventing voter impersonation rather than illicit registration. Some observers might argue, however, that voter ID requirements can serve as an additional line of defense against illicit or erroneous voter registration. ", "On the other hand, it may also be reasonable to suppose that the more focus is placed on preventing fraud and abuse, the greater the risk that people who do meet the fundamental criteria for eligibility will be improperly excluded from the voter rolls, or not succeed in voting despite being on the rolls. Such concerns have been raised especially for specific demographic groups such as elderly, poor, and minority voters. Some observers have proposed solutions that might reduce the risk of such a conflict, for example, by placing digital photographs of registered voters in electronic pollbooks, thereby eliminating the need for most voters to present separate identification documents.", "It could be that the apparent conflict is in fact a false one\u2014for example, changes to the election process aimed at increasing access or at decreasing fraud might not have significant effects on actual access and fraud\u2014or that the impact of any particular measure that seems likely to be effective is in fact minimal. Some observers argue that examples of voter fraud at the polling place are rare. Some also claim that voter fraud is much more of a risk with absentee and mail-in voting than at the polling place. Among the 33 states with voter ID requirements, 8 apply those requirements to voters casting absentee or mail-in ballots. However, there does not appear to be sufficient information available to determine the degree to which more broadly applied ID requirements for absentee and mail-in voting would reduce the risk of fraud or how they would affect turnout.

That uncertainty is not surprising, given the complexities of the election process, the difficulties of collecting data about it that are amenable to scientific analysis, the difficulty of controlling for the effects of various factors other than voter ID requirements, the relative recency of ID requirements in several states, variation among states in the stringency of the requirements, and other factors.

For example, if the implementation of an ID requirement caused a change in turnout, either a reduction or an increase, of 2%, but the margin of victory for a contest was 5%, there would be no effect on the outcome of the election for that contest. In contrast, if the margin of victory were 1%, a 2% reduction in turnout might change the outcome.

Two scientific surveys of local election officials in 2006 and 2008 found that on average the officials supported a photo ID requirement, but they believed it would have a negative effect on turnout. They also believed it would increase election security, even though they found voter fraud uncommon and not a serious problem in their jurisdictions.", "A systematic approach to achieving the two goals discussed in this section would presumably include a risk analysis of all steps in the election process with respect to each goal.
