Motor vehicle crashes caused an estimated 36,560 fatalities in 2018; a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has shown that 94% of crashes are due to human errors. For this and other reasons, federal oversight of the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles has been of considerable interest to Congress. In the 115 th Congress, autonomous vehicle legislation passed the House as H.R. 3388 , the SELF DRIVE Act, and a separate bill, S. 1885 , the AV START Act, was reported from a Senate committee. Neither bill was enacted. In the 116 th Congress, interest in autonomous vehicles remains strong, but similar comprehensive legislative proposals have not been introduced.

The pace of autonomous vehicle commercialization may have slowed due to the 2018 death in Arizona of a pedestrian struck by an autonomous vehicle, which highlighted the challenges of duplicating human decisionmaking by artificial intelligence. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the fatality was caused by an \"inadequate safety culture\" at Uber\u00e2\u0080\u0094which was testing the vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0094and deficiencies in state and federal regulation.", "The U.S. Department of Transportation and NHTSA have issued three reports since 2016 that inform the discussion of federal autonomous vehicle policies, suggesting best practices that states should consider in driver regulation; a set of voluntary, publicly available self-assessments by automakers showing how they are building safety into their vehicles; and a proposal to modify the current system of granting exemptions from federal safety standards.

These included the following:", "The extent to which Congress should alter the traditional division of vehicle regulation, with the federal government being responsible for vehicle safety and states for driver-related aspects such as licensing and registration, as the roles of driver and vehicle merge. The number of autonomous vehicles that NHTSA should permit to be tested on highways by granting exemptions to federal safety standards, and which specific safety standards, such as those requiring steering wheels and brake pedals, can be relaxed to permit thorough testing. How much detail legislation should contain related to addressing cybersecurity threats, including whether federal standards should require vehicle technology that could report and stop hacking of critical vehicle software and how much information car buyers should be given about these issues.

No further action was taken on either bill before the 115 th Congress adjourned.", "Although some Members of Congress remain interested in autonomous vehicles, no legislative proposals have become law. Several fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles raised new questions about how federal and state governments should regulate vehicle testing and the introduction of new technologies into vehicles offered for sale. A pedestrian was killed in Arizona by an autonomous vehicle operated by Uber on March 18, 2018, and three Tesla drivers died when they failed to respond to hazards not recognized by the vehicles. These accidents suggest that the challenge of producing fully autonomous vehicles that can operate safely on public roads may be greater than developers had envisioned, a new outlook voiced by several executives, including the Ford Motor Co.

To successfully navigate roadways, an autonomous vehicle's computers, sensors and cameras will need to accomplish four tasks that a human driver undertakes automatically: detect objects in the vehicle's path; classify those objects as to their likely makeup (e.g., plastic bag in the wind, a pedestrian or a moving bicycle); predict the likely path of the object; and plan an appropriate response. Most autonomous vehicles use dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) to monitor road conditions, congestion, crashes, and possible rerouting. As 5G wireless communications infrastructure is installed more widely, DSRC may evolve and become integrated with it, enabling vehicles to offer greater interoperability, bandwidth, and cybersecurity. Some versions of these autonomous vehicle technologies, such as GPS and rear-facing cameras, are being offered on vehicles currently on the market, while manufacturers are studying how to add others to safely transport passengers without drivers.", "Manufacturers of conventional vehicles, such as General Motors and Honda, are competing in this space with autonomous vehicle \"developers\" such as Alphabet's Waymo. In addition, automakers are aligning themselves with new partners that have experience with ride-sharing and artificial intelligence:", "Ford and Volkswagen have announced that they expect to use autonomous vehicle technology in a new ride-sharing service in Pittsburgh, PA, as early as 2021; GM acquired Cruise Automation, a company that is developing self-driving technology for Level 4 and 5 vehicles. GM has also invested $500 million in the Lyft ride-sharing service; Honda, after breaking off talks about partnering with Waymo, purchased a stake in GM's Cruise Automation; Volvo and Daimler have announced partnerships with ride-sharing service Uber; and BMW partnered with the Mobileye division of Intel, a semiconductor manufacturer, to design autonomous vehicle software."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cybersecurity and Data Privacy", "paragraphs": ["As vehicle technologies advance, the security of data collected by vehicle computers and the protection of on-board systems against intrusion are becoming more prominent concerns.

The systems that allow vehicles to communicate with each other, with roadside infrastructure, and with manufacturers seeking to update software will also offer portals for possible unauthorized access to vehicle systems and the data generated by them.", "Protecting autonomous vehicles from hackers is of paramount concern to federal and state governments, manufacturers, and service providers. A well-publicized hacking of a conventional vehicle by professionals demonstrated to the public that such disruptions can occur. Hackers could use more than a dozen portals to enter even a conventional vehicle's electronic systems ( Figure 2 ), including seemingly innocuous entry points such as the airbag, the lighting system, and the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS). Requirements that increasingly automated vehicles accept remote software updates, so that owners do not need to take action each time software is revised, are in part a response to concerns that security weaknesses be rectified as quickly as possible.", "To address these concerns, motor vehicle manufacturers established the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC), which released a set of cybersecurity principles in 2016. DOT's autonomous vehicle policies designate Auto-ISAC as a central clearinghouse for manufacturers to share reports of cybersecurity incidents, threats, and violations with others in the vehicle industry.", "Aside from hackers, many legitimate entities would like to access vehicle data, including vehicle and component manufacturers, the suppliers providing the technology and sensors, the vehicle owner and occupants, urban planners, insurance companies, law enforcement, and first responders (in case of an accident).

V ehicle infrastructure . Autonomous vehicles will need new types of infrastructure support and maintenance, including advanced telecommunications links and near-perfect pavement and signage markings. Planning and implementing these highway improvements may enable autonomous vehicles to be fully functional sooner. In addition, many test vehicles are currently powered by electricity, so the availability of refueling stations could be a factor in their acceptance. Wo rkforce training. The increased reliance on autonomous vehicle technologies may require different workforce skills. Many traditional mechanical parts may disappear, especially if autonomous vehicles operate entirely on battery power, while the arrangement and function of dashboards and seating may be reinvented. Components suppliers that are already addressing this new product demand and reorienting their workforces will assist in the transition to autonomous vehicles. G overnment laws and regulations that encourage development and testing . Fully autonomous vehicles may not have standard features of today's cars, such as steering wheels and brake pedals, as there will not be a driver. By law or regulation, motor vehicles built today are required to have many of these features. Some governments are taking a lead by modifying vehicle requirements for purposes of pilot programs and tests. Permanent changes in standards will most likely be necessary if autonomous vehicle technologies are to be commercialized. L evel of consumer acceptance . Markets are more likely to embrace autonomous vehicles if many residents in cities see autonomous vehicles on the road, a high level of technology is in use (including internet access and mobile broadband), and ride-hailing services are more widely used.", "Several surveys have been conducted analyzing many of these factors. For example, a 2018 Harvard University report highlights plans in China, South Korea, Japan, and the United States to \"seize the benefits\" of autonomous vehicles. In a report on innovation policies in four Asian countries (China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore), the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ranked Singapore first in autonomous vehicle readiness because of its policies and new laws governing their deployment and its high consumer acceptance. The report also notes that South Korea's K-City facility is \"intended to be the world's largest testbed for self-driving cars.\"", "A more detailed comparison of factors affecting autonomous vehicle development and deployment has been conducted by KPMG International, which has developed an index to measure how 25 countries are guiding autonomous vehicles ( Table 2 ).", "The Netherlands ranked first overall in the KPMG report, where it was cited as \"an example of how to ready a country for AVs by performing strongly in many areas , \" as well as first in infrastructure.

Separately, DOT would have been required to study ways in which autonomous vehicles and parts could be produced domestically, with recommendations on how to incentivize U.S. manufacturing.", "The Senate staff draft would have consolidated some of the advisory committees in S. 1885 into a Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council with diverse stakeholder representation, and mandated to report on mobility for the disabled, senior citizens and populations underserved by public transportation; cybersecurity; employment and environmental issues; and privacy and data sharing.", "No similar comprehensive autonomous vehicle legislation has been introduced in the 116 th Congress, although discussions on a bicameral bill have been ongoing. In addition, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works has reported America's Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019, S. 2302 , which includes several provisions in Subtitle D addressing the possible impact of autonomous vehicles on highway infrastructure.

The National Governors Association (NGA) has noted that state governments have a role with respect to vehicle and pedestrian safety, privacy, cybersecurity, and linkage with advanced communications networks. While supporting technology innovations in transportation, a recent NGA report notes that \"the existing regulatory structure and related incentives have not kept pace with the new technology\" and that \"recent accidents have raised concerns about the safety of drivers, pedestrians and other road users in the period during which autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles share the road.\"", "NGA has joined with other state and local government organizations to call for modifications in forthcoming autonomous vehicle legislation, including", "clarity that states and local governments not only can enforce existing laws governing operation of motor vehicles on public roads, but also originate new statutes and regulations; requiring submission of more detailed automaker and developer reports to DOT on the safety of their technologies, so that states and cities can be assured that autonomous vehicle testing is being conducted in a safe manner; differentiation between limited vehicle testing and the commercial deployment of large numbers of autonomous vehicles through an expanded exemptions process; and expansion of plans for consumer education about \"safe use and interaction\" with respect to autonomous vehicles.", "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), at least 41 states and the District of Columbia considered legislation related to autonomous vehicles between 2013 and October 2019; in that time, 29 states and the District of Columbia enacted legislation, governors in 11 states issued executive orders, and 5 states issued both an executive order and enacted legislation. ( Figure 4 ).", "Of the states that have enacted laws in 2017, 2018, and 2019 pertaining to autonomous vehicles, NCSL reports that the largest number of states have passed laws that clarify certain types of commercial activity, such as how closely autonomous vehicles can follow each other when they are coordinated, as in truck platooning. According to NCSL, no recent state laws have been enacted dealing with cybersecurity or vehicle inspection reports. NCSL has organized and categorized the types of state legislation ( Table 4 ). For a more thorough description of the legislation passed in 2017, 2018, and 2019, the NCSL Table of Enacted State Legislation provides more detail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implications for Highway Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Deployment of fully autonomous vehicles will require not only a suite of new technologies, but also changes to the highway infrastructure on which those vehicles will operate. Autonomous vehicles being tested today rely on clear pavement markings and legible signage to stay in their lanes and navigate through traffic. Major highways as well as side roads in urban and rural settings will need to accommodate autonomous vehicles in addition to a large fleet of conventional vehicles with human drivers.", "In this transition period to more autonomous vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0094which many anticipate will last several decades \u00e2\u0080\u0094the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is expected to play a significant role through its administration of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which sets standards for all traffic control devices, including signs, intersection signals, and road markings. For example, overhead signage on Interstate Highways contains white lettering on a green background in all 50 states\u00e2\u0080\u0094easily recognizable to any U.S. driver\u00e2\u0080\u0094due to MUTCD standards. FHWA is in the process of updating the 2009 MUTCD to address issues specific to autonomous vehicle technologies. However, state compliance with MUTCD is voluntary, and not all states uniformly apply all standards. Audi reportedly announced in 2018 that it would not make its new Level 3 autonomous vehicle technology, called Traffic Jam Pilot, available in the United States because of \"laws that change from one state to the next, insurance requirements, and things like lane lines and road signs that look different in different regions.\" Other automakers have made similar complaints about U.S. roads.", "In the near term, improvement and better maintenance of pavement markings, signage and intersection design may be the most helpful steps that federal and state transportation officials can take. Despite national standards based on MUTCD, not all states maintain their highway markings at a level that would be useful to guide autonomous vehicles. Inadequate road maintenance may affect the pace of autonomous vehicle deployment. Some 21% of major U.S. roads are in poor condition, and a road with many potholes or temporary pavement repairs may also lack continuous lane markings. Many minor roads, which are generally the responsibility of county or municipal governments, may lack road edge lines as well as center lines, potentially making it difficult for autonomous vehicles to position themselves correctly. Dirt and gravel roads may pose particular challenges for autonomous vehicles, as they generally have no pavement markings and cameras may be unable to detect potholes or edges in low-visibility conditions.", "Closely tied to the need for clearer road markings and signage will be ways in which federal and state transportation agencies develop a standardized method to communicate information to vehicles and motorists about construction, road accidents, detours, and other changes to road environments. Many of the perceived benefits of autonomous vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0094reduced vehicle fatalities, congestion mitigation, and pollution reduction\u00e2\u0080\u0094may depend on the ability of vehicles to exchange information with surrounding infrastructure. The Transportation Research Board (TRB) has been evaluating how states should begin now to plan and develop the types of connected vehicle infrastructure that will be necessary for full autonomous vehicle deployment. TRB's research is also focused on how cash-strapped transportation agencies can identify the large investments that will in turn be necessary to implement connectivity on top of regular maintenance of highways, bridges, and other traditional infrastructure.", "Other options to facilitate autonomous vehicle travel may include designation of special highway corridors that would include all V2X systems necessary for safe autonomous vehicle operation; three European countries have agreed to build such a corridor.", "Over a longer time line, the importance of highway markings may fade as automakers and developers find new ways for autonomous vehicles to navigate, including greater use of guardrails and roadside barriers, sensors, and three-dimensional maps. If highly detailed mapping is deemed to be one replacement for visual cues such as lane markings, then transportation agencies and automakers may need to develop an open standard so that all vehicles will understand the mapping technology. V2X communications through DSRC and cellular may evolve to provide a mechanism for new types of vehicle guidance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
