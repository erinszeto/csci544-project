In general, PRWORA states that an alien who is not a qualified alien is not eligible for any f ederal public benefit with specified exceptions for certain short-term, emergency related benefits (see below). In addition, with specified exceptions, any alien who is not a qualified alien, a nonimmigrant, or an alien paroled into the United States under INA section 212(d)(5) for less than one year is not eligible for a state or local public benefit. In other words, almost all legally present noncitizens are eligible for state and local public benefits, but in general, only those aliens who are or are expected to become immigrants (legal permanent residents) are eligible for federal public benefits. In addition, PWORA placed additional restrictions on receiving federal means-tested public benefits. The health related means-tested public benefits are Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and are discussed below.", "The law defines \"public benefit\" as:", "\u2026any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.

In general, CHIP allows states to cover targeted low-income children with no health insurance in families with income above Medicaid eligibility levels. States may also extend CHIP coverage to pregnant women when certain conditions are met. ", "As discussed above, PRWORA defined Medicaid as a means-tested public benefit, triggering additional eligibility requirements for \"qualified aliens.\" Currently, noncitizens' eligibility for federal Medicaid and CHIP benefits depends largely on their immigration status and whether they arrived (or were on a program's rolls) before August 22, 1996, the enactment date of PRWORA. Notably, the aliens must also meet the financial and categorical eligibility requirements for Medicaid or be targeted low-income uninsured children or eligible pregnant women for CHIP. Most legal permanent residents (LPRs) entering after August 22, 1996, are barred from Medicaid and CHIP for five years, after which they are eligible for CHIP and eligible for Medicaid at the state's option. States may also choose to use state and federal Medicaid and CHIP funds to cover pregnant women and children who are LPRs within the first five years of arrival. In addition, states have the option to use state funds to provide medical coverage for other LPRs within five years of their arrival in the United States.

LPRs receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) on or after August 22, 1996, are eligible for Medicaid because Medicaid coverage is required for all SSI recipients. Finally, in the case of LPRs sponsored for admission after 1997, the income and resources of their sponsor are \"deemed\" available to them when judging their eligibility. Nonetheless, all aliens regardless of immigration status who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid are eligible for emergency Medicaid.

More specifically, the Act has three primary requirements:", "hospitals must provide an appropriate medical screening examination for individuals who seek emergency care in a hospital ED; if an individual is found to have an emergency medical condition, the hospital must treat and stabilize the medical condition (or transfer the patient under certain circumstances); and if an individual's medical condition is not stable, the hospital may not transfer him or her unless (1) the individual (or someone acting on the individual's behalf) requests the transfer and/or (2) the transfer is appropriate as defined under the Act.", "Because hospitals are required to evaluate and treat all patients who seek care in hospital EDs, EMTALA in effect requires hospitals to provide free (uncompensated) care for some patients.", "Overall, in the United States, 17% of the approximately 115 million annual ED visits are made by patients without health insurance. A study that examined data on ED usage concluded that the literature does not support the notion that uninsured patients are a primary cause of ED overcrowding, present with less acute conditions than insured patients, or seek ED care primarily for convenience. Nonetheless, others have reported that the increase in ED usage is caused by uninsured patients, and that EMTALA has led to more patients seeking care for non-urgent conditions in EDs. As discussed above, noncitizens are more likely than U.S. citizens to be uninsured.

In addition, examining other Latinos, 16% of unauthorized aliens and 17% of immigrants had more than one ED visit in the previous year, compared with 22% of native-born and 20% of naturalized citizens of Latino decent.

In addition, between 2000 and 2007, the noncitizens' percentage of the uninsured population increased, although the increase was not consistent across the time period. Conversely, during the same time period, the percentage of the uninsured population made up of native-born citizens decreased. As with the noncitizen population, the naturalized citizen percentage of the uninsured population increased from 2000 to 2007.

Nonetheless, although there is limited research, there does not seem to be evidence that noncitizens use emergency departments more than citizens. ", "Notably, some argue that one of the reasons noncitizens lack health insurance and tend to use few health services (except for those related to childbirth) is that overall they are a healthier population. The literature is mixed on whether this is a valid assumption. For example, a study of Latinos found that unauthorized aliens are the least likely to report their health as poor among Mexicans and other Latinos, including immigrants and citizens. Another study reported that the foreign-born reported fewer health problems than the native-born, and the health advantage was especially larger among the unauthorized population. Nonetheless, other studies have found the opposite, with noncitizens being as likely as citizens to report poor or fair health and less likely to report having excellent health.", "In addition, the link between health insurance coverage and health care utilization is well documented, and several studies have shown that their lower rate of insurance coverage is one factor contributing to noncitizens' lower utilization of health care, including preventive care (e.g. cancer screening). Nonetheless, several studies have reported that the noncitizen population, including unauthorized aliens, was more likely to have hospitalization for childbirth than the citizen population. ", "Furthermore, regardless of legal status, and in addition to the barriers caused by a lack of health insurance, immigrants often face language and cultural barriers in accessing health care. These barriers include lack of knowledge about the U.S. healthcare system and lack of sufficient financial resources. Many of these barriers are the same for citizens (e.g., low incomes, poor education, being in a health care shortage area such as an inner city), but in general, noncitizens are more likely to have more of these characteristics. In addition, the Kaiser Commission reports that immigrants may underutilize health care, regardless of insurance coverage, out of fear of jeopardizing their eligibility citizenship by incurring costs as a public charge. Similarly, fear of discovery by government officials may also be a barrier to accessing health services among the unauthorized population, as was shown in a 1994 study on unauthorized aliens and tuberculosis.

Individuals born outside the United States or its outlying areas, and whose parents were born outside the United States or its outlying areas, are asked, \"Are you a citizen of the United States?\" Respondents who answer \"Yes\" are coded as naturalized citizens, while respondents who answer \"No\" are categorized as noncitizens. In the CPS, individuals for whom no birthplace is provided are assigned a citizenship status during the editing process. For example, the citizenship status of a child may be assigned based on the citizenship status of the child's mother. The CPS does not attempt to verify the accuracy of responses to the questions about citizenship.
