Among its many provisions, FSMA expanded FDA's authority to conduct a mandatory recall of contaminated food products; enhanced surveillance systems to investigate foodborne illness outbreaks; established new preventive controls and food safety plans at some food processing facilities and farms; enhanced FDA's traceability capacity within the nation's food distribution channels; increased inspection frequencies of high-risk food facilities (both domestic and foreign facilities); and expanded FDA's authority and oversight capabilities with regard to foreign companies that supply food imports to the United States.", "Under FSMA, FDA is responsible for more than 50 regulations, guidelines, and studies. This included seven \"foundational\" rules required to fully implement FSMA covering:", "1. Preventive Controls for Human Food: Requires that food facilities have safety plans that set forth how they will identify and minimize hazards. 2. Preventive Controls for Animal Food: Establishes Current Good Manufacturing Practices and preventive controls for food for animals. 3. Produce Safety: Establishes science-based standards for growing, harvesting, packing, and holding produce on domestic and foreign farms. 4. Foreign Supplier Verification Program: Importers will be required to verify that food imported into the United States has been produced in a manner that provides the same level of public health protection as that required of U.S. food producers. 5. Third Party Certification: Establishes a program for the accreditation of third-party auditors to conduct food safety audits and issue certifications of foreign facilities producing food for humans or animals. 6. Sanitary Transportation: Requires those who transport food to use sanitary practices to ensure the safety of food. 7. Intentional Adulteration: Requires domestic and foreign facilities to address vulnerable processes in their operations to prevent acts intended to cause large-scale public harm.", "These regulations were to have been proposed or, in some cases, finalized within one to two years of enactment (roughly January 2012 and January 2013); other rules were to have been submitted within 18 months of enactment (roughly mid-2012). However, many of these regulations did not become final until 2016. Other FDA actions under FSMA were also delayed. Several factors contributed to these delays, including the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) review process, extensions in the public comment and response period for many of FDA's proposed rules and the agency's re-proposal of key provisions of some major regulations, and also, according to FDA, limited agency resources and the lack of availability of discretionary appropriations. Delays in FDA's rulemaking process resulted in many FSMA regulations being released according to a court-ordered schedule under a federal lawsuit brought by the Center for Food Safety.", "Full implementation of the most FSMA regulations will be phased in over the next several years, mostly to provide flexibility to farms and food businesses to comply with the new requirements, as provided for in the enacted law.

Among its many provisions, FSMA expanded FDA's authority to conduct a mandatory recall of contaminated food products; enhanced surveillance systems to investigate foodborne illness outbreaks; established new preventive controls and food safety plans at some food processing facilities and farms; enhanced FDA's traceability capacity within the nation's food distribution channels; increased inspection frequencies of high-risk food facilities (both domestic and foreign facilities); and expanded FDA's authority and oversight capabilities regarding foreign companies that supply food imports to the United States. FSMA does not directly address meat and poultry products under the jurisdiction of USDA.", "When the law was enacted, FDA has identified five key elements of FSMA: ", "Preventive controls \u2014FSMA provides FDA with a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply. As examples, the act requires mandatory preventive controls for food facilities and mandatory produce safety standards, and also gives FDA the authority to prevent intentional contamination. Inspection and Compliance \u2014FSMA provides FDA with the ability to conduct oversight and ensure compliance with new requirements and to respond when problems emerge. Examples include establishing a mandated inspection frequency (based on risk); giving FDA access to industry records and food safety plans; and requiring certain testing to be conducted by accredited labs. Response \u2014FSMA provides FDA with the ability to respond to problems when they emerge. Examples include giving FDA mandatory recall authority for all food products; expanding FDA's authority to administratively detain products that are in violation of the law; giving FDA the authority to suspend a facility's registration, effectively prohibiting the company from selling any products within the United States; establishing pilot projects so FDA can enhance its product tracing capabilities; and requiring additional recordkeeping by facilities that \"manufacture, process, pack or hold\" foods designated as \"high-risk.\" Imported Food Safety \u2014FSMA provides FDA with the ability to help ensure that food imports meet U.S. food safety standards. Examples include requiring importers to verify that their foreign suppliers have adequate preventive controls; establishing a third-party verification system; requiring certification by a credible third party for high-risk foods as a condition for entry into the United States; establishing a voluntary qualified importer program for expedited review and entry from participating importers; and giving FDA the right to refuse entry into the United States of food from a foreign facility if FDA is denied access to the facility or the country where the facility is located. Enhanced Partnerships \u2014FSMA provides FDA with the authority to improve training of state, local, territorial, and tribal food safety officials. Examples include requiring FDA to develop and implement strategies to enhance the food safety capacities of state and local agencies through multi-year grants, as well as strategies to enhance the capacities of foreign governments and their industries; and giving FDA the authority to rely on inspections of other federal, state, and local agencies in meeting its increased inspection mandate for domestic facilities. ", "FSMA authorized additional appropriations and staff for FDA's future food safety activities. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the newly enacted law could increase net federal spending subject to appropriations by $1.4 billion over a five-year period (FY2011-FY2015). FSMA authorizes an increase in FDA staff, to reach 5,000 in FY2014. ", "During the regulatory development phase of FSMA, seven \"foundational\" rules were identified as required to fully implement FSMA (see listing in text box below). These regulations were to have been proposed or, in some cases, finalized within one to two years of enactment (roughly January 2012 and January 2013); other rules were to have been submitted within 18 months of enactment (roughly mid-2012). However, FDA's regulations were not finalized until 2016. Some other FDA actions under FSMA were also delayed.

However, there were continued delays in the agency's release of other FSMA rules, industry guidance, and reports, well beyond the dates required under the law. These delays were exacerbated by FDA's decision to extend the public comment and response period for most FSMA proposed regulations as well as the agency's decision to re-propose key provisions of some regulations.

Provisions that FDA plans to change \"include water quality standards and testing, standards for using raw manure and compost, certain provisions affecting mixed-use facilities, and procedures for withdrawing the qualified exemption for certain farms.\" Some stakeholders expect further changes to other provisions in these proposed rules. In March 2014, FDA announced it would also re-propose regulations implementing a second preventive controls regulation, namely the Preventive Controls for Food for Animals (FSMA \u00a7103).", "FDA had suggested that they would likely publish the re-proposed sections of these rules at or very near to the same time. The agency also indicated that it will accept \"additional comments only on those sections of the proposed rules that have been revised,\" recognizing the \"court order regarding the timelines for finalizing these rules.\" In September 2014, FDA re-proposed certain aspects of four major proposed rules, including preventive controls for both human food and animal food (FSMA \u00a7103(a) and (c)), produce safety (FSMA \u00a7105(a)), and the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSMA \u00a7301(a)).", "Congress pushed FDA to consider rewriting these proposed regulations. Several Members of Congress have submitted a series of letters to FDA requesting that the agency release a second set of proposed rules and solicit public comment before going final. Within Congress, two letters were sent to FDA on November 22, 2013, including a House-Senate letter from Senators Shaheen and Blunt and Representatives Courtney and Gibson, and a letter from members of the House Organic Caucus, each expressing concerns about the proposed requirements in FDA's produce rule, among other concerns. A third letter was sent to FDA on November 13, 2013, by Senators Tester and Hagan expressing concerns about the effects of the proposed rules on small farms and facilities. Another letter was sent on November 15, 2013, from Members from Vermont (Senators Leahy and Sanders, and Representative Welch), urging FDA to re-propose these rules. A wide range of stakeholders have also expressed similar concerns and are supporting FDA's reexamination of some of its proposed regulations.", "Other congressional actions taken regarding FSMA include the addition of a provision in the enacted 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 , \u00a712311) requiring FDA to provide Congress with a scientific and economic analysis of FSMA, including an analysis of how the law affects farm businesses of all sizes, prior to implementing final regulations under the law. Recent appropriations bills also have addressed certain aspects of FDA's implementation of regulations under FSMA. As part of the enacted FY2014 appropriations, Congress directed FDA to implement a \"comprehensive training program\" for federal and state inspectors and commended FDA for its decision to revise its proposed rules affecting farmers. As part of the enacted FY2015 and FY2016 Agriculture appropriations, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees made a number of recommendations in their respective bills regarding FDA's ongoing efforts to develop FSMA-related regulations and guidance. Both committees have addressed FSMA's re-proposal of certain key regulations regarding food safety preventive controls for both human and animal food, and standards for produce, and have also expressed a range of concerns as FDA has developed regulations under FSMA, including concerns about extensive delays in FDA's rulemaking and implementation of FSMA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budgetary and Staff Resources", "paragraphs": ["Limited resources and the availability of discretionary appropriations might also have affected FDA's rollout and full implementation of FSMA.

The Obama Administration has repeatedly requested that additional user fees be implemented to cover some of these costs, which Congress has not approved. Increases in appropriated funding for FDA's Food Program have not matched the Administration's additional requested user fees. Staff levels at FDA also have remained below levels authorized in FSMA, with an estimated 3,700 FDA staff working on food-related activities in FY2014.
