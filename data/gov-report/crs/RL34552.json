During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs also pursued a number of other U.S. policy goals, such as reducing high rates of population growth, promoting economic development in general, advancing U.S. trade interests, expanding access to basic education and health care, promoting human rights, and protecting the environment. In the 1990s, other goals included stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs, expanding peace efforts in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting religious freedom, and countering trafficking in persons.", "A defining change in focus came following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Since then, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have taken on a more strategic sense of importance, and have been frequently cast in terms of contributing to the war on terrorism. In 2002, President Bush released his National Security Strategy that for the first time established global development as the third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy. Development was again underscored in the Administration's re-statement of the National Security Strategy released on March 16, 2006.", "Also in 2002, foreign assistance budget justifications began to highlight the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority, emphasizing amounts of U.S. assistance to 28 \"front-line\" states\u2014countries that cooperate with the United States in the war on terrorism or face terrorist threats themselves. Large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism. State Department efforts focus extensively on outreach in strategically important countries, diplomatic security, and finding new and more effective ways of presenting American views and culture through public diplomacy.", "In the context of the post 9/11 environment, the Bush Administration announced significant initiatives relating to diplomacy and foreign aid. A new transformational diplomacy initiative, announced in 2006, repositioned diplomats to global trouble spots, created regional public diplomacy centers, localized small posts outside of foreign capitals, and trained diplomats in new skills. (See CRS Report RL34141, Diplomacy for the 21 st Century: Transformational Diplomacy , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] for more information.) Also announced in 2006 was the creation of a new position at the State Department, the Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA), who serves concurrently as USAID Administrator. Heading up this new \"F bureau\" at State, the DFA created a new Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance with the objectives of providing more coordination, coherence, transparency, and accountability for aid programs. (See CRS Report RL34243, Foreign Aid Reform: Issues for Congress and Policy Options , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] for more information.)", "Other presidential initiatives address development and global health concerns. The Millennium Challenge Corporation is an aid delivery concept, proposed by President Bush in 2002, authorized by Congress (Title VI, Division D of P.L. 108-199 ), and established in early 2004. It is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of U.S. resources in a few low- and low-middle income countries that have demonstrated a strong commitment to political, economic, and social reforms. The President initially promised $5 billion annually by FY2006, although funds requested and appropriated have never reached this level.", "With regard to global health issues, President Bush announced in 2003 a five-year, $15 billion commitment to combat HIV/AIDS. Known as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, the initiative has focused significant funds in 15 focus countries, largely in Africa. Subsequently, the President launched a new initiative in mid-2005 aimed specifically at malaria (President's Malaria Initiative, or PMI), pledging $1.2 billion in additional resources through 2010. These initiatives, which have benefitted African nations, have contributed to fulfilling the Administration's pledge to double aid to Africa in the 2004-2010 period. In May 2007, the President announced a second phase commitment on HIV/AIDS of an additional $30 billion through FY2013.", "Beyond these recently emerging foreign policy goals relating to terrorism and global health concerns, other prominent objectives have continued since the early 1990s including supporting peace in the Middle East through assistance to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians; fostering democratization and stability for countries in crisis, like Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda, Kosovo, Liberia, and Sudan; facilitating democratization and free market economies in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union; suppressing international narcotics production and trafficking through assistance to Colombia and the Andean region; and alleviating famine and mitigating refugee situations in places throughout the world.", "The international affairs budget can be divided into two components\u2014State Department and Foreign Operations.

This year the Administration is requesting $248.6 million for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative, including CRC, in FY2009.", "DOD's expanding role in traditional civilian overseas activities over the years has led some observers to comment that DOD is not ideally suited, by expertise or training, to perform some of these missions. For example, some observers claim that police training missions are best performed by civilian law enforcement personnel. Others suggest that local-level economic reconstruction initiatives may be more effective when integrated into a broader economic reconstruction and development strategy, guided by civilian experts. Some nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), in turn, have expressed concerns that working closely with the military could affect how the NGOs are perceived by host populations.", "For almost two decades, some analysts have judged that the United States needs a broader array of civilian personnel, readily available and trained to work with the military, to deal with the many needs of states emerging from conflict, as well as to prevent conflict. Without such civilian personnel, observers maintain that tasks such as civil administration, policing, political institution building, humanitarian relief, and early reconstruction or construction of physical infrastructure have fallen by default to ad hoc arrangements and to military forces, which as a whole are neither structured nor trained for them. The Bush Administration has moved incrementally to develop a small operational civilian capability that, as stated in the February 2008 announcement of a Civilian Stabilization Initiative (CSI), would serve as \"a counterpart to the U.S. military, ready and capable to stabilize countries in the transition from war to peace.\"", "In mid-2004, the Bush Administration established the State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) as the first step in operationalizing the State Department and other civilian agencies to undertake reconstruction and stabilization missions, either alone or with the military. Congress endorsed the creation of S/CRS in 2004 (Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005, H.R. 4818 , P.L. 108-447 , signed into law December 8, 2004. Section 408, Division D) and defined its responsibilities. Since then, S/CRS has worked to establish the basic concepts, mechanisms, and capabilities necessary to carry out reconstruction and stabilization missions. Among its principal tasks has been the development of the CRC to undertake reconstruction and stabilization missions.", "Senators Lugar and Biden have introduced legislation repeatedly since 2004 to support the creation of civilian capabilities and fund their activities, including a permanent authorization for S/CRS, the authorization and funding of a readiness response corps, and the establishment of a conflict response fund. The latest version of this bill is S. 613 , the Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2007, reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 10, 2007 ( S.Rept. 110-50 ). On February 27, 2008, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved a similar bill, H.R. 1084 .
