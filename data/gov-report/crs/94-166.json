It is a matter of the law of the place where it occurs. Nevertheless, a number of American criminal laws apply extraterritorially outside of the United States. Application is generally a question of legislative intent, express or implied. There are two exceptions. First, the statute must come within Congress's constitutional authority to enact. Second, neither the statute nor its application may violate due process or any other constitutional prohibition.", "Claims of implied extraterritoriality must overcome additional obstacles. Federal laws are presumed to apply only within the United States, unless Congress clearly provides otherwise. Moreover, the courts will also presume that Congress intends its statutes to be applied in a manner that does not offend international law.", "Historically, in order to overcome these presumptions, the lower federal courts have read certain vintage Supreme Court cases broadly. The Supreme Court's recent pronouncements in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. and RJR Nabisco v. European Community, however, suggest a far more restrictive view.", "Although the crimes over which the United States has extraterritorial jurisdiction may be many, so are the obstacles to their enforcement. For both practical and diplomatic reasons, criminal investigations within another country require the acquiescence, consent, or preferably the assistance, of the authorities of the host country. The United States has mutual legal assistance treaties with several countries designed to formalize such cooperative law enforcement assistance. It has agreements for the same purpose in many other instances. Cooperation, however, may introduce new obstacles. Searches and interrogations carried out jointly with foreign officials, certainly if they involve Americans, must be conducted within the confines of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. And the Sixth Amendment imposes limits upon the use in American criminal trials of depositions taken abroad.", "The nation's recently negotiated extradition treaties address some of the features of earlier agreements which complicate extradition for extraterritorial offenses, that is, dual criminality requirements; reluctance to recognize extraterritorial jurisdiction; and exemptions on the basis of nationality or political offenses. To further facilitate the prosecution of federal crimes with extraterritorial application Congress has enacted special venue, statute of limitations, and evidentiary statutes. To further cooperative efforts, it enacted the Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act, P.L. 111-79, which authorizes federal courts to issue search warrants, subpoenas, and other orders to facilitate criminal investigations in this country on behalf of foreign law enforcement officials.", "This report is available in an abridged version, stripped of its attachments, bibliography, footnotes, and most of its citations to authority, as CRS Report RS22497, Extraterritorial Application of American Criminal Law: An Abbreviated Sketch, by [author name scrubbed]."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Crime is ordinarily proscribed, tried, and punished according to the laws of the place where it occurs. American criminal law applies beyond the geographical confines of the United States, however, under certain limited circumstances. State prosecution for overseas misconduct is limited almost exclusively to multi-jurisdictional crimes, that is, crimes where some elements of the offense are committed within the state and others are committed beyond its boundaries. A surprising number of federal criminal statutes have extraterritorial application, but prosecutions have been relatively few. This may be because when extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction does exist, practical and legal complications, and sometimes diplomatic considerations, may counsel against its exercise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Considerations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Powers", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution does not forbid either congressional or state enactment of laws that apply outside the United States. Nor does it prohibit either the federal government or the states from prosecuting conduct committed abroad. In fact, several passages suggest that the Constitution contemplates the application of American law beyond the geographical confines of the United States. It speaks, for example, of \"felonies committed on the high seas,\" \"offences against the law of nations,\" \"commerce with foreign nations,\" and of the impact of treaties.", "More specifically, it grants Congress the power \"[t]o define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations\"; the power \"[t]o regulate commerce with foreign Nations\"; and \"[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\" ", "The power to define and punish felonies on the high seas and the power under the Necessary and Proper Clause have been referenced in the past as the source of Congress's authority to enact extraterritorial criminal legislation primarily in a maritime context. The powers have been understood to permit overseas application of federal criminal law, even extending to an American vessel at anchor well within the territory of another nation.", "Congress's commerce powers are three; one, that vests it with power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,\" affords it apparent authority to enact criminal statutes with extraterritorial application. The other two Commerce Clause powers permit Congress to regulate interstate commerce and commerce with the Indian tribes. The courts often speak of these two in exceptionally sweeping terms. The Foreign Commerce Clause may be even more far-reaching, although there is certainly support for a contrary view. ", "Courts in some of the more recent cases have opted for a middle ground. One found that Congress did indeed have the legislative power to proscribe illicit overseas commercial sexual activity by an American who had traveled from the United States to the scene of the crime. Confronted with a vigorous dissent, the panel's majority expressly chose to avoid the issue of whether it would have reached the same result if the defendant had not agreed to pay for his sexual misconduct or some other commercial factor. Another court elected to construe the statute before it narrowly and thereby avoided the necessity of ruling on the scope of Congress's power under the foreign commerce clause. A third held that Congress's authority to regulate foreign commerce extended to the regulation of the channels of U.S. foreign commerce, but it left for another day the questions of whether the domestic effect on commerce prerogative has a foreign commerce counterpart or whether foreign commerce issues should be judged by standards of their own. ", "Two other circuits, however, favor a more expansive view. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has held that Congress's foreign commerce power at least mirrors the \"channels,\" \"instrumentalities,\" and \"substantive effect\" components of its interstate commerce powers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has gone even further and ruled that the Foreign Commerce Clause embodies not only the \"channels\" and \"instrumentalities\" authority, but also encompasses the power to regulate any \"activities that demonstrably affect [U.S. foreign] commerce.\" ", "Its own enumerated powers aside, Congress has resorted on countless occasions to its authority to enact extraterritorial legislation in furtherance of the powers vested in one of the other branches or in reliance on powers it shares with one of the other branches\u2014through the necessary and proper clause. It has, for instance, regularly called upon the authority deposited with the President and Congress in the fields of foreign affairs and military activities, powers which the courts have described in particularly wide-ranging terms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Nevertheless, the powers granted by the Constitution are not without limit. The clauses enumerating Congress's powers carry specific and implicit limits which govern the extent to which the power may be exercised overseas. Other limitations appear elsewhere in the Constitution, most notably in the due process clauses of the Fifth Amendment. Some limitations are a product of the need to harmonize potentially conflicting grants of authority. For example, although the Constitution reserves to the states the residue of governmental powers which it does not vest elsewhere, the primacy it affords the federal government in the area of foreign affairs limits the authority of the states in the field principally to those areas where they are acting with federal authority or acquiescence.", "In the area of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the most often cited limitation resides in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. While the enumerated powers may carry specific limits which govern the extent to which the power may be exercised overseas, the general restrictions of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause have traditionally been mentioned as the most likely to define the outer reaches of the power to enact and enforce legislation with extraterritorial application.", "Unfortunately, many of the cases do little more than note that due process restrictions mark the frontier of the authority to enact and enforce American law abroad. Even the value of this scant illumination is dimmed by the realization that the circumstances most likely to warrant such due process analyses are the very ones in which the least process is due. Although American courts that try aliens for overseas violations of American law must operate within the confines of due process, the Supreme Court has observed that the Constitution's due process commands do not protect aliens who lack any \"significant voluntary connection[s] with the United States.\" Moreover, the Court's more recent decisions often begin with the assumption that the issues of extraterritorial jurisdiction come without constitutional implications.", "Nevertheless, due process issues have surfaced in a handful, but growing number, of lower court decisions relating to extraterritoriality. A few courts describe a due process requirement that demands some nexus between the United States and the circumstances of the offense. Occasionally, they look to international law principles to provide a useful measure to determine whether the nexus requirement has been met. On other occasions, they consider the principles at work in the minimum contacts test for personal jurisdiction. At the heart of these cases is the notion that due process expects that a defendant's conduct must have some past, present, or anticipated locus or impact within the United States before he can fairly be held criminally liable for it in an American court. The commentators have greeted this analysis with some hesitancy, and some courts have simply rejected it.", "A related due process challenge is based on notice. It is akin to the concerns over secret laws and vague statutes, the exception to the maxim that ignorance of the law is no defense. Here, indicia of knowledge, of reason to know, of an obligation to know, or of reasonable ignorance of the law's requirements\u2014some of which are reflected in international standards\u2014seem to be the most relevant factors. Citizens, for instance, might be expected to know the laws of their own nation; seafarers to know the law of the sea and consequently the laws of the nation under which they sail; everyone should be aware of the laws of the land in which they find themselves and of the wrongs condemned by the laws of all nations. On the other hand, the application of American criminal statute to an alien in a foreign country under whose laws the conduct is lawful would seem to evidence a lack of notice sufficient to raise due process concerns.", "Conceding this outer boundary, however, the courts fairly uniformly have held that questions of extraterritoriality are almost exclusively within the discretion of Congress; a determination to grant a statutory provision extraterritorial application\u2014regardless of its policy consequences\u2014is not by itself constitutionally suspect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutory Construction", "paragraphs": ["For this reason, the question of the extent to which a particular statute applies outside the United States has generally been considered a matter of statutory, rather than constitutional, construction. General rules of statutory construction have emerged which can explain, if not presage, the result in a given case. The first of these holds that a statute that is silent on the question of overseas application will be construed to have only territorial application unless there is a clear indication of some broader intent. Moreover, \"when a statute provides for some extraterritorial application, the presumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that provision to its terms.\"", "At one time, the second rule of construction stated that the nature and purpose of a statute may provide an indication of whether Congress intended a statute to apply beyond the confines of the United States. Although hints of it can be found earlier, the rule was first clearly announced in United States v. Bowman . ", "The Supreme Court's emphatic endorsement of the domestic presumption in a civil context in Morrison cast some doubt on Bowman 's continued vitality. Early indications were that the courts and commentators were unwilling to go that far. The Court in RJR Nabisco , another civil case, however, may have changed that. In RJR Nabisco , the Court seemed to take direct aim at Bowman without naming it. There may be some real question of the extent to which the Court still considers Bowman good law. ", "The final rule declares that unless a contrary intent is clear, Congress is assumed to have acted so as not to invite action inconsistent with international law. At one time, the cases seemed to imply the existence of another rule, that is, unless Congress declared that it intended a statute to apply overseas to both aliens and American nationals, it would be presumed to apply only to Americans. Yet as discussed below, the challenge seems less compelling in light of the generous reading of the internationally recognized grounds upon which to stake a claim."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Law", "paragraphs": ["International law supports, rather than dictates, decisions in the area of the overseas application of American law. Neither Congress nor the courts are bound to the dictates of international law when enacting or interpreting statutes with extraterritorial application.", "Yet Congress looks to international law when it evaluates the policy considerations associated with legislation that may have international consequences. For this reason, the courts interpret legislation with the presumption that Congress or the state legislature intends its laws to be applied within the bounds of international law, unless it indicates otherwise.", "To what extent does international law permit a nation to exercise extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction? The question is essentially one of national interests. What national interest is served by extraterritorial application and what interests of other nations suffer by an extraterritorial application?", "The most common classification of these interests dates to a 1935 Harvard Law School study which divided them into five categories or principles corresponding to the circumstances under which the nations of the world had declared their criminal laws applicable: (1) the territorial principle that involves crimes occurring or having an impact within the territory of a country; (2) the nationality principle that involves crimes committed by its nationals; (3) the passive personality principle that involves crimes committed against its nationals; (4) the protection principle that involves the crimes which have an impact on its interests as a nation; and (5) the universal principle that involves crimes which are universally condemned. ", "The American Law Institute's Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States contains perhaps the most comprehensive, contemporary statement of international law in the area. It indicates that reasonableness defines the latitude that international law affords a country to enact, try, and punish violations of its law extraterritorially; its assessment of reasonableness mirrors a balancing of the interests represented in the Harvard study principles.", "While the Restatement's views carry considerable weight with both Congress and the courts, the courts have traditionally ascertained the extent to which international law would recognize extraterritorial application of a particular law by citing the Harvard study principles, read expansively.", "The territorial principle of the Harvard study principles applies more widely than its title might suggest. It covers conduct within a nation's geographical borders. Yet, it also encompasses laws governing conduct on its territorial waters, conduct on its vessels on the high seas, conduct committed only in part within its geographical boundaries, and conduct elsewhere that has an impact within its territory. Congress often indicates within the text of a statute when it intends a provision to apply within its territorial waters and upon its vessels. Although rarely mentioned in the body of a statute, the courts have long and regularly acknowledged the \"impact\" basis for a claim of extraterritorial application. This is particularly so, when the facts in a case suggest other principles of international law, in addition to the territorial principle. ", "If the territorial principle is more expansive than its caption might imply, the protective principle is less so. It is confined to crimes committed outside a nation's territory against its \"security, territorial integrity or political independence.\" As construed by the courts, however, it is understood to permit the application abroad of statutes which protect the federal government and its functions. And so, it covers the overseas murder or attempted murder of federal officers or those thought to be federal officers; acts of terrorism calculated to influence American foreign policy; conduct that Congress has characterized as a threat to U.S. national security; false statements or forgery designed to frustrate the administration of U.S. immigration law; entering the United States as a stowaway; or overseas bribery in connection with the award of federal government contracts. ", "The nationality principle rests the exercise of extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction on the citizenship of accused. It is the principle mirrored in the Supreme Court's statements in Blackme r v. United States , following the contempt conviction of an American living in Paris who ignored a federal court subpoena. As in the case of Blackmer , which evidenced both the nationality and the protective principles, cases involving the nationality principle often involve other principles as well.", "The passive personality principle recognizes extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victim of the offense. It, too, has been asserted most often in the presence of facts suggesting other principles.", "The universal principle is based on the premise that offenses against all nations may be punished by any nation where the offender is found. At a minimum, it applies to piracy and offenses committed on the high seas on \"stateless\" vessels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Current Extent of American Extraterritorial Criminal Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Law", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Express", "paragraphs": ["Congress's declaration that a particular statute is to apply outside of the United States is the most obvious evidence of intent to create extraterritorial jurisdiction.

Although the concept of the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States once embraced little more than places over which the United States enjoyed state-like legislative jurisdiction, U.S. navigable territorial waters, and vessels of the United States, its application has been statutorily expanded.

Some address misconduct so universally condemned that they fall within federal jurisdiction regardless of any other jurisdictional considerations as long as the offender flees to the United States, is brought here for prosecution, or is otherwise \"found in the United States\" after the commission of the offense. Some enjoy extraterritorial application under any of a number of these and other explicit jurisdictional circumstances.", "Members of another category of explicit extraterritorial federal criminal statutes either cryptically declare that their provisions are to apply overseas or describe a series of jurisdictional circumstances under which their provisions have extraterritorial application, not infrequently involving the foreign commerce of the United States in conjunction with other factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act", "paragraphs": ["The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) is somewhat unusual in that it expressly authorizes extraterritorial coverage of federal criminal law predicated on nothing more than the consent of the nation with primary criminal jurisdiction.

In fact, they construed Bowman and Ford to suggest that American extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction includes a wide range of statutes designed to protect federal officers, employees, and property; to prevent smuggling; and to deter the obstruction or corruption of the overseas activities of federal departments and agencies. They held, for instance, that the statute outlawing the assassination of Members of Congress may be applied against an American for a murder committed in a foreign country, and that statutes prohibiting the murder or kidnaping of federal law enforcement officials apply in other countries even if the offenders are not Americans, and even if the offenders simply incorrectly believed the victims were federal law enforcement officers. They have also considered extraterritorial jurisdiction appropriate to (1) cases where aliens have attempted to defraud the United States in order to gain admission into the United States; (2) false statements made by Americans overseas; (3) the theft of federal property abroad; (4) counterfeiting, forging, or otherwise misusing federal documents or checks overseas by either Americans or aliens; and (5) murder of a foreign national in another nation designed to facilitate the operation of a criminal enterprise in the United States. RJR Nabisco casts serious doubt on the continued validity of these assessments, at least the absence of some textual, structural, or contextual indication that Congress intended the statutes at issue to apply abroad.", "This is equally true to the implications of the earlier jurisprudence. A logical extension of earlier law would have been to conclude that statutes enacted to prevent and punish the theft of federal property apply worldwide. And there seemed no obvious reason why statutes protecting the United States from intentional deprivation of its property by destruction should be treated differently from those where the loss is attributable to theft.

Earlier cases occasionally expressed the view that an individual might be guilty of conspiracy to violate a federal law within the United States notwithstanding the fact he never entered the United States; it was enough that he was a member of a conspiracy to violate the American law. The cases applied the same rationale to accessories to overseas federal crimes, and to piggyback offenses where criminal liability was predicated upon a crime that applies abroad.

Obviously, Congress may, by preemptive action, extinguish the legislative authority of a state in any area over which Congress has plenary powers. And the Supremacy Clause also renders treaties to which the United States is a party binding upon the states and therefore beyond their legislative reach.

Another common claim is where an individual outside the state attempts or conspires to commit a crime within the state; or one within the state attempts or conspires to commit a crime beyond its boundaries.

Subsequently negotiated agreements either require extradition regardless of where the offense occurs, permit extradition regardless of where the offense occurs, or require extradition where the extraterritorial laws of the two nations are compatible.", "More recent extradition treaties address other traditional features of the nation's earlier agreements that complicate extradition, most notably the nationality exception, the political offense exception, and the practice of limiting extradition to a list of specifically designated offenses.", "Federal crimes committed within other countries are more likely than not to be the work of those who live there. Yet, the \"most common type of treaty provision provides that neither of the contracting parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens or subjects.\" Most treaties negotiated of late, however, contain either an article declaring that extradition may not be denied on the basis of nationality or one declaring that if extradition is denied on the basis of nationality, the case must be referred to local authorities for prosecution.", "\"The political offense exception is now a standard clause in almost all extradition treaties of the world.\" Originally designed to protect unsuccessful insurgents in flight, it is often construed to include both the purely political offense such as treason and sedition and related political offenses such as an act of violence committed during the course of, and in furtherance of, a political upheaval. The exception is somewhat at odds with contemporary desires to prevent, prosecute, and punish acts of terrorism. Consequently, treaties forged over the last several years frequently include some form of limitation on the exception, often accompanied by a discretionary right to refuse politically or otherwise discriminatorily motivated extradition requests.", "Current U.S. extradition treaties signed prior to the 1980s list specific crimes to which the treaty is limited. In the nation's first extradition treaty the list was limited to murder and forgery; toward the end of the 20 th century the standard lists had grown close to more than 30 crimes. Treaties agreed to more recently opt for a generic description.", "As an alternative to extradition, particularly if the suspect is not a citizen of the country of refuge, foreign authorities may be willing to expel or deport him under circumstances that allow the United States to take him into custody. In the absence of a specific treaty provision, the fact that the defendant was abducted overseas and brought to the United States for trial rather than pursuant to a request under the applicable extradition treaty does not deprive the federal court of jurisdiction to try him."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Venue", "paragraphs": ["Federal crimes committed within the United States must be tried where they occur. Crimes committed outside the United States are tried where Congress has provided. Congress has enacted both general and specific venue statutes governing extraterritorial offenses. Section 3238, the general provision, permits the trial of extraterritorial crimes either (1) in the district into which the offender is \"first brought\" or in which he is arrested for the offense; or (2) prior to that time, by indictment or information in the district of the offender's last known residence, or if none is known, in the District of Columbia. The phrase \"first brought\" as used in section 3238 means \"first brought while in custody.\" The phrase \"is arrested\" applies when the accused is initially taken into custody under an indictment that is subsequently dismissed. As the language of the section suggests, venue for all joint offenders is proper wherever venue for one of their number is proper. Courts are divided over whether section 3238 may be applied even though venue may have been proper without recourse to its provisions.", "On occasion, Congress will enact individual provisions covering venue for offenses committed abroad. The Controlled Substances Import and Export Act and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) are two such examples. The Controlled Substance section outlaws overseas possession with intent to import into the United States. MDLEA outlaws possession of controlled substances on vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. They contain parallel venue provisions, which permit trial in the judicial district where the accused enters the United States or in the District of Columbia.

Federal courts ordinarily have no authority to subpoena foreign nationals located in a foreign country. Mutual legal assistance treaties and similar agreements generally contain provisions to facilitate a transfer of custody of foreign witnesses who are imprisoned in a foreign nation and in other instances to elicit assistance to encourage foreign nationals to come to this country and testify voluntarily.", "Unable to secure the presence of witnesses who are foreign nationals, Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits federal courts to authorize depositions to be taken abroad, under \"exceptional circumstances and in the interests of justice.\" They may admit such depositions into evidence in a criminal trial as long as the demands of the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Constitution's Confrontation Clause are also satisfied.", "Originally, only a defendant might request that depositions be taken under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, but they have been available to prosecutors since the 1970s. The Rule offers depositions as an alternative to long-term incarceration of material witnesses. Otherwise, depositions may be ordered only under exceptional circumstances. Some courts have said that to \"establish exceptional circumstances the moving party must show the witness's unavailability and the materiality of the witness's testimony.\" Others would add to these that \"the testimony is necessary to prevent a failure of justice\" or additional considerations. ", "As general matter, depositions are to be taken in the same manner as depositions in civil cases. Moreover, the Rule requires that the defendant be afforded an opportunity to attend depositions taken at the government's request. When a deposition is taken abroad, the courts prefer that the defendant be present, that his counsel be allowed to cross-examine the witness, that the deposition be taken under oath, that a verbatim transcript be taken, and that the deposition be captured on videotape; but they have permitted depositions to be admitted into evidence at subsequent criminal trials in this country, notwithstanding the fact that one or more of these optimal conditions are not present. In nations whose laws might not otherwise require, or even permit, depositions under conditions considered preferable under U.S. law, a treaty provision sometimes addresses the issue.", "Although the government will ordinarily take depositions under the conditions that would permit them to be used as evidence at trial, \"[c]ompliance with Rule 15 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for use of a deposition at trial.\" The question of admissibility of overseas depositions rests ultimately upon whether the Confrontation Clause requirements have been met. The right of an accused under the Confrontation Clause embodies not only the prerogative of a literal face-to-face confrontation, but also the right to cross examine and to have the witness's testimonial demeanor exposed to the jury. The early cases relied on the Supreme Court's decisions either in Ohio v. Roberts or in Maryland v. Craig . Faced with the question of whether trial witnesses might testify remotely via a two-way video conference, Craig held that the Confrontation Clause's requirement of physical face-to-face confrontation between witness and defendant at trial can be excused under limited circumstances in light of \"considerations of public policy and necessities of the case.\" Roberts dealt with the question of whether the admission of hearsay evidence violated the Confrontation Clause, and declared that as long as the hearsay evidence came within a \"firmly rooted hearsay exception\" its admission into evidence in a criminal trial constituted no breach of the clause.", "After Roberts and Craig , however, the Supreme Court held in Crawford v. Washington that \"testimonial\" hearsay could not be considered reliable and admitted into evidence without the safeguard of cross examination. Crawford forecloses subsequent reliance on Roberts ' across-the-board hearsay rule exception when faced with the question of whether a \"testimonial\" deposition may be admitted into evidence at trial. Crawford repudiates the suggestion that Roberts permits anything less than actual confrontation in the case of \"testimonial\" hearsay in the form of a deposition or any other form. The status of Craig 's video and public interest exception is less clear. At least one appellate panel has concluded that the prosecution's need for critical evidence does not alone supply the kind of public policy considerations necessary to qualify for a Craig exception; but another has held that national security interests may suffice. ", "Since the pre- Crawford cases required a good faith effort to assure the defendant's attendance at overseas depositions, it might be argued that Crawford requires no adjustment in the area's jurisprudence. Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit's en banc Craig analysis implied that it thought the use of overseas depositions at trial more compatible with the confrontation clause than the use of video trial testimony. Yet in a later video case, the Fourth Circuit rejected a Confrontation Clause challenge when the circumstances satisfied the dual demands for a Craig exception: (1) denial of a face-to-face confrontation made necessary by important policy considerations, and (2) assurance of reliability in the form of an \"oath, cross-examination, and observation of the witness' demeanor.\" ", "The Federal Rules of Evidence govern the admissibility of evidence in federal criminal trials. A deposition taken overseas that has survived scrutiny under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Confrontation Clause is likely to be found admissible. The hearsay rule, Rule 802, which reflects the law's preference for evidence that is exposed to the adversarial process, poses the most obvious obstacle. The Rule, however, provides an explicit exception for depositions, one that has been applied to depositions taken abroad under the authority of Rule 15."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Security Concerns", "paragraphs": ["When witnesses and other evidence are located in other countries, a defendant's statutory and constitutional rights may conflict with the government's need for secrecy for diplomatic and national security reasons. Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure entitles a defendant to disclosure of any of his statements in the government's possession, but the prosecution's case may have evolved from foreign intelligence gathering. The Sixth Amendment assures a criminal defendant of \"compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,\" but providing a witness who is also a terrorist suspect and in federal custody may have an adverse impact on the witness's value as an intelligence source. The Sixth Amendment promises a criminal defendant the right to confront the witnesses against him, even a witness who presents classified information to the jury.", "Congress has provided the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) as a means of accommodating the conflict of interests. The CIPA permits the court to approve prosecution prepared summaries of classified information to be disclosed to the defendant and introduced in evidence, as a substitute for the classified information. The summaries, however, must be an adequate replacement for the classified information, because ultimately the government's national security interests \"cannot override the defendant's right to a fair trial.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Admissibility of Foreign Documents", "paragraphs": ["There is a statutory procedure designed to ease the evidentiary admission of foreign business records in federal courts. The section covers \"foreign record[s] of regularly conducted activity\" in virtually any form, i.e., any \"memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, maintained in a foreign country.\" It exempts qualified business records from the operation of the hearsay rule in federal criminal proceedings and permits their authentication upon foreign certification. Finally, it establishes a procedure under which the reliability of the documents can be challenged in conjunction with other pre-trial motions. While the prosecution's failure to provide timely notice of its intent to rely upon the section does not necessarily bar admission, its failure to supply a foreign certification of authenticity precludes admission under the section.", "Early appellate decisions upheld Section 3505 in the face of Confrontation Clause challenges, as in the case of depositions drawing support from Ohio v. Roberts . As noted above, Crawford cast doubt upon the continued vitality of the all-encompassing Roberts rule (hearsay poses no confrontation problems as long as it falls within a \"firmly rooted hearsay exception\") when it held that only actual confrontation will suffice in the case of \"testimonial\" hearsay. Although it left for another day a more complete definition of testimonial hearsay, Crawford did note in passing that \"[m]ost of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial\u2014for example business records.\" More than one later court panel has rejected a confrontation clause challenge to Section 3505 on the basis of this distinction."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution grants Congress broad powers to enact laws of extraterritorial scope and imposes few limitations on the exercise of that power.
