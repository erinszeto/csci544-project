The report describes the actions Congress has taken to shape FWS's structure and functions over time and notes selected issues of interest to Congress.", "The current structure of FWS is the result of more than 150 years of agency and departmental reorganizations. FWS began as two agencies: the Office of the Commission of Fish and Fisheries (established as an independent agency in 1871) and the Bureau of the Biological Survey (established in 1885 as an outgrowth of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's [USDA's] Division of Entomology). These two entities evolved into the Bureau of Fisheries (in the Department of Commerce) and the Bureau of Biological Survey in USDA. They were consolidated and established within DOI as the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1939. After that time, the service was further restructured on several occasions through both presidential reorganizations and congressional statutes. The most recent major reorganization took place in 1970, although FWS has continued to evolve pursuant to the passage of additional laws and the addition of new responsibilities. In its current form, FWS contains national, regional, and field offices spread across the United States, including its headquarters in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, eight regional headquarter offices, and other field and FWS-administered sites.", "Pursuant to authorizing statutes, FWS is responsible for a multitude of fish- and wildlife-related activities. These activities include administering the National Wildlife Refuge System; managing migratory bird species; protecting endangered and threatened species; restoring fish species and aquatic habitats; enforcing fish, wildlife, and conservation laws; conducting international conservation efforts; and disbursing financial and technical assistance to states, territories, and Indian tribes for wildlife and sport fish restoration and other activities.", "For example, FWS is responsible for the enforcement of several wildlife-related statutes and international agreements, such as the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71531 et seq.), the Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a73371-3378 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a742-43), and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7703-712). The service administers the National Wildlife Refuge System pursuant to the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7668dd-668ee), as amended, which includes more than 800 million acres of lands and waters that FWS administers through either primary or secondary jurisdiction, including 566 national wildlife refuges as well as other service lands and waters. FWS also manages more than 70 national fish hatcheries, fish health centers, and fish technology centers and oversees the Aquatic Animal Drug Approval Partnership Program. In addition, FWS coordinates both domestic and international conservation activities, including administering multiple international conservation statutes. FWS also is responsible for disbursing financial assistance pursuant to the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (known as the Pittman-Robertson Act; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7669 et seq.) and the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act (commonly known as the Dingell-Johnson Act; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7777 et seq.), as well as State and Tribal Wildlife grants. From FY2014 through FY2018, Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson allocations together provided more than $1 billion annually to states, territories, and DC for wildlife and sport fish restoration and hunter education.", "FWS is funded through a mix of discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Discretionary appropriations, which averaged $1.5 billion annually from FY2009 through FY2018, regularly have been allocated across nine accounts and have supported many of the agency's essential functions. FWS mandatory funding, which averaged $1.2 billion annually from FY2009 through FY2018, predominately has been derived through revenues generated from excise taxes on hunting- and fishing-related equipment.

These include species-specific statutes (e.g., Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act ), general conservation statutes (e.g., Migratory Bird Treaty Act [MBTA] ), and broader wildlife-related statutes (e.g., ESA and Lacey Act). Some statutes, such as the MBTA, which reflects multiple bipartite agreements between the United States and other countries, also serve as implementing legislation for international treaties. ", "Similar to statutes aimed at protecting specific or multiple migratory bird species, habitat protection statutes related to migratory birds protect both domestic (e.g., North American Wetlands Conservation Act [NAWCA] and Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act [commonly known as the Duck Stamp Act] ) and international bird habitats (e.g., NAWCA and Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act ). Habitat protection statutes generate revenues and allocate funds to be used for the acquisition and conservation of migratory bird habitats. For example, the Duck Stamp Act generates revenue through the sale of federal waterfowl hunting stamps, which are required for waterfowl hunters 16 years of age and older. These revenues are deposited into the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund and used to acquire property interests for waterfowl habitat. Certain international treaties also provide for habitat protection, such as the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitats (also known as the RAMSAR Convention), which was ratified by the Senate in 1986. ", "The Migratory Bird Program carries out several actions related to promulgating regulations, providing educational resources, and administering grant programs. For example, FWS annually promulgates rules pertaining to the hunting of migratory birds, as authorized by the MBTA, that establish the framework (e.g., the eligible opening and closing dates) for migratory bird hunting seasons for states and tribes. States are then allowed to determine their hunting seasons and bag limits within the federal framework. Other regulations pertain to permitting activities that fall under the oversight of either the MBTA or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, such as incidental take and depredation permits as well as scientific research and falconry. Depredation permits allow for the regulated take of species protected under migratory bird statutes, for example \"to reduce damage caused by birds or to protect other interest such as human health and safety or personal property.\" The environmental impact and issuance of depredation permits may be contentious among some stakeholders. Additionally, FWS allows stakeholders to take specific species, without requiring an individual depredation permit, through the issuance of a depredation order that is subject to specific restrictions and conditions. ", "The Migratory Bird Program participates in several educational programs to develop \"an understanding of and an appreciation for wildlife and nature.\" The program provides several educational activities and resources to connect youth, parents, educators, and others with migratory bird conservation. These activities include the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program, International Migratory Bird Day, and the Shorebird Sister Schools Program. The education program also provides resources for bird identification and for people interested in bird watching.", "A significant component of the Migratory Bird Program is administering grant programs for bird habitat conservation. In particular, NAWCA, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act, and the Urban Conservation Treaty for Migratory Birds provide resources, including grant funding, to conserve migratory birds and their habitats. These programs support partnerships to conduct habitat restoration projects both domestically and internationally across the Western Hemisphere. Further, by requiring matching funds, these programs seek to leverage federal funds for conservation activities. ", "Several issues related to migratory birds are of general interest to Congress. For example, Congress may be interested in how hunting regulations are established for migratory birds, the extent of migratory bird habitats that are acquired, and the permitting process for the incidental take of species protected by migratory bird statutes. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Conservation", "paragraphs": ["The International Affairs program at FWS \"coordinates domestic and international efforts to protect, restore, and enhance the world's diverse wildlife and their habitats with a focus on species of international concern.\" The program has multiple responsibilities, including administering grant programs, providing technical assistance to wildlife managers in other countries, and helping to conserve foreign and domestic species through the regulation of international trade and wildlife trafficking.", "The International Affairs program derives its authorities through multiple statutes and international agreements. Authorizing statutes, treaties, and agreements take many forms and can focus on wildlife and habitat conservation, individual species, or species groups. Although several of these laws and treaties overlap with other functions of FWS\u2014such as the MBTA, migratory bird bilateral treaties and conventions, CITES, and ESA\u2014others focus on international conservation efforts for specific species or groups of species. For example, the International Affairs program administers funds associated with the African Elephant Conservation Act, Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act, Asian Elephant Conservation Act, Great Ape Conservation Act, and Marine Turtle Conservation Act.", "To conserve these species, FWS partners with and supports a wide array of international partners, including foreign state, educational, nonprofit, and multinational organizations. Each species conservation act is associated with a fund to protect that species or species group, which supports international grants for conservation efforts. These funds typically are provided for in annual discretionary appropriations.", "Although the import of trophies and illegal wildlife trade generally falls under ESA, the Lacey Act, and related statutes, international conservation statutes also can be a mechanism for implementing trade restrictions on certain products (e.g., ivory from African elephants under the African Elephant Conservation Act). As such, Congress may consider international conservation efforts as both mechanisms to promote and fund conservation activities and as ways to address the importation of foreign wildlife products. In addition, the reauthorization of existing international conservation statutes is a common issue of interest for Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Law Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["FWS is responsible for enforcing fish and wildlife conservation laws across the country. FWS law enforcement has a long history dating back to FWS's predecessor agency, the Division of Biological Survey (see \" Agencies Preceding the Fish and Wildlife Service ,\" above). In 1900, Congress enacted the Lacey Act, and the Division of Biological Survey was tasked with enforcing it. The Lacey Act, as amended, \"prohibits the importation, exportation, transportation, sale, or purchase of fish, wildlife, or plants taken or possessed in violation of federal, state, tribal, or foreign laws.\" Since being tasked with enforcing the Lacey Act, FWS's law enforcement mission has expanded to include ", "investigating wildlife crime, habitat destruction, and environmental contamination; combating invasive species; regulating wildlife trade, shipment, importation, and exportation; enforcing federal hunting regulations; protecting endangered species and their critical habitat; and educating the public about federal wildlife and conservation laws. ", "FWS's law enforcement authority is derived from a number of federal wildlife statutes and from the implementation of selected international treaties. (Many of these laws are discussed in other sections of this report, including NWRSAA, Lacey Act, ESA, MMPA, MBTA, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and several of the international conservation agreements.)", "The Office of Law Enforcement operates at the national, regional, and field levels. The national office provides \"oversight, support, policy, and guidance.\" At the regional and field levels, where most personnel are located, special agents and wildlife inspectors execute on-the-ground law investigations and wildlife inspection. Special agents carry out investigations of wildlife trafficking to disrupt illegal trade and dismantle smuggling networks, among other responsibilities. Wildlife inspectors oversee wildlife transiting through U.S. ports. In addition, they are tasked with processing shipments to identify and intercept illegal wildlife in trade before it enters the country or continues in transit.", "The Office of Law Enforcement is distinct from the Refuge Law Enforcement program. Funding for both programs is included under the same appropriation account within the FWS budget, Resource Management, but through different activities (see \" Discretionary Appropriations \" within \" U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Appropriations ,\" below).", "Ensuring that conservation laws are implemented effectively is a perennial issue of interest to Congress. To do so, Congress considers not only questions pertaining to funding the FWS Law Enforcement but also questions of introducing new or amending existing environmental statutes that would modify the responsibilities of law enforcement personnel. For example, these modifications might include altering responsibilities for special agents in the field or wildlife inspectors in ports of entry. Many of the issues of interest to Congress in other programs (such as protected species or international conservation) have the potential to impact the FWS Law Enforcement program.

Grants are available for states, territories, tribes, and DC, though eligibility differs by grant type. Authority for several FWS-administered grant programs is provided in two statutes, the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937 (commonly known as the Pittman-Robertson Act) and the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950 (commonly known as the Dingell-Johnson Act). Authority for the State and Tribal Wildlife grant program is routinely provided through annual appropriations legislation.", "Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson are supported through revenues generated by excise taxes on hunting- and fishing-associated equipment, respectively. These programs are premised on a user-pay, user-benefit model, in which taxes on hunting equipment support hunting-related activities and wildlife restoration and taxes on fishing and related equipment support boating-related activities and sport fish restoration. Revenues generated from these taxes are deposited into trust funds administered by the Department of the Treasury and used to provide for mandatory appropriations to support the respective grant programs. Funding is allocated to states and territories (and, in the case of Dingell-Johnson, to Washington, DC) according to program-apportionment formulas. ", "Pittman-Robertson provides funding for wildlife restoration and hunter education and safety programs. Dingell-Johnson provides funding for sport fish restoration and other activities. Sport fish restoration accounts for approximately 58% of funding from the Dingell-Johnson fund (excluding administration and multistate grants); the remaining 42% supports boating access and infrastructure, aquatic education, and coastal and wetland conservation, among other uses. Both acts provide funding for administration and multistate conservation grant programs. Since their enactment, Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson have provided nearly $21 billion dollars in financial assistance for states, territories, and DC for wildlife restoration, hunter safety and education, and sport fish restoration, not including other Dingell-Johnson uses (see Figure 5 ). From FY2014 through FY2018, these programs were provided a combined total of more than $1 billion annually, on average, for wildlife and sport fish restoration and hunter education.", "State and Tribal Wildlife grants are used to support state fish and wildlife agencies and tribal governments in developing and implementing plans and programs that benefit wildlife and its habitat. Historically, state assistance has been disbursed in two parts, one based on a formula and one based on a competitive grant process. Tribal grants are awarded based on an application process, which is open to federally recognized tribes. ", "Congress routinely considers issues related to wildlife and sport fish restoration grants. Members of Congress regularly introduce legislation to amend Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson, including bills that would alter what types of activities are funded, the allocation of funding, and the sources of funding.
