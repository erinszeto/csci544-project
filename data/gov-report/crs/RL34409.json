Recent years have seen a rise in the use of this information for marketing and even for criminal purposes. The purchase and sale of telephone record information, therefore, became a booming business. Websites and data brokers claiming to be able to obtain the phone records for any phone number within a few days abounded. However, the methods by which these data brokers obtained their information came under intense fire from public interest groups concerned about consumer privacy.", "Consumer groups and news outlets reported that telephone records were being obtained fraudulently by data brokers or other individuals without the knowledge or consent of the customers to whom the records related. Data brokers are thought to employ three different practices to obtain customer telephone records without the approval of the customer. The first method occurs when an employee of one of the phone companies sells the records to the data broker. The second method occurs through a practice called \"pretexting,\" where a data broker pretends to be the owner of the phone and obtains the records from the telephone company under false pretenses. The third method is employed when a data broker obtains the customer's telephone records by accessing the customer's account on the Internet.", "In response to increased concern over the unauthorized disclosure of private telephone records, Congress and other regulatory agencies have taken a number of steps to improve the security of this information. Congress enacted the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006, which makes \"pretexting\" a federal offense. The Federal Trade Commission has instituted a number of enforcement actions against data brokers. And the FCC recently amended its regulations governing the disclosure of Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) in an attempt to address the concerns raised by Congress, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), and other consumer groups regarding the unauthorized disclosure of such information.", "This report discusses recent efforts to protect the privacy of customer telephone records and efforts to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure, or sale of such records by data brokers. In addition, it provides a brief overview of the confidentiality protections for customer information established by the Communications Act of 1934. It does not discuss the legal framework for the disclosure by telephone companies of phone records to the government.

Specifically, EPIC and other commenters pointed out that data brokers advertise the availability of cell phone records, which include calls to and from a particular cell phone number, the duration of such calls, and may include the physical location of the cell phone. In addition to selling cell phone call records, many data brokers also claimed to provide calling records for landline and Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phones, as well as nonpublished phone numbers. Data brokers claimed to be able to provide this information fairly quickly, in a few hours to a few days.", "Although personal information such as Social Security numbers can be found on public documents, phone records are stored only by phone companies. For this reason, data brokers are alleged to have obtained phone records from the phone companies themselves, albeit without their approval. It is also believed that data brokers had taken advantage of inadequate company security standards to gain access to customer telephone information. Data brokers are thought to employ three different practices to obtain customer telephone records without the approval of the customer. The first method occurs when an employee of one of the phone companies sells the records to the data broker. The second method occurs through a practice called \"pretexting,\" where a data broker pretends to be the owner of the phone and obtains the records from the telephone company under false pretenses. The third method is employed when a data broker obtains the customer's telephone records by accessing the customer's account on the Internet.", "Pretext calling for customer telephone records occurs when the data broker or investigator pretends to be the cell phone account holder and persuades phone company employees to release the information. The public availability of personal identifiers, like the Social Security number, made it easier for someone to impersonate the account holder to convince the employee that they were the account holder. For this reason, it was suggested that phone companies cease the use of readily available biographical information, like the Social Security number, for identity authentication.", "Telephone companies are encouraging customers to receive electronic statements and to access customer accounts online. Typically, online accounts are set up in advance, to be activated at a later date by the customer. If someone can figure out how to activate and access the online account of the customer, the call records can be obtained.", "In response to these concerns, Congress, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have acted to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of phone records.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit struck down those rules, finding that they violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution.", "In response to the Tenth Circuit's remand, the FCC amended its CPNI regulations to require telecommunications carriers to receive opt-in (affirmative) consent before disclosing CPNI to third parties or affiliates that do not provide communications-related services. However, carriers were permitted to disclose CPNI to affiliated parties, joint venture partners, and independent contractors after obtaining a customer's \"opt-out\" consent. \"Opt-Out\" consent means that the telephone company sends the customer a notice saying it will consider the customer to have given approval to use the customer's information for marketing unless the customer tells it not to do so (usually within 30 days.)", "On April 2, 2007, the FCC issued an order amending its Customer Proprietary Network Information Regulations and largely accepting EPIC's proposed changes. The revised rules broaden the opt-in requirement for sharing CPNI with third parties and affiliated entities that do not provide a telecommunications service to include joint venture partners and independent contractors as well. Opt-out consent remains acceptable for sharing CPNI with affiliates that provide telecommunications services. Carriers are required, prior to soliciting the customer's approval, to provide notice of the customer's right to restrict use, disclosure, and access to the customer's CPNI.", "Carriers are also required to establish safeguards to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of CPNI. To that end, carriers must maintain records that track access to customer CPNI records. The FCC also has implemented carrier authentication requirements for the disclosure of call detail information under which carriers are not allowed to release call detail information during a customer-initiated phone call, except when the customer provides a pre-established password. If the customer does not or cannot provide the password, the carrier may release the call detail information only by sending the information to the address of record for the account or through backup authentication methods that do not use readily available biographical information (such as a social security number, or mother's maiden name). Carriers also must establish passwords for online account access. Carriers must provide notice to customers whenever changes to their accounts occur, as well as adhere to a notification process for both law enforcement and affected customers in the event of unauthorized or improper disclosure of CPNI.", "Each carrier is also required to certify annually its compliance with the CPNI regulations and to make this certification publicly available.

To impose such a forfeiture penalty, the Commission must issue a notice of apparent liability, and the person against whom the notice has been issued must have an opportunity to show, in writing, why no such forfeiture penalty should be imposed.

On February 13, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit upheld the FCC's order. NCTA did not challenge the constitutionality of Section 222 of the Communications Act, therefore, it was assumed by both parties that some form of disclosure prevention is constitutionally permissible. The only question left for the court was whether the FCC's order implementing Section 222 comported with the First Amendment. The court held that it did because it advanced the government's substantial interest in protecting consumer privacy and did so in a way that was \"no more expansive than necessary\" to serve that interest. The court noted that, for First Amendment purposes, opt-in is only marginally more intrusive than opt-out, and a scheme similar to the one at issue in this case was upheld in the consumer credit context. Turning to the alleged procedural violations in the promulgation of the order, the court found that the FCC had based its decision to return to a limited opt-in regime on reasoned analysis and substantial evidence. Therefore, the agency had not violated the Administrative Procedure Act. "], "subsections": []}]}}
