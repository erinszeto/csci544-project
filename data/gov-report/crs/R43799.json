Committee rules, even if they have not been amended, must be revalidated in each Congress as provided in Rule XXVI.", "Committee rules cover a variety of subjects\u2014from meeting dates to quorums to processing nominations. Some Senate rules that are reflected in committees' rules must be followed, such as the rule that requires a majority of a committee to be physically present to report a measure or matter. Other committee rules, such as those concerning the relationship between a committee and its subcommittees, are largely within the discretion of each committee to design.", "From a chair's perspective, a committee's rules authorize the chair to act on a variety of matters. However, the rules might provide the chair with a different authority for each matter. A chair might be able to act on his or her own authority on one matter but need the concurrence of the ranking minority member on another matter. In one instance, a chair may be able to act quickly, but in another instance the chair might be required to give notice prior to taking an action. Each committee's rules have evolved distinctively, and different degrees of discretion or limitation in each committee's rules govern each action that a chair might take.", "From the minority's perspective, a committee's rules govern the minority's role in agenda setting, decision making, and procedural prerogatives. Committees' rules vary in what role they provide the minority in selecting witnesses, placing matters on the agenda, forming a quorum, bringing a matter to a vote, authorizing subpoenas, and so on.", "From an individual committee member's perspective, a committee's rules allocate authority between the chair and ranking minority member and between the chair and the committee's members. In many rules, the chair, or the chair with the concurrence of the ranking minority member, may make decisions, such as reducing the notice of a meeting or waiving other requirements in the committee's rules related to holding a meeting. In other rules, decisions may be made only by action of the committee.", "Just as in the Senate, many actions in committees are taken by unanimous consent. Unanimous consent may allow some or many committee rules to be set aside. It might also be used to create ad hoc procedures that accommodate committee members on a particular piece of legislation or for a specific meeting or to facilitate a committee's conduct of business. Before agreeing to unanimous consent, a committee member might wish to understand the specific committee rules and committee member prerogatives being set aside.", "In cataloguing and comparing the breadth of 114th Congress Senate committee rules on legislative and executive business, this report provides the reader with a guide to the variety of committee rules.

If the Senate establishes a committee after February 1 of the first year of a new Congress, the rules of that committee must be published in the Congressional Record not later than 60 days after the establishment of the committee. A committee's rules must be \"not inconsistent\" with the Senate's rules. (Rule XXVI, paragraph 2.)", "A committee typically adopts the rules that were in effect in the previous Congress, with any change agreed to by the committee usually being incremental. A committee's rules develop over time and fit the jurisdiction, practices, and culture of a committee, leaving little reason for major changes, even when control of the Senate changes. A change in a Senate rule or standing order might cause committees to reexamine their rules.", "Many Senate rules, standing orders, and other decisions of the Senate, such as committee funding, affect committees' conduct of their legislative and executive business.

", "A number of committees specifically acknowledged the primacy of Senate rules in their own rules. These were the Committees on Armed Services; Energy and Natural Resources; Foreign Relations; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; Veterans' Affairs; and Indian Affairs. Some of these committees' rules also acknowledged the preeminence of Senate resolutions and the Legislative Reorganization Acts of 1946 and 1970. The Foreign Relations Committee, in addition, made its Rule I its jurisdictional statement from Rule XXV, paragraph 1(j). Most committees appended their jurisdictional statements to their rules.", "In addition to their rules, some committees have adopted resolutions, manuals, and other guidance that may affect their operations.", "The primary legislative function of the standing committees of the U.S. Senate is to evaluate the thousands of bills and resolutions that Senators introduce in each two-year Congress, which are normally referred upon introduction to the appropriate committee, and measures passed by the House. Senate committees also annually evaluate thousands of executive nominations, and the Foreign Relations Committee has jurisdiction over treaties submitted by the President for the advice and consent of the Senate.
