Gradually, Congress has expanded the term national defense, as defined in the DPA, so that it now includes activities related to homeland security and domestic emergency management.

Title III: Expansion of Productive Capacity and Supply, which allows the President to incentivize the domestic industrial base to expand the production and supply of critical materials and goods. Authorized incentives include loans, loan guarantees, direct purchases and purchase commitments, and the authority to procure and install equipment in private industrial facilities. Title VII: General Provisions, which includes key definitions for the DPA and several distinct authorities, including the authority to establish voluntary agreements with private industry; the authority to block proposed or pending foreign corporate mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers that threaten national security; and the authority to employ persons of outstanding experience and ability and to establish a volunteer pool of industry executives who could be called to government service in the interest of the national defense.", "The authorities of the DPA are generally afforded to the President in statute. The President, in turn, has delegated these authorities to department and agency heads in Executive Order 13603, National Defense Resource Preparedness, issued in 2012. While the authorities are most frequently used by, and commonly associated with, the Department of Defense, they can be, and have been, used by numerous other executive departments and agencies. The DPA lies within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.", "Nearly all DPA authorities will terminate on September 30, 2014, though a few, such as the Exon-Florio Amendment (which established government review of the acquisition of U.S. companies by foreigners) and anti-trust protections for certain voluntary industry agreements, have been made permanent. Since 1950, the DPA has been reauthorized over 50 times, though significant authorities were terminated from the original law in 1953.

Much of this authority lapsed at the end of that war, but the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union in the late 1940s and the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June of 1950 caused the Truman Administration to reconsider the need for stronger executive authority in the interest of national defense.", "A number of factors encouraged President Truman to propose such legislation. Both the armed services and the defense industry supporting the nation's effort during World War II had demobilized during the late 1940s after the cessation of hostilities. With the return of peace, the Administration cut back military expenditures significantly. President Truman accentuated these cuts by placing heavy reliance on atomic weapons to provide for the nation's defense. The perceived power of the atomic arsenal justified, in the eyes of the Administration, substantial cuts in expensive, manpower-intensive conventional military capabilities. This enabled the President to propose and Congress to pass much-reduced defense appropriations.", "In addition, the nation had recently experienced substantial economic and industrial turmoil. Demand for housing and consumer products, unleashed by the expiration of wartime economic controls, precipitated a series of postwar labor strikes. These reached their height in 1946 in a nationwide shutdown of passenger and freight rail service, leading President Truman to threaten to seize control of the railways and draft striking rail workers into the Armed Forces, placing them under military discipline. Though the presidential threats were never carried out, the strike served to illustrate the economic context in which the nation approached the Korean War.", "The original DPA, enacted on September 8, 1950, granted broad authority to the President to control national economic policy. Containing seven separate titles, the DPA allowed the President, among other powers, to demand that manufacturers give priority to defense production, to requisition materials and property, to expand government and private defense production capacity, to ration consumer goods, to fix wage and price ceilings, to force settlement of some labor disputes, to control consumer credit and regulate real estate construction credit and loans, to provide certain antitrust protections to industry, and to establish a voluntary reserve of private sector executives who would be available for emergency federal employment.", "Four of the seven titles (Titles II, IV, V, and VI), which were those related to requisitioning, rationing, wage and price fixing, labor disputes, and credit controls and regulation, terminated in 1953 when Congress allowed them to lapse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Committee Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["Though commonly associated with industrial production for the Department of Defense (DOD), the DPA currently lies within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Prior to 1975, House rules did not permit simultaneous referral of bills to two or more committees. Precedents in both chambers did not allow divided or joint referrals, regardless of bill content. Instead, bills were assigned to committees based on the preponderance of their subject matter. Because much of the President's proposal dealt with economic policy, what became the Defense Production Act was assigned in 1950 to the House and Senate Committees on Banking and Currency (their successors are the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs). Although the parts of the act dealing with the requisitioning of materials, wages and prices, labor, and credit are no longer in force, these committees have retained jurisdiction.", "In addition to the standing committees of jurisdiction, the original statute created a Joint Committee on Defense Production. This committee was composed of selected members from the standing Committees on Banking and Currency of the Senate and House. This committee was intended to review the programs established by the DPA and advise the standing committees whenever they drafted legislation on the subject. The Joint Committee has not existed, in effect, since 1977 when salaries and expenses for the committee were last funded, although the provision in the DPA establishing the Joint Committee on Defense Production was only officially repealed in 1992."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of DPA Reauthorizations", "paragraphs": ["The DPA has been amended and reauthorized numerous times since its original enactment.

The Defense Production Act, like the War Power Acts that preceded it, included a sunset provision that has required periodic reauthorization and offered the opportunity for amendment. Congress passed the DPA in 1950 and has thus far reauthorized it 51 times, including many short-term \"stop-gap\" extensions. From time to time, the DPA has expired without Congress passing a law reauthorizing and extending the termination date of the DPA. However, in such circumstances, Congress has often ultimately passed a law retroactively setting the effective date for the law to the previous expiration date. Most notably, for example, the DPA expired on October 20, 1990, and was not reauthorized until August 17, 1991. However, upon passage of P.L. 102-99 , the effective date of the law was set to October 20, 1990.", "The DPA was most recently reauthorized by the 111 th Congress.

The declaration was also amended to include \"biomass\" and \"more efficient energy storage and distribution technologies\" as forms of renewable energy to augment domestic energy supplies to further assure the adequate maintenance of the domestic industrial base.

Under the language of the DPA, a person (including corporations, as defined in statute) is required to accept prioritized contracts/orders, though regulations implementing Title I authorities provide practical exemptions to this mandate. The limited allowances for when a person is required to or may optionally reject a prioritized order can be superseded by the direction of the implementing federal department. In executing a contract under the DPA, a contractor is not liable for actions taken to comply with governing rules, regulations, and orders (e.g., prioritization requirements), including any rules, regulations, or orders later declared legally invalid. The government can also prioritize the performance of contracts between two private parties, such as a contract between a prime contractor and a subcontractor, if needed to fulfill a priority contract and promote the national defense.", "Title I also allows the President to allocate or control the general distribution of materials, services, and facilities. Allocation authority relates historically to the controlled materials programs of World War II, when the distribution of critical materials and resources had to be managed to maximize the production of goods needed in the war effort. This authority is rarely used today, and is currently only implemented for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, under which the DOD may augment its airlift capability with civilian aircraft during a national defense related crisis.", "There are several notable restrictions to the priorities and allocation authority.

These prioritized contracts are typically issued under the DOC's delegated authority with respect to materials, services, and facilities, including construction materials, and under its regulations guiding the use of this authority. Some notable examples of DOD's use of Title I priorities authority include supporting the development of the Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles. While the priorities authority is used far less frequently by other departments and agencies, it has been used for both the prevention of terrorism and natural disaster preparedness.

A direct loan is a loan from the federal government to another government or private sector borrower that requires repayment, with or without interest. A loan guarantee allows the federal government to guarantee a loan made by a non-federal lender to a non-federal borrower, either by pledging to pay back all or part of the loan in the instance that the borrower is unable to do so.

Similarly, the statute specifies that the authority to investigate, subpoena, and otherwise collect information necessary to administer the provisions of the act, as provided by Section 705 of the DPA, will not expire until two years after the termination of the DPA.", "If the DPA were to expire, there are other permanently authorized authorities that may serve as a partial substitute for the Title I priorities and allocations authority. Most prominently, Section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 allows the President to place orders with any person for \"articles and materials\" and require that person to \"give precedence\" to that order above all others in the interest of national security. However, as has been discussed in congressional testimony by executive branch officials, this Selective Service Act authority is more limited than the DPA's priorities and allocations authority in that it only applies to orders of materials intended for the armed forces or atomic energy programs (instead of the broad national defense definition of the DPA), and that it does not offer liability protection for recipients of the prioritized orders (as is offered by Section 707 of the DPA). Additionally, through two more statutes, the President is authorized only in a time of war or when war is \"imminent\" to place priority orders for supplies necessary for the armed forces, or even assume full or partial control of factories producing such items, so long as persons are justly compensated for their loss. ", "Frequently, Congress has elected to reauthorize the DPA by extending the termination date provided in Section 717 for a limited period, such as a year, without making significant amendments to the overall statute. In other circumstances, Congress has reauthorized the law by extending the Section 717 date for several years while also amending the other provisions of the law. In either circumstance, reauthorizations have typically been presented as discrete bills, though on occasion the DPA has been reauthorized through a provision in a larger legislative vehicle such as the National Defense Authorization Act. For a chronology of all laws reauthorizing the DPA since inception, see Table A-4 .", "The laws discussed above reauthorized the DPA by explicitly amending the termination clause in Section 717. It may also be possible to implicitly extend the DPA termination clause by appropriating funds for carrying out the provisions of the DPA that would be available after the termination date had been reached. For example, if appropriations for FY2015 were enacted which did not explicitly amend Section 717, but provided funds for activities conducted pursuant to the expiring provisions of the DPA, it is likely that this FY2015 appropriation would be read as implicitly suspending the September 30, 2014, termination date for the duration of the appropriated funds. Finding an implicit suspension would avoid creating a situation in which Congress would have made a meaningless appropriation of funds for purposes that cannot be fulfilled. In addition to a full-year FY2015 spending law, an implicit suspension of the termination date could also arise in the context of a shorter-term continuing resolution. However, in previous instances where a continuing resolution did not provide funds, either in the text of the resolution itself or as incorporated by reference, specifically for a program that would expire, no implicit suspension of that expiration date was found.", "The rationale for finding an implicit suspension of the termination clause appears to be strongest in scenarios where Congress appropriates funding that would not become available until after the termination date would have elapsed. For example, in the situation described in the previous paragraph, the hypothetical funding provided in a full-year FY2015 appropriation or a continuing resolution would become available at the beginning of FY2015, after the DPA provisions had sunset at the end of FY2014. The argument for implicit suspension of the termination date is not as strong where appropriations for DPA activities precede the termination date but the availability of those funds extend beyond it. For example, appropriations for DPA activities in preceding fiscal years are typically \"available until expended.\" As \"no-year\" money, that temporal availability of those funds would theoretically extend beyond the termination date. However, GAO has previously opined that, in the case of a termination of authority, \"no new obligations may be incurred after the termination date as a charge against the agency's appropriation even if funds remain from an appropriation made available to the agency prior to the termination date.\" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "H.R. 4809", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 4809 passed the House under suspension of the rules on July 29, 2014.

The remaining sections of the bill would reform existing provisions of the DPA.", "Section 2 of the bill would make several revisions to the Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC), which was established in the Reauthorization of 2009 and is currently authorized in Section 722 of the DPA. First, Section 2 would restate the general purpose of the DPAC. Originally, the committee was created to advise the President on the effective use of the full scope of authorities of the act. The bill would instead redirect this to coordination and planning for the use of Title I priorities and allocations authority within the executive branch. Notably, this proposed change would likely result in the abolishment of several \"industrial capability assessment study groups\" created under DPAC authority. Second, Section 2 would supersede the rotating chair system for the DPAC, which was established by presidential memorandum. Under the existing procedure, the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security rotate annually in the DPAC chair. Instead, the bill would direct the President to appoint as chair the \"head of the agency to which the President has delegated primary responsibility for government-wide coordination of the authorities in this Act.\" As currently established in E.O. 13603 delegations, the Secretary of Homeland Security appears to be the most likely chair-designate, but the language of the proposed bill could allow the President to appoint another Secretary. Third, Section 2 of the bill would require the chair to appoint a person to coordinate all committee activities. Finally, Section 2 of the bill would revise the annual reporting requirements of the DPAC to emphasize Title I priority and allocation authority and to require the report to include updated copies of Title I-related rules.", "Section 3 of the bill accentuates the Title I rulemaking requirement first directed in the Reauthorization of 2009 by requiring delegated agencies with Title I authority to issue and annually review their final rules. Of the six departments to which the President delegated Title I authority, only three (Commerce, Energy, and Transportation) had issued final rules as of June 10, 2014. The Departments of Agriculture, Defense, and Health and Human Services have not yet completed final rules.", "Section 4 of the bill would revise the Title III, Section 303 authority of the DPA. First, Section 4(a) of the bill would require the President, on a non-delegable basis, to provide written explanatory materials on how actions taken under Section 303 would meet several presidential determinations required by law (that the actions are essential to the national defense and that sufficient commercial production and supply of the good would otherwise not be available). Current law allows these determinations to be delegated beyond the President. In recent practice, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics has been responsible for making these determinations and for submitting signed explanatory materials to the committees of jurisdiction. Section 4(a) would also reinstitute two provisions, with minor revisions, that were removed from the law in the Reauthorization of 2009. In addition to the existing conditions in Section 303(a)(5) of the DPA that must be determined to be met before using Section 303 authorities, the President would be required to determine that the actions taken are \"the most cost effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need.\" ", "Further, Section 4(a) of the bill would reinstitute another deleted provision. That provision required that, should the aggregate cost of planned actions taken to address an industrial base shortfall under Section 303 exceed $50 million, those actions must first be authorized by an act of Congress. This monetary limitation on action was removed from law in the Reauthorization of 2009 and replaced with a general notification to the committees of jurisdiction for projects estimated to cost more than $50 million. The proposed revision would require the President to both notify the committees of jurisdiction and obtain authorization in an act of Congress before taking actions in excess of $50 million to address a manufacturing capacity or supply shortfall. ", "Section 4(b) of the bill would retroactively exempt any existing Title III project (i.e., one that has already been determined to meet requirements of the law) from the requirements of the proposed Section 4(a). In other words, if actions to address a shortfall for any existing project do not exceed $50 million currently, but ultimately do so in the future, that project would not require direct authorization from Congress.", "In their totality, the revisions made by Section 4 of the bill, if enacted, may partially limit exiting Section 303 authority. For example, if the bill is enacted as currently written, Congress would be able to refuse authorization to new Title III projects and actions that would push the aggregate cost above the $50 million threshold. However, the President would retain the ability to waive these requirements in periods of national emergency or if the actions are necessary to avert a shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.", "Section 5 of the bill would revise the existing \"such sums as necessary\" authorization of appropriations found in Section 711 of Title VII of the DPA. Instead, the bill would authorize the appropriation of $133 million per fiscal year, starting in FY2015, to carry out the provisions and purposes of the Defense Production Act. Past appropriations to the DPA Fund are listed in Table 1 , which shows that the annual average direct appropriation to the DPA Fund between FY2010 and FY2014 was $127.7 million, with a high of $223.5 million in FY2013 and a low of $34.3 million in FY2011.
