Military work facilities, particularly those overseas and those by the National Guard and Reserves, are perceived by manyas being deteriorated and underfunded. Recently, Congress has often appropriated more inconstruction funds than the Administration has requested. Congress has similarly augmented budgetrequests for military family housing appropriations. The FY2002 military construction bill exceedsthe requested amount by 5.3%.", "An additional key issue is the future of the Efficient Facilities Initiative (EFI). DOD recommended legislation on August 3 to initiate a worldwide assessment of military installationrequirements, based on the results of the current Quadrennial Defense Review, and a subsequentround of base closures and realignments. The legislation as submitted would permanently authorizethe service secretaries to convey base property to local or state government or private enterprise andlease back what is necessary for military use.

Defense construction spending soared as facilities were hardenedagainst potential nuclear attack, missile silos were constructed, and other infrastructure was built.The appropriations committees established military construction subcommittees to deal with thisnew level of activity, and the separate military construction bill was created.

Subcommittee hearings have discussed at length the applicationof military construction funds to housing and workplace improvements at basesoverseas and within the continental United States.

Foran in-depth discussion of the privatization of housing see CRS Report RL31039(pdf) , Military Housing Privatization Initiative: Background and Issues , by [author name scrubbed].", "Requested Congressional Additions to the Military Construction Budget. In recent years, some analysts have criticizedthe military construction appropriations process for being prone to the insertion ofunwanted and unnecessary undertakings. Others, though, have supported theaddition of construction projects not requested by the Department of Defense asbeing necessary for military viability. An historical comparison shows that thedivergence between DOD budget requests and congressional appropriationenactments originated relatively recently and has mainly affected the less than 20 %of military construction funding dedicated to the National Guard and Reserves (see Table 5 at the end of this report).", "Military construction funding since the mid 1980s can be broken into three distinct periods: prior to fiscal year 1989; fiscal years 1989 - 1994; and fiscal year1995 to the present. Before FY1989, the relationship between funding requested bythe Administration and budget authority enacted by Congress appeared stable.Congress typically appropriated approximately 80 % of DOD requests for militaryconstruction funds. Beginning with FY1989, Regular (i.e., active duty) componentfunding continued in the established pattern, but Reserve component requests (whichinclude the federal reserves and the Army and Air National Guard) took a sudden andsharp downturn (see Figures 1 and 2 ). Congress responded by adding morethan35% to that year's budget Reserve component submission. This gap between reserveconstruction requests and appropriations has remained and widened. Finally, withFY1995, the pattern of funding for the Regular forces inverted. Although presidentialrequests reversed their downward direction and began to rise, Congress began toappropriate more than was requested and has continued to do so to the present.", "Environmental Remediation on Closed Military Bases. The continuing costs associated with the four completedBRAC rounds, funded through the military construction appropriation, are nowreduced to covering environmental and other caretaker efforts. Funding requestedand appropriated for BRAC fell sharply from a high of $3,898 million for FY1996to a low of $664 million for FY2000 as closure and realignment wound down. (4) Thecost of environmental remediation contributed to a $1,024 million FY2001 BRACappropriation, of which $865 million was dedicated to base environmental cleanup.", "Members of the Senate Appropriations and Armed Services Committees, in hearings held a few days after the submission of the President's amended FY2002budget request, noted that Department of Defense had requested only $532 millionin BRAC funds at a time when the Navy and Air Force had announced a combinedshortfall of between $140 million and $150 million in immediate BRAC cleanupneeds. (5) DOD witnesses responded by indicating thatthe request would be sufficientfor upcoming requirements, explaining that the shortfall estimates had been based ona set of assumptions that were no longer thought to be accurate.", "The upturn in expenditures had come about through recent legal requirements and agreements between the services and local communities. DOD expected theinsufficiency to be satisfied through transfers of unused funds from other accountsand by adjustments in the end-use of some property that would significantly reducethe cost of needed remediation. The passed bill added more than $100 million inBRAC funds to the request, primarily for remediation of the environmental impactof the 1995 round of base realignments and closures.", "The Efficient Facilities Initiative (EFI). The Efficient Facilities Initiative (EFI) was announced by theDepartment of Defense on August 2, and the Department's General Counselsubmitted proposed legislation to Congress on August 3. The EFI includes threemajor actions: the potential realignment and closure of U.S. military installationsoverseas; the potential realignment and closure of installations within the UnitedStates; and the permanent authorization of the Brooks Air Force Base DevelopmentDemonstration Project, expanded to include all military services.", "In support of the first action, the Secretary of Defense has instructed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to undertake a thorough assessment of alloverseas military installations based on the results of the upcoming QuadrennialDefense Review (QDR). His recommendations on the retention, realignment orclosing of bases are due to the Secretary six months after the completion of the QDR.", "In support of the second action, the Secretary will likewise use the results of the QDR to generate a list of recommended actions regarding the future of militaryinstallations within the United States and its territories. The proposed legislationsuggests the establishment of a review commission and a process for endorsing theSecretary's recommendations for submission to the President and Congress. Both ofthese differ somewhat from the BRAC process of the 1990s. (6)", "For an understanding of the third action, one must look to recent activity at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas. The Brooks Air Force Base DevelopmentDemonstration Project (also known as the \"Base Efficiency Project,\" or the \"BrooksCity-Base Project\") is a partnership between the Secretary of the Air Force and theCity of San Antonio, Texas, and represents an alternative to traditional base closingsor realignments. Congress has authorized the Secretary to \"convert any military orcivil service appropriated or non-appropriated fund activity at Brooks Air Force Base,Texas, into a contracted activity or an exchange of services compensated for by thelease, sale, conveyance, or transfer of real or private property.\" (7) This has empoweredthe Secretary to convey, in exchange for appropriate compensation, the whole ofFederal real property at Brooks to the city and to lease back for military use thoseparts which directly support the base's military mission. (8) The cost of maintainingand operating the facility's physical plant, including fire and police protection,upkeep, and the like, is effectively transferred along with ownership from theDepartment of Defense to the local community. Funds generated from the lease orsale of property, reimbursements, and so on, is placed in a special Project Fund,which the Secretary of the Air Force may employ for operations, leaseback,maintenance and repair of Department facilities, and other uses at Brooks. (9)", "EFI proponents have maintained that conducting a single definitive round of base closures and realignments could relieve communities of uncertainty about theirfuture. Proponents further contend that a review commission with restricted abilityto change the Secretary of Defense's recommendations might reduce the potential forpolitics to influence its outcome; and that joining the military departments with localand state governments and private enterprise could significantly reduce the need formilitary construction and defense appropriations. Critics, though, have suggestedthat the selection of the commission's members and the method used for creating thelist of recommendations may actually repoliticize the BRAC process, and haveasserted that benefits to the defense budget accrued to date from the Brooks projectare hypothetical.", "Real Property Costs, the Broader Picture. With military construction comes maintenance. Plantmaintenance, adequately funded and conscientiously carried out, preventsdeterioration and reduces the need for replacement. As a facility ages, though, ittends to demand greater effort and expense to maintain it in usable condition.Inadequate maintenance accelerates facility deterioration, requiring early demolitionand replacement. Construction and maintenance, therefore, are closely related, andthe effort expended on one will have a direct effect on the other.", "Much of the funding for\"real property maintenance\" (RPM) is contained within the Operations and Maintenance function of the Defense budget, which falls withinthe jurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittees of the Appropriations Committees. (10) Figure 3 gives a graphic representation of the relative sizes of the MilitaryConstruction and RPM appropriations for FY2001.", "RPM funding includes not only repairs and maintenance for existing structures, but also \"minor construction\" (projects whose costs do not exceed $500,000). TheFY2001 Defense budget request included $5,325.6 million for real propertymaintenance and repair and $251.1 million for minor construction. Even that totaldoes not capture the full cost incurred in maintaining DOD real property. To gain amore complete picture, one should add items not easily broken out from the generalbudget submission, such as the pay and benefits of military personnel assigned toRPM activities (installation maintenance, for example), projects financed throughDOD Working Capital Funds, and construction supported through DOD Research,Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. (11) Therefore, the finalcost to the Department of Defense of building, maintaining, and operating itsholdings in real property is extremely difficult to capture in its entirety.", "Conflicting Priorities and Construction Funding. Overall Administration proposals for military constructionfunding have fallen in nearly every year since the mid-1980s. Nevertheless, until themid-1990s, Congress consistently granted significantly less budget authority to theDepartment of Defense than had been requested by the Administration (see Figure4 ).", "This pattern of partial funding reversed with the FY1995 budget. The Administration's FY1994 Military Construction budget request was $4,007 million,while Congress authorized $3,787.9 million. (12) The FY1995 request fell to $2,240.2million, to which Congress added $431.9 million. (13) Every year since then, Congresshas added significant amounts to the Administration requests, countering whatMembers have termed \"inadequate\" funding for military construction.", "Three related explanations have been given for recent congressional actions. First, some Members of the military construction subcommittees have argued thatmilitary construction has been chronically underfunded. This viewpoint wasreiterated in hearings on the FY2001 and 2002 budgets and the reports from theHouse Appropriations Committee and the defense authorizing committees on billsfor FY1998-2000.", "Second, Congress often has different priorities than the Administration, as reflected in frequent congressional cuts to overseas construction requests andcontributions to the NATO Security Investment Program and its predecessor, theNATO Infrastructure Program (see Figure 5 ). (14)", "Third, although Congress has found the President's overall requests for militaryconstruction insufficient, Members have deemed DOD treatment of the Army andAir National Guard and the federal reserves particularly so. (15) Until the late 1980s,the amount of military construction funds appropriated by Congress for the Guardand Reserve rose steadily, closely matching the amounts requested by DOD. ForFY1989, though, the Administration requested $472.9 million in militaryconstruction for the Guard and Reserve, a decrease of $106.4 million from theprevious year. Congress responded by appropriating $605.1 million. Senator Bondcommented during floor debate on FY1996 military construction appropriations thatMembers believed that the Pentagon artificially lowered the amount of budgetauthority requested, counting on Congress to add money to Guard and Reserveprograms. Since FY1989, Congress has consistently appropriated more than theAdministration request, and the gap between request and enactment has grownconsiderably.
