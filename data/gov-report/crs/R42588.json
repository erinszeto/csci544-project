The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for all accounts subject to the annual appropriations process at the Departments of Labor (DOL) and Education (ED). It provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture bill). The L-HHS-ED bill also provides funding for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration.", "Continuing Resolutions: On March 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6).

With limited exceptions, the full-year CR generally funds discretionary L-HHS-ED programs at their FY2012 levels, minus an across-the-board rescission of 0.2% per Section 3004, as interpreted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The full-year CR superseded a six-month CR for FY2013 (P.L. 112-175) that had been enacted on September 28, 2012.

The order called for an across-the-board cut of 5.0% for non-exempt nondefense discretionary funding, 2.0% for certain Medicare funding (per a special rule), and 5.1% for other non-exempt nondefense mandatory funding. Because the sequester was ordered before the enactment of the FY2013 full-year CR, OMB calculated the amounts to be sequestered based on annualized funding levels in place under the six-month FY2013 CR (P.L. 112-175).
