As a result, Foreign Operations spending measures developedby the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyondspending issues and played a major role in shaping, authorizing, and guiding bothexecutive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives. It hasbeen largely through Foreign Operations appropriations that the United States hasmodified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the Cold War. The legislation has also been the channel through which the President has utilizedforeign aid as a tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of September 11,2001.

Foreignaid spending increased slightly in FY1998, but beginning the following year andcontinuing to the present, Foreign Operations appropriations have trended upwarddue in large part to the approval of resources for special, and in some casesunanticipated foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives. Although funding forregular, continuing foreign aid programs also rose modestly during this period,supplemental spending for special activities, such as Central American hurricanerelief (FY1999), Kosovo emergency assistance (FY1999), Wye River/Middle Eastpeace accord support (FY2000), a counternarcotics initiative in Colombia and theAndean region (FY2000 and FY2002), aid to the front line states in the war onterrorism and Iraq-war related assistance (FY2003), was chiefly responsible for thegrowth in foreign aid appropriations. The average annual funding level during theFY1999-FY2002 period of $17.29 billion represents a level 24% higher than the lowpoint in Foreign Operations appropriation in FY1997.", "Although Foreign Operations appropriations had been rising for five consecutive years, amounts approved in FY2003 and FY2004 have reached unprecedented levelsover the past 40 years. Regular appropriations approved in these two years haveroughly been on par with amounts of the previous few years. But substantialsupplementals of $7.5 billion and $21.2 billion, respectively, for assistance to thefront line states in the war on terrorism and Afghanistan and Iraq reconstruction, havepushed spending upward.

Due to the nature of rapidly changing overseas eventsand the emergence of unanticipated contingencies to which it is in the U.S. nationalinterest to respond, it is not surprising that foreign aid and defense resources fromtime to time are the major reason for considering and approving supplementalspending outside the regular appropriation cycle. Supplementals have providedresources for such major foreign policy events as the Camp David accords (FY1979),Central America conflicts (FY1983), Africa famine and a Middle East economicdownturn (FY1985), Panama and Nicaragua government transitions (FY1990), theGulf War (FY1991), and Bosnia relief and reconstruction (FY1996).

The Committee's distribution added funding beyond the President's request forseveral subcommittees, including Homeland Security (up $1 billion), VA/HUD (up$600 million), and Commerce, Justice, and State (up $229 million). In addition tothe $3 billion reduction for Defense, the House Committee further cut ForeignOperations by $1.769 billion to $17.12 billion. This 9.4% cut from the President'srequest was the largest percentage reduction for any of the 13 subcommittees.", "The Senate Appropriations Committee on June 19 agreed to its allocations, differing from House levels in several areas, including Foreign Operations. TheSenate panel provided $18.09 billion for foreign assistance, an amount that wassubsequently raised to $18.446 billion on October 29 in order to accommodate additional funds for international HIV/AIDS. The Senate amount was about $450million, or 2.3%, below the President's request, but $1.3 billion more than the House.", "Although Senate levels were easier to accommodate, conferees meeting to resolve funding and other differences between the two bills received a relatively lowrevised allocation of $17.2 billion. The actual reduction to the executive's budgetproposal, however, is unlikely to be as significant as a comparison between therequest -- $18.9 billion -- and the final allocation. Congress included in the Iraqreconstruction supplemental ( P.L. 108-106 ) roughly $700 million in additional fundsfor Pakistan, Jordan, and Afghanistan that will allow the President to fully fund the FY2004 proposals for these countries using resources from both the supplementaland the regular Foreign Operations measure. As such, less money will need to bedrawn for these country aid programs from the Foreign Operations bill than originallyanticipated. Moreover, during final negotiations over the conference agreement of H.R. 2673 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, to whichForeign Operations became attached, conferees added $350 million for theMillennium Challenge Account, an amount that is in addition to the $17.2 billionallocation. Consequently, taking into account funding in the supplemental plus theadd-on for the MCA, the cut to the President's overall request may be closer to $1billion, or 5%.", "Nevertheless, a cut of this size for Foreign Operations required substantial trade-offs among Administration priorities as well as foreign aid programs of highinterest to Congress. With most of the Foreign Operations increases slated for newinitiatives, including the Millennium Challenge Account and the Global AIDSprogram, cuts were necessary for some of these new proposals and for continuingactivities. During several months of debate, the White House repeatedly emphasizedthat the budget package should not reduce funding for his top spending priorities.

Among the top congressionaldevelopment aid funding priorities in recent years have been programs supportingchild survival, basic education, and efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectiousdiseases. The Administration has also backed these programs, but officials object tocongressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities when itcomes at the expense of other development sectors. Most recently during theFY2003 and FY2004 budget cycles, some Members of Congress have argued that ithas been the executive branch that has added funds for Administration priorities bycutting resources for other development activities.", "In years when Congress has increased appropriations for its priorities, but not included a corresponding boost in the overall development aid budget, resources forother aid sectors, such as economic growth and the environment, have beensubstantially reduced. This was more problematic during the mid-to-late 1990s whenworld-wide development aid funding fell significantly. In more recent years, andespecially for FY2003 and FY2004, Congress increased overall developmentassistance so that both congressional and executive program priorities could befunded without significant reductions for non-earmarked activities. Nevertheless,Administration officials continue to argue that such practices undermine theirflexibility to adjust resource allocations to changing global circumstances.", "In 2001, the Bush Administration set out revised USAID core goals for sustainable development programs focused around three \"spheres of emphasis\" or\"strategic pillars\" that include Global Health, Economic Growth and Agriculture, andConflict Prevention and Developmental Relief. The Administration furtherintroduced a new initiative -- the Global Development Alliance (GDA) -- in aneffort to expand public/private partnerships in development program implementation. Under the initiative, USAID identifies good development opportunities beingconducted by private foundations, non-governmental organizations, universities, andfor-profit organizations, and provides parallel financing to leverage resources alreadycommitted to these activities. USAID officials envisioned that the agency wouldbecome much more of a coordinating and integrating institution to expand andenhance development efforts of these non-governmental development partners.Although it started out as a much more ambitious project -- USAID requested $160million for FY2002 -- the GDA has received relatively modest funding allocations:$20 million in FY2002 and $14.9 million in FY2003. The FY2004 request sought$15 million.", "Underscoring the importance of the debate over funding allocations of development aid resources has been an elevation by the Administration of the valueof foreign economic assistance as an instrument of U.S. foreign policy since theterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. President Bush announced plans to launchtwo major foreign aid initiatives -- the Millennium Challenge Account and theGlobal AIDS Initiative -- that if approved by Congress, would significantly boostfunding for development assistance programs. Moreover, the President's September2002 National Security Strategy established global development, for the first time,as the third \"pillar\" of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy.", "For FY2004, the President sought a substantial increase in overall development assistance, although the programs are configured differently than they have been inthe past, raising questions in some observers' minds about the Administration'scommitment to broad-based, worldwide development. For \"core\" developmentassistance -- programs that match the current structure of USAID's \"strategicpillars\" and Foreign Operations appropriation accounts for Development Assistanceand Child Survival and Health Program Fund -- the Administration proposed $2.84billion, as shown in Table 11. This represented a $245 million, or 8% reduction from amounts for FY2003.

With the additions of the Global AIDSInitiative and the Millennium Challenge Account, for which $450 million and $1.3billion, respectively, were requested, total development aid in FY2004 would growto $4.6 billion, or 49% higher than FY2003 amounts.", "While development assistance supporters applauded the increases sought for the new initiatives, they remained concerned over the reductions proposed for USAID's\"core\" development accounts.

The HIV/AIDS and MCAproposals, on the other hand, are more narrowly focused. The Global AIDSInitiative, implementing prevention, treatment, and care projects, are to focus largelyon 14 priority countries in Africa and the Caribbean. The Millennium ChallengeAccount will likely support programs in the first year in perhaps as few as 8-10\"best-performing\"countries that have demonstrated progress in the areas ofgovernance, economic freedom, and social investments in people. TheAdministration further had said that MCA funding would be in addition, not asubstitute for continuing \"core\" development activities. Critics charged that theFY2004 budget request violated that pledge by cutting amounts for \"core\" programs.", "What some observers found most problematic about the FY2004 development assistance request was that increases for selected areas, especially those forHIV/AIDS, to some extent resulted from reductions in other development programs. (See Table 12.) Among health programs, each sub-sector was cut, except forHIV/AIDS. Funding for other infectious diseases, including tuberculosis andmalaria, would have fallen by one-third under the President's budget request, childsurvival activities would be cut by 11%, reproductive health would drop by 5%, andvulnerable child programs would be reduced from $27 million to $10 million. TheAdministration recommended similar reductions in its FY2003 budget request lastyear, but Congress restored most of the funds that would have been lost under thePresident's recommendation. For example, USAID had sought $110 million fornon-HIV/AIDS infectious diseases out of the Child Survival and Health ProgramFund account for FY2003, an amount that rose to $154.5 million due to subsequentcongressional additions in the Foreign Operations appropriation.", "Aside from global health programs, USAID proposed a mix of budget increases and cuts for other \"core\" development sectors.

For FY2004, the Administration requested $425 million for bilateral populationassistance, the same as proposed last year, but below the $446.5 million appropriatedby Congress for FY2003. Although funding considerations have at times beenheatedly debated by Congress, the most contentious family planning issues addressedin nearly every annual congressional consideration of Foreign Operations bills havefocused on two matters: whether the United States should contribute to the U.N.Population Fund (UNFPA) if the organization maintains a program in China whereallegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years, andwhether abortion-related restrictions should be applied to bilateral USAID populationaid grants (commonly known as the \"Mexico City\" policy).", "UNFPA Funding. The most contentious issue usually concerns the abortion restriction question, but most recentattention has focused on UNFPA and a White House decision in July 2002 to blockthe $34 million U.S. contribution to the organization. During the Reagan and BushAdministrations, the United States did not contribute to UNFPA because of concernsover practices of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization in China whereUNFPA maintains programs. In 1985, Congress passed the so-called Kemp-Kastenamendment which has been made part of every Foreign Operations appropriationsince, barring U.S. funds to any organization that supports or participates \"in themanagement\" of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. In 1993,President Clinton determined that UNFPA, despite its presence in China, was notinvolved in the management of a coercive program. In most years since 1993,Congress has appropriated about $25 million for UNFPA, but added a directive thatrequired that the amount be reduced by however much UNFPA spent in China. Consequently, the U.S. contribution has fluctuated between $21.5 million and $25million.", "For FY2002, President Bush requested $25 million for UNFPA. As part of a larger package concerning various international family planning issues, Congressprovided in the FY2002 Foreign Operations bill \"not more than\" $34 million forUNFPA. While members of the Appropriations Committees say it was their intentto provide the full $34 million, the language allowed the President to allocatehowever much he chose, up to a $34 million ceiling. According to February 27,2002, testimony by Arthur Dewey, Assistant Secretary of State for Population,Refugees, and Migration before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the WhiteHouse placed a hold on UNFPA funds in January 2002 because new evidencesuggested that coercive practices were continuing in Chinese counties where UNFPAconcentrates its programs. A September 2001 investigation team, sponsored by thePopulation Research Institute, concluded that a consistent pattern of coercioncontinued in \"model\" UNFPA counties, including forced abortions and involuntarysterilizations. Refuting these findings, a UNFPA-commissioned review team foundin October 2001 \"absolutely no evidence that the UN Population Fund supportscoercive family planning practices in China or violates the human rights of Chinesepeople in any way.\" (See House International Relations Committee hearing, Coercive Population Control in China: New Evidence of Forced Abortion andForced Sterilization , October 17, 2001.

(The authority to make this decision had beendelegated previously by the President to the Secretary of State.) The StateDepartment's analysis of the Secretary's determination found that even thoughUNFPA did not \"knowingly\" support or participate in a coercive practice, that alonewould not preclude the application of Kemp-Kasten. Instead, a finding that therecipient of U.S. funds -- in this case UNFPA -- simply supports or participates insuch a program, whether knowingly or unknowingly, would trigger the restriction.", "The team found that the Chinese government imposes fines and penalties on families that have children exceeding the number approved by the government, apractice that in some cases coerces women to have abortions they would nototherwise undergo. The State Department analysis concluded that UNFPA'sinvolvement in China's family planning program \"allows the Chinese governmentto implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion.\" (The full text of theState Department's analysis is online at the State Department's website at http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/other/12128.htm .

The debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decadesago, in 1973, when Congress added a provision to the Foreign Assistance Act of1961 prohibiting the use of U.S. appropriated funds for abortion-related activitiesand coercive family planning programs. During the mid-1980s, in what has becomeknown as the \"Mexico City\" policy (because it was first announced at the 1984Mexico City Population Conference), the Reagan Administration, and later theGeorge H. W. Bush Administration restricted funds for foreign non-governmentalorganizations (NGOs) that were involved in performing or promoting abortions incountries where they worked, even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S.funds . Several groups, including International Planned ParenthoodFederation-London (IPPF-London), became ineligible for U.S. financial support. Insome subsequent years, Congress narrowly approved measures to overturn thisprohibition, but White House vetoes kept the policy in place. President Clinton in1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors, allowing the United States toresume funding for all family planning organizations so long as no U.S. money wasused by those involved in abortion-related work.", "Between 1996 and 2000, the House and Senate took opposing positions on the Mexico City issue, actions that repeatedly held up enactment of the final ForeignOperations spending measures. The House position, articulated by RepresentativeChris Smith (N.J.) and others, supported reinstatement of the Mexico City policyrestricting U.S. aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortionsor in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries. The Senate,on the other hand, rejected in most cases House provisions dealing with Mexico Citypolicy, favoring a position that left these decisions in the hands of theAdministration. Unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides, Congressadopted interim arrangements during this period that did not resolve the broadpopulation program controversy, but permitted the stalled Foreign Operationsmeasure to move forward. The annual \"compromise\" removed House-added MexicoCity restrictions, but reduced population assistance to $385 million, and in severalyears, \"metered\" the availability of the funds at a rate of one-twelfth of the $385million per month.", "In FY2000, when the issue became linked with the separate foreign policy matter of paying U.S. arrears owed to the United Nations, a reluctant PresidentClinton agreed to a modified version of abortion restrictions, marking the first timethat Mexico City conditions had been included in legislation signed by the President (enacted in the Foreign Operations Act for FY2000, H.R. 3422 ,incorporated into H.R. 3194 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act forFY2000, P.L. 106-113 ). Because the President could waive the restrictions for $15million in grants to organizations that refused to certify, there was no major impacton USAID family planning programs in FY2000, other than the reduction of $12.5million in population assistance that the legislation required if the White Houseexercised the waiver authority.", "When Congress again came to an impasse in FY2001, lawmakers agreed to allow the new President to set policy. Under the FY2001 Foreign Operationsmeasure, none of the $425 million appropriation could be obligated until afterFebruary 15, 2001.

They believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they areunsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losingeligibility for USAID funding. This, they contend, will lead to higher numbers ofunwanted pregnancies and possibly more abortions. Opponents also believe the newconditions undermine relations between the U.S. Government and foreign NGOs andmultilateral groups, creating a situation in which the United States challenges theirdecisions on how to spend their own money. They further argue that U.S. policyimposes a so-called \"gag\" order on the ability of foreign NGOs and multilateralgroups to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations. This would be unconstitutional if applied to American groups working in the UnitedStates, critics note.

This exemption would apply so long as theservices do not violate the law of the country in which they are performed and thatthey would not violate U.S. laws if provided in the United States.

TheCrowley amendment further would have altered existing law for determining UNFPAeligibility by requiring that the President find that UNFPA does not \"directly\"support or participate in coercive or involuntary activities. This would appear tomake it more difficult for the President to block funding for UNFPA than underconditions that apply for this year.

The remaining deficitof $4.3 billion would be covered by recently frozen and seized assets ($2.5 billion),the Development Fund for Iraq ($1.2 billion), and $3 billion in already appropriatedU.S. assistance. Iraq was projected to have $1.1 billion remaining for reconstructionby end of December 2003.", "The Administration request suggested that a reassessment of Iraq's immediate reconstruction needs demanded greater outlays of revenue than projected in July. Italso suggested that presumed sources of additional revenue in 2004 -- chiefly, oilexport production and international donor contributions -- might not be as large asoriginally anticipated. In any case, the result was a supplemental reconstructionrequest nearly 20% larger than the size of the entire national budget for Iraq projectedon an annualized basis in early July.", "Reconstruction Concerns and Critical Assessment.", "Total Reconstruction Costs. As noted above, the supplemental request was intended to meet only the most important,immediate needs in Iraq in the 2004 fiscal year. Until October 2003, the cost of Iraqreconstruction was based on speculation and educated guesswork. However, as partof the lead-in to an international donors conference held in Madrid on October 24,the World Bank and the U.N. Development Program released a needs assessmentthey conducted of 14 Iraqi economic and social sectors. (8) The Bank/UNDPassessments put the cost of reconstruction for the 14 sectors at $36 billion over fouryears, a figure that does not include $19.4 billion estimated by the CPA for security,oil, and other critical sectors not covered by the Bank assessments. (9) Total Bank/CPAprojected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion, $17.5 billion in2004 alone. If Iraqi oil revenues are not sufficient to meet the projected needs --which appears likely in the near term by most accounts -- and other internationaldonors do not pledge significant contributions, the United States may face increasedfinancial demands, if it seeks to meet projected Iraqi needs.", "Iraqi Oil Revenues and Financing Reconstruction. Until mid-2003, the Administration hadexpected most costs of reconstruction to be borne by Iraq through receipts from itsoil exports. While the decrepit state of oil production infrastructure and recurrentsabotage to pipelines and facilities have forced experts to downgrade expectationsof potential exports and receipts, any sustained increase in production will assist thereconstruction effort. Current rates of production are nearing 2 million barrels/day,but Iraqis do not expect to reach 2.5 million barrels until spring and 3 million untilthe end of 2004. Administration estimates of the prewar level range between 2.5 and3 million barrels. Ambassador Bremer indicated at a Senate hearing on September22 that he expected Iraq to produce sufficient oil in 2005 to take care of its basicneeds and provide additional funds for capital investment. (10) Undersecretary of StateLarson projected $12 billion in revenue in 2004 and $19 billion in 2005. (11) Anassociation of leading banks and financiers, the Institute of International Finance,predicted that oil revenue will be insufficient to cover the Iraqi operational budget in2004, leaving nothing for reconstruction. (12)", "Roughly $503 million had been allocated by September 2003 from the FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental for repair of oil facilities and restoration ofproduction and distribution systems. The Administration request for these purposesunder the FY2004 supplemental was $2.1 billion. Additional sums for Iraqi securityforces were in part intended to create an Iraqi force that would prevent pipeline andother oil facility sabotage.", "Loans vs. Grants for Reconstruction. Closely related to the issue of Iraqi oil revenues as a means of financingreconstruction projects was the question of whether assistance could be extended ona loan rather than grant basis. Some argued that, given the substantial amount of oilrevenues that Iraq will generate at some point in the future, Baghdad would have themeans to service debt incurred for the purpose of rebuilding its infrastructure. Loans,either extended bilaterally or through some sort of trust fund, possibly managed bythe World Bank, would be repaid at some point, thereby reducing reconstructioncosts to the United States, they said.", "The Administration, which proposed that the entire $20.3 billion supplemental be offered as grants, argued repeatedly during congressional hearings against addingto Iraq's already substantial debt obligations. Witnesses asserted that Iraq owedroughly $200 billion in pre-war debts, reparations, and other claims. G7 leadersagreed informally at the June 2003 summit to suspend through 2004 the requirementfor Iraq to service any existing debt, giving time to construct some sort of multilateraldebt restructuring arrangement. (13) Further, U.N.Security Council Resolution 1483stated that Iraqi oil exports or proceeds could not be attached by creditors through2007 unless authorized by the Council.", "Beyond the matter of whether Iraq should incur more debt obligations in the near term was the question over who could legally assume responsibility for newsovereign debt. Although it would be possible that the World Bank could managean Iraq reconstruction trust fund that would receive contributions from internationaldonors, if the Bank were to use these resources for project lending, it would almostcertainly require, as it has in the past, that some sort of sovereign Iraq authorityassume the debt obligation. Until such time that legal authority is transferred to Iraqihands, the Coalition Provisional Authority is the temporary government of Iraq andwould be the one signing for the loans. Most legal scholars take the position that anoccupying power has no authority to incur new debts on behalf of the displacedsovereign. (14) Some contend, however, that thereis an exception in which a newgovernment would be responsible for the debt if it can be shown that the loans wererequired for the welfare of the occupied territory and the terms were fair andreasonable. (15)", "This issue was closely examined by lawmakers. The Senate adopted (51-47) an amendment by Senators Bayh and Nelson on October 16 converting $10 billion ofreconstruction grants to loans, which could be later restored as grants if foreigncreditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Earlier, Senator Dorgan had offered amendments in committee markup and on the Senate floor (tabled in both venues)that would have created an authority to use Iraqi oil to secure reconstructionfinancing and convert U.S. grants to loans. Senator Hutchison and others submittedan amendment that did not come up for floor debate directing $10 billion of the totalreconstruction supplemental to a Trust Fund, to be established within the WorldBank, out of which loans and loan guarantees would be made. ", "On the House side, Representative Wamp proposed but later withdrew an amendment during Committee markup that would have withheld one-half of Iraqfunds until after the election of a new Iraqi leader, at which time the remainingmoney would be available in the form of a loan. Representative Obey offered anamendment (defeated 25-36) that, among other things, would have transferred about$7 billion of reconstruction funds to a World Bank-administered loan facility. Afurther amendment by Representative Obey regarding a shift of grants to loans wasdefeated in the House 200-226.", "House and Senate conferees agreed to provide all Iraq reconstruction aid as grants rather than loans.", "Contracting Concerns. An Administration decision applied to the early reconstruction contracts to waive thenormal competitive bidding requirements and request bids from specific companieswhich were seen to have preexisting qualifications received considerable attentionby the business community. The closed bidding and lack of transparency disturbeda number of legislators, and some Members of Congress asked the GAO to determinewhether contracting agencies are following appropriate procedures.", "Some observers noted that, in addition to many American firms, a number of international organizations and non-U.S. companies were excluded from theselections made by USAID and other agencies, and even British companies were notconsidered despite that country's role in the war. U.S. officials pointed out that onlya few select firms possessed the particular skills that would qualify them for the jobspecifications for Iraq reconstruction, and that time and security clearances were alsocritical factors. Foreign entities, potentially excluded by \"buy America\" provisionsof law, and other U.S. firms could participate as sub-contractors to the selectedAmerican firms. Sub-contractors are likely to compose half or more of the total costof each contract.", "The Supplemental's Impact on Other Donors. At the time, it appeared possible that congressionalaction on the supplemental could influence the contributions of international donorsat the October donors' conference, and Administration officials encouraged Congressto complete debate on the spending bill prior that date. Some argued that a largepledge of U.S. aid prior to the conference might stimulate other donors to contributemore; diminution of the Administration plan, they argued, could have the oppositeeffect. Opponents of making U.S. aid for reconstruction in the form of loans alsocontended that other donors might follow the American lead and offer loans ratherthan grants, adding further to Iraq's debt problems. In addition, the supplementaltargeted sectors -- infrastructure and security -- that other donors were less likelyto support themselves. In similar \"nation-building\" exercises elsewhere, donors havetended to funnel contributions to the social sectors, such as education and health, andgrassroots democratization and economic development, all areas relatively untouchedby the supplemental. ", "Perhaps a more important factor in other donor calculations was the extent to which they would have a say in the use of funds. Donors had been reluctant toprovide assistance because they were wary of being perceived as supporting aunilateral U.S. policy. In response to this concern, donors discussed at a September6 meeting in Brussels, the concept of creating Iraq reconstruction trust funds,managed by the U.N. or World Bank, which would accept and distributecontributions. Control over how the money was spent, according to Undersecretaryof State Alan Larson who represented the U.S. at the September 6 meetings, wouldbe handled by some sort of a multilateral management board that might includeofficials from international organizations, major donors, and Iraqis representinginterim ministries. (16)", "Management of Iraq Reconstruction Funds by U.S. Agencies. Administrative control over Iraq reconstructionfunds became a significant issue during congressional debate on the $2.475 billionappropriation in P.L. 108-11 . At that time, most had expected that transfers forreconstruction and post-conflict aid would be made to USAID, the State Department,and other traditional foreign assistance management agencies. But with plans for theDefense Department to oversee the governing of Iraq immediately after the end ofhostilities, the White House wanted to maintain maximum flexibility over thedistribution of resources so the President could transfer some or all of the funding toDOD. The proposal stimulated immediate controversy with a number of critics,including Members of Congress, arguing that aid programs should remain under thepolicy direction of the State Department and under the authorities of a broad andlongstanding body of foreign aid laws. Although initial House and Senate decisionswould have blocked Administration efforts to place control of reconstruction fundswith the Pentagon, ultimately Congress agreed to allow the White House to allocatethe resources among five agencies, including DOD. Funds for the Iraq Relief andReconstruction Fund appropriated in P.L. 108-11 have been managed by L. PaulBremer, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), and the U.S. civilianadministrator in Iraq, who reports to the Secretary of Defense.", "The Administration proposed that the entire $20.3 billion be placed in the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, as was the case with the previous supplemental, andto continue Ambassador Bremer and the CPA's role as administrators of the Fundunder DOD guidance. After submitting the supplemental, however, the White Houseannounced the establishment of a new \"Iraq Stabilization Group,\"headed by NationalSecurity Advisor Condoleezza Rice. The Group was intended to help speed upreconstruction efforts by identifying and resolving problems that had in some casesbeen the source of decision-making disputes in Washington. Some analysts believedthat the move was also intended to allow the State Department a greater voice inreconstruction policy. At the same time, the State Department staff serving under theCPA in Iraq was expected to grow from 55 to about 110. Nevertheless, AmbassadorBremer would continue to report to the Secretary of Defense. (17)", "During congressional debate, the Senate tabled (56-42) an amendment by Senators Leahy and Daschle that would have placed the CPA under the directauthority and foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State. The House bill,however, added a provision barring the coordination of defense or reconstructionactivities in Iraq or Afghanistan by a U.S. government officer who was not subjectto confirmation by the Senate. The House Committee wanted to ensure that whoeverwas in charge of coordination be available to testify at congressional oversighthearings. Senator Leahy proposed a similar amendment for Senate consideration. These proposals appeared to block the initiative of placing National Security CouncilAdvisor Rice, who is not subject to confirmation and who does not testify beforeCongress, in charge of coordinating reconstruction. The White House, however,contended that the new Iraq Stabilization Group did not affect control of reconstruction efforts and that the job remains under control of the DefenseDepartment. (18) In any case, the House provisionrequiring that the coordination ofreconstruction activities be headed by a confirmed U.S. official was deleted inconference negotiations.", "Reconstruction Priorities and Costs. The Administration said that the request included only the most pressing, immediateneeds for Iraq in FY2004. However, the relative importance of certain items detailedin the request -- 're-engineering of postal service business practices' andconstruction of seven residential communities, for example -- was challenged byCongress. Further, the costs associated with reconstruction requests were subject toskepticism, with some congressional staff reportedly suggesting that the price tag wasintentionally inflated so that the Administration would not have to return to Congressto ask for more funds in 2004. (19) Several Senateamendments were offered but notadopted that would have reduced funding for what the sponsors regarded aslow-priority needs and redirected the resources for domestic or other militaryprograms in Iraq. The House bill proposed a $1.655 billion cut in Iraq reconstructionfunding, reducing or eliminating resources for a wide range of activities that theHouse found to be un-executable, low priority, or likely to receive funding from otherinternational donors. A number of these House recommendations for cuts wereadopted in the conference agreement. See Table 17 above for details of sector andproject reductions recommended by Congress. ", "Congressional Action.", "FY2004 Regular Foreign Operations Appropriations. The President did not request, nor did eitherHouse or Senate bills provide, additional funding for Iraq reconstruction in theregular FY2004 Foreign Operations Appropriations measures. Although the Housedid not address Iraq reconstruction funding matters in H.R. 2800 , Sec.572 of the legislation required that Iraq reconstruction contracts awarded withappropriated funds be subject to full and open competition. Conferees meeting on H.R. 2673 -- the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2004 within whichForeign Operations has been incorporated as Division D -- decided, however, todrop the House contract provision in Sec. 572, believing the issue had beenadequately addressed in the FY2004 supplemental measure (see below).", "FY2004 Iraq Reconstruction Supplemental. As illustrated in Table 17 above, theSenate-passed measure ( S. 1689 ) followed the general funding requestsproposed by the President, while the House bill ( H.R. 3289 ) reduced the$20.3 billion recommendation by $1.65 billion. Both bills further added sectionsrequiring more detailed reporting to Congress on reconstruction activities and placedlimits on, but not prohibiting non-competitive contracting procedures. The Housemeasure also prohibited reconstruction efforts to be coordinated by anyone notconfirmed by the Senate, apparently in reaction to the White House announcementestablishing the Iraq Stabilization Group, headed by national Security Advisor Rice.", "House and Senate negotiators agreed to total Iraq reconstruction at levels similar to House-passed amounts, reducing funds for a number of activities deemed tooexpensive or of low priority. The conference agreement was approved in the Houseon October 29. ", "Perhaps the most challenging issue for conference committee consideration was whether to provide the entire reconstruction package as a grant, as proposed by thePresident and H.R. 3289 , or extend $10 billion in the form as a loan, asthe Senate bill recommends. The $10 billion loan in S. 1689 could laterbe converted to a grant if international creditors agree to cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Under a threat of a Presidential veto, House and Senate conferees agreed to providethe entire package of aid as grants.
