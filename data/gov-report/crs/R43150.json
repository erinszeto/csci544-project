Specifically, in certain circumstances, large employers who do not provide adequate or affordable coverage may potentially pay a penalty if at least one of their full-time workers enrolls in an exchange and receives a premium credit. Prior to the delay, CBO projected that the employer penalties would increase federal revenue between $5 billion and $10 billion in 2014.", "Finally, most individuals will be required to maintain minimum essential coverage (MEC), which includes eligible employer coverage, individual coverage, and federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, among others. Individuals who do not maintain MEC for themselves and their dependents, and who are not exempt from the individual mandate, will be required to pay a penalty for noncompliance. Prior to the delay, CBO projected that the penalty payments by individuals would equal $3 billion in FY2014 and $5 billion in FY2015.

These changes also may have an impact on federal spending and revenue associated with the employer penalty, individual mandate, and premium credits. The following section discusses these issues in greater detail. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility for Premium Tax Credits in the Exchanges", "paragraphs": ["ACA authorized new federal tax credits to go towards covering premiums for health insurance offered through the newly established exchanges (marketplaces) beginning in 2014. These premium credits will be available to individuals and families who have household incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), and do not have access to MEC elsewhere. In addition, an individual may have an offer of MEC from an employer, but if that coverage is not adequate or affordable, that individual could qualify for premium tax credits. In addition to premium credits, ACA also establishes subsidies to reduce cost-sharing expenses.", "One potential impact of a delay in the enforcement of potential employer penalties under ACA in 2014 may be a lower than projected number of \"large\" employers offering health insurance coverage. This may result in a larger than projected increase in the number of workers eligible for premium tax credits in the exchanges in 2014. The magnitude of this effect is beyond the scope of this report. A recent study by the Urban Institute found that the delay in the enforcement of the employer penalty has almost no effect on overall coverage under the ACA or the distribution of that coverage across public and private sources. CBO and JCT have not yet completed an analysis of the impact that the Administration's July 2, 2013, announcement and other recently issued final rules will have on spending and revenues under current law. That analysis will be released soon.", "Individuals filing for a premium tax credit face the same requirements with respect to accuracy as when they file their annual taxes. Under current law, individuals who knowingly provide false information are subject to penalties and there is no statute of limitations for fraudulent claims. In addition, there are a number of other information reports and processes available to the IRS and the exchanges to validate an individual's income and whether an individual has access to MEC and the nature of that coverage. ", "Under ACA, the amount received in premium credits is based on the prior year's income tax returns. These amounts are reconciled in the next year when individuals file tax returns for the actual year in which they received a premium credit. If a tax filing unit's income changes, and the filer should have received a higher credit amount, this additional credit would be included in their tax refund for the year. On the other hand, any excess amount that was overpaid in premium credits would have to be repaid to the federal government as a tax payment, with some limits on repayment based on income. ", "In addition, a recent final regulation issued by HHS provides guidance to exchanges in determining eligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions in the absence of information about the availability of employer-sponsored insurance. Under this guidance, prior to January 1, 2015, an exchange may accept an applicant's attestation regarding enrollment in an eligible employer-sponsored plan and eligibility for qualifying coverage in an eligible employer plan for the benefit year for which coverage is requested without further verification. While HHS indicates that this is an option for state-based exchanges, HHS indicates that federally-facilitated exchanges (including partnership exchanges) will not rely on an applicant's attestation and instead adhere to the verification procedures outlined in regulations.", "Even with a delay in reporting requirements (as outlined in IRS Notice 2013-45), there are a number of other information reports available to assist IRS in confirming whether someone has MEC when applying for premium tax credits in a state-based exchange. For example, a proxy for MEC from an employer may be available from individual's W-2 forms, as enacted under Section 9002 of ACA and described in Table 1 above. ACA requires employers to disclose the employer's contribution towards an employee's health insurance coverage on the employee's W-2 form. The W-2 information available after April 15, 2014, would be based on tax returns filed for CY2013, which would require some reconciliation of information in later years. This information, however, would not identify or report whether employers are offering coverage that is adequate or affordable , nor is it available consistently for workers at firms less than 250 workers. In these cases, there is nothing preventing the state exchanges from contacting an individual's employer to determine more information about the health insurance coverage provided. ", "Finally, employers are encouraged to voluntarily comply with the reporting requirements in 2014. For those employers that voluntarily comply, this will provide additional information to IRS regarding the existence and nature of an individual's health insurance coverage if available.

Individuals will be required to maintain minimum essential coverage for themselves and their dependents.

As noted earlier, however, the magnitude of this effect is outside the scope of this report.", "Similar to the discussion above with respect to premium credit eligibility, determining the existence of MEC for purposes of the individual mandate may require reliance on other information available to the IRS. In this case, because there is a financial penalty for noncompliance, individuals will have an incentive to approach their employers to certify that they have MEC. ", "While information regarding the existence of MEC would be available for employers who voluntarily comply with the reporting requirements in 2014, there may also be other sources of this information available to tax filers. For example, as noted above, a proxy for minimum essential coverage from employers may be available on an individual's W-2 form as enacted under Section 9002 of ACA and described in Table 1 above. Since the individual mandate payments are determined when an individual files taxes, the W-2 information would be available at that time for workers at firms with more than 250 employees (see discussion under premium credits above).
