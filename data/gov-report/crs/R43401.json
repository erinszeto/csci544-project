The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued a Safety Alert to notify emergency responders, shippers, carriers, and the public that recent derailments and resulting fires indicate that the type of crude oil transported from the Bakken region of North Dakota may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil. The alert reminds emergency responders that light sweet crude oil, such as that coming from the Bakken region, pose significant fire risk if released from the package (tank car) in an accident. PHMSA has expanded the scope of lab testing to include other factors that affect proper characterization and classification of crude oil such as volatility, corrosivity, hydrogen sulfide content and composition/concentration of the entrained gases in the material.", "All crude oils are flammable, to a varying degree.

The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) recently fined several oil companies for improperly classifying their crude oil rail shipments. Potential safety concerns have similarly been raised over pipeline shipments of crude oil from Canada's oil sands projects.", "Crude oil is highly variable and can exhibit a wide range of physical and chemical properties. In fact, crude oil samples drawn from the same oil field can vary significantly. Lighter oils may be prone to ignite more readily than heavier crude oils depending on the range of light hydrocarbons they contain. In addition to flammability, other factors such as specific gravity (density) and entrained gases may also play important factors in rail car loading, and corrosivity and sulfur content may affect rail car structural integrity. Bakken crude oil (traded as North Dakota Light) is a light sweet crude oil high in light-end paraffinic range hydrocarbons, as well as heavy-end asphaltic range hydrocarbons. Light sweet crudes, like Bakken, are easier to process directly into gasoline and middle-distillate fuels (e.g., diesel) than heavier crude oils.

The Lower Flammable Limit (LFL) is the minimum concentration of vapor or gas in air below which propagation of flame does not occur on contact with a source of ignition.

(See \" Rail Car Capacity and Load Limit \" regarding DOT-III tank cars.)

(ASTM refers to the American Society for Testing and Materials.) Vapor pressure is an important consideration for both crude oil producers and refiners in determining general handling and initial refinery treatment.

Sulfur oxides released into the air during combustion of refined petroleum products are also a major air pollutant. During the decomposition of organic matter that occurs with hydrocarbons in some geologic formations, sulfur may chemically combine with hydrogen to form hydrogen sulfide gas (H 2 S), a highly corrosive, flammable, and toxic gas. Oil and gas reservoirs with high concentrations of H 2 S can be particularly problematic to produce. H 2 S causes sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking in the standard steel casing and valves used to construct oil wells, and thus require a switch to costly stainless steel. PHMSA has a similar concern for sulfide-stress-corrosion in tank cars. During drilling, detection of H 2 S could result in abandoning the well due to concerns for worker safety. (Worker exposure to no more than 0.03 ppm for up to 8 hours is generally considered safe.)", "Sulfur content is measured as an overall percentage (by weight) of free sulfur and sulfur compounds in a crude oil. Total sulfur content in crude oils generally ranges from below 0.05% to 5%.

In May 2013, Enbridge Energy Partners (a crude oil shipper) detected H 2 S at concentrations of 1,200 parts-per-million in a crude oil storage tank. Enbridge consequently made an emergency application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to amend its conditions of carriage, which would give it the right to reject crude containing more than 5 parts-per-million H 2 S (an exposure level that would require personal protective equipment).

When crude oil reaches the surface, the reduced pressure and temperature releases the dissolved condensates to a gaseous phase. Surface processing equipment separates the gas into various product streams. The \"degassed\" oil is typically stored in stock tanks before transport (by pipeline, tank truck, or rail car) to a refinery where any remaining condensate may be separated.

", "A tank car becomes overloaded when it exceeds either the maximum gross weight on rail or maximum filling limit. An overloaded rail car can cause its axles to break, or cause the car to exceed the maximum time a car can take to achieve maximum braking. A crude oil shipper has two options in meeting the weight agreement with the rail carrier: provide either a weight from a certified scale, or a weight estimate based on calculations. To calculate the weight limit, the shipper must consider the \"light weight\" of the tank car (the unloaded or tare weight) and consider the density (API gravity) of the crude oil to be loaded. For illustrative purposes, Figure 2 shows how increasingly heavier API gravity reduces the volume of crude oil that can be loaded into a tank car in order to not exceed the gross rail weight limit. ", "At 50\"API, the tank car can hold its maximum volume of 31,800 gallons and not exceed the 286,000 lb. gross weight on rail limit.

At Bakken's highest density of 39.7\"API, the tank car can only hold 30,488 gallons\u2014a volume reduction of roughly 1,300 gallons. The reduced volume also creates free space at the top of the tank car, which provides the opportunity for entrained gases to release from crude oil.

However, the U.S. Gulf Coast (Texas and Louisiana) constitutes the most prolific region of domestic crude oil production, and the crude oils produced (WTI, Eagle Ford, and Louisiana Light Sweet, among others) rival Bakken in the characteristics the PHMSA alert has called into scrutiny. The Gulf Coast does benefit from existing pipeline infrastructure; however, producers are relying on rail to access new markets, as evidenced by Eagle Ford crude oil moving from East Texas to St James, Louisiana by rail.", "All crude oils are flammable, to a varying degree.
