Unlike antitrust, RICO, and other federal punitive damage, private attorney general provisions, the individual need not have been a victim of the misconduct giving rise to the litigation. The name qui tam is the shortened version of an oft abbreviated Latin phrase which roughly translates to \"he who prosecutes for himself as well as for the King.\" Qui tam comes to us from before the dawn of the common law. Reviled at various times throughout the ages as a breeding ground for \"viperous vermin\" and parasites, legislative bodies have authorized it when they consider the enforcement of some law beyond the unaided capacity or interest of authorized law enforcement officials. Best known of the contemporary members of the line is the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733). From 1986 until expansion of the Act in 2009, False Claims Act recoveries totaled an amount in excess of $20 billion.

They brought with them, however, unintended consequences. They gave rise to a class of bounty hunters who unscrupulously exploited weaknesses in the system. \"Old statutes which had been forgotten were unearthed and used as means to gratify ill-will. Litigation was stirred up simply in order that the informer might compound [ i.e., settle] for a sum of money. Threats to sue were easy means of levying blackmail.\" Coke in his Third Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England devotes a chapter to the reform legislation designed to control the practices of these \"vexatious relators, informers, and promoters,\" whom he classifies as turbidum hominum genus (a class of unruly men) and as a species among the classes of \"viperous vermin\" \u2013 a class was so unpopular that Queen Elizabeth I at one time found it necessary to issue a proclamation shielding its members from mob violence.

The effect of them is simply to hold out to a confederate a strong temptation to betray his coconspirator, and bring him to justice. The bill offers, in short, a reward to the informer who comes into court and betrays his coconspirator, if he be such; but it is not confined to that class. Even the district attorney, who is required to be vigilant in the prosecution of such cases, may be also the informer, and entitle himself to one half the forfeiture under the qui tam clause, and to one half of the double damages which may be recovered against the person committing the act. In short, sir, I have based the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh sections upon the old-fashion idea of hold out a temptation, and \"setting a rogue to catch a rogue,\" which is the safest and most expeditious way I have ever discovered of bringing rogues to justice.", "As enacted, the statute prohibited various frauds against the government, including making or presenting false claims, false vouchers, false oaths, forged signatures, theft, embezzlement, and conspiracy. The proscriptions applied to both military personnel and civilians. Civilian offenders faced a sentence of imprisonment of from one to five years or a fine of not less than $1,000 or more than $5,000. They also faced civil liability in the amount of $2,000, double the amount of damage sustained by the United States, and costs.

Recent experience shows that plaintiffs in informers' suits not only fail to furnish to the United States the information which is the basis of their actions, but on the contrary, at times base the litigation on information which has been secured by the Government in the regular course of law enforcement. Such plaintiffs at times not only use information contained in indictments returned against the defendant, but also seek to use Government files to prove their cases. Consequently, informers' suits have become mere parasitical actions, occasionally brought only after law-enforcement offices have investigated and prosecuted persons guilty of a violation of law and solely because of the hope of a large reward.", "He also referred to a court of appeals decision that seemed to reflect judicial condemnation of the qui tam provisions. The Senate passed the repeal proposal with little debate at the close of the 77 th Congress. The House acted with similar dispatch and passed a comparable bill when it convened in the 78 th Congress. In the interim, however, the Supreme Court had repudiated the lower court opinion which the Attorney General had cited. Moreover, opposition to repeal had developed in the Senate. As a consequence, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended curtailing, rather than repealing, the false claim qui tam provisions.

That is, the government's action would not be thought to relate back to the private litigant's filing within the statute of limitations. The 2009 Act added a new subsection to \u00a73731 to afford the government the advantage of the date of the relator's complaint as a cut-off date for statute of limitations purposes.

The rights available in criminal proceedings exist precisely because the proceedings are criminal. The Sixth Amendment rights \u2013the right to counsel; to call and confront witnesses; to informed of the nature of the charges against him; to trial in the place where the offense occurred; and to a speedy and public trial before an impartial jury \u2013 apply only to \"the accused\" in criminal proceedings.

Harper that, \"under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution.\" Nine years later, however, in Hudson v. United States , the Court withdrew from the broad implications of Halper whose analysis it characterized as \"ill considered.\" The appropriate test, the Court declared, is one exemplified in its pre- Halper case law:", "Whether Congress, in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicate[] either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other. Second, where Congress has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, [was] the statutory scheme . . . so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate that intention. In regard to this latter inquiry, we have noted that only the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute on such a ground.

A fine is excessive, in the eyes of the Court, \"if it is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the defendant's offense.\" ", "In the qui tam context, some lower courts treat False Claims Act qui tam penalties as punishment and consequently subject to excessive fines clause analysis.

In the course of its opinion, however, the Court noted that it \"need not say with precision what limits there may be on a financial or personal interest of one who performs a prosecutorial function. In particular, we need not say whether different considerations might be held to apply if the alleged biasing influence contributed to prosecutions against particular persons, rather than to a general zealousness in the enforcement process.\" That fact pattern surfaced in Young v.

Five members of the Supreme Court agreed that Young's subsequent conviction should be overturned because, \"counsel for a party that is the beneficiary of a court order may not be appointed as prosecutor in a contempt action alleging a violation of that order.\" Four members of the Court felt this was so because the appointment of an interested prosecutor constituted error which undermined confidence in the integrity of the criminal proceeding. One of the four went so far as to assert that the failure to appoint a disinterested prosecutor constituted a due process violation. A fifth Justice merely concurred in the result, because he felt that the lower court's appointment of a prosecutor \u2013 disinterested or not \u2013 was invalid on separation of powers grounds.", "Lower federal courts thereafter confronted with due process challenges to qui tam have rejected them based on the fact that relators press their claims as private civil litigants and thus do not exercise government power subject to due process clause restrictions on criminal prosecutions.

First, the Constitution grants the federal courts the judicial power over \"cases and controversies.\" This is thought to require at least two parties with conflicting interests, presented in a context suitable for judicial resolution, i.e. , standing in a case or controversy. Yet, relators come to court with no interest of their own, only a contingent personal interest. Second, the Constitution instructs the President to see that the laws are faithfully executed. Yet, without his approval or unrestricted control, relators may initiate and prosecute litigation. Third, the President is vested with the authority to appoint officers of the United States and, with the courts and heads of departments, to appoint inferior officers. Yet, relators, who engage in activities otherwise reserved to officers and inferior officers of the United States, are appointed neither by the President, the courts, nor by the head of any department.

Valeo , the Court seemed to conclude that only officers appointed under Article II could be vested with conducting civil litigation on behalf of the United States: ", "We hold that these provisions of the Act, vesting in the Commission primary responsibility for conducting civil litigation in the courts of the United States for vindicating public rights, violate Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2, of the Constitution. Such functions may be discharged only by persons who are \"Officers of the United States\" within the language of that section.", "Yet, earlier Court decisions suggested that the appointments clause applied only to those purported to hold an \"office of the United States,\" and that Congress might authorize the performance of services in the name of the United States by those who did so without the attributes of office, selected other than under Article II. The line begins with United States v. Hartwell which found that a Treasury Department clerk was an officer of the United States for purposes of an embezzlement statute. The Court noted that the defendant had been appointed in a manner consistent with Article II to a position that \"embraced the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument, and duties\" and for which the duties were continuing and permanent rather than occasional or temporary. ", "The second case, United States v. Germaine , likewise involved a penal statute applicable to \"officers of the United States.\" The Court concluded that the defendant, a surgeon paid to conduct and report on the results of examinations of applicants and recipients of federal pensions, was not an officer of the United States. The Court supported its view by noting that the defendant filled no office; his duties were occasional and intermittent; he kept no place of business for the public use; he gave no bond; he took no oath; he was but an agent employed by the Commissioner of Pensions to obtain information needed for the performance of the Commissioner's duties. ", "The Court used the same mode of analysis in Auffmordt v. Heden , when it concluded that appraisers called upon in the event of a customs dispute were not officers of the United States and consequently their selection other than under the Article II formula did not invalidate their efforts. ", "The Court in Buckle y distinguished rather than repudiated Germaine and Affmordt , but it did so in manner that does not necessarily resolve the qui tam issue:", "[The term] \"Officers of the United States\" does not include all employees of the United States, but there is no claim made that the Commissioners are employees of the United States rather than officers. Employees are lesser functionaries subordinate to officers of the United States, see Auffmordt v. Hedden, 137 U.S. 310, 327 (1890); United States v. Germaine , supra , whereas the Commissioners, appointed for a statutory term, are not subject to the control or direction of any other executive, judicial, or legislative authority.", "The Court later affirmed the Buckley assertion that only officers appointed in conformity with Article II could \"exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States.\" ", "Yet in Freytag , it acknowledged the existence of various classes empowered other than by Article II appointment who performed services in the name of the United States. There it distinguished Tax Court special trial judges (inferior officers) from special masters (not officers) along the lines suggested in Germaine rather than based on a relative degree of independence mentioned in Buckley : ", "The office of special trial judge is established by Law, and the duties, salary, and means of appointment for that office are specified by statute. These characteristics distinguish special trial judges from special masters, who are hired by Article III courts on a temporary, episodic basis, whose positions are not established by law, and whose duties and functions are not delineated in a statute. Furthermore, special trial judges perform more than ministerial tasks. . . . [T]he special trial judges exercise significant discretion.

Thus, the threshold question that we face is whether qui tam relators are \"officers\" for purposes of Article II. We conclude that they are not; qui tam relators do not serve in any office of the United States. There is no legislatively created office of informer or relator under the FCA. Relators are not entitled to the benefits of officeholders, such as drawing a government salary.

Morrison v. Olson presents a question perhaps most closely analogous to the one of whether qui tam statutes undermine or unduly interfere with the President's ability to fulfill his responsibilities under the take care clause.

(c) Rights of the parties to qui tam actions. \u2013 (1) If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2). (2)(A) The Government may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the person has been notified by the Government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion. (B) The Government may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera. (C) Upon a showing by the Government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the Government's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as\u2013", "(i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;", "(ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;", "(iii) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or", "(iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.", "(D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation. (3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. If the Government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause. (4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Government that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the Government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings. (5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the Government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the United States, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.

Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant. (2) If the Government does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant. (3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section 3729, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United States to continue the action, represented by the Department of Justice. (4) If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.", "(e) Certain actions barred. \u2013 (1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the armed forces under subsection (b) of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person's service in the armed forces.
