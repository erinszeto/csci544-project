They are segments of the financial system in which funding is raised through issuing and trading equity or debt securities, which are forms of financial assets representing ownership or indebtedness of a firm. They are considered the largest source of financing for U.S. nonfinancial companies, significantly larger than bank loans and other forms of financing.", "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the principal regulator of U.S. capital markets. In recent years, Congress and the SEC began to increasingly direct capital markets regulation away from its traditional \"one size fits all\" approach. Starting in 2012, the bipartisan Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act; P.L. 112-106) has scaled regulation for smaller companies and reduced regulations in general for certain types of capital formation. It established a number of new options to expand capital access, including a new provision for crowdfunding. Starting in 2015, parts of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (P.L. 114-94)\u2014referred to as JOBS Act 2.0\u2014provided additional scaled disclosure and reporting related regulatory relief for smaller companies. Following the JOBS Act and JOBS Act 2.0, capital markets regulation has become even more tailored to suit companies of different sizes and with different needs.", "However, concerns over capital formation persisted, given that smaller companies continue to face challenges to accessing capital, and the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) remained at far below long-term average levels post-JOBS Act. To address these concerns, Congress has considered numerous legislative proposals to further expand the scaled approach, with some proposals building on existing JOBS Act provisions. The most notable of these proposals is the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018 (House-amended S. 488), a capital markets package referred to as JOBS Act 3.0. The House replaced the content of the original S. 488 and passed the amended measure by a 406-4 vote on July 17, 2018. The package includes 32 titles, many of which have previously passed the House with bipartisan support as standalone bills. Of the 32 titles, 18 are more capital markets related. They can be grouped under four general categories:", "Expand Investor Access. One approach to expand capital access is to expand the investor pool or enhance investor communications. Some of the provisions propose to expand (1) the type of eligible investors by widening certain eligible investor definitions, as seen in Titles IV and X; (2) the number of eligible investors allowed to participate in certain offerings, as seen in Title XXXII; and (3) the communication to eligible investors by allowing broader outreach, as seen in Title I. Reduce Compliance Costs. Some believe compliance costs could potentially outweigh benefits and are disproportionately burdensome for small and medium-sized businesses. In response to these concerns, certain provisions aim to reduce (Titles V and IX) or better understand (required studies in Titles XXII and XXXI) compliance costs for publicly listed companies. Promote Financial Intermediation. Capital markets consist of numerous players. Between investors and company issuers, who are the end contributors and recipients of funding, there are financial intermediaries that serve to channel funding or execute trades. Titles XXVI (a required study) and XXXII would promote the use of pooled investment vehicles to channel funding from investors to issuers. Title XXIV would require a study on investment research of small issuers, and Title XX would create a designated new marketplace for smaller issuer stock trading. Increase Investor Protection. Multiple S. 488 titles would create investor protection safeguards as part of a provision related to capital formation. Other provisions center on investor protection. For example, Titles XXVII (a required study) and XXIX would provide protection to general investors against corporate insiders, and Title XXX would provide targeted protection to senior investors who are victims of financial exploitation."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The JOBS and Investor Confidence Act ( S. 488 ) is a capital markets package consisting of 32 titles that have mostly already passed the House with bipartisan support as standalone bills. Originally a relatively narrow bill, the earlier version of S. 488 was referred to as the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act and was passed by the Senate on September 11, 2017. The original bill's content was incorporated into Section 507 of S. 2155 , which was signed into law on May 24, 2018 ( P.L. 115-174 ). A substitute amendment to S. 488 was passed by the House on July 17, 2018, in a 406-4 vote (hereinafter, all discussion of S. 488 refers to the House-amended version of the bill). The package has been referred to as JOBS Act 3.0, following after the initial Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act; P.L. 112-106 ) in 2012 and the financial services provisions signed into law as part of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act ( P.L. 114-94 ), which are referred to as JOBS Act 2.0. ", "Some of the provisions in S. 488 are part of a long-running debate about financial market regulation. In response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203 ) on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is generally regarded as a regulatory overhaul that broadly tightened the U.S. financial regulatory landscape. Since the Dodd-Frank Act, there have been multiple attempts to provide regulatory relief through either repeals to sections of the Dodd-Frank Act or new proposals. ", "Two of these legislative attempts to provide regulatory relief are the Financial CHOICE Act (FCA; H.R. 10 ) and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ( S. 2155 , P.L. 115-174 ). H.R. 10 is a wide-ranging financial reform bill that was passed by the House on June 8, 2017. P.L. 115-174 is a narrower proposal that was passed by the Senate on March 14, 2018, and then passed by the House and signed into law in May 2018. Several of the provisions in H.R. 10 that were not included in P.L. 115-174 , many of which are related to capital markets, are included in S. 488 . S. 488 passed the House with close to unanimous support. In addition, many S. 488 provisions were included in a House-passed appropriations bill ( H.R. 6147 ). Table A-1 highlights these provisions. ", "Although S. 488 is generally referred to as a capital markets package, it addresses various other topics; for example, insurance and human trafficking financing (see Table A-1 for a full list of the 32 titles). S. 488 's capital markets provisions are largely focused on smaller companies' access to capital. In addition, several of the titles are oriented toward studies, some of which include recommendations for regulatory action. ", "This report summarizes the 18 capital markets provisions in S. 488 , as amended and passed by the House. Capital markets, for purposes of this report, refer to the segments of the financial system under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight and in which funding is raised through equity or debt securities. The report divides the 18 provisions into four general categories: (1) expand investor access, (2) reduce compliance costs, (3) promote financial intermediation, and (4) increase investor protection. These categories may not be mutually exclusive. For example, the proposed changes to Regulation Crowdfunding (see \" Title XXXII\u2013Crowdfunding Amendments \" section below) could be interpreted as expanding investor access through the amendments to the SEC registration threshold; promoting financial intermediation through the use of pooled investment vehicles; and increasing investor protection through the investment adviser registration requirements. In such case, one primary category is chosen according to the provision's principal functions.

There are two types of securities offerings. One type is called public offerings , which are available to all types of investors and have more rigorous disclosure requirements. By contrast, securities offerings that are exempt from SEC registration are referred to as private offerings and are mainly available to more sophisticated investors. Because public offerings are already accessible by all investors, the discussions of expanding investor access often revolve around private offerings. ", "For purposes of investor protection, private offerings are often limited in the kinds of investors to which they can be offered. Two common approaches to expanding capital access are to expand the investor pool or enhance investor communication for private offerings. Some of the S. 488 provisions propose to expand (1) the type of eligible investors by widening the accredited investor definition, as seen in Titles IV and X; and (2) the communication to eligible investors by allowing broader outreach, as seen in Title I.

The events are often sponsored by angel investors (early-stage investors, mostly high-net-worth individuals), venture capital associations, nonprofits, or universities and are used to communicate that a company is interested in, if not actively seeking, investor financing.", "Rule 506 of Regulation D (Reg D) under the Securities Act of 1933 permits companies to offer privately placed (through private markets) equity or debt securities offerings to any number of accredited investors (financial institutions and individual investors who meet certain asset or income thresholds) and up to 35 nonaccredited investors without being subject to state and federal securities registration requirements. Popular with emerging companies, Rule 506 offerings have no size limits but were historically subject to a general solicitation ban (a prohibition on their general promotion or advertising). Responding to concerns that the ban was unduly burdensome, the JOBS Act amended Rule 506 by creating an offering category under Reg D called Rule 506(c), wherein issuers can engage in general solicitations to accredited investors while taking \"reasonable steps\" to verify that status. After the rule's adoption, whether an issuer was still subject to the general solicitation ban during demo days remained a question for many. ", "The SEC's 2015 question and answer guidance document attempted to provide more clarity. It states that if prospective investors were invited to a demo day by an issuer or a person acting on its behalf via a general solicitation, the issuer can then use Rule 506(c) if it takes reasonable steps to verify that a purchaser is an accredited investor and that the offering is limited to such investors.", "Notwithstanding the SEC guidance, uncertainty over the applicability of the general solicitation ban at demo days has persisted. Moreover, there are other concerns that even if the general solicitation ban was clearly not being enforced at demo days, the demands of the accredited investor verification process would discourage investor interest.", "Title I attempts to address the aforementioned concerns related to demo days. It would require the SEC to revise Rule 506 to clarify that the limits on general solicitation are not applicable to presentations, communications, or events conducted on behalf of an issuer at an event sponsored by certain organizations, including (1) the United States or any territory, the District of Columbia, or any state; (2) a college, university, or other institution of higher education; (3) a nonprofit organization; (4) an angel investor group; (5) a venture forum, venture capital association, or venture capital trade association; or (6) any other group, person, or entity that the SEC designates.

An accredited investor, in the context of an institution, includes certain entities with more than $5 million in assets, as well as regulated entities such as banks and registered investment companies that are not subject to the assets test.", "The income- and net-worth-based definition of an accredited investor has generated criticism, as it arguably suggests that higher net worth equates to investing sophistication. The definition also generates concerns about its sufficiency in capturing those who need investor protection. Some question, for example, whether a senior citizen, who relies on his or her existing net worth as the sole source of financial security, should be eligible for higher-risk investing.", "In addition, the effects of inflation adjustments could be significant in the long run. For example, the current accredited investor thresholds are not inflation adjusted.

Under Section 404(a) of SOX, public companies are required to provide the SEC a top management-prepared report assessing the effectiveness of their internal controls over their financial reporting (processes aimed at ensuring the integrity of financial and accounting disclosures), which may help reduce financial fraud. Section 404(b) of SOX requires a company's outside auditors to attest to that managerial assessment.

Among other things, a VC fund is defined as an entity that (1) represents itself as pursuing a venture capital strategy to its investors and prospective investors; and (2) has no more than 20% of its total assets invested in assets that are not \"qualifying investments,\" equity securities acquired directly from a company that it has invested in (e.g., primary market securities). ", "If a VC fund no longer meets this definition, its adviser must then register with the SEC as a nonexempt private fund adviser under the Investment Adviser Act often at a significant expense. ", "VC funds are often portrayed as engines of economic development. There are concerns, however, over the existence of certain perceived hurdles to their ability to fully play that role. One concern is that VC funds are increasingly challenged because their portfolios of nonqualifying investment, primarily in the form of secondary market shares of their portfolio companies, are nearing the aforementioned 20% limit. As such, VC fund advocates such as the VC fund trade group, the National Venture Capital Association, argue that the secondary market equity 20% limit often causes funds to forgo general investment opportunities. ", "Title XXV would require the SEC to issue rules revising the definition of a VC fund's qualifying investments to include primary market or secondary market equity securities issued by a company that a fund is investing in, expanding the size of a fund's potential portfolio of a company's secondary market securities. SEC-issued rules would also have to provide that a VC fund's qualifying investments must be predominantly primary market securities issued by a firm that it is investing in, an attempt to ensure that a VC fund's corporate acquisitions would have to entail slightly more primary shares than secondary shares.", "Although praised by the VC fund industry, a concern of some critics, including the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer and investor advocate, is that by permitting an expanded VC fund investment presence in secondary market shares, the legislation would shift VC fund activity away from direct primary investment stakes in startup firms.", "CBO estimates that SEC implementation of a similar bill ( H.R. 6177 ) would entail a gross cost of about $1 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title XXVI\u2013Expanding Investment in Small Business", "paragraphs": ["Title XXVI would direct the SEC to study the 10% threshold limitation for \"diversified company\" qualification under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (P.L. 76-768).

To be diversified, a fund must meet several requirements, including that it is not investing in more than 10% of any single issuer's outstanding voting shares.

Some believe that the use of Regulation Crowdfunding could increase with the modifications to the SEC's current treatment of SPVs and the thresholds maintained in the Exchange Act that once crossed, trigger SEC registration. The basic concept of using a SPV (in the form of a crowdfunding vehicle) is to pool money from many individual investments into a single entity, with the SPV organizer to be a single point of contact for all of the SPV's investors. The use of SPVs could expand financial intermediation and promote capital access, whereas the required crowdfunding vehicle adviser registration is a method to mitigate certain investor protection concerns.

Expanding capital formation allows for greater access of investment opportunities for more investors and increased funding for businesses. But expanded capital formation also involves investor protection challenges, including the challenge to ensure that investors, such as less sophisticated retail investors, comprehend the risks they are bearing. For example, proposals that reduce the regulatory compliance that a securities issuer or a market intermediary must comply with can decrease these market participants' compliance costs and increase the speed and efficiency of capital formation. However, this reduced regulation may also expose investors to additional risks. In addition, investor protection can help contribute to healthy and efficient capital markets because investors may be more willing to provide capital, and even at a lower cost, if they have faith in the integrity and transparency of the underlying markets.

The SEC enacted Rule 10b5-1 in 2000 to allow executives to make prearranged trades at a time when they are not in possession of insider information to avoid insider trading inquiries. Yet studies repeatedly show that the Rule may have been abused, evidenced by corporate insider trades within 10b5-1 plans that earned abnormal returns.
