Over the next decade, in response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps. Some of these increases were quite substantial, particularly after FY2006. By FY2012, the authorized end strength for the Army was 562,000, with authority for the Secretary of Defense to increase that to 592,400 if needed to meet operational missions and reorganizational objectives ( P.L. 111-84 , \u00a7403), while the authorized end strength for the Marine Corps was 202,100. With the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in December 2011 and a drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan beginning in 2012, the Army and the Marine Corps have announced plans to reduce their personnel strength to 490,000 and 175,000, respectively, by FY2017. In contrast to the growth of the ground forces in the FY2001-FY2012 time frame, end strength for the Air Force and Navy decreased over this period. The authorized end strength for FY2012 was 332,800 for the Air Force and 325,700 for the Navy. ", "Discussion: With the end of the war in Iraq, and a planned drawdown in Afghanistan over the next few years, the House bill included reductions for the Army (-9,900) and Marine Corps (-4,800) end strengths in comparison to their FY2012 authorized levels. It also reduced the end strengths for the Air Force (-2,417) and the Navy (-3,000). However, the bill mitigated the impact of these cuts somewhat by specifying that those individuals who are being evaluated for disability be excluded in the calculation of end strength (sec. 404). Excluding such ill or injured service members from the end strength \"count\" would effectively increase the number of individuals who can remain on active duty. This is particularly relevant for the ground forces, which still have thousands of wounded personnel in the disability evaluation system. Looking to future years, Section 403 of the House bill sought to temper the pace of the drawdown for ground forces by capping the size of future reductions in Army and Marine Corps end strengths, and by requiring the President to certify that any reductions will not have certain negative impacts. ", "The Senate bill included end-strengths that were identical to the House bill, except that it authorized 786 fewer personnel for the Air Force. The conference report included end-strength levels identical to the House and Senate provisions for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, while authorizing an Air Force end-strength slightly lower than the House and Senate provisions. The conference report adopted the House limitations on end-strength reductions in the Army and Marine Corps for FY2014-17, but did not adopt the certification requirement, budgeting restrictions, or the disability exclusion. However, section 528 of the conference report requires the Service Secretaries to provide certain information to the Congress on possible adverse impacts on readiness and dwell time that are related to the presence of service members in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System.", "Reference(s): Previously discussed in CRS Report R41874, FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Policy Issues , coordinated by [author name scrubbed], and similar reports from earlier years.

Much of this can be attributed to the reduction in Navy Reserve strength during this period. There were also modest shifts in strength for some other components of the Selected Reserve. For comparative purposes, the authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves for FY2001 were as follows: Army National Guard (350,526), Army Reserve (205,300), Navy Reserve (88,900), Marine Corps Reserve (39,558), Air National Guard (108,022), Air Force Reserve (74,358), and Coast Guard Reserve (8,000). Between FY2001 and FY2012, the largest shifts in authorized end strength have occurred in the Army National Guard (+7,674 or +2%), Coast Guard Reserve (+2,000 or +25%), Air Force Reserve (-2,958 or -4%), and Navy Reserve (-22,700 or -26%). A smaller change occurred in the Air National Guard (-1,322 or -1.2%), while the authorized end strength of the Army Reserve (-300 or -0.15%) and the Marine Corps Reserve (+42 or +0.11%) have been largely unchanged during this period.", "Discussion: In both the House and Senate bills, and the conference report, the authorized Selected Reserve end strengths for FY2013 are the same as those for FY2012 for the Army National Guard, the Army Reserve, and the Marine Corps Reserve. The Navy Reserve's authorized end strength was 66,200 in FY2012, but the Administration requested a decrease to 62,500 (-3,700) which the House and Senate approved, as did the conferees. The Coast Guard Reserve's authorized end strength was 10,000 in FY2012, but the Administration requested a decrease to 9,000 (-1,000), which the House and Senate also approved, as did the conferees. The Air National Guard's end strength in FY2012 was 106,700 and the Air Force Reserve's was 71,400. The Administration proposed reducing these to 101,600 (-5,100) and 70,500 (-900), respectively. The proposed reductions were largely based on Air Force plans to divest, transfer, or retire certain aircraft from Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units. These proposals were quite controversial, and the House and Senate rejected them, authorizing only a small reduction in end strength for the Air National Guard (-695 for the House, -265 for the Senate) and increasing the end strength for the Air Force Reserve (+1,028) in comparison to FY12. The committee report accompanying the House bill noted that \"the committee's increase to the President's FY13 budget request reflects the corresponding manpower requirements for the committee's limitation on retiring, divesting or transferring any aircraft assigned to the Air Force.\" The committee report accompanying the Senate bill stated, \"The committee supports the Department of Defense fiscal year 2013 request for reserve component end strengths, with the exception of additional Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve end strength to support force structure changes adopted by the committee\" and later, \"The committee believes that there is little justification for the relative imbalance in the cuts applied to the Air National Guard.\" The conference report adopted strength levels below the House and Senate provisions, and below the FY12 levels (-1000 Air National Guard, -520 Air Force Reserve) but still substantially higher than the Administration request (+4,100 Air National Guard, +380 Air Force Reserve).", "References: None.", "CRS Point of Contact: [author name scrubbed], x[phone number scrubbed].

Section 1009 of Title 37 provides a permanent formula for an automatic annual military pay raise that indexes the raise to the annual increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The President's FY2013 Budget request for a 1.7% military pay raise is consistent with this formula. However, Congress has at times approved pay raises different from the ECI. For example, in fiscal years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010, the pay raise was equal to the ECI plus 0.5%.", "Discussion: Section 601 of the House bill provides an increase identical to that requested by the Administration, which is also the same as the pay raise specified by 37 U.S.C. 1009. The Senate bill contains no statutory language; in the absence of statutory language, the automatic pay increase would be 1.7%. The conference committee adopted the House language, which specifies a 1.7% pay increase effective January 1, 2013. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the total cost of a 1.7% military pay raise would be $1.3 billion in 2013.

With P.L. 112-81 , Section 351, Congress expanded the list of those eligible to adopt these dogs to include the handler (if wounded), or a parent, spouse, child, or sibling of the handler in cases where the handler is deceased.

Currently, they are classified as \"equipment,\" which means that anyone interested in adopting one of these dogs must pay the transportation costs. Military working dogs are trained to be fearless and aggressive. These traits may not be desired outside of the military or law enforcement. There is public concern for the welfare of these dogs.

A plain reading of the term suggests that men and women would be required to meet the same physical standards (e.g., carry the same load, the same distance at the same speed) in order to be similarly assigned. However, in the past, the Services have used this and similar terms to suggest that men and women must exert the same amount of energy (e.g., calories used) in a particular task, regardless of the work that is actually accomplished by either. Hypothetically speaking, if a female soldier carries 70 pounds of equipment five miles and exerts the same effort as a male carrying 100 pounds of equipment the same distance, the differing standards could be viewed as 'gender-neutral' because both exerted the same amount of effort, with differing loads.

Concerns have been raised over the potential conflicts of DADT and religious expressions against homosexuality. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\u2026.\" Various federal laws and regulations also seek to protect religious practices and freedoms, and the Department of Defense has issued regulations concerning religious exercise in the military. The extent to which service members and chaplains can freely exercise their religion while complying with policies related to the repeal of DADT is a topic of ongoing debate.", "Discussion: The language in Section 533 would give service members and chaplains broad permission to publicly support or condemn certain sexual practices on the grounds of conscience or religious tenets. Arguably, this is to protect the free speech and religious rights of service members in the wake of the repeal of DADT. The language also ensures that no disciplinary actions may be taken against a chaplain who refuses to comply with a direction or duty that is contrary to either the chaplain's personal or religious beliefs. The section raises some First Amendment issues, particularly whether the repeal of DADT limits what chaplains are able to say within their ministries, and whether, for example, they can be compelled to provide counseling and other services that run counter to denominational doctrine. Although anti-discrimination policies are already in place, some groups argue that with the repeal of DADT, service members are allowed no protections for expressing their religious beliefs regarding same-sex behaviors and this new provision is needed. Others argue that the provision could create a hostile climate for openly homosexual members of the military, and possibly incite harassment or violence.
