AEF requirements apply equally to U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and foreign entities. Designing a transparent and comprehensive AEF definition has proven difficult and has evolved over the years. The current set of laws and rules governing farm program eligibility\u2014for both family and nonfamily members on farm operations\u2014remain subject to considerable scrutiny and criticism from both rural and farm advocacy groups as well as certain Members of Congress. In particular, critics contend that current U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) eligibility criteria\u2014especially for providing active personal management\u2014remain broad and subjective and may represent a low threshold to qualify for payments, thus facilitating the creation of new farm operation members simply to expand an operation's farm payment receipts.", "Three major categories of legal entities are subject to AEF requirement for program payment eligibility: an individual, a partnership, and a corporation.", "An individual must meet three specific AEF criteria. First, independently and separately from other individuals with an interest in the farm business, the person makes a significant contribution to the operation of: (a) capital, equipment, or land; and (b) active personal labor and/or active personal management. Second, the person's share of profits or losses is commensurate with his/her contribution to the farming operation. Third, the person shares in the risk of loss from the farming operation.", "An individual that meets the AEF criteria is eligible for farm program payments but subject to annual payment limits. If a married person meets the AEF requirements, any spouse will also be considered to have met the AEF requirements, thus effectively doubling the individual payment limit. Also, every family member 18 years or older who receives income based on the farm's operating results is deemed to meet the AEF requirements and is eligible for a separate payment limit. Another exception to AEF requirements is made for landowners provided they receive income based on the farm's operating results.", "A general partnership is an association of multiple persons whereby each member is treated separately and individually for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits. A partnership's potential payment limit is equal to the limit for a single person times the number of persons or legal entities that comprise the operation's ownership and meet the AEF requirements. Thus, adding a new member can potentially provide an additional payment limit. A corporation is an association of joint owners that is treated as a single person for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits, provided that the entity meets the AEF and other eligibility criteria. Adding a new member generally does not affect a corporation's payment limit but only increases the number of members that can share a single payment limit.", "In accordance with a provision in the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79; \u00a71604), USDA added more specificity to the role that a nonfamily member of a partnership or joint venture must play to qualify for farm program benefits. However, considerable issues remain that may be of interest to Congress. Long-standing concerns remain that some farm operations are organized to overcome program payment limits and maximize the amount of their farm program payments. In particular, some advocacy groups suggest that USDA's new rule did not go far enough in tightening AEF criteria and that it continues to allow for a high number of farm managers and associated payment limits for both family and nonfamily farm operations."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), under the authority of Congress as enunciated in periodic farm legislation, provides support to the U.S. farm economy through a variety of federal farm programs.

This variation has generated considerable interest\u2014by both the general public and Congress\u2014in who is eligible to participate in farm programs and, thus, may receive payments. The concern over program eligibility also derives, in part, from instances where farm payments have accrued to individuals who have never engaged in farming. ", "Program eligibility requirements and payment limits are central to how many U.S. farm programs operate and how support dollars are distributed across the nation. In particular, eligibility requirements and payment limits determine who receives federal farm program payments and how much they receive. A number of statutory and regulatory requirements govern federal farm program eligibility for benefits under various programs. A key aspect of eligibility for major farm revenue support programs is the requirement that a person be \"actively engaged in farming\" (AEF)\u2014that is, that a person contribute either labor or management time (or both) to the farm's operation. Not all farm programs are subject to the same AEF criteria, and the criteria often apply differently based on the type of legal entity owning the farm operation.

This is followed by a description of all of the key terms and concepts involved in defining a farm business and farm program payment recipient, including the three major types of farm business organizations (sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation). Then the report discusses current requirements used to define a person or entity as being \"actively engaged in farming\" (AEF) by type of legal entity. This is followed by a description of a 2015 USDA rule\u2014released subsequent to the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 )\u2014that clarifies what constitutes AEF for nonfamily members of a farming operation, how more than one nonfamily person may qualify as an active farm manager (subject to a limit of three farm managers), and the recordkeeping requirements necessary to meet this new criteria. Finally, the report discusses several issues that may be of potential interest to Congress concerning regulations governing the implementation and monitoring of AEF criteria.", "A 2014 discussion of farm program payment limit and eligibility issues by farmdoc daily states:", "Payment limits are a technical and legal issue.

According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congress was motivated to pass the Farm Program Payments Integrity Act after hearing several concerns about farm payments going to individuals not involved in farming. This law required that an individual or entity meet AEF criteria to receive farm commodity payments. ", "Since their establishment, AEF criteria have been a requirement for payment eligibility for most farm revenue support programs. Since 1996, an average of about $9 billion per year in farm support program payments have been subject to the AEF criteria. Thus, significant taxpayer resources are at stake. However, designing a transparent and comprehensive definition of what it means to be AEF has proven difficult. ", "In 2004, GAO contended that USDA regulations failed to specify a measurable standard for what constituted \"a significant contribution of active personal management.\" Furthermore, GAO argued that, by not specifying such a measurable standard, USDA allowed individuals with little or no involvement in a farming operation to qualify for payments. ", "As a consequence of such criticism, the definition of AEF has evolved over the years as Congress and USDA\u2014via its regulatory powers\u2014have attempted to tighten payment eligibility criteria. For example, the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) added more specificity to the definition of person and legal entity . It limited qualifying payments via direct attribution to persons or legal entities with ownership interests in joint ventures that pooled the resources of multiple payment recipients. It also expanded a separate payment limit to the spouses of qualifying farm payment recipients. Yet GAO continued to argue that further specificity was needed for AEF criteria.", "The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 , \u00a71604) required USDA, in new regulations, to add more specificity to the role that a nonfamily producer who is a member of a legal entity\u2014primarily a partnership or joint venture\u2014must have to qualify for farm program benefits. ", "In general, family farms receive special treatment in which every adult family member 18 years or older who receives income based on the farm's operating results is deemed to meet the AEF requirements. Prior to the 2018 farm bill, family membership was based on lineal ascendants or descendants but was also extended to siblings and spouses. The 2018 farm bill (\u00a71703) further extended the definition of family member to include first cousins, nieces, and nephews. As a result, the current set of laws and rules governing farm program eligibility\u2014particularly for family members of a farm operation\u2014remain subject to considerable scrutiny and criticism from both rural and farm advocacy groups as well as certain Members of Congress.

Sole proprietorship or family farm . The farm business is run by a single operator or multiple adult family members\u2014the linkage being common family lineage\u2014where each qualifying member is subject to an individual payment limit.
