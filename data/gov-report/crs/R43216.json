A security clearance alone does not grant an individual access to classified materials. Rather, a security clearance means that an individual is eligible for access. In order to gain access to specific classified materials, an individual should also have a demonstrated \"need to know\" the information contained in the specific classified materials.", "There are three levels of security clearances: Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret, which correspond to the levels of sensitivity of the information that a cleared individual will be eligible to access. In addition, there are two major categories of classified information that require additional handling and access restrictions\u2014Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), which includes intelligence sources, methods, and processes, and Special Access Programs (SAPs), which are highly sensitive projects and programs. These categories exist for classified information that has been deemed particularly vulnerable. Eligibility standards and investigative requirements for access to SCI and SAPs are higher than for access to information otherwise classified at the same level, which further restricts the number of individuals eligible for access.", "Federal employees and private contractors must be cleared in order to gain access to classified materials. An individual may not obtain or initiate a security clearance on his or her own. A sponsoring federal agency initiates the process and will make the final security clearance determination based on a background investigation.", "Although the process involves a number of stages, the key steps to obtaining and maintaining a security clearance are (1) agency sponsorship and submission of clearance application materials; (2) a background investigation, the extent of which may vary by level of clearance; and (3) adjudication to determine whether an individual is deemed eligible for access. Adjudication and final clearance determinations are generally handled by the sponsoring agency. To maintain a security clearance, an individual is also subject to periodic reinvestigations and, more recently, continuous monitoring and evaluation of his or her background.", "Previously, the Office of Personnel Management, Federal Investigative Services (OPM-FIS) oversaw approximately 95% of all background investigations. On October 1, 2016, President Obama transferred responsibility for investigative work and related services from OPM-FIS to the newly established National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB). Like OPM-FIS, the NBIB conducts some of the investigative work itself and contracts the rest out to private firms.", "Typically, the costs of a background investigation, including background investigations of private contractors, are paid for by the requesting agency.

During this phase, the agency makes a determination that an employee or contractor requires access to classified information for the completion of his or her duties. At the request of the sponsoring agency, the individual will submit his or her clearance application material (e.g., Standard Form SF86). Investigation . Using the information provided by the applicant in his or her clearance application materials, a background investigation of the applicant is conducted. The background investigation may vary in terms of content, cost, and length of time for completion depending, in part, on the level of clearance being sought. The National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB) within OPM is responsible for overseeing the majority of personnel background investigations. Adjudication . Once the background investigation is complete, the application enters the adjudication phase. During this phase, a determination is made whether to grant the applicant a security clearance. Generally, this decision is made by the sponsoring agency and is based on the information obtained during the background investigation. Reinvestigation. Individuals who hold security clearances are subject to periodic reinvestigations. Previously, the maximum number of years that a security clearance remained valid was tied to the individual's clearance level. For example, reinvestigations for someone with a Confidential clearance, the least demanding, occurred at least once every 15 years; Secret, at least once every ten years; and Top Secret, at least once every five years. OPM and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), however, reduced the reinvestigation timeline to five years for all clearance holders, regardless of access level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Are Private Contractors Subject to the Same Clearance Process as Federal Employees?", "paragraphs": ["Private contractors are subject to the same clearance procedures as direct government employees.

The process differs slightly for an individual who is employed by a company that performs work under contract with the federal government. First, the contractor must determine whether the employee requires access to classified information in order to perform the duties of his or her position. The contractor must inform the sponsoring agency (i.e., the \"customer\" agency for whom the work is being performed) that the employee requires access to classified materials.

Adverse information regarding one of the guidelines will not automatically result in denial of a security clearance.

In addition, some agencies may allow applicants to appeal or challenge unfavorable results of a polygraph examination that was conducted as part of his or her security clearance background investigation. Appeals are typically handled within the agency and decided by the agency's personal security appeals board or by an administrative judge.

For example, each agency has authority to conduct an additional investigation if the one on record is a certain number of years old, and each agency may add additional requirements to the process, such as a polygraph examination. Reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and ODNI cite anecdotal evidence which suggests that agencies may be reluctant to accept the background investigations or security clearance determinations made by other agencies.
