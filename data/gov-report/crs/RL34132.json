In FY1999 and every year since FY2002, however, annual agriculture appropriations acts have prohibited the use of those mandatory funds for the purposes the Agriculture Committees intended.

The CFTC's functions include oversight of trading on the futures exchanges, registration and supervision of futures industry personnel, prevention of fraud and price manipulation, and investor protection. Although most futures trading is now related to financial variables (interest rates, currency prices, and stock indexes), congressional oversight remains vested in the agricultural committees because of the market's historical origins as an adjunct to agricultural trade.", "For FY2008, the Administration has requested $116.0 million for the CFTC, an increase of 18.4% over FY2007's appropriation under the continuing resolution of $98 million. The Administration's budget also proposes that a fee be imposed on users of the futures markets to pay for the cost of federal regulation. To fund the CFTC at the $116 million level, a fee of about 5\u00a2 per transaction on the futures exchanges would be required. Every administration since Ronald Reagan's has proposed a similar fee, but Congress has never enacted one. (For more information on the futures transaction fee, see CRS Report RS22415, Proposed Transaction Fee on Futures Contracts , by [author name scrubbed].)", "The enacted appropriation for FY2008 is $111.266 million (after rescission), which is $13 million\u00a0(+13.6%) more than the appropriation in FY2007. The increase provides for an additional 17\u00a0FTEs for more oversight of futures markets, and for information technology costs, both of which were in the Administration's request. It does not adopt the proposed user fees on futures\u00a0transactions.", "The enacted amount is between the amounts for CFTC in the House and Senate bills. The House bill provided $102.6 million for the CFTC as an appropriation from the general fund. The Senate amount was $116 million and was in H.R. 2829 , the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2008."], "subsections": []}]}}
