The additional rebate owed for each drug is the amount the manufacturer increased the drug's AMP above the product's inflation-rate-adjusted AMP since the product was introduced. As the manufacturer increases the drug's AMP above the inflation rate, it owes a larger additional rebate. ", "Under previous law, modifications to existing drug products, such as new doses or formulations, generally were considered new products for determining drug manufacturers' Medicaid rebate obligations. As a result, drug manufacturers could incur a lower additional rebate when they introduced a new line-extension formulation that was based on an existing product. For example, under previous law, drug manufacturers often introduced extended-release formulations of existing products that were considered new products. While line-extension formulations generally are introduced at a higher price than the reference product from which they were derived, the additional rebate is calculated from the most recent date of introduction of the line-extension rather than from the date the reference product was introduced. As a result, drug manufacturers often owe an additional rebate on the reference product, but owe little or no additional rebate on the line-extension drug introduced at a later date.
