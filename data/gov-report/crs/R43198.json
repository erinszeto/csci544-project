Environmental groups have recently filed a lawsuit against the BNSF Railway Company and several coal companies under the Clean Water Act in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Project supporters have argued that the projects would create or maintain jobs in the construction, mining, and transportation industries and bring increased tax revenue to the states. Supporters such as the coal companies and labor unions also argue that many potential adverse impacts can be mitigated. Some stakeholders are taking a wait-and-see approach\u2014recognizing potential benefits, but waiting to see what the cumulative effects of the various port terminal projects may be, including mitigation measures that would be implemented, before deciding whether potential benefits outweigh adverse impacts.", "Stakeholder concerns over the cumulative impacts to communities, tribes, states, and regions primarily pertain to effects of increased rail and barge transport of PRB coal through the Pacific Northwest. Considering the pending and potential projects, it would appear that annual PRB coal export capacity could expand to exceed 100 million short tons. Rail industry representatives have stated that such an increase in export capacity could result in 8 to 16 additional trains per day. The coal would arrive through the Columbia River Gorge by rail from the PRB in Montana and Wyoming, and continue by rail and/or barge to export facilities in Washington and Oregon. ", "The potential for an increase in mile-and-a-half long coal trains has generated concern regarding potential adverse impacts from increased coal dust emissions to air and deposition to land or surface water; traffic congestion and increased wait times at rail crossings; potential derailments or delays to emergency response vehicles; and noise and vibrations high enough to cause structural damage. Dredging and construction activities in waterways to accommodate increased barge traffic and deep-water vessels have also generated concern over potential impacts to fisheries, marine ecosystems, or endangered species habitat. Also, some stakeholders have cited broader global climate change impacts associated with increased coal burning in Asia. ", "Project proponents argue that many of the potential adverse effects, particularly those related to increased barge and rail transport, can be mitigated or largely eliminated. However, some stakeholders have expressed concern that the potentially broader, cumulative impacts of pending and possible future projects will not be adequately identified and, thus, not be addressed.

This viewpoint was rejected by the Corps of Engineers, stating that an analysis of the potential broad-based impacts, i.e., from mining through burning U.S. coal overseas, was beyond their scope and jurisdiction. However, the Washington Department of Ecology has plans for a comprehensive review of environmental, transportation, health, and climate issues before the coal ports can be built.

For the United States, on the one hand, increasing production of U.S. coal would tend to increase related methane emissions above what would otherwise occur. On the other hand, coal exports would tend to raise domestic coal prices and thereby tend to curb U.S. coal use and related emissions.

Past Congresses have resolved that binding commitments from such countries must be made for the United States to bind itself to GHG emissions under the UNFCCC.

Projects with uncertain impacts require preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) to determine whether the impacts would be significant. The Corps has identified permit issuance among those actions normally requiring an EA, but not necessarily an EIS.

The scoping phase is currently underway for the GPT and MBT projects. As a result, the full range of issues that will be analyzed in each EIS is not yet known. However, in determining the scope of an EIS, the Corps is required to consider connected, cumulative, or similar project-related actions and the resulting direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of those actions. ", "Permit applications pending before the Corps for export terminal expansion projects in Oregon and Washington may be considered connected or similar actions that would result in certain indirect or cumulative impacts. What is uncertain, however, is how broadly the Corps may define those terms. For example, it is unclear whether the Corps may identify increased train traffic out of Montana or Wyoming as an indirect effect of increasing coal export capacity related to permit issuance for the GPT or MBT projects. Also, given the current limits to commercial rail capacity in Washington and Oregon, it is not known whether the Corps would identify the potential need to expand rail capacity as a reasonably foreseeable indirect effect of port terminal permit approval. The potential need for new rail construction or the expansion of existing rail facilities may be particularly relevant if such activities were subject to approval from the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (i.e., a federal action subject to NEPA). ", "While it is difficult to determine the full range of project-related actions and resulting impacts that the Corps may include in the EA and EISs currently being prepared, a letter from the Corps indicates its approach to the environmental review process for the proposed projects. In response to a letter from Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber regarding concerns over the cumulative impacts of port terminal projects proposed in Washington and Oregon, the Corps states, in part: ", "The effects that the Corps will consider in the review of each project proposal will include the specific activity requiring a DA [Department of the Army] permit, and those portions of the entire project over which there is sufficient federal control and responsibility to warrant Corps NEPA review. Based on existing law and DA regulations, the Corps will extend its scope of analysis beyond the proposed activity with the Corps jurisdiction\u2026only where the Corps determines that extension to be appropriate under its NEPA regulations and other relevant authorities.", "What are unknown are which activities the Corps may determine are beyond its jurisdiction, but appropriate for consideration under NEPA. So far, at least, there appears to be some disagreement between EPA and the Corps over the potential project impacts that should be addressed during the NEPA process. ", "In an April 2012 letter to the Corps, EPA notes various elements of the Coyote Island terminal project that led EPA to determine that an EIS was necessary for that project. That determination alone conflicts with the Corps' determination that the project would, at least initially, require the preparation of an EA. Additionally, in delineating the project impacts that warrant the preparation of an EIS, EPA identified the potential public health impacts from coal dust and diesel pollution related to the proposed Coyote Island terminal project; the high level of interest and concern among communities, agencies, interest groups, and industries regarding the proposal to transport coal from Wyoming and Montana to Asia; the uncertainty of potential impacts of transporting large quantities of PRB coal, including trans loading activities on the Columbia River; and the proposed and potential future projects' contribution to cumulatively significant impacts to human health and the environment from increases in greenhouse gas emissions, rail traffic, mining activities on public lands, and the transport of particulate matter and mercury from Asia to the United States, among other possible impacts.", "To address the cumulative impacts, EPA recommended that the Corps conduct a broadly scoped cumulative impacts analysis of exporting large quantities of PRB-mined coal through the U.S. West Coast to Asia. The Corps has taken another approach and, as stated earlier, the Corps is preparing an EA for the Coyote Island terminal project and individual EISs for the other pending projects. EPA's assessment of potential project effects that should be included for analysis appears to be broader than the project-specific effects that the Corps would address in the NEPA documents for the three currently pending projects.

It may be sometime after the scoping process is complete before it is known how extensively the Corps will consider indirect and cumulative impacts of the proposed projects.
