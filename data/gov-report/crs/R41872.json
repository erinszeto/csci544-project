The Senate was not meant to be a passive participant. Delegates to the Philadelphia convention believed that the Senate would be knowledgeable about nominees and capable of voting wisely. Yet, for the most part, it has acted cautiously, uncertain of the scope of its own constitutional power. The source of this uncertainty is not the Constitution. Nowhere in that document, or in its history, is there an obligation on the part of the Senate to approve a nomination. On the contrary, the burden should be on the President to select and submit a nominee with acceptable credentials.", "Others have said that the Senate should allow the President greater leeway in his choices for office than is currently the case. For example, law professor John C. Eastman told the Senate Rules Committee on June 5, 2003, that ", "... the appointment power is located in Article II of the Constitution, which defines the powers of the President, not in Article I, which defines the powers of the legislature. As the Supreme Court itself has noted, by vesting appointment power in Article II, the framers of our Constitution intended to place primary responsibility for appointments in the President. The \"advice and consent\" role for the Senate, then, was to be narrowly construed.", "The practice of the Senate, however, has not systematically reflected either of these perspectives. Historically, the nomination and confirmation of presidential appointments has been regulated not by strict, formal rules, but rather by informal customs that can change (and have changed) over the years, as the relative balance of power between the President and the Senate ebbs and flows. It is these customs which form the process, according to appointments expert Michael J. Gerhardt. ", "These informal arrangements\u2014those not clearly required or clearly prohibited by the Constitution\u2014have come to define the dynamic in the federal appointments process. The informal arrangements through which the system operates\u2014including senatorial courtesy; logrolling; individual holds, \"blue slips;\" consultation between presidents, members of Congress, and other interested parties, including judges; interest group lobbying; strategic leaking by administrations, senators and interest groups; manipulation of the press; the media's effort to influence the news; and nominees' campaigning\u2014are the sum and substance of the federal appointments process. Studying these arrangements provides even greater illumination than studying Supreme Court decisions or the Constitution itself of how the different branches of the federal government interact on matters of mutual concern.", "Under these informal customs, individual Senators have, historically, been deeply involved in the nomination and confirmation process. The procedures and traditions that have developed have tended to protect the autonomy of individual Senators to choose how to fulfill the advice and consent role, rather than to dictate the process for all Senators.", "It is this combination\u2014unwritten Senate traditions and the protection of each Senator's rights\u2014that has led critics to call for changes in the legislative branch's process. \"[T]he Senate's confirmation process is entirely consistent with all of its other norms, traditions and rules. Concern for the rights and prerogatives of individual senators gives rise to numerous opportunities for obstruction and delay,\" argued political scientists Nolan McCarty and Rose Razaghian.", "On the other hand, as congressional scholar Sarah Binder noted, \"Most presidential nominees emerge from the Senate confirmation process and are eventually confirmed.\" In the 111 th Congress, for example, the President submitted 964 nominations to executive branch positions, and 843 of those were eventually confirmed for an 87% success rate.", "The 112 th Congress has made some changes to the appointments process, which will be discussed throughout the remainder of this report. This was not the first time in recent years that the appointments process has been addressed. Changes to the appointments process during presidential transitions were included in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, for example.

", "The Senate's committees perform an important information-gathering function on those nominated to top posts of the government. Each committee typically gathers biographical and financial information on each of the nominations it receives. The executive branch does not routinely provide the information it has gathered on the nominee to the Senate, so committees may have to do their own research. Sometimes, committees also review the results of an FBI investigation on the nominee. Most committees will not act on a nomination until all of this information is obtained; some formalize this by including in their rules a waiting period between the committee's receipt of the nomination and committee action on it.", "Committees consider nominations at business meetings, also called markups. A majority of the committee must be physically present to report the nomination to the full Senate, and a majority must support the motion to report the nomination. Typically, committees do not write reports on nominations, as they may do with legislation reported from committee.", "Nominations reported by a committee are placed on the Senate's Executive Calendar , and must lay over one day before the full Senate may act on them. A simple majority vote, a quorum being present, is required to confirm a nomination, but, if there is significant opposition, supporters of a nomination may first need to win a super-majority vote to end debate (60 votes) before the simple majority confirmation vote can take place.", "The majority leader is responsible for setting the agenda for the Senate, including scheduling debate and votes on nominations. Although the motion to consider a nomination is typically not debatable, the nomination itself is subject to debate. That means Senators who are opposed to a nomination may prevent the Senate from taking a final vote on it by means of extended debate. The only recourse the majority leader has to force an end to the debate on a nomination is to use the cloture process, which would then require the support of 60 Senators to end the debate and vote on the confirmation of the nomination.", "The vast majority of the Senate's business, however, especially on nominations, is conducted pursuant to a unanimous consent (UC) agreement. A UC agreement establishes the procedural blueprint for consideration of a measure or matter. It must be agreed upon by all Senators to take effect. For example, a UC on a nomination might set a date and time the Senate will begin debate on it and perhaps include a specific time length for the debate, three hours. Such a UC, if agreed to by the Senate, would preclude a Senator from delaying the final vote by extended debate.", "When a Senator informs his or her party leader that they would object to a unanimous consent agreement to debate and vote on a nomination, this is typically referred to as a \"hold.\" Absent a unanimous consent agreement, the majority leader may decide not to bring up a nomination even though a majority of the Senate may support the nominee, because the Senate would have to spend several days of session to end debate and get to the confirmation vote.", "Even after a committee reports a nomination, lack of floor action may send the process back to the beginning. Anytime the Senate is in a recess of more than 30 days, all nominations not yet confirmed are to be returned to the President. If the President still desires to fill the jobs with the people he had chosen, he must resubmit the nominations to the Senate, and they all must go through the committee process, even those that the committees had previously reported.", "At any of the above stages, the Senate may alter how the process works if all Senators agree. For example, some nominations for Cabinet secretaries do not get referred to committee and may be considered by the Senate the same day they are received. Or Senators may agree not to refer a nomination to committee (and perhaps allow its immediate consideration on the floor) or to discharge the nomination from the committee and agree to its immediate confirmation. Frequently, before the annual August recess, the Senate agrees to a unanimous consent agreement that prevents all but a few nominations from returning to the President, despite the requirements discussed above.

But most of the elongation of the appointments process is the consequence of a steady accumulation of inquiries, investigations, and reviews aimed at avoiding political embarrassment. These include extensive vetting, lengthy interviews, background checks, examinations of government computer records, completion of questionnaires and forms composed of hundreds of questions, FBI full-field investigations, public financial disclosure, and conflicts of interest analysis.

According to data from the most recent edition of the Plum Book , as of 2008, the number of executive branch PAS positions had increased by approximately 365 since the outset of the Kennedy Administration. Most of this increase can be attributed to the creation of new departments and agencies with PAS positions over that time period. For example, the Departments of Transportation, Energy, Education, and Homeland Security all have a number of PAS positions; other agencies created during that period with PAS positions include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Election Commission, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Additionally, existing agencies saw a gradual increase in the number of PAS positions.

As discussed above, there are several executive branch entities involved in the background check process, including the White House, OGE, and the FBI. Any information that is overlooked during a background check and surfaces later can be potentially embarrassing to a President, so it is in the President's interest to have a very thorough vetting process for nominees. As a result, the scrutiny that has been applied to nominees has increased over time, according to a former director of presidential personnel, with candidates often answering similar questions at least two or three times. In addition, as a result of the increase in the number of PAS positions the President has to fill, the selection process has slowed. Thus, before the President even sends a nomination to the Senate, the selection and vetting of that nominee may be time consuming. ", "The background checks for nominees are essentially restarted once the nomination is sent to the Senate, since it appears that the President tends not to share the background information with the Senate. The Ethics in Government Act requires OGE to give an ethics report to the appropriate committee of jurisdiction for each nomination. The ethics report includes one of the standard forms for financial disclosure, as well as an ethics agreement describing potential conflicts of interest.

A large number of vacancies, especially during a party turnover transition, can lead to a bottleneck in the selection and vetting process.", "Some studies have identified the appointments process during presidential transitions as particularly problematic. For example, the Obama Administration's transition, according to a 2010 study, started out well-organized and well-financed. After the inauguration, however, issues such as \"a shift in personnel directors from the transition to the White House, Senate delays, a decision to stiffen vetting requirements following nominee tax issues and other problems\" slowed the President's rate of filling his Administration. ", "Other recent events have also highlighted some characteristics of the duration of the presidential appointments process. The 9/11 Commission identified several Cabinet positions that were still vacant during the first few months of the George W. Bush Administration, suggesting that the President's delayed ability in getting his team together may have compromised some national security policymaking in those first few months of the new Administration. Because of the delayed election results after the election of 2000, the Bush Administration was at a particular disadvantage for filling vacant positions in a timely manner. ", "There may be several consequences of a slow appointments process. For example, a slow appointments process may have a negative effect on the new President's ability to govern. One study suggested that a high number of vacancies at the outset of a new President's Administration can contribute to a lag in agency productivity: \"These delays in agency staffing have detrimental consequences. Without political appointees, regulation and enforcement actions have lagged.\" The same report also suggested that vacancies in Senate-confirmed positions may give a higher level of influence within the President's administration to some presidential advisors who are not subject to advice and consent.

The second provision required the establishment of a working group to make recommendations to speed up the vetting of nominees.

For example, in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 that established the Department of Homeland Security, the section of the law that established the position of Secretary read as follows: \"There is a Secretary of Homeland Security, appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" Other statutes creating PAS positions have similar language. To remove the advice and consent requirements for the positions covered by P.L. 112-166 , the legislation amended each section of the U.S. Code that established the 163 positions generally by striking the phrase \"by and with advice and consent of the Senate.\" The President now has the ability to fill these positions without consulting the Senate. P.L. 112-166 converted the positions to \"PA\" positions, or presidentially appointed positions.", "The law's supporters have said that the positions listed in the law were not significant enough to necessitate Senate consideration, which is why they were chosen to be included. Many of the positions were assistant secretaries for administration or public affairs and other lower-level policy positions within agencies. Senator Alexander, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said on the Senate floor upon introduction of S. 679 that \"these are the ones the Senate does not need to spend time on.\" Senator Schumer also stated that \"all of the positions covered in this proposal tend to be non-controversial and most closely resemble appointments that are currently made without Senate approval.\" According to these and other floor statements on the bill, \"Removing these positions from Senate confirmation will allow a new administration to be set up with more efficiency and speed, thus making government work better for the people.\"", "The section of P.L. 112-166 eliminating the advice and consent requirements from the 163 positions took effect 60 days after enactment, on October 9, 2012.

The bill's sponsors had said that these positions should not require Senate confirmation, and the President should be able to appoint those individuals immediately upon entering the White House to get the new Administration up and running. As one of the bill's cosponsors stated, \"Many of these positions have little or no policy role, such as the Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs at the Department of Commerce, or are internal management or administration positions, such as chief financial officers or assistant secretaries for public affairs.\"", "The bill as reported removed the advice and consent role for assistant secretaries for public affairs and assistant secretaries for legislative affairs. Ultimately, assistant secretaries for legislative affairs were removed from the bill (as a part of a manager's amendment agreed to by voice vote), while assistant secretaries for public affairs remained in the bill. As with the CFOs, which were also removed from S. 679 , the legislative affairs positions were later added to S.Res. 116 .", "The other positions included in P.L. 112-166 appear to be positions that the sponsors of the legislation consider to be lower-level policy positions. For example, the law eliminated the advice and consent requirements for the Rural Utilities Service administrator and seven commissioners of the Mississippi River Commission.

These nominations now bypass formal committee consideration unless any single Senator objected to using the expedited process. The nominations originally included in this resolution tend not to be controversial and typically require little individual floor debate for confirmation. They must remain advice and consent positions because of the responsibilities of the boards and councils under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The positions added to the resolution during Senate floor debate do not have the same requirement.", "In addition, many of the boards are structured to have a partisan political balance, and Senator Schumer said that retaining advice and consent over these positions allows the Senate to protect the bipartisan balance.", "S.Res. 116 was reported by the Senate Rules and Administration Committee on May 12, 2011; the full Senate amended and then agreed to the resolution on June 29, 89-8. The Senate agreed to a manager's amendment that added 39 positions to the list of those covered by the resolution (for the list of covered nominations, please see Appendix B ). These positions had been included in the other nomination process bill ( S. 679 ), and were moved by the Senate to S.Res. 116 to allow Senators to retain some of their control over the positions through the advice and consent process.

The nomination will remain on this list for 10 days of session, after which it will move to the existing section called \"Nominations\" on the Calendar. Presumably, a nomination will not be eligible for floor consideration until it had moved to the \"Nominations\" section of the Executive Calendar , though the resolution does not specifically state this.", "At any time after the receipt of a nomination and until it is placed on the \"Nominations\" section of the calendar, any Senator may request that the nomination be referred to committee, and not be considered using the new process. The nomination would then proceed using the existing confirmation process, beginning with referral to committee. In this way, the new system utilizes the existing practices of the Senate's unanimous consent process, where objection from even one Senator will prevent it from being used.", "In addition, the Senate added a provision during floor consideration that requires any committee report on legislation that establishes any new position within an existing agency or department or a new agency or department that would be appointed by the President to contain a justification of any such new position.

", "Supporters of the resolution said it would make for quicker, easier confirmation for the 272 positions covered. \"This retains the authority of the Senate over these positions, but streamlines the process, lessening the burden on the Senate for routine, non-controversial nominations and providing for a faster road to confirmation as well,\" said one Senator upon introduction of the resolution.", "\"We are confident this package will eliminate many of the delays in the current confirmation process,\" said resolution sponsor Senator Schumer. He noted that it is his expectation the nominations, once placed on the Nominations section of the Executive Calendar , would receive quick approval from the Senate: \"The presumption for these part-time positions is, as I said, that they will be approved by unanimous consent and not be held up as a part of other battles or leverage or whatever else.\" ", "By removing the committees' need to act on these nominations, the new process, it could be argued, might save the committees time. As students of the Senate know, a good deal of member and staff time is used before and during committee markups, business meetings where the committee would decide whether to report nominations to the full Senate. Senate rules require a majority of a committee to physically be present in order to report anything to the parent chamber, and, with the press of business on the Senate floor and in other committees, it can be difficult to schedule meetings efficiently. Time could also be saved if the committees did not need to hold hearings on any of the nominations in this group. ", "The committees retain the information gathering function, and are able to signal to other Senators their approval or disapproval of the nominations through informal discussions and floor speeches.

The remaining 28 nominations were not confirmed and were returned to the President. ", "Of the 47 confirmed nominations, all had been reported favorably from the committees of jurisdiction. Of the 28 unconfirmed nominations, none had been acted on by the committees of jurisdiction.

It could also reflect an understanding on the part of the committee that the full Senate was unlikely to consider the nomination(s) and, therefore, that there was no benefit for the committee to report the nominations.", "On the other hand, the new process removes the official role of the committees of jurisdiction, and in doing so, may take some portion of control away from the chairs and other members of the committees over the fate of the nominations. While critics charge that members have too much say over who gets confirmed, members may be concerned about preserving the ability of a committee to have its say on a nomination simply by not acting on it. ", "Supporters of the resolution might counter that the single objection provision in the rule would take care of this problem. The new process would not apply to a nomination if any Senator objects to it. So, if a committee chair or member felt strongly that a certain nomination needed to have more time and attention devoted to it, he or she could trigger the exemption and the nomination will revert back to the regular confirmation process.", "In fact, a Senator desiring to lengthen the regular confirmation process for any nominee to one of these positions could do so by waiting to object to the new process until the nomination had been on the calendar section entitled \"Privileged Nominations \u2013 Information Received\" for nine days of session.

If, as sponsors believe, the positions included in this group, and the nominations intended to fill them are non-controversial, then the new process could streamline the confirmation process for those nominees, especially if Senators are assured that they retain an ultimate ability to influence the path of any nomination. If, however, any Senator desired to require that any nominee in this group proceed through the regular confirmation process, they can do so, essentially leaving open the question of how effective S.Res. 116 will be as a new procedure.
