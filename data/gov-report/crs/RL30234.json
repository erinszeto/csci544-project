Beginning in 1993, long-standing disputes prevented such an agreement from being concluded. On June 30, 1999, after many years of heated diplomatic struggles, U.S. and Canadian officials reached a new comprehensive agreement. The 1999 Agreement (1) established abundance-based fishing regimes for the Pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the PST; (2) created two bilaterally managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds to promote cooperation, improve fishery management, and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts; and (3) included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation, improve the scientific basis for salmon management, and apply institutional changes to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC). Annex IV to the 1999 Agreement outlines, in detail, the fishery regimes to be followed by Canada and the United States in cooperatively managing the six species of anadromous Pacific salmon and trout. Before it expired at the end of 2008, the terms of Annex IV were renegotiated.", "The 1999 conservation and harvest-sharing agreement was of interest to Congress for several reasons. Most notably, a congressional appropriation of $140 million was required to establish the agreement's two regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds. Provisions of the 1999 Agreement were implemented thorough additional authorizing language and amendment of the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a73631, et seq.). The 1999 Agreement under the PST regime has been implemented in accordance with existing U.S. laws pertaining to salmon conservation (e.g., Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; Endangered Species Act). In addition, the agreement's implementation determines the quantity of fish available for commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries as well as Indian treaty allocations.", "Many complex issues continue to challenge the PSC and the parties; several of these were addressed in the 2008 renegotiation of the Annex IV fisheries regimes. Some of the issues associated with the renegotiation included the fishery regime for Chinook salmon found in Chapter 3 of Annex IV. The problems arising from the status (e.g., U.S. endangered and threatened species listing) of certain runs of Chinook salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and perhaps British Columbia posed particular challenges for the negotiators. Additional concerns arose from Canada over increasing bycatch of Chinook salmon by the U.S. pollock fishery in the Bering Sea, as many of these fish are bound for the Yukon River, including Canadian tributaries.", "This report provides historical background about the PST, discusses issues that created difficulties in the regime, summarizes the 1999 accord, and analyzes issues considered during the renegotiation of Annex IV. The 111th Congress may conduct oversight of the renegotiated Agreement and its implications for U.S. salmon management."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["On June 30, 1999, U.S. and Canadian officials signed a new comprehensive agreement to resolve long-standing disputes and to ensure implementation of the conservation and harvest-sharing principles of the 1985 Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST). After years of failed negotiations, a combination of resource management studies, joint-fishery restrictions to protect wild salmon stocks, and the involvement of high-level government negotiators helped ease tensions between the United States and Canada over the shared harvest of Pacific salmon. Moreover, the two nations recognized that failure to reach a long-term conservation and harvest-sharing agreement was in no one's best interest. The provisions in this agreement's Annex IV outline, in detail, the fishery regimes to be followed by Canada and the United States in cooperatively managing the five species of Pacific salmon. Most chapters of Annex IV expired at the end of 2008, and discussions began in 2005 on its renegotiation. This report provides historical background about the PST, discusses issues that created difficulties in the regime, summarizes the 1999 salmon accord, and outlines issues relevant to the renegotiation of Annex IV.", "The 1999 Agreement (1) established abundance-based fishing regimes for the Pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the PST; (2) created two bilaterally managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds to promote cooperation, improve fishery management, and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts; and (3) included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation, improve the scientific basis for salmon management, and apply institutional changes to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC).", "Pacific salmon have long been a matter of common concern to the United States and Canada. In the 1800s, with the advent of canning technologies, extensive commercial salmon fisheries developed in both countries. Since their inception, salmon fisheries have experienced strong fluctuations in catch and stock abundance. Periods of great plenty were often followed by years of low returns. By the 20 th century, it had become obvious that the combined effects of fishing and natural variability in abundance could lead to overharvest. The United States and Canada recognized that some form of cooperation would be necessary for the sake of the resource.", "For many years, piecemeal agreements were forged to protect specific fisheries, such as Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon. However, because of the diversity in salmon fisheries and recurring disagreements over how best to address the interception problem, these agreements proved inadequate. In 1985, the PST created an arrangement for cooperative management, research, and enhancement of all intercepted Pacific salmon stocks. The goal of the PST is coordinated management of Pacific salmon throughout their range to ensure sustainable fisheries and maximize long-term benefits to the parties.", "Despite the PST, some salmon stocks continued to decline. Interceptions strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Canada, and the parties fundamentally disagreed on how to achieve the conservation and harvest-sharing goals established by the PST. After a long-term harvest agreement expired in 1992, Canada argued strongly that the United States was exceeding its share of the catch under the PST's \"benefits equivalent\" provisions. In contrast, the United States argued that Canadian interceptions of Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, and Idaho) coho salmon and Chinook salmon were further damaging these depleted stocks.", "In years following 1992, a unstated assumption of both parties\u2014that they would both abide by conservation measures\u2014allowed the two countries to manage their fisheries. In 1997, bilateral stakeholder talks were held in an attempt to resolve the impasse. Ultimately, these negotiations failed to forge an agreement. In August 1997, the United States and Canada appointed William Ruckelshaus and David Strangway, respectively, to conduct a joint investigation and to make recommendations for ending the controversy. In addition, Washington State and Canada agreed to restrict several of their fisheries to help protect wild salmon stocks. However, failure to reach a long-term conservation and harvest-sharing agreement harmed several salmon stocks and hampered the ability of Washington, Alaska, and British Columbia fishermen to plan fishing seasons and budget expenses because, without a harvest-sharing agreement, year-to-year salmon allocations were unpredictable. Thus, the 1999 Agreement represented a major breakthrough in a longstanding contentious resource issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Background9", "paragraphs": ["Pacific salmon are among the world's most highly migratory anadromous fish. They spawn in fresh water, often hundreds of miles from the ocean, migrate to the sea as juveniles, and then disperse into the open ocean. From one to several years later, they return to their natal rivers to spawn and complete their life cycle. Along the Pacific Coast of North America, many juvenile salmon travel north after they enter the ocean, migrating freely across the national boundaries of the United States and Canada and into international waters (see Figure 1 ).", "There are six species of anadromous Pacific salmon and trout: Chinook (king) salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ), sockeye (red) salmon ( O. nerka ), coho (silver) salmon ( O. kisutch ), pink (humpy) salmon ( O. gorbuscha ), chum (dog) salmon ( O. keta ), and steelhead trout ( O. mykiss ). Migration patterns widely vary among the species. Because of their value and importance to U.S. and Canadian fisheries, three species\u2014Chinook, sockeye, and coho\u2014are of particular interest.", "Chinook salmon from central and northern Oregon coastal rivers, the Columbia River system, and drainages entering Puget Sound generally swim north as juveniles, some migrating as far as the waters off northern British Columbia and Alaska. Coho salmon stocks generally do not migrate as far north and the southern coho stocks (fish originating in Washington/Oregon and southern British Columbia) generally do not mingle with the northern stocks (originating in northern British Columbia and Alaska), which frequently migrate through the waters off southeast Alaska. Because of this natural segregation, the northern and southern coho stocks are addressed separately in the PST. Sockeye salmon from British Columbia's Fraser River move in different patterns depending on ocean conditions. In years when El Ni\u00f1o climatic events occur, Fraser River sockeye are more prevalent in southeast Alaskan waters, returning to the Fraser River through Johnstone Strait off the west coast of the British Columbia mainland. In other (non- El Ni\u00f1o ) years, Fraser River sockeye exhibit a somewhat more southerly distribution and return through the Strait of Juan de Fuca.", "As a result of these migration patterns, fishermen in the United States and Canada intercept fish originating in and returning to rivers of the other country, often in substantial numbers. Canadian commercial troll fisheries off the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) often catch Chinook and coho salmon bound for the rivers of Oregon and Washington, including some threatened and endangered stocks. WCVI trollers and recreational anglers also harvest Puget Sound Chinook. Fishermen in southeast Alaska catch salmon returning to rivers in Canada and the Pacific Northwest. In some years, Washington State commercial fisheries, both tribal and non-tribal, may catch large numbers of Fraser River sockeye as they migrate through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. For many years, these interceptions caused tension between the United States and Canada. Thus, salmon migration patterns and interceptions complicate negotiations.", "A 1937 arrangement between the United States and Canada to conserve and equitably divide the harvest of Fraser River sockeye salmon was an early success story in the management of shared salmon stocks. The Fraser River lies wholly within Canada, but sockeye salmon generally pass through U.S. waters as they return to spawn. Thus, Fraser River sockeye supported large fisheries in both the United States and Canada, setting the stage for an international drama.", "In the late 1800s, Canadian fishermen dominated the Fraser River sockeye fishery. By 1900, with the expansion of U.S. purse seine fisheries, U.S. harvest quickly surpassed the Canadian harvest. From 1900 through 1934, U.S. fisheries produced from 61% to 70% of the sockeye salmon canned from the Fraser River run. In 1913, crews blasting a railroad right-of-way through the canyon walls above the Fraser River triggered a massive rock slide that choked the river canyon. The effects of the slide were most detrimental at a narrow section of the river known as Hell's Gate, blocking access to spawning areas upstream from the slide. United States and Canadian harvest of sockeye salmon dropped dramatically. By 1918, with substantial U.S. assistance, the Hell's Gate reach was restored, and sockeye salmon could again move upstream to spawn.", "The rise of competing U.S. and Canadian fisheries, natural fluctuations in salmon stock abundance, and the events at Hell's Gate provided impetus for negotiations between the United States and Canada over the cooperative management of the sockeye salmon stocks. In 1937, after seven years of negotiation, the Fraser River Convention was ratified. The Convention established the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, with principal responsibility for protecting, preserving, and extending the sockeye salmon fisheries of the Fraser River (pink salmon were later added to the Convention). The commission operated under two objectives: (1) restore Fraser River sockeye runs; and (2) equally divide the catch, within practical limits, between U.S. and Canadian fishermen. In 1946, the commission recommended that regulations be implemented to:", "provide closures designed to permit adequate escapement of all races of salmon comprising the run; protect in the greatest possible degree the most seriously depleted runs; divide the total catch as equally as might be possible between the fishermen of the two countries; and permit the largest catch possible consistent with attainment of these objectives.", "However, because of the diversity in salmon fisheries and recurring disagreements over how best to address the interception problem, the 1937 agreement eventually proved inadequate. The Fraser River Convention was an ambitious experiment, which unquestionably met its twofold mandate to rebuild and equally allocate Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon. However, a much broader forum was necessary to solve the overall problem of U.S. and Canadian salmon interceptions. It would be nearly half a century before the two countries agreed to terminate the Fraser River Convention and replace it with an expanded institution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Pacific Salmon Treaty", "paragraphs": ["In 1985, after several decades and a great deal of international and regional deliberation, the United States and Canada successfully completed negotiations on the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST). The PST created an arrangement for cooperative management, research, and enhancement of shared Pacific salmon stocks to ensure sustainable fisheries and maximize long-term benefits to both parties. In the absence of a fish-sharing arrangement, benefits derived from unilateral conservation and enhancement efforts are diminished by another nation's interceptions. The PST created a regime aimed at ensuring sustainable fisheries through conservation and enhancement, and optimizing benefits to each party.", "The PST established a commission (the PSC) to make recommendations to the parties concerning management of the salmon fishing regime. The PSC meets annually to review fishing activities in the previous year, to advise the PST parties on the status of the fishery, and to suggest any necessary adjustments to the regime. The PSC is divided into two national sections, each with four commissioners and four alternate commissioners. Voting structure was defined for the United States by the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act, as discussed below.", "The PST's fundamental principles are to \"a) prevent overfishing and provide for optimum production [of salmon]; and b) provide for each party to receive benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters.\" In addition, parties are to take into account the desirability of reducing interceptions, the desirability of avoiding disruption of existing fisheries, and annual variations in stock abundance. For many years, the parties strongly disagreed over the meaning of benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters , as specified in Article III of the PST, most notably in terms of what benefits should be considered. Canada stated that benefits equivalent should be interpreted strictly on a fish-for-fish basis. That is, either Canada harvests the salmon produced in its rivers or harvests an amount of U.S. fish equal to the number of Canadian salmon intercepted in U.S. fisheries. The United States has viewed this interpretation as an oversimplification, believing that all of the PST's principles must be considered in unison, and that there is no simple definition of benefits equivalent . For example, who benefits when salmon are caught in Alaska but processed in Canada? And, how are the issues of protecting fish habitat by forgoing development opportunities (e.g., logging, mining, petroleum development) to be balanced?", "The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which elaborated on elements within the PST, provided minimal guidance. It stated that because data on salmon interceptions and total production by rivers of origin are imprecise, each nation's method for determining benefits equivalent may differ. Thus, the MOU stated that complete and comprehensive implementation of Article III (1)(b) would not be possible until some time in the future (without identifying a date or timeline). The MOU stated that, in the short term, annual fishery regimes shall be conducted in an equitable manner and that \"the Commission's decisions take into account changes in the benefits flowing to each of the parties through alteration in fishing patterns, conservation actions, or as the result of changes in the abundance of the runs.\"", "For the long term, \"if it is determined that one country or the other is deriving substantially greater benefits than those provided from its rivers, it would be expected that the parties would develop a phased program to eliminate the inequity within a specified time period, taking into account the provisions of Article III, paragraph 3, of the PST (i.e., the desirability in most cases of reducing interceptions), avoiding undue disruption of existing fisheries, and accounting for annual variations in abundance of stocks. The MOU also stated that correcting imbalances is a national responsibility and may involve adjusting fishing effort or enhancement projects on a regional basis, and that the party with the advantage shall propose corrective measures to the PSC.", "Despite the joint commitment embodied in the PST to conserve and protect the shared salmon stocks, the United States and Canada spent many years in a diplomatic stalemate, and the health of the salmon stocks suffered as a result. After the initial disagreements over the equitable sharing of intermingled stocks in the early 1990s, a number of mechanisms were employed to resolve this issue. In 1993 and 1994, Canada and the United States appointed new negotiators to address the benefits equivalent principle. By 1995, government-to-government negotiations proved unsuccessful and New Zealand Ambassador Christopher Beebe was appointed to guide a mediation of the PST's equity ( benefits equivalent ) principle. When this failed, the parties established two stakeholder panels, composed of fishermen from both countries, in an attempt to settle the controversy. While stakeholder negotiations provided considerable progress, this process also eventually broke down.", "In August 1997, the United States and Canada appointed William Ruckelshaus and Dr. David Strangway, respectively, to conduct a joint investigation of the controversy and to make recommendations for ending it. Their report, published in January 1998, contained four specific recommendations:", "1. The governments should cause to be adopted interim fishing-sharing arrangements for up to two years, stressing that it was incumbent on the governments to ensure that these arrangements are developed and implemented.", "2. During the two-year period, both parties should develop a practical framework for implementing Article III (i.e., leading to establishment of long-term fishing arrangements.)", "3. The stakeholder process should not be reconvened.", "4. The parties should also undertake a comprehensive review of the PSC and dedicate themselves to making it a functional institution for preserving and managing Pacific salmon.", "They concluded that to accomplish their recommendations, \"meaningful compromises of positions strongly held will be necessary.\" Moreover, to ensure long-term sustainability of the shared resource, \"rules must be established for the preservation of the [salmon] and time is not on their side.\"", "Disparate efforts to protect and conserve salmon habitat, which contributed to the relatively weak southern stocks and more robust northern stocks, may be equally to blame for the lack of stability in the PST regime. Southern boundary stocks (e.g., Pacific Northwest Chinook salmon) have suffered extensively from habitat degradation. Most salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest (and a few in some areas of southern British Columbia) have been subjected to major habitat damage from dams, irrigation projects, agriculture, logging, ports, and pollution. Such habitat damage can degrade salmon production without the damaging activity bearing any of the related costs of resource conservation. A significant problem with the PST was that the framers did not anticipate the magnitude of harm caused by non-fishing activities on Pacific Northwest stocks (and some isolated Canadian Chinook stocks).", "As noted previously, after the long-term harvest agreement expired in 1992, Canada and the United States argued over equitable harvest-sharing and conservation of salmon stocks. After years of failed negotiations, cooperative studies (e.g., Ruckelshaus-Strangway), joint-fishery restrictions to protect wild stocks, and the involvement of high-level government representatives (e.g., Lloyd Cutler, Senior White House Representative on Pacific Salmon) helped to ease tensions between the United States and Canada in the late 1990s. Moreover, the two nations recognized that failure to reach a long-term conservation and harvest-sharing agreement was in no one's best interests. In 1999, these factors permitted U.S. Negotiator James Pipkin and Canadian Negotiator Don McRae to overcome years of failed negotiations.", "On June 3, 1999, Lloyd Cutler, Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson, Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber, Washington Governor Gary Locke, and Tribal Negotiator Ted Strong announced that, after intensive negotiations extending over several years, U.S. and Canadian officials had reached a comprehensive agreement to resolve their long-standing dispute relating to Pacific salmon and the PST. On June 30, 1999, the United States and Canada formally signed the 1999 Agreement on Pacific Salmon. Terms of the agreement are discussed below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 and U.S. Decision-Making", "paragraphs": ["The 1999 Agreement was reached within the framework of the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-5 , 99 Stat. 7; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a73631-3634). This act implemented PST provisions and established the institutional framework for U.S. negotiations. The structure of the U.S. Section was a critical element in framing negotiations between the United States and Canada. Because this institutional framework is likely to affect future PST negotiations, a brief discussion of the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 is warranted.", "The Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 is the implementing legislation for the PST. Section 3 defines the composition of the U.S. Section to the PSC, the voting requirements for the U.S. Section, and other matters necessary for U.S. participation in the PST. The U.S. Section is composed of four members: a non-voting representative of the U.S. government, and three voting members from Alaska, Oregon or Washington, and the \"treaty Indian tribes.\" Subsection (g) defines the voting requirements for the U.S. Section, which operates \"with the objective of attaining consensus decisions in the development and exercise of its single vote within the PSC. A decision of the U.S. Section shall be taken when there is no dissenting vote.\" In the event that the U.S. Section is unable to arrive at a consensus, \u00a73(g) of the act authorizes the creation of a Conciliation Board to assist in resolving disputes. The Secretary of State, when concerned that the United States is in jeopardy of not fulfilling international obligations pursuant to the PST because of disputes within the U.S. Section, is empowered to refer these matters to the President. If state or tribal actions or omissions place the United States in jeopardy of not fulfilling its international obligations under the PST, the Secretary of Commerce may take steps to supersede state or tribal fishery regulations.", "It is of concern to some that the structure of the U.S. Section could offer the opportunity for U.S. politics to paralyze the PSC. In contrast to the Canadian Section, where the Canadian federal government decides the position to be taken by its section, the U.S. position is shaped by the state and tribal representatives in the U.S. Section as defined by the act. There is no U.S. federal government position, and the U.S. position is based solely on unanimity among its three voting commissioners. However, the interests of Alaska, Washington/Oregon, and the treaty tribes are often competing and, in the past, have impaired the ability of the U.S. Section to arrive at a unified position. Observers of the process suggest that an overarching difficulty that hindered past attempts to reach consensus is the lack of a requirement compelling the U.S. and Canadian parties to reach an agreement. Related to this is the absence of any penalty for non-resolution. Because both countries could continue to fish in the absence of an agreed harvest regime, there is no incentive to reach agreement and the parties can abandon negotiations without fear of consequences.", "In sum, because the U.S. Section is required by law to work by consensus, the PSC cannot make recommendations to the parties without the approval of all voting members of the U.S. Section. The PST's salmon fishing regimes are based entirely on the recommendations of the PSC. Many believe that the PST negotiation process has been hampered by the structure of the U.S. Section, in which dissent by any single voting member can bring PST negotiations to a halt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 1999 Agreement52", "paragraphs": ["On June 30, 1999, U.S. and Canadian officials signed a comprehensive agreement to resolve long-standing disputes relating to Pacific salmon and the PST.

To be effective, this approach requires an informed pre-season and a responsive in-season approach to fishery management. The parties surmise that by matching harvest levels to actual salmon abundance, this management scheme reduces the tendency to overfish, removes mortality resulting from ineffective live-release practices, and prevents unnecessary loss of fishing opportunities.

Many factors, in addition to harvest, contributed to the decline of these stocks, including habitat destruction, water diversion, hydroelectric dams, and oceanic and climatic change. The parties believed that the conservation-based fishery regimes established by the 1999 Agreement would help to ensure the effectiveness of public and private investments in habitat restoration and other aspects of salmon recovery.", "The 1999 Chinook salmon regime encompassed marine and certain freshwater fisheries in Alaska, Canada, Washington, and Oregon. All Chinook salmon fisheries were to be managed based on abundance, rather than the fixed-catch quotas that applied previously. Two types of fisheries were designated: (1) those that would be managed based on the aggregate abundance of Chinook salmon present in the fishery, and (2) those that would be managed based on the status of individual stocks or stock groups in the fishery.", "The three fisheries designated for aggregate abundance-based management (AABM) were ocean fisheries that occur in large areas and affect a complex aggregation of many stocks. These were:", "southeast Alaska troll, net, and sport fisheries; northern British Columbia troll and Queen Charlotte Islands sport fisheries; and west coast Vancouver Island troll and sport fisheries.", "Each of these AABM fisheries would be managed to achieve a specific harvest rate that varied based on an index of abundance of salmon present in that particular fishery for that particular year. Because each fishery is comprised of a different group of stocks that have different survival rates, the allowable catch would vary between fisheries and between years. Larger catches would be allowed when abundance was greater and, importantly, catches would be increasingly constrained when abundance is diminished. Table 1 in Chapter 3 of the 1999 Agreement's Annex IV provided maximum catch targets for each of the 3 AABM fisheries through the range of Chinook abundance indices.", "All other ocean and freshwater fisheries targeting Chinook salmon were designated for individual stock-based management (ISBM). Fisheries in this category included, but were not limited to:", "central British Columbia troll, net, and sport fisheries; southern British Columbia marine troll, net, and sport fisheries (other than the west coast Vancouver Island troll and sport fisheries); and all troll, net, and sport marine and freshwater fisheries in Oregon, Washington, and the Snake River basin in Idaho.", "The ISBM fisheries generally occurred in marine waters closer to the rivers of origin, or directly in the rivers. These fisheries often are aimed at harvesting hatchery-produced salmon or species other than Chinook. The catch in these fisheries is comprised of a relatively small number of Chinook salmon stocks, some of which were depleted. Accordingly, these fisheries fell under a \"general obligation\" that specified certain reductions in exploitation rates relative to a 1979-1982 base period. This general obligation required Canada to maintain at least a 36.5% reduction in fishing mortality on Chinook salmon stock groups identified as depleted relative to the base period. This general obligation required the United States to maintain at least a 40% reduction relative to the same base period. In those cases where the general obligation was insufficient to achieve escapement objectives for natural stocks, additional reductions were to be taken as necessary to meet agreed escapement objectives or, when taken with the general obligation, were at least equivalent to the average reduction for the specific Chinook stock group during the years 1991-1996.", "The 1999 Agreement provided a degree of flexibility, allowing U.S. and Canadian management agencies to decide how best to distribute harvest across their various fisheries to reflect domestic fishery priorities, provided the over-all reductions were achieved. For some Chinook stocks, the reduction would have to be much greater than the general obligation, due to the need to provide extra protection for certain very depleted stocks. The general obligation did not apply to hatchery stocks or healthy natural stocks that were achieving escapement objectives and could support harvest.", "In addition to predetermined harvest schedules, the 1999 Agreement specified conditions (e.g., failure of a stock to meet agreed escapement objectives for 2 consecutive years) under which even greater harvest reductions would apply. These so-called \"weak stock\" provisions serve as a safety valve to afford additional protection to stocks that may fail to respond to broader recovery programs. Finally, the United States and Canada agreed to implement by 2002, subject to improvements in technical information, a total mortality approach to Chinook fisheries, taking into account indirect or incidental mortality. This would provide more accurate information on which to make fishery management decisions. These arrangements introduced incentives to reduce incidental fishing mortality and harvest more selectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fraser River Sockeye and Pink Salmon", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of State noted that, although much of the structure of previous agreements relating to the Fraser River was retained, the 1999 Agreement required a substantial reduction in the U.S. share of Fraser River sockeye.

For Puget Sound stocks, Canadian WCVI fishery harvest rates have not been reduced to the extent anticipated under the 1999 Agreement. Consequently, fisheries that harvest Chinook in Puget Sound, including those directed at other species, such as sockeye, have been further restricted to compensate for less-than-anticipated reductions in Canadian fishery impacts. For Snake River fall Chinook, the impacts of WCVI fisheries have been reduced more than expected, providing greater flexibility in allocating impacts among U.S. fisheries affecting this stock complex.
