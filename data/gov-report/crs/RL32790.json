The price of each fuel, the capital costs associated with power plantconstruction, and plant efficiencies will determine the competitiveness of each fuel source. Butbecause of limited domestic supply, natural gas supply is unlikely to keep pace with demand. Thiswill lead to increased imports, according to EIA forecasts. Per-well reserve additions are expectedto continue to decline over the EIA forecast period (2004-2025). EIA further forecasts that naturalgas will not displace coal as the dominant fuel supply for power generation despite projectedincreases in liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, additional domestic supply from the lower 48states, and Alaskan natural gas from a newly constructed pipeline.

For instance, fuel costs for a coal-fired plant are about 24% of total costs, whereas fuelcosts for a natural gas facility are close to 69% of total costs. This price difference could give coalan advantage. However, new plant capital costs favor natural gas, accounting for only 23% of totalelectric production costs.

Natural gas facilities (combinedcycle; combustion turbine or distributed generation technology) are forecast to account for 60% ofthe new capacity. Total new coal capacity of 87 GW is to come online between 2004-2025; thus,coal capacity will be 33% of new capacity after 2011, according to EIA.

Coal is competitive at natural gas prices of $4-$6 permillion Btus; prices above that range push up the total cost of gas-fired power facilities abovecoal-fired plants.

During the gasification process, coal is co-fed with water and oxygen in a reducingatmosphere at high pressure to produce synthetic gas, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. Sulfur andcarbon dioxide are also produced and removed. The synthetic gas drives a combustion turbine,whose exhaust is used to make steam to drive a secondary turbine.
