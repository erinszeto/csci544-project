Initially, federal air quality law focused on supporting state programs, through the conduct of research (a central, federal research program was more efficient than 50 state research efforts) and through technical and financial support (regulation was seen as a state and local matter). By the late 1960s, the federal research effort, located in the National Center for Air Pollution Control, Public Health Service, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), included the preparation of \"criteria\"\u2014a summary of scientific knowledge concerning selected air pollutants\u2014and \"guidelines\"\u2014a summary of control technologies. These criteria and guidelines were to support state programs to control air pollution.", "As environmental awareness heightened in the late 1960s, the federal role enlarged. With the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, the federal clean air program was moved to the newly created EPA and reconstituted, with the federal government becoming responsible for establishing \"national ambient air quality standards\" for air pollutants endangering public health or welfare and resulting from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources. The states remained primarily responsible for developing implementation plans to attain and maintain compliance with those national standards. Major amendments in 1977 and 1990 refined the NAAQS setting and implementation process. The 1977 amendments formally established the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) and the 5-year review process. The 1990 amendments increased federal guidance to states in implementing existing NAAQS.", "Thus the present process for setting and revising NAAQS consists of the statutory steps incorporated in the CAA over a series of amendments. In addition, several other steps of varying degrees of import have been added by the EPA, by executive orders, and by subsequent regulatory reform enactments by the Congress. The steps are depicted in Appendix A ; for an example chronology of the steps, see Appendix B . The documentary language spelling out those steps, along with explanatory notes, follows."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criteria Air Pollutants", "paragraphs": ["The pollutants for which NAAQS are set are often called \"criteria pollutants.\" This term reflects the evolution of the process. Before there were NAAQS, the Air Quality Act of 1967 (a predecessor of the CAA) required the Federal government to list air pollutants and to prepare \"criteria\"\u2014a report summarizing scientific evidence concerning their health effects. The states then set standards. Thus the air pollutants for which NAAQS were later set were originally air pollutants for which the Office of Air Quality in HEW prepared \"criteria.\" The current language specifying the listing of \"criteria\" air pollutants, as modified by the 1970 and 1977 amendments to the CAA, is as follows:", "The Administrator shall ... publish, and shall from time to time thereafter revise, a list which includes each air pollutant\u2014(A) emissions of which, in his judgment, cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare; [and] (B) the presence of which in the ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources ....

Also, EPA was to assist states in attaining these standards through grants and technical assistance, and could impose sanctions on states for failures to fulfill their obligations. At present, six pollutants are designated \"criteria pollutants\" for which NAAQS have been set: particulate matter (PM), ozone (O 3 , a key measure of smog), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2, , or, inclusively, nitrogen oxides, NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx, or, specifically, SO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and lead (Pb)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Ambient Air Quality Standards", "paragraphs": ["The Administrator ... shall publish ... regulations prescribing a national primary ambient air quality standard and a national secondary ambient air quality standard for each air pollutant for which air quality criteria have been issued ....

[Senate Report No. 91-1196, p. 10]", "As stated in \u00a7109, a NAAQS defines the acceptable concentration of an air pollutant in the ambient air necessary to protect health. As discussed later, costs are not considered in setting primary standards. Areas\u2014defined as air quality control regions\u2014complying with the standard are designated \"attainment areas\" and areas in which the pollutant exceeds the standard are designated \"nonattainment areas.\" An area can be in attainment for one air pollutant and out of attainment for another.", "Although a primary NAAQS has a federally enforceable deadline, a NAAQS does not itself establish what to do when concentrations exceed the standard (nor how to protect clean air in attainment areas). Other provisions of the CAA lay out the process of implementation (specifically, \u00a7110). For nonattainment areas, this includes monitoring ambient air quality to determine compliance; requiring states to prepare state implementation plans (SIPs) to bring areas not in compliance into compliance; and requiring states to implement their plans to achieve and maintain the NAAQS by a specified deadline (Title I, Part D of the Act). Federal measures to protect air quality include new source performance standards (\u00a7111), which are national standards on specified categories of new sources of selected air pollutants, and mobile source emission standards (\u00a7202). Also, the federal government continues to prepare \"guidance documents\" spelling out available control measures for the NAAQS pollutants. Finally, in attainment areas where the air is cleaner than NAAQS, the CAA establishes a program for new source permitting to \"maintain\" that clean air quality (Title I, Part C)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "\"Margin of Safety\"", "paragraphs": ["... [A]llowing an adequate margin of safety .... [CAA \u00a7109(b)(1)]", "In setting such [national ambient air quality] standards the [Administrator] should consider and incorporate not only the results of research summarized in air quality criteria documents, but also the need for margins of safety. Margins of safety are essential to any health-related environmental standards if a reasonable degree of protection is to be provided against hazards which research has not yet identified. [Senate Committee on Public Works, Report No. 91-1196 (1970), pp. 9-10]", "The phrase, \"margin of safety,\" has been central to several debates.", "The phrase seems to imply that NAAQS are based on thresholds\u2014that there is a concentration of a pollutant below which adverse health effects do not occur. In this view, the Administrator determines the \"no effect\" threshold for the pollutant from the scientific evidence in the \"criteria document\" and then adds a safety factor. From this perspective, the issue is how large the margin of safety should be. In a report on automobile emissions in 1974, a panel of the National Academy of Sciences observed that \"the safety factors provided by the air standards are much smaller than is usual in regulating other environmental pollutants such as radioactivity....\" This could be interpreted as suggesting the need for tighter standards, thus providing a larger margin of safety.", "In fact, scientists find that there seem not to be clear thresholds for air pollutants. The 1974 National Academy of Sciences panel on auto emissions observed that\u2014", "... in no case is there evidence that the threshold levels have a clear physiological meaning, in the sense that there are genuine adverse health effects at and above some level of pollution, but no effects at all below that level. On the contrary, evidence indicates that the amount of health damage varies with the upward and downward variations in the concentration of the pollutant, with no sharp lower limit.", "The 1996 reviews of the ozone and PM standards likewise concluded that no threshold of adverse effects could be found for either pollutant.", "The inability of scientists to find a threshold has led to contention in the setting of NAAQS. Some argue that if there is no threshold, then there cannot be a margin of safety and as a result the whole NAAQS process of necessity becomes a risk management decision\u2014that is, one in which the Administrator balances risks with costs to decide where to set the standard. Others argue that the lack of a threshold justifies the tightest possible standards.", "Another, related debate comes from the view that only in adding a \"margin of safety\" does the administrator layer a policy judgment onto an objective, scientifically determined NAAQS. Some argue that this judgmental aspect means that the \"margin of safety\" phrase implicitly endorses the consideration of costs in setting NAAQS; as discussed later, the lead industry sued EPA over lead standards on the basis that the \"margin of safety\" required EPA to take costs into account in setting NAAQS, but the court ruled that the statute and its legislative history are against that interpretation ( Lead Industries Association v. Environmental Protection Agency , 647 F.2d 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1980)).", "The legislative history of the CAA only briefly touches on the \"margin of safety\" phrase. The Senate Report 90-1196 (accompanying legislation that became the Clean Air Amendments of 1970), quoted at the beginning of this section, clearly indicates that the \"margin of safety\" is designed to protect against the potential for adverse effects to occur at pollutant concentrations below those known to cause harm. Thus, regardless of the existence of a threshold, the margin of safety is a factor the Administrator would consider in making choices involving uncertainties embedded in the definitions of which vulnerable population groups to protect and of what effects are adverse health effects: these issues are discussed later. Similarly, House Report 95-294 (accompanying legislation that became the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977), after quoting the National Academy of Sciences about the \"smaller than usual\" safety factor in NAAQS and about the lack of evidence for thresholds, suggested \" greater not lesser control of emissions are likely to be needed . \" The precautionary premise of the act seems manifest in the phrase \"margin of safety\" regardless of the existence of thresholds; and the inference that the phrase calls for consideration of costs has been consistently rejected."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Secondary Standards", "paragraphs": ["Any national secondary ambient air quality standard ... shall specify a level of air quality the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on such criteria, is requisite to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects associated with presence of such air pollutant in the ambient air.

However, the Committee emphasizes that included among those persons whose health should be protected by the ambient standard are particularly sensitive citizens such as bronchial asthmatics and emphysematics who in the normal course of daily activity are exposed to the ambient environment. In establishing an ambient standard necessary to protect the health of these persons, reference would be made to a representative sample of persons comprising the sensitive group rather than to a single person in such a group.", "Ambient air quality is sufficient to protect the health of such persons whenever there is an absence of adverse effect on the health of a statistically related sample of persons in sensitive groups from exposure to ambient air.

The Clean Air Act does not define the adverse health effects against which NAAQS must protect, nor does the legislative history of the CAA contain much discussion of what constitutes an adverse health effect. The National Commission on Air Quality noted proposals that the Act contain greater specificity, but observed:", "any attempt to identify specific types of health effects could inhibit identification of unanticipated effects that should be considered. In addition, most air pollutants affect public health in more than one way. To carry out its responsibilities under the Act, EPA, before making a final decision to set or revise an air quality standard, must have all relevant and reliable scientific information on the full range of possible health effects of a pollutant.", "Indications of what constitutes an adverse health effect can be found in the distinction between primary and secondary standards and in the definition of hazardous air pollutants. While a primary NAAQS protects health, a secondary NAAQS protects welfare, which includes, by definition, \"personal comfort and well-being.\" Thus, pollution effects that involve only \"personal comfort and well-being\" are not health effects that primary standards are directed toward. The definition of a hazardous air pollutant in the 1970 Act is \"an air pollutant ... which ... may cause, or contribute to, an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness.\" Unquestionably, \"increase in mortality,\" \"irreversible\" and \"incapacitating\" signal health effects. Are bouts of coughing or decreased lung functioning adverse health effects? If they are irreversible or incapacitating, the answer would seem clearly \"yes.\" As a practical matter, if an effect necessitates medical intervention or leads to curtailed activity, such as missing school or work, the answer would seem \"yes.\" The question of whether an effect is an adverse health effect can be difficult to answer, particularly if the effect appears minor but may cumulate over a lifetime.", "Exposure evaluation and risk assessment .", "In order to emphasize the precautionary or preventive purpose of the act (and, therefore, the Administrator ' s duty to assess risks rather than wait for proof of actual harm), the committee not only retained the concept of endangerment to health; the committee also added the words ' may reasonably be anticipated ' . ...", "By its use of the words ' cause or contribute to air pollution ' , the committee intends to require the Administrator to consider all sources of the contaminant which contribute to air pollution and to consider all sources of exposure to the contaminant\u2014food, water, air, etc.\u2014in determining health risk.", "Finally, the term ' in the judgment of the Administrator ' is intended to modify both the ' cause and contribute to ' phrase and the ' reasonably may be anticipated ' phrase.

EPA cases, and as emphasized in House Report 95-294, the Administrator may promulgate a NAAQS in \"reasonable\" anticipation of public health endangerment. The practical effect of this criterion is to allow a \"weight of evidence\" approach to be used in setting a NAAQS ; EPA need not prove that adverse health effects have already occurred, nor that the air-borne form of the pollutant solely caused the harm.", "Margin of safety . On the question of what constitutes a \"margin of safety,\" EPA's Staff Paper on Particulate Matter summarizes the situation as follows:", "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that the requirement for an adequate margin of safety for primary standards was intended to address uncertainties associated with inconclusive scientific and technical information available at the time of standard setting. It was also intended to provide a reasonable degree of protection against hazards that research has not yet identified (Lead Industries Association v. EPA, 647 F.2d 1130, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 101 S. Ct. 621 (1980); American Petroleum Institute v. Costle, 665 F.2d 1176, 1177 (D.C. Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 102 S. Ct. 1737 (1982)). Both kinds of uncertainties are components of the risk associated with pollution at levels below those at which human health effects can be said to occur with reasonable scientific certainty. Thus, by selecting primary standards that provide an adequate margin of safety, the Administrator is seeking not only to prevent pollution levels that have been demonstrated to be harmful but also to prevent lower pollutant levels that she finds may pose an unacceptable risk of harm, even if the risk is not precisely identified as to nature or degree.", "In selecting a margin of safety, the EPA considers such factors as the nature and severity of the health effects involved, the size of the sensitive population(s) at risk, and the kind and degree of the uncertainties that must be addressed. Given that the \"margin of safety\" requirement by definition only comes into play where no conclusive showing of adverse effects exists, such factors which involve unknown or only partially quantified risks have their inherent limits as guides to action. The selection of any particular approach to providing an adequate margin of safety is a policy choice left specifically to the Administrator's judgment ( Lead Industries Association v. EPA , supra, 647 F.2d at 1161-62). [EPA, Particulate Matter Staff Paper (1996), pp. II-1 - II-2]", "EPA's view, then, is that the \"margin of safety\" allows the Administrator to take into account the dimensions of the decision that scientific data cannot resolve. This view has also been voiced by the Courts. For example, concerning the ozone NAAQS, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals observed, \"... EPA must err on the side of caution, just as it did here \u2013 setting the NAAQS at whatever level it deems necessary and sufficient to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety, taking into account both the available evidence and the inevitable scientific uncertainties.\" American Trucking Association, Inc. v.

The National Commission on Air Quality explained the principle as follows:", "The statutory basis for setting national ambient air quality standards does not take economic factors into account. In the Act, Congress recognized that while the levels of air pollution at which public health is affected generally do not vary among different locations, the costs of meeting a specific standard can vary substantially from area to area, depending upon the severity of the pollution. Thus, if a national air quality standard were based in part on the costs of complying with it, the high costs of meeting the standard in a few heavily polluted areas could result in the standard's being set at a less protective level than is achievable in a reasonable, economic fashion in other areas. The health benefits of good air quality and the economic, social, energy, and other costs of meeting health-based standards can be balanced more effectively and appropriately when control programs are established for particular areas than when national primary standards are set.", "The concept of deferring cost considerations until the implementation of standards, rather than incorporating them in standards-setting, arose early in the evolution of the CAA. The Senate Report on the Air Quality Act of 1967 affirmed the primacy of health protection in setting NAAQS:", "Considerations of technology and economic feasibility, while important in helping to develop alternative plans and schedules for achieving goals of air quality, should not be used to mitigate against protection of the public health and welfare.

Under this provision, Congress could consider a joint resolution of disapproval, with special procedures in the Senate to ensure floor consideration within 60 legislative days. While the procedure was not invoked, bills to delay the new standards were introduced, including H.R. 1984 and S. 1084 , with a hearing held on the latter. No bill to rescind the new NAAQS was reported from committee, however.", "Appendix A. The NAAQS-Setting Process", "Appendix B.
