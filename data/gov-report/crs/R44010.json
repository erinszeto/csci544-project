Limits on DOD funding resulting from the Budget Control Act required DOD to implement significant spending cuts that were not the result of deliberate and strategic planning.

The result could be the implementation of policies that squander resources and waste taxpayer dollars. According to GAO, \"[f]ederal agencies are responsible for ensuring that the information reported in [the FPDS] database is complete and accurate.\"", "History of FPDS", "On August 30, 1974, Congress enacted the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, which established an Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) within OMB and required the establishment of \"a system for collecting, developing, and disseminating procurement data which takes into account the needs of Congress, the executive branch, and the private sector.\" One of the goals of establishing a system for tracking procurement data was to \"promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the procurement of property and services.\"", "In February 1978, the OFPP issued a government-wide memorandum that designated the Department of Defense as the executive agent to operate the Federal Procurement Data System. Agencies were instructed to begin collection of procurement data on October 1, 1978, and to report the data to DOD in February 1979. Since 1982, the GSA has operated the system on behalf of the OFPP. Today, FPDS is the only government-wide system that contains all publicly available federal procurement data. FPDS data are used by other federal-spending information resources, including USASpending.gov .", "Almost from FPDS's inception, the GAO expressed concerns about the accuracy of the information in the database. OMB attempted to eliminate many of the errors in FPDS by introducing a successor system\u2014the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS), which began operation on October 1, 2003. FPDS was to \"rely less on manual inputs and more on electronic 'machine-to-machine' approaches.\" Despite the systems update, GAO said \"[i]nformation in FPDS can only be as reliable as the information agencies enter though their own systems.\"", "In September 29, 2009, testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight, William T. Woods, GAO's Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management, said the following about FPDS information:", "Our past work has found that federal contracting data systems, particularly FPDS-NG, contain inaccurate data. FPDS-NG is the primary government contracting data system for obligation data. Despite its critical role, GAO and others have consistently reported on FPDS-NG data quality issues over a number of years.", "A 2012 GAO report reiterated its finding that DOD needs to \"obtain better data on its contracted services to enable it to make more strategic workforce decisions and ensure that it maintains appropriate control of government operations.\" And a 2015 report by the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce found that \"the Department needs to improve (a) its process for entering accurate and reliable data into FPDS-NG.\" ", "Data Reliability Concerns Persist", "According to GSA, agencies are required to validate their data annually. Agency statements regarding data accuracy are independent of the FPDS systems and outside the authority of GSA. For DOD specifically, components (at the service branch level) are required to submit to Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) an annual certification of reported data, summary of data verification and validation efforts, and Agency FPDS Data Quality Certifications.", "Continued concerns raised over the reliability of data have prompted many analysts to rely on FPDS primarily to identify broad trends and make rough estimations. According to one GAO report", "DOD acknowledged that using FPDS-NG as the main data source for the inventories has a number of limitations. These limitations include that FPDS-NG does not provide the number of contractor FTEs performing each service, identify the requiring activity, or allow for the identification of all services being procured.", "Officials from the GSA, the agency that administers FPDS, stated that data errors in FPDS do not substantively alter the larger context of 1.4 million actions and billions of dollars of obligations entered into the system by DOD every year. Officials have also indicated that whenever possible and feasible, steps are taken to improve the reliability and integrity of the data contained in FPDS. For example, in early 2016, CRS noted discrepancies in reported contract obligations associated with public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76. Despite a prohibition on new public-private competitions under Circular A-76 (see P.L. 111-8 , the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Bill), FPDS reported a large number of contracts in this category in each subsequent fiscal year. DOD reported that A-76 contracts, for example, represented approximately 1% of all contract obligations in FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015 (roughly $3 billion in each fiscal year). When asked for clarification, DOD's Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy office stated that the majority of these contract obligations were in fact coding errors in FPDS. That same year, CRS observed that DOD's FPDS-reported A-76 obligations were restated, to approximately $150 million per year from FY2013 to FY2015.", "Despite the limitations of FPDS, imperfect data may be better than no data. Some observers say that despite its shortcomings, FPDS is one of the world's leading systems for tracking government procurement data. FPDS data can be used to identify some broad trends and rough estimations, or to gather information about specific contracts. Understanding the limitations of data\u2014knowing when, how, and to what extent to rely on data\u2014could help policymakers incorporate FPDS data more effectively into their decisionmaking process.", "Appendix B. Obligations Trends by PSC", "Product and service codes (PSCs) are used \"to describe the products, services, and research and development (R&D) purchased by the federal government.\" FPDS sorts contract obligations into 33 overarching PSCs: nine product codes, 23 service codes, and one R&D code. Each of the nine product codes are represented by numbers from 1-9. Each of the service codes is represented by a single letter, and R&D is represented by the letter \"A.\" Figure B-1 depicts changes in DOD contract obligations by PSC, from FY2008-FY2015.", "Each of the 33 PSCs for services has a description identifying the types of contracts contained in the category; the nine PSCs for products do not have a description.
