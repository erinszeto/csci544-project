Each OPO is required to be a member of and provide transplant candidate information to the OPTN, which maintains the master waiting list of individuals seeking transplants in the United States. OPOs may also implement regional organ allocation systems different from the national OPTN system for the purpose of increasing organ availability and/or organ quality, reducing or addressing an inequity in organ allocation/distribution unique to a local area, and/or examining a policy variation intended to benefit the allocation/distribution system overall.

Living donation is preferable for transplant recipients, because kidneys recovered from live donors typically outlast those from deceased donors. The law amended the Public Health Service Act to authorize the HHS Secretary to award grants to states, transplant centers, qualified organ procurement organizations or other public or private entities to reimburse travel, subsistence, and incidental nonmedical expenses incurred by individuals toward making living organ donations.

Still, the number of additional kidney transplants likely to result from a national paired and/or list kidney donation system depends on a number of things. The number of available kidneys could be increased by numerous factors\u2014not all of which are necessarily desirable. These factors include selecting an optimal transplant system (list, paired, or combination) for the size of the population, lowering the degree of compatibility required for a transplant, increasing donor willingness to participate in list and paired donation programs, and avoiding systemic restrictions used to achieve equitable outcomes among recipients. The studies that have examined these factors are summarized below.", "One study generated data about the type of transplant system that is optimal for a given population size by comparing paired, list, and combination programs via computer model. The authors estimated that a pool of 3,584 donor/recipient pairs could generate 1,871 successful transplants (52%) using a combination paired/list exchange program, 1,730 (48%) using a paired program alone, and 1,330 (37%) using a list program alone. The same study found that, for small populations of donor/recipient pairs (less than 100), list donation would generate more potential transplants than paired donation because list donation uses the entire deceased donor pool, while paired donation is limited to the incompatible pool.", "A second study investigated factors that influence donors' willingness to participate in paired and list exchange programs. Willingness to make a paired or list donation appeared to be directly proportional to the likely magnitude of benefit to the intended recipient. Of 174 potential donors who had been found medically incompatible with their intended recipients, 63.8% were willing to participate in paired donation (in which the intended recipient would receive a kidney immediately from a live donor), and 37.9% were willing to participate in list donation (in which the intended recipient would be moved up the list for a kidney from a deceased donor). Willingness to make a list donation was greatest when the intended recipient would be moved to the top rather than the top 20% of the waiting list (37.9% vs. 19.0%).", "A third study examined the possibility of maximizing paired donations by lowering the donor/recipient compatibility requirements. By doing so, authors were able to increase the percentage of possible exchanges from 57% to 91.7% of patients in their database. A number of specialized centers report success with incompatible kidney transplantation using special techniques to make the kidney more compatible with the intended recipient. The results of these types of transplants are reportedly encouraging, but long-term results are not yet available, and therapy is labor intensive, requires immunosuppressives, and adds an average of $28,000 to the cost of the transplant.", "A fourth study estimated the impact that ethical restrictions to help ensure that people of all blood types benefit equitably from list donations would have on the number of transplants performed. The authors proposed certain restrictions on list donation (and others have proposed avoiding list donation altogether) because people with blood type O may be disadvantaged by such a system. Donors with blood type O may give compatible kidneys to recipients with any blood type, but recipients with O blood type may only receive compatible kidneys from type O donors. For that reason, type O recipients, who already have the longest mean wait time on the cadaver waiting list, may have to wait an even longer time for a cadaveric kidney in a typical list donation program. The ethical dimensions of this issue are discussed further in the Ethical Issues section of this report.", "Study results indicated that restrictions to benefit recipients with blood type O would decrease annually the number of additional kidneys available from list exchanges by about one-half (from a range of 844\u20142,155 additional kidneys, to a range of 414\u20141,150 additional kidneys).

While the statute did not define valuable consideration, it did state that the term \"does not include the reasonable payments associated with the removal, transplantation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of a human organ or the expenses of travel, housing, and lost wages incurred by the donor of a human organ in connection with the donation of the organ.\"", "The legislative history of the 1984 NOTA did not discuss the meaning of the term valuable consideration. It simply expressed Congress's intent to criminalize the buying and selling of organs for profit. For example, the Senate report accompanying S. 2048 stated that \"[i]t is the sense of the Committee that individuals or organizations should not profit by the sale of human organs for transplantation.\" The House conference report for that bill reiterated that Section 301 was directed toward monetary exchanges: \"This title intends to make the buying and selling of human organs unlawful.... \" During congressional hearings in 2003 on incentives to increase organ donations, strong objections were proffered against the use of direct monetary incentives to procure organs.", "Living donations of kidneys from a single biologically compatible living donor to a recipient had taken place before NOTA was enacted in 1984. Since NOTA specifically allowed certain expense payments to be provided to a living donor, it was clear that living donations were not precluded by NOTA and that single living donations did not implicate the \u00a7 301 prohibition against the exchange of valuable consideration. At the time NOTA was enacted, living donation arrangements involving multiple donors and recipients, such as paired donation and list donation, had not yet been developed as medical options. Thus, Congress did not consider such practices in enacting the prohibition on giving or receiving valuable consideration in return for human organs. In recent years, some transplantation facilities have implemented living donation programs involving multiple recipients and/or donors, however other transplant facilities have hesitated to implement such multiple living donation programs because of possible legal concerns over whether such practices could be construed as violating the exchange of valuable consideration prohibition in NOTA. Congress, in December, 2007, enacted P.L. 110 - 144 , the Charlie W. Norwood Living Organ Donation Act, which clarifies that \"human organ paired donation\" is not a human organ transfer for valuable consideration and thus does not violate NOTA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Valuable Consideration and Living Donation Arrangements", "paragraphs": ["It has always been clear that living donation arrangements such as paired donation and list donation do not involve actual monetary payments to the donor or recipient. The concern that has been raised is whether the donors and recipients in multiple living donation arrangements have received valuable consideration for their promises to get something in return for specific acts. Such arrangements arguably involve some kind of bargain since there are mutual promises on both sides of the arrangement. The argument has been made that where a donor trades his organ for a compatible organ for his intended beneficiary, the donor receives valuable consideration in the exchange of mutual promises to donate organs. Now that Congress has clarified that paired transplants of compatible living donors and recipients do not violate NOTA's prohibition of valuable consideration in return for organ donation, issues may still be raised regarding other kinds of living donation arrangements such as list donation, because Congress clarified only the legality of paired donation arrangements.", "Two legal opinions issued before Congress's recent amendment of \u00a7 301 of NOTA regarding paired donation arrangements continue to be relevant to the question of the legality of other kinds of multiple living donation arrangements, such as list donation. The Associate General Counsel to UNOS, in 2006, provided a legal analysis of the applicability of \u00a7 301 of NOTA to both paired donation and list donation arrangements, concluding that \"NOTA \u00a7301 is legally and historically inapplicable to today's living donation arrangements.\" Elaborating on the applicability of the \u00a7 301 prohibition on the exchange of valuable consideration, the UNOS legal analysis stated as follows:", "\"Valuable consideration\" under NOTA \u00a7 301 is a monetary transfer or a transfer of valuable property between donor, recipient and/or organ broker in a sale transaction. It is not familial, emotional, psychological or physical benefit to the organ donor or recipient, all of which attach equally to the \"living-related kidney transplants\" in yesterday's terminology and to the multi-party intended recipient donations, paired donations and similar innovative and highly beneficial living donation arrangements of today and tomorrow. There is no \"valuable consideration\" under NOTA \u00a7 301 in any of these living donation arrangements. The donor receives none, the recipient gives none and none is transferred to a broker. In fact, there is no \"consideration\" at all in a living organ donation arrangement because the donation is a \"gift\"....", "A gift is different from a contract. A contract does not involve donative intent. \"Consideration\" and the mutual agreement of the parties are required to make the contract legally binding. A gift, on the other hand, involves a gratuitous transfer by the donor and no transfer of money, property or services or agreement not to exercise rights or to suffer material detriment (\"consideration\") by the beneficiary. For that reason, it is often said that no \"consideration\" is present in a gift. A promise to make a gift of an organ is not intended to be legally binding.", "The donation of an organ is properly considered to be a gift, rather than a contractual undertaking. As gifts, living donations may be made conditionally for a specific purpose. The condition can be construed as \"consideration\" only if the happening of the condition will be a benefit to the person who promises to give an organ. If, on the other hand, the happening of the condition will not benefit the promisor and is merely for the purpose of enabling the promisee to receive a gift, the condition is not \"consideration.\" [footnotes omitted]", "The Associate General Counsel's analysis concluded that, although list donation and paired donation involve more than a single set of recipients and/or donors, the condition in each case benefits the intended recipient rather than the donor. Thus, these transactions are conditional gifts and do not involve any federally prohibited exchange of valuable consideration.", "In addition, pursuant to a request by the HHS General Counsel, the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) rendered an opinion in March 2007 on the legality of alternative organ donation practices under \u00a7 301 of NOTA. The HHS General Counsel requested the OLC's opinion so that the Secretary of HHS would know whether \u00a7 301 imposes a barrier to his engaging in various actions to encourage practices such as paired and list donation. The OLC concluded at that time that paired exchanges and living donor transplants for increased priority in deceased donor allocation do not involve 'valuable consideration' and are therefore not prohibited under NOTA. The OLC opinion examined relevant statutory provisions, the common law of contracts, contemporaneous state laws, and case law. While the opinion acknowledged that the common law understanding of valuable consideration was somewhat vague, the meaning derived from case law and the context of the term in the NOTA statute suggested that consideration, to be \"valuable,\" should be pecuniary. Because \u00a7 301 is a criminal provision, \"it is therefore appropriate to apply the rule of lenity in favor of a narrower reading, and thus to understand 'valuable consideration' in section 301 of the Act as referring to the buying and selling of organs for monetary gain or to organ exchanges that are otherwise commercial,\" and not to alternative organ donation practices such as paired and list donation.", "While Congress has made it clear that paired donation arrangements do not violate NOTA's prohibition against the exchange of valuable consideration for human organs, the legality under \u00a7 301 of NOTA of current list donation arrangements and of other, future multiple recipient/donor arrangements remains an open question. The two legal opinions cited above lend credence to the argument that such arrangements may not be found to involve illegal exchanges of valuable consideration for human organs.

Still, 72% also agreed that transplant centers had a duty to offer their patients the possibility of transplantation using living donors.

This calculation is generally made for each patient independently\u2014it is not ethically acceptable for one patient to bear all of the risks and another to reap all of the benefits. On this point, IOM noted that a living donor may gain psychosocial benefits from donating an organ to one in need, which could arguably outweigh the risks to the donor's physical health. However, in order to help ensure that the risk is not too great for a particular donor due to a preexisting medical condition or the like, IOM recommended that an independent donor advocate be appointed to assess the risk-benefit ratio.", "Even with a donor advocate to make the risk-benefit assessments, one major factor complicates the assessment of the ratio: little is known about the long term health and quality-of-life effects of being a living organ donor. This lack of information makes it difficult for professionals to ensure that they consider the full spectrum of risks to be outweighed by benefits. Therefore, IOM recommended (as ACOT had before ) that living donor registries be established to enable follow-up research on the long-term effects of living donation. In addition, in June 2006, HHS solicited public comments from the organ transplant community for living donation after \"several widely publicized living donor deaths\" and an increasing trend in the number of living donations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Informed Consent", "paragraphs": ["Ethically justifiable living organ donation presupposes the competent donor's voluntary informed consent. ACOT specified that living donors' informed consent must be competent, free from coercion, and fully informed of the risks and benefits as a donor, among other things. As IOM noted, obtaining informed consent is confounded by the same lack of long-term health data that makes assessing the risk-benefit ratios difficult. It is not possible to fully inform potential living donors (a necessary component of informed consent) without information about the likely impact of the procedure on long-term health. IOM suggested that creating a living donor registry would enhance informed consent as well as inform the risk-benefit analysis.", "Further problems in obtaining informed consent are related to the requirement that it be given voluntarily. Establishing a voluntary process may be complicated if donors are not legally competent to consent (e.g., children), or if situations are coercive (e.g., loved ones feel pressured to become living donors). Some potential donors have expressed relief at discovering that they were incompatible with their intended recipients. Expanded use of paired exchanges, and the prospect of list exchanges, may eliminate the incompatibility excuse for potential donors, and may thus create a coercive situation. IOM's recommendation that each living donor receive an advocate is aimed at protecting voluntary informed consent as well as evaluating the risk-benefit ratio. In addition, IOM recommends that the advocates address gender disparities in living donation.

Implementing a system with a disparate impact, particularly one that falls on an already disadvantaged group, has caused some authors to recommend that list paired donation have a minimal role on a national level. It has caused others to recommend that the system be modified to protect type O recipients.", "A different set of authors has come out in favor of the list exchange program despite the impact on people with type O blood. They claim that the impact on type O recipients would be transient. Though some people would be bumped to the top of the transplant list, their absence from that list when they would have come to its top (four to five years later) would eventually balance out the impact of the system.", "Current law avoids the type O issue by focusing only on paired, and not list, donation. Earlier proposals would have raised this issue by explicitly permitting list donation (e.g., S. 2306 , 109 th , and S. 573 IS, 108 th ), or potentially allowing the practice ( H.R. 710 EAS, 110 th )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ethical Issues Related to Directed Donation (Paired and List)", "paragraphs": ["Directed donation, which allows an organ donor to specify the recipient, creates issues related to the equitable allocation of organs. Paired and list donation (both of which are types of directed donation) create parity issues regarding what the intended recipient should be entitled to receive in lieu of the donation.

The rules governing who gets an organ are, therefore, quite important. In general, the ranking on the waiting list depends on biological matching, medical status, patient location, age of the patient, and length of time the patient has been on the waiting list for a transplant. By contrast, directed donation allows the donor to choose who receives their organ (or, in the case of list donation, who is to advance on the waiting list). The PCBE noted that this raises the question of whether it is ethical for one person to receive an organ before another more needy person, simply because someone cares for them enough to make a donation. PCBE also noted that prohibiting such acts of love as living donation in the name of justice would be perverse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parity", "paragraphs": ["Some have suggested that in paired and list donations, the donated and received organs must be of equal value to ensure an equitable exchange. While this might be possible with a paired exchange, it is almost certainly not the case with a list donation, because the intended recipient will receive a kidney from a deceased donor instead of a living one. (Deceased donor organs do not typically last as long as living donor organs). Other issues related to parity have been raised, such as whether one donor in a paired exchange may change his or her mind if the other donor has already undergone surgery. To prevent these scenarios, it has been suggested that both donors should undergo surgery at the same time. Other authors have suggested that outcome parity cannot be guaranteed in list and paired exchange programs. If one organ fails, the recipient is not necessarily entitled to receive another."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ethical Issues Related to Proposals for Expanding the Organ Supply: Exchanging Valuable Consideration for an Organ", "paragraphs": ["The demand for transplantable organs has inspired a wide variety of proposals to increase the supply, including some that would allow or encourage forms of payment for organs. Congress has considered several proposals to give donors honorific or tax incentives for donating organs. The use of financial incentives has been studied, proposed and debated in the general literature. Various organizations, including the American Medical Association and UNOS have supported the study of financial options to encourage organ donations. Arguments have been made that donors of organs should be treated no differently than donors of tissues (such as human hair, blood plasma, sperm, and eggs). It has also been argued that because the practice of transplanting organs is profitable for the professional parties involved, those from whose bodies the organs are harvested should be able to share in some of the profits.", "There has been resistance to proposals that encourage commodification of human organs. The IOM conducted an extensive analysis of various types of financial incentives to encourage donation, such as payment through regulated futures markets, payment of funeral expenses, providing bereavement counseling, tax incentives, and providing health insurance. IOM concluded that none should be promoted at this time because of a lack of evidence that these incentives would improve donation rates, because once put in motion a system of financial incentives would be difficult to reverse, and because of fears that such systems might disproportionately affect the poor. This recommendation came as a disappointment to some who seek to increase the supply of transplantable organs.", "While current law clarifies that paired donation does not violate NOTA's prohibition on the exchange of human organs for valuable consideration, it does not permit the payment of money in exchange for organ donation.
