Subsequent legislation extended Member use of the frank to a specific number of days before and after a session, first by 10 days in 1810, then by 30 days in 1816, and finally to 60 days in 1825. The Act of 1825 also provided for the unlimited franking of newspapers and documents printed by Congress, regardless of weight.", "Scholarly work suggests that franked mail played an important role in national politics during the early 19 th century. Members mailed copies of acts, bills, government reports, and speeches, serving as a distributor for government information and a proxy for the then non-existent Washington press corps, providing local newspapers across the country with information on Washington politics. Because franking statutes allowed Members to both send and receive franked mail during much of the 19 th century, constituents could also mail letters to their Senators and Representatives for free.", "According to one scholar, Members spent up to three hours each day signing their names on envelopes, some Members franking up to 3,000 items daily when Congress was in session and occasionally hiring ghost-writers to sign their signature for them. This led one Member to describe the House of Representatives as a \"bookbinder's shop.\"", "In 1845, Congress passed comprehensive franking legislation that instituted an accounting system, in which executive departments would pay for mail through general tax revenue, in hopes of easing the burden on the Post Office Department and reducing paid mail rates. Members of Congress continued to have their franking privilege paid for out of postal revenue. The accounting system was repealed in 1847 in favor of an annual appropriation to the Post Office Department to subsidize free and franked mail costs.

In addition, proponents argue that if legislative matters could not be easily transmitted to constituents free of charge, most Members could not afford to pay for direct communications with their constituents.", "Historically, the franking privilege was seen as a right of the constituents, not of the Member.
