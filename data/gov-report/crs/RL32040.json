They have a long history and come in several varieties: the not-less-than, the flat sentence, and piggyback versions. Federal courts may refrain from imposing an otherwise required statutory mandatory minimum sentence when requested by the prosecution on the basis of substantial assistance toward the prosecution of others. First-time, low-level, non-violent offenders may be able to avoid the mandatory minimums under the Controlled Substances Acts, if they are completely forthcoming.", "The most common imposed federal mandatory minimum sentences arise under the Controlled Substance and Controlled Substance Import and Export Acts, the provisions punishing the presence of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, the Armed Career Criminal Act, various sex crimes including child pornography, and aggravated identity theft.", "Critics argue that mandatory minimums undermine the rationale and operation of the federal sentencing guidelines which are designed to eliminate unwarranted sentencing disparity. Counter arguments suggest that the guidelines themselves operate to undermine individual sentencing discretion and that the ills attributed to other mandatory minimums are more appropriately assigned to prosecutorial discretion or other sources.", "State and federal mandatory minimums have come under constitutional attack on several grounds over the years, and have generally survived. The Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishments clause does bar mandatory capital punishment, and apparently bans any term of imprisonment that is grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime for which it is imposed. The Supreme Court, however, has declined to overturn sentences imposed under the California three strikes law and challenged as cruel and unusual. Double jeopardy, ex post facto, due process, separation of powers, and equal protection challenges have been generally unavailing.", "The United States Sentencing Commission's Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System (2011) recommends consideration of amendments to several of the statutes under which federal mandatory minimum sentences are most often imposed.", "Lists of the various federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes are appended, as is a bibliography of legal materials.

Among other things, they cover drug dealing, murdering federal officials, and using a gun to commit a federal crime. They have been a feature of federal sentencing since the dawn of the republic. They circumscribe judicial sentencing discretion, although they impose few limitations upon prosecutorial discretion, or upon the President's power to pardon. They have been criticized as unthinkingly harsh and incompatible with a rational sentencing guideline system; yet they have also been embraced as hallmarks of truth in sentencing and a certain means of incapacitating the criminally dangerous. This is a brief overview of federal statutes in the area and a discussion of some of the constitutional challenges they have faced."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Types of Mandatory Minimums", "paragraphs": ["Mandatory minimums come in many stripes, including some whose status might be disputed. The most widely recognized are those that demand that offenders be sentenced to imprisonment for \"not less than\" a designated term of imprisonment. Some are triggered by the nature of the offense, others by the criminal record of the offender. A few members of this \"not less than\" category are less \"mandatory\" than others, because Congress has provided a partial escape hatch or safety valve. For example, several of the drug-related mandatory minimums are subject to a \"safety valve\" for small time, first time, non-violent offenders that may render their minimum penalties less than mandatory, or at least less severe. Still others can be avoided at the behest of prosecution for a defendant's substantial assistance against his cohorts. Some of the other \"not-less-than\" mandatory minimums purport to permit the court to sentence an offender to a fine rather than to a mandatory term of imprisonment.", "A second generally recognized category of mandatory minimums consists of the flat or single sentence statutes, the vast majority of which call for life imprisonment. Closely related are the capital punishment statutes that require imposition of either the death penalty or imprisonment for life, or death or imprisonment either for life or for some term of years.", "The \"piggyback\" statutes make up a third class. The piggyback statutes are not themselves mandatory minimums but sentence offenders by reference to underlying statutes including those that impose mandatory minimums.", "Until the Supreme Court intervened in Booker v. United States to eliminate the binding effect of the Sentencing Guidelines, the final and least obvious group was comprised of statutes whose violation resulted in the imposition of a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment by operation of law, or more precisely by operation of the Sentencing Reform Act and the Sentencing Guidelines issued in its name. After Booker and the line of cases that followed, the Guidelines cannot fairly be characterized as a source of mandatory minimum sentences, although they continue to tilt heavily toward incarceration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History", "paragraphs": ["Mandatory minimums have been with us from the beginning. In fact, the history of our criminal sentencing practices is the story of increased reliance upon judicial or administrative discretion in order to mute the law's severity in individual cases, followed by increased limitations on such discretion in order to curb the resulting arbitrary and discriminatory disparities in punishment. It is a saga in which \"competing theories of mandatory and discretionary sentencing have been in varying degrees of ascendancy or decline.\"", "Severity and a want of discretion marked the early criminal law. The sentence which followed a felony conviction was death; except in rare instances no other punishment could be imposed. Over time the courts were given some discretion over sentencing, but the choices were hardly lenient; and corporal punishment and banishment were common.", "Yet even early on there were efforts to ease the law's severity. Both the accused and the convicted could be pardoned at the King's will. While Parliament regularly increased the number of crimes, it often replaced common law capital offenses with statutory crimes defined as misdemeanors or subject to the benefit of clergy. The result was the same in either case, a reduced number of capital offenses. In our own country, state legislatures drastically curtailed the number of capital offenses soon after the Revolution.", "When the first Congress assembled, it enacted several mandatory minimums, each of them a capital offense. The 19 th century, however, witnessed the appearance of a host of discretionary schemes designed to ease the harshness of criminal law in individual cases. The courts could suspend sentence and were vested with broad authority in the selection of those sentences they chose to impose. Probation and parole were born and became prominent.", "By late in the century at the federal level, the number of mandatory capital offenses had been reduced, and while the number of mandatory minimums had increased, most federal criminal statutes merely established a maximum penalty and left to the discretion of the courts the sentences to be imposed within the maximum. The 1909 federal criminal code revision eliminated most mandatory minimums; soon thereafter federal prisoners were made eligible for parole after service of a third of their sentences (after 15 years in the case of prisoners with life sentences); and federal courts shortly thereafter received the authority to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and impose probation. The 1948 federal criminal code revision took much the same tack as its predecessor: it eliminated many, but not all, of the \"not-less-than\" mandatory minimums and continued in place most of the \"flat\" sentence mandatory minimums.", "By mid-20 th century, a well-respected commentator could observe that \"[t]he individualization of penal dispositions, principally through the institutions of the indeterminate sentence, probation, and parole, is a development whose value few would contest.\" The contest was joined soon thereafter.", "Driven by concerns that broad discretion had led to rootless sentencing, unjustifiable in its leniency in some instances and in its severity in others, legislative bodies moved to curtail discretionary sentencing on several fronts. Determinate sentencing, sentencing commissions and guidelines, and mandatory minimum sentences became more prevalent. Parole and probation were abolished or greatly restricted in several jurisdictions.", "The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 brought this trend to the federal criminal justice system. It repealed the authority of the federal courts to suspend criminal sentences. It abolished federal parole. It created a sentencing guideline system, applicable within the statutory maximum and minimum penalties established by Congress that tightly confined the sentencing discretion of federal judges.

A defendant is also \"entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationally related to any legitimate Government end.\" Some courts have suggested that a defendant is entitled to relief if the prosecution refuses to move under circumstances that \"shock the conscience of the court,\" or that demonstrate bad faith, or for reasons unrelated to substantial assistance.

It has been suggested that a court may use the section 5K1.1 factors for that determination, that is, \"(1) the court's evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant's assistance, taking into consideration the government's evaluation of the assistance rendered; (2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant; (3) the nature and extent of the defendant's assistance; (4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance; [and] (5) the timeliness of the defendant's assistance.\" ", "The substantial assistance exception makes possible convictions that might otherwise be unattainable. Yet, it may also lead to \"inverted sentencing,\" that is, a situation in which \"the more serious the defendant's crimes, the lower the sentence \u2013 because the greater his wrongs, the more information and assistance he had to offer to a prosecutor\"; while in contrast the exception is of no avail to the peripheral offender who can provide no substantial assistance. Perhaps for this reason, most of the judges who responded to the Sentencing Commission survey agreed that a sentencing court should not be limited to assistance-related factors and should be allowed to use the generally permissible sentencing factors when calculating a sentence under \u00a73553(e).

Its 1991 report, after sketching the arguments traditionally offered in support of mandatory minimums, observed that", "only 4 of the 60 mandatory minimums were regularly prosecuted; mandatory minimums induce new sentencing disparities; due to plea bargaining, 35% of the defendants who might have been charged and sentenced under mandatory minimums were not; \"disparate application of mandatory minimum sentences ... appears to be related to race\"; mandatory minimums lack the capacity to consider the range of aggravating and mitigating circumstances that may attend the same offense and as a consequence produce unwarranted sentencing uniformity; uneven application deprives mandatory minimums of their potential to deter; mandatory minimums breed disparity by transferring judicial discretion to the prosecution; in contrast to the calibrated approach of the guidelines, mandatory minimums create cliffs where minuscule factual differences can have enormous sentencing consequences; the amendment process of the sentencing guidelines makes them perpetually self-correcting, while mandatory minimums are single-shot efforts at crime control; and the most efficient and effective way for Congress to exercise its powers to direct sentencing policy is through the established process of sentencing guidelines, permitting the sophistication of the guidelines structure to work, rather than through mandatory minimums.", "The Commission's initial report was quickly followed by a Department of Justice study that concluded that a substantial number of those sentenced under federal mandatory minimums were nonviolent, first-time, lower level drug offenders.", "Congress responded with the safety valve provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3553(f) under which the court may disregard various drug mandatory minimums and sentence an offender within the applicable sentencing guideline range as long as the offender was a low level, nonviolent participant with no prior criminal record who has cooperated fully with the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Second Commission Report", "paragraphs": ["A number of things changed between the first and second Commission reports. Sentencing under the Guidelines had only been in place for a relatively short period of time when the first report was written. The number of defendants sentenced by federal courts is now almost three times the number sentenced under the Guidelines when the Commission wrote its first report. In the years since, Congress has muted the impact of some mandatory minimums with the safety valve and the Fair Sentencing Act, but it has also added new crimes and increased the penalties for old crimes. Occasionally, that meant new mandatory minimums or increases in old mandatory minimums. The judicial landscape has changed as well. When the Commission issued its first report the Guidelines were largely binding upon sentencing judges. After the Supreme Court's Booker decision and its progeny, they are largely advisory. Finally, in the ensuing years the public policy debate over mandatory minimum sentences has continued before the Commission, before Congress, and in academic circles. The Commission's second report summarizes views of those who favor mandatory minimums and those who oppose them. Proponents contend that mandatory minimum sentences:", "promote sentencing uniformity and prevent sentencing disparity; afford greater public protection through certain punishment, deterrence, and incapacitation; inflict just desserts; induce plea bargains and offender cooperation and thus contribute to law enforcement efficiency; and assist state and local law enforcement efforts.", "Opponents, on the other hand, contend that mandatory minimum sentences:", "contribute to both excessive uniformity and unwarranted disparity; result in disproportionate and excessively severe sentences; fail to account for individualized circumstances; transfer sentencing discretion from judges to prosecutors; constitute neither a deterrent nor an effective law enforcement tool; interfere with state law enforcement efforts; and adversely impact various demographic groups.", "It omits as did the first Commission report at least one argument for mandatory minimums. During the Commission's first decade and a half of operation before Booker , the Commission created its own system of mandatory minimum penalties. The Guidelines denied judges sentencing discretion. Imprisonment was mandatory by operation of the Guidelines in the vast majority of cases. True, it occurred by operation of the exercise of a delegation of Congress's legislative authority rather than by direct exercise. Yet the result was same, a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. The Guideline system was more nuanced, but that is a difference of degree not of kind.", "Finally, the most obvious difference between the first and second Commission reports is focus. To an extent the Commission could not provide in its infancy, the second report describes, analyzes, and makes recommendations relating to the four major groups of federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes: those involving drug crimes, gun crimes, sex crimes, and identity theft crimes."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Boundaries", "paragraphs": ["Defendants sentenced to mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment have challenged them on a number of constitutional grounds beginning with Congress's legislative authority and ranging from cruel and unusual punishment through ex post facto and double jeopardy to equal protection and due process.

It enjoys only such powers as can be traced to the Constitution. All other powers are reserved to the states or to the people.

It also grants Congress authority to enact legislation \"necessary and proper\" to the execution of those powers which it vests in Congress or in any officer or department of the federal government.", "Many of the federal laws with mandatory minimum sentencing requirements were enacted pursuant to Congress's legislative authority over crimes occurring on the high seas or within federal enclaves, or to its power to regulate commerce.

Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.... Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.\" The Court then proceeded to conclude that the clause did not authorize Congress to enact a particular statute which purported to outlaw possession of a firearm on school property. Since the statute addressed neither the channels nor instrumentalities of interstate commerce, its survival turned upon whether it came within Congress's power to regulate activities that have a substantial impact on interstate commerce. Here, the statute was found wanting. \"[B]y its terms\" it had \"nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise.\" It \"contain[ed] no jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affect[ed] interstate commerce.\" Its impact on commerce was so remote that to credit it would envision a virtually boundless power and one reserved to the states, the Court felt.

The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.\" Yet purely intrastate activities may have a sufficient impact on interstate commerce to bring them within the reach of Congress's Commerce Clause power. So it is in the case of the Controlled Substances Act where several mandatory minimums are found. The Court concluded in Gonzales v. Raich that:", "Given the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere and concerns about diversion into illicit channels, we have no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA. Thus ... when it enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market in a fungible commodity, Congress was acting well within its authority to 'make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper' to 'regulate Commerce ... among the several States.'

In O'Neil v. Vermont , however, three dissenting justices expressed the view that the cruel and unusual punishments clause's prohibitions extended to \"all punishments which by their excessive length or severity are greatly disproportionate to the offences charged.\"", "The views of the O'Neil dissenters gained further credence after they were quoted by the Court in Weems v. United States , when it invalidated a territorial sentencing scheme which it found both disproportionate in degree and cruel in nature.", "Perhaps because of the unusual nature of the penalties involved, the proportionality doctrine suggested in Weems lay dormant for over 60 years. It reappeared in the capital punishment cases following Furman v. Georgia .", "When the capital punishment statutes enacted in response to Furman came before the Court, one of the threshold questions was whether capital punishment was a per se violation of the cruel and unusual punishments clause. For a plurality of the Court, that question could only be answered by determining whether capital punishment was necessarily \"grossly out of proportion to the severity of [any] crime.\" In the case of murder, \"when a life has been taken deliberately by the offender, [the Court could not] say that the punishment is invariably disproportionate to the crime.\"", "In Coker v. Georgia , a plurality of the Court found \"that death is indeed a disproportionate penalty for the crime of raping an adult woman.\" It did so after considering the general repudiation of the death penalty in such cases by the legislatures of other jurisdictions; the infrequency with which juries in Georgia had been willing to impose the death penalty for rape of an adult woman; and the comparative severity Georgia used to punish other equally or more serious crimes. The Court employed much the same method of analysis in later capital punishment cases which raised the proportionality doctrine.", "Initial efforts to carry the proportionality doctrine to noncapital cases proved unsuccessful. Shortly after Coker , a petitioner, convicted under a recidivist statute which called for an automatic life sentence upon a third felony conviction, sought to persuade the Court that the Eighth Amendment precluded such a sentence based upon a comparative analysis of the severity of the treatment of recidivism in other jurisdictions, Rummel v. Estelle . The majority of the Court was not persuaded. The proportionality doctrine had only been employed in capital punishment cases and Weems , it noted. Both involved punishments, different in nature, from those in Rummel . ", "Moreover, the petitioner had failed to convincingly establish any objective criteria to evidence gross disproportionality. Without some objectively identifiable \"bright light\" marking disproportionality, the Court feared application of the proportionality doctrine would constitute subjective policy making, a task more appropriately left to the legislative bodies.", "Any thoughts that the proportionality doctrine might have been abandoned were dashed almost immediately by Solem v. Helm . Solem declared that imposition of a mandatory term of life imprisonment under a state recidivist statute constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The \"objective criteria\" which guided a proportionality analysis included, \"(i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on the other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\"", "Individualized consideration . Consideration of the defendant's unique circumstances is one of the foundations of the Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence in capital punishment cases. Furman found that the Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishments clause, made binding upon the states by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, precluded imposition of the death penalty at the unguided discretion of the judge or jury.", "The states initially travelled one of two paths to avoid the problems of unguided discretion identified in Furman . Some eliminated discretion; others provided guidance. The second approach passed constitutional muster, Gregg v. Georgia . The first did not, Woodson v. North Carolina . Mandatory capital punishment offended the Eighth Amendment on three grounds, it was said in Woodson . It was contrary to the evolving standards of decency which mark the threshold of the Amendment's protection. It failed to address the objections of Furman to imposition of the death penalty at the unguided discretion of the judge or jury. And it failed to permit consideration of individual characteristics of the crime and offender:", "A process that accords no significance to relevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender or the circumstances of the particular offense excludes from consideration in fixing the ultimate punishment of death the possibility of compassionate or mitigating factors stemming from the diverse frailties of humankind. It treats all persons convicted of a designated offense not as uniquely individual human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to be subjected to the blind infliction of the penalty of death....", "Consideration of both the offender and the offense in order to arrive at a just and appropriate sentence has been viewed as a progressive and humanizing development. While the prevailing practice of individualizing sentencing determinations generally reflects simply enlightened policy rather than a constitutional imperative, we believe that in capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment, requires consideration of the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death. 428 U.S. at 304 (citations omitted).", "The Court regularly and consistently recognized the individual considerations requirement in subsequent capital punishment cases. Although the language cited above and other dicta would seem to apply with similar force in noncapital cases, the Court emphasized that the doctrine was limited to capital cases.

Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist simply refused to recognize an Eighth Amendment proportionality requirement, at least in noncapital cases.

More precisely, the plurality emphasized that \"the Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence. Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime.\" In the case of Harmelin, the sentence was not grossly disproportionate because of the severity of his crime, that is, \"the pernicious effects of the drug epidemic in this country ... demonstrate that the ... legislature could with reason conclude that the threat posed to the individual and society by possession of this large an amount of cocaine \u2013 in terms of violence, crime, and social displacement \u2013 is momentous enough to warrant the deterrence and retribution of a life sentence without parole.\"", "The plurality opinion also contains several useful observations about the constitutionality of mandatory sentences per se.", "Deference to legislative judgment notwithstanding, when the Court later applied the same gross disproportionality standard in an excessive fines context, it seemed to imply that even misconduct legislatively classified as a fairly serious crime (a felony) might lack the gravity to support boundless sanctions.

In the eyes of the Court, the crime involved a \"minimal level of culpability.\" Moreover, \"[t]he harm ... caused was also minimal. Failure to report this currency affected only one party, the Government, and in a relatively minor way.... Had his crime gone undetected, the Government would have been deprived only of the information that $357,144 had left the country....

These cases also have their origin in the death penalty cases.", "The first of these, Atkins v. Virginia , held that the Eighth Amendment barred execution of a mentally retarded defendant. In the years leading up to Atkins , a substantial number of state legislatures in capital punishment states had banned execution of the mentally retarded. Elsewhere, though permitted in law, the practice has been abandoned in fact. This, coupled with the fact that a want of defendant capacity undermines the normal expectations and justifications of the criminal justice system, marked execution of the mentally retarded as an Eighth Amendment impermissible excessive punishment.", "For much the same reason, the Court shortly thereafter in Roper v. Simmons declared that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing the death penalty for a crime committed as a juvenile. Next, the Court carried the Atkins-Roper line of cases beyond the capital punishment realm. In Graham v. Florida , Justice Kennedy explained that \"[t]he Court's cases addressing the proportionality of sentences fall within two general classifications. The first involves challenges to the length of term-of-years sentences given all the circumstances of a particular case. The second comprises cases in which the Court implements the proportionality standard by certain categorical restrictions on the death penalty.\" In the first line of cases, the Solem-Harmelin-Ewing line, the Court employs a proportionality standard, and \"it has been difficult for the challenger to establish a lack of proportionality.\"", "In the second line of cases, the Atkins-Roper line, Graham recognized a two-step approach used when the challenge is based on a characteristic of the defendant, such as his mental capacity as in Atkins or his age as in Roper . First, the Court \"considers 'objective indicia of society's standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice' to determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue.\" Second, \"guided by 'the standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court's own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment's text, history, meaning, and purpose,' the Court must determine in the exercise of its own independent judgment whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution.\" ", "Graham challenged his sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole imposed the commission of a nonhomicide, armed robbery, committed while a child. Using this Atkins-Roper approach the Court concluded that the Eighth Amendment precluded Graham's sentence. It carried that logic forward in Miller v. Alabama . The Miller defendants had been convicted of capital murder committed while juveniles and had been sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. That the Eighth Amendment does not permit, the Court held. The Miller sentencing procedures suffered from two previously identified constitutional defects. First, they barred consideration of the mitigating impact of the defendant's age:", "By removing youth from the balance \u2013 by subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole sentence applicable to an adult \u2013 these laws prohibit a sentencing authority from assessing whether the law's harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender. That contravenes Graham's (also Roper's ) foundational principle: that imposition of a State's most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children.", "Second, the procedure not only failed to account a paramount culpability-reducing factor, but it also failed to account for the severity of the sentence when imposed upon a child:", "Graham makes plain these mandatory scheme's defects in another way: by likening life-without-parole sentences imposed on juveniles to the death penalty itself. Life-without-parole terms, the Court wrote, share some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences. Imprisoning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of his life by a forfeiture that is irrevocable. And this lengthiest possible incarceration is an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile because he will almost inevitably serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender. The penalty when imposed on a teenage, as compared with an older person, is therefore the same in name only. All of that suggested a distinctive set of legal rules: In part because we viewed this ultimate penalty for juveniles as akin to the death penalty, we treated it similarly to that most severe punishment.", "Thus, under the current state of the law, the Eighth Amendment bars imposition of a mandatory life term of imprisonment upon juveniles and most likely a particular term of imprisonment in those exceptionally rare cases when the punishment is grossly disproportionate to the offense.

After Winship , the question arose whether a statute might authorize or require a more severe penalty for a particular crime based on a fact\u2014not included in the indictment, not found by the jury, and not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Pennsylvania passed a law under which various serious crimes (rape, robbery, kidnapping, and the like) were subject to a mandatory minimum penalty of imprisonment for five years, if the judge after conviction found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had been in visible possession of a firearm during the commission of the offense. Had the Pennsylvania statute created a new series of crimes? For example, had it supplemented its crime of rape with a new crime of rape while in visible possession of a firearm? And if so, did the fact of visible possession have to be proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt?", "The Supreme Court concluded that visible possession of a firearm under the statute was not an element of a new series of crimes, but was instead a sentencing consideration that had been given a legislatively prescribed weight. As such, the Pennsylvania statutory scheme neither offended due process nor triggered any right to a separate jury finding. ", "There followed a number of state and federal statutes under which facts that might earlier have been treated as elements of a new crime were simply classified as sentencing factors. In some instances, the new sentencing factor permitted imposition of a penalty far in excess of that otherwise available for the underlying offense. For instance, the Supreme Court found no constitutional defect in a statute which punished a deported alien for returning to the United States by imprisonment for not more than 2 years, but which permitted the alien to be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 20 years upon a post-trial, judicial determination that the alien had been convicted of a serious crime following deportation. ", "Perhaps uneasy with the implications, the Court soon made it clear that, \"under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Apprendi v. New Jersey . Side opinions questioned the continued vitality of McMillan 's mandatory minimum determination in light of the Apprendi .", "Initially unwilling to extend Apprendi to mandatory minimums in Harris , the Court did so in Alleyne v. United States . Alleyne was convicted under the statute that imposes a series of mandatory minimum penalties upon defendants who carry a firearm during and in furtherance of a crime of violence (5 years for carrying; 7 years for brandishing; 10 years for discharging). The jury found him guilty of carrying; the court concluded the gun had been brandished. The Sixth Amendment requires that the question of brandishing had to be found by the jury, the Court declared:", "Harris drew a distinction between facts that increase the statutory maximum and facts that increase only the mandatory minimum. We conclude that this distinction is inconsistent with our decision in Apprendi and with the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. Mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an element that must be submitted to the jury.

The courts remain to be convinced that the mandatory minimum features of the section pose any separation of powers impediments. Defendants who invoke double jeopardy have been reminded that \"the Supreme Court has long since determined that recidivist statutes do not violate double jeopardy because 'the enhanced punishment imposed for the later offense is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes, but instead as a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.'\" Much the same response has awaited those in \u00a73559(c) cases who seek refuge in ex post facto, \"the use of predicate felonies to enhance a defendant's sentence does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because such enhancements do not represent additional penalties for earlier crimes, but rather stiffen the penalty for the latest crime
