Many are living in areas that have seen intense fighting; they have nowhere to go within Syria and external flight options are limited. A case in point is the Yarmouk refugee camp near Damascus. From a pre-conflict population of about 160,000, there are approximately 18,000 Palestinians (and possibly non-Palestinian civilians) in the camp. Yarmouk has been under siege and little to no humanitarian access has been possible for months, despite UNRWA's calls for continuous, uninterrupted access.

Other vulnerable populations include third country nationals and vulnerable migrants. At this point it is not known how many of the refugee and vulnerable populations have been displaced. Moreover, these numbers do not account for populations who may have been living in Syria, but were not registered as refugees.

Many observers are predicting a further spike in the number of displaced persons.

Contributions to the crisis have also been made outside of the U.N. appeals process.

The December 18, 2012, version of the appeals was the fourth revision and covered the period January to June 2013.

Despite the provision of substantial humanitarian assistance, insecurity within Syria and lack of cooperation by the Syrian government has severely hampered efforts by governments, U.N. entities, and humanitarian partners to access affected areas to provide humanitarian assistance to populations in need. Funding Shortfalls. Although the United Nations and governments, including the United States, have worked with both traditional and non-traditional donors to generate and increase contributions, the two U.N. appeals remain underfunded. Willingness and cooperation of neighboring countries . So far, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey have received the vast majority of refugees from Syria. The United States and the international community have recognized the contribution of neighboring countries and supported their efforts while simultaneously encouraging them to keep their borders open to those fleeing the conflict. Nevertheless, in the short term, the increasing numbers of refugees strain the infrastructure and capacity of these countries, and in the long term, they create concerns that the situation could become protracted with limited ongoing international support and attention. Ongoing capacity by the international community to keep pace with humanitarian developments . The urgent humanitarian needs coupled with the speed at which the situation is changing have many experts concerned that the international response capacity could be overwhelmed if the current pace and scope of conflict and displacement continues.", "Amid these factors, Congress may also need to weigh the following:", "Balancing priorities . Finding the resources to sustain U.S. aid pledges may be difficult in light of domestic budget constraints. When humanitarian emergencies like the Syria situation require immediate emergency relief, the Administration may fund pledges by depleting most global humanitarian accounts. In order to respond to future humanitarian crises, however, these resources would need to be replenished. If not replenished, U.S. capacity to respond to other emergencies could be diminished. Burdensharing . Both Congress and the Administration have encouraged other countries to provide humanitarian assistance for the Syria situation and to turn pledges into actual commitments. It is not always evident whether figures listing donor amounts represent pledges of support or more specific obligations. Pledges made by governments do not always result in actual contributions, as demonstrated by the donor conferences in Kuwait. It also cannot be assumed that the funds committed to relief actually represent new contributions, since the money may have been previously allocated elsewhere. Moreover, it is not readily apparent how the actual costs of a humanitarian emergency might be shared among international donors. Comparing U.S. assistance and international aid can also be difficult because of the often dramatically different forms the assistance takes (relief items versus cash, for instance). ", "More broadly, political considerations play a role in the way humanitarian assistance is given and to whom. While the images of human suffering only reinforce the need to \"do something,\" humanitarian assistance carries some weight as an instrument of \"neutral\" intervention and is the most flexible policy tool that can be quickly brought to bear in a crisis. Sometimes humanitarian assistance is expanded beyond its immediate function to avert a crisis, to provide support to allies, and to maintain a presence in the region. How it is used and whether it becomes more of a strategic, policy tool depends upon the situation, what other governments are doing, and the degree to which the United States has further interest in the region. ", "Providing humanitarian assistance also raises questions about implications for future action. On the one hand, if the United States decides to reduce its humanitarian support to Syria, would this diminish U.S. standing among its allies or affect its interests in other ways? On the other hand, since the President has a great deal of flexibility over U.S. involvement, once commitment to a humanitarian effort is made, does this make the long-term U.S. participation in reconstruction and political solutions more likely? Regardless, the level and sources of U.S. humanitarian assistance will inevitably have an important impact not only on the Syrian relief operation itself, but on broader U.S. foreign policy goals.", "Appendix A.
