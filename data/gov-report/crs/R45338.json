In addition, the FCC seeks to encourage diversity, including (1) the diversity of viewpoints, as reflected in the availability of media content reflecting a variety of perspectives; (2) diversity of programming, as indicated by a variety of formats and content; (3) outlet diversity, to ensure the presence of multiple independently owned media outlets within a geographic market; and (4) minority and female ownership of broadcast media outlets.", "Two FCC media ownership rules have proven particularly controversial. Its national media ownership rule prohibits any entity from owning commercial television stations that reach more than 39% of U.S. households nationwide. Its \"UHF discount\" rule discounts by half the reach of a station broadcasting in the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) band for the purpose of applying the national media ownership rule. In December 2017, the commission opened a rulemaking proceeding, seeking comments about whether it should modify or repeal the two rules. If the FCC retains the UHF discount, even if it maintains the 39% cap, a single entity could potentially reach 78% of U.S. households through its ownership of broadcast television stations.", "An important issue with respect to the national ownership cap, which the FCC has not addressed in a rulemaking, is how the agency treats a situation in which a broadcaster manages, operates, or sells advertising for a television station owned by another. In some cases, the FCC has articulated its policy on an ad hoc basis in the context of merger reviews, while in other instances it has effectively consented to such arrangements through its silence. Thus, a single entity could comply with the national ownership cap while still influencing broadcast television stations it does not own, reaching more viewers than permitted under the cap. For example, in reviewing the now-cancelled proposed merger between Sinclair Broadcast Group and Tribune Media Company in 2018, FCC commissioners raised concerns that Sinclair's proposed sale of Tribune's Chicago station WGN-TV in order to comply with the national ownership cap could effectively be a \"sham\" transaction due to Sinclair's relationships with the proposed buyer. Nevertheless, neither Sinclair's application nor the FCC's order for a designated hearing addressed whether Sinclair's intention to operate four television stations owned by others within the Wilkes-Barre-Scranton-Hazleton, PA, television market might cause it to breach the national ownership cap.", "In November 2017, acting in response to petitions from broadcast station licensees, the FCC repealed or relaxed several local media ownership rules. The repealed rules limited common ownership of broadcast television and radio stations within the same market, and of television stations and newspapers within the same market. The FCC also relaxed rules limiting common ownership of two top-four television stations (generally, ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC stations) within the same market. In August 2018, the FCC issued rules governing a new \"incubator\" program designed to enhance ownership diversity. Parties, including the Prometheus Radio Project, have appealed these orders. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is scheduled to hear arguments regarding the legal challenges to all of the FCC's recent broadcast media ownership rule changes.

Based on surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, the percentage of adults citing local broadcast television as a news source declined from 65% in 1996 to 37% in 2016.

Generally, the four broadcast networks covered by this definition are ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC. The FCC did not address the dual network rule in its 2017 Reconsideration Order, and the rule therefore remains in effect.", "The FCC first adopted this rule, which originally prohibited ownership of any two networks, with respect to radio in 1941, as part of the Chain Broadcasting Report . The FCC directed the rule at NBC, the only company at that time with two radio networks. The FCC found that the operation of two networks gave NBC excessive control over its affiliated broadcast radio stations, and an unfair competitive advantage over other broadcast radio networks. The FCC extended the dual network rule to television networks in 1946. ", "Section 202(e) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed the FCC to revise its dual network rule. Per the act, the FCC modified the rule to enable common ownership of two networks, as long as one of the networks was not among the top four networks (i.e., ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC). In 2001, the FCC revised the rule to permit one of the four major networks to jointly own one of those emerging networks, which have since merged into the CW network. Today, the CBS Corporation has a partial ownership interest in the CW broadcast network. In 2016, the FCC retained the \"dual network\" rule without modification, in order to foster its goals of preserving competition and localism.
