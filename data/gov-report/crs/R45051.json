The amount of assets they hold, the services they provide, and how they secure funding are just a few examples. These differences affect an individual organization's risk of failure and the risk its failure or distress could pose to the overall financial system. Policymakers generally agree that certain banking regulations should be tailored to account for such differences, and as a result, banks are currently subject to or exempt from various regulations if they meet certain criteria. To what degree existing bank classifications adequately tailor regulation and how tailoring should be designed and implemented are debated issues. This report examines", "existing and proposed bank regulatory classifications, legislation that proposes to change existing classifications or create new ones, and, the characteristics of bank organizations that fall under existing and proposed classifications.", "Banks are classified in a variety of ways. Some are informal classifications that refer to widely understood differences between community and Wall Street banks\u2014two commonly recognized types of banks\u2014but that are unofficial classifications that do not affect banking regulations. For example, community banks are understood to be small institutions that meet the credit needs of a community and Wall Street banks are understood to be large, complex institutions that could individually pose risk to the financial system. Existing regulatory classifications are official classifications applied to banks that meet some criteria and determine whether a bank is subject to certain regulations. In addition, several existing proposals would establish new regulatory classifications and criteria.", "Often (but not always) existing criteria are size-based thresholds that subject a bank to more stringent regulation once it exceeds a certain amount of assets. Proponents of this system argue simple, \"bright line\" rules create certainty and transparency and that asset size is an adequate measurement to identify which institutions should or should not be subject to certain regulation. Critics argue it too narrowly focuses on one aspect of a bank organization, and thus may subject certain banks to inappropriate regulation. Critics may argue that new or additional criteria based on other characteristics (e.g., the business activities a bank engages in or the amount of capital it holds) should be implemented.", "To investigate how well certain criteria would appropriately tailor regulation, it is informative to examine characteristics of banking organizations and compare banks that meet some criteria to those that do not. This report examines characteristics such as asset size; concentrations in loans, deposits, trading assets, and trading liabilities; activity in derivatives; and capital levels. The analysis generally suggests that these characteristics are correlated; larger banks tend to be involved in more business lines and hold less capital whereas smaller banks tend to be more focused on making loans and taking deposits and hold more capital. However, the large number of banks and the high degree of variation across multiple variables means that no set of criteria is easily and objectively identifiable as the best means of tailoring regulations.", "In the 115th Congress, numerous bills\u2014including H.R. 10, H.R. 1116, H.R. 1948, H.R. 2121, H.R. 3072, H.R. 3312, S. 1002, S. 1284, S. 1499, and S. 1893\u2014would change the existing system of bank regulation tailoring.

Policymakers and experts generally agree that bank regulation should be tailored to account for these differences between institutions. As result, regulations are generally applied to banks based on meeting or not meeting some criteria. These criteria are established on an ad hoc basis, and are often (but not always) based on whether the bank is above or below a certain asset size threshold, such as $1 billion, $10 billion, or $50 billion in total assets. To what degree the application of regulation should vary and how those variations should be designed and implemented are debated issues. These issues have been prominent in recent years at least in part because legislative and regulatory responses to the financial crisis\u2014such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank; P.L. 111-203 ) and the international agreement known as Basel III Accord \u2014have amended or introduced a number of regulations that include tailoring criteria.", "Bank regulation aims to achieve certain potential benefits (e.g., better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability) that justify potential costs of the regulation (e.g., reduced credit availability for certain consumers and businesses, slower economic growth over some period of time). The size of the realized benefits and costs of a regulation for any individual bank or group of banks are likely to depend in part on certain characteristics of that bank or group, such as willingness to take on risk, systemic importance, and ability to absorb compliance costs. Thus, appropriately fitting regulation to banks of different types is an important component of designing effective and efficient regulation. For illustrative purposes, consider the following simplified example. A regulation aimed at reducing systemic risk may produce greater benefit when applied to a very large, complex, globally active and interconnected institution than when applied to a single-branch institution making residential and farm loans in a rural community. In addition, the large institution may have more resources to comply with the regulation. ", "Achieving appropriate tailoring for thousands of diverse banks is more difficult than laid out in the stylized example above. Determining which banks should be regulated similarly to each other, differently from others, and how regulation should differ between groups varies from regulation to regulation. For example, the Dodd-Frank mandates enhanced prudential regulation for bank holding companies (BHCs) with more than $50 billion in assets and assigns primary consumer compliance supervision of banks with more than $10 billion to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). U.S. regulators have created classifications\u2014largely in adherence to Basel III\u2014designating some large BHCs as advanced approaches banks and globally systemically important banks , subjecting them to stricter capital and liquidity requirements. Classifications are also in place for small banks. For example, certain banks with less than $1 billion are subject to less frequent examinations, and BHCs below that threshold are exempt from certain requirements involving mergers and capital ratios. In addition, a popular, but unofficial, terminology\u2014which includes terms such as community bank and Wall Street \u2014is used during debate related to bank regulation.", "An exhaustive examination of all classifications and thresholds and dimensions across which these various types of banks differ is beyond the scope of this report.

Although these banks may typically be small in terms of asset size, conceptually that does not necessarily have to be a determining factor. Nevertheless, community banks are often identified as such based on their small asset size. Complicating the identification of community banks using only size as a criterion is that no consensus exists over what the specific size threshold should be. In addition, many have observed that most small banks are generally different from large banks in a variety of ways besides asset size. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for research purposes, identifies community banks by assessing certain metrics related to asset size, balance sheet characteristics, and geographic footprint. Under this definition, six banks with more than $10 billion in assets and one with almost $41 billion in assets were classified as community banks. ", "Community banks are likely to be more concentrated in core commercial bank businesses of making loans and taking deposits and less involved in other activities such as securities trading or holding derivatives. Community banks also tend to operate within a smaller geographic area. These banks are generally more likely to practice relationship lending wherein loan officers and other bank employees have a longer-standing and perhaps more personal relationship with borrowers. Due in part to these characteristics, proponents of community banks assert that these banks are particularly important credit sources to local communities and otherwise underserved groups, as big banks may be unwilling to meet the credit needs of a small market of which they have little knowledge. Finally, relative to large banks, small banks are likely to have fewer employees, fewer resources to dedicate to regulatory compliance, and are less likely to individually pose a systemic risk to the broader financial system.

Although at least one of these subsidiaries must be a chartered bank, many others could be nonbanks, such as broker-dealers, asset managers, and insurance brokers or agents. Wall Street banks may be internationally active and have a global presence. The term Wall Street bank comes from the prominent role many of these institutions play in underwriting and trading securities, activities that commonly take place on Wall Street in New York City.

A bank is said to be TBTF when policymakers judge that its failure would cause such serious disruptions to the financial system that the resulting economic and social outcomes would be unacceptable. To avoid these outcomes, the government would be compelled to save the institution from failure, perhaps by directly giving it funding. Characteristics that could make an institution so important to the functioning of the financial system include its size, interconnectedness, complexity, or central role in a certain market or sector. The belief among market participants that the government will protect a certain bank or groups of banks could lead to moral hazard , wherein market participants do not adequately assess or monitor risk because they feel protected from potential losses. Moral hazard can result in excessive risk taking by the bank, lax risk monitoring by shareholders and creditors, and unfair funding advantages. In addition, government \"bailouts\" expose taxpayers to potential losses. Whether the policy reforms enacted by Dodd-Frank and Basel III effectively addressed these problems is a matter of debate.

Banks generally face many prudential (or \"safety and soundness\") regulations, including requirements to maintain a certain minimum capital level and prohibitions on proprietary trading and affiliations with certain investment funds and companies.

In addition, the quarterly reporting forms small banks are required to file with federal bank regulators are simpler and less detailed than those filed by larger banks.

A detailed examination of how the scores are calculated and what qualifies a bank as a G-SIB is beyond the scope of this report, but what is pertinent is that the size of the institution constitutes only one of 12 indicators measured under method 1 and one of nine indicators in method 2.

Subjecting such an institution to costly regulation aimed at containing risks presented by complex activities, such as engaging in wholesale funding markets, securities market making, and hedging with derivatives, would arguably be unduly burdensome. Likewise, an institution that does engage significantly in such activities could be (and possibly strategically choose to remain) below a threshold at which such regulations come into effect. Again, the distinctions are conceptually simple, but hard in practice. The activities and markets a bank could engage in are myriad; where should policymakers draw the line?", "Examples of activities-based criteria could be those that place limitations on securities and derivatives trading in which the bank engages. Trading assets and liabilities are generally financial instruments that a bank underwrites and deals in, has positions in for the purpose of selling in the near term, or has a position in to accommodate a customer. Trading assets and liabilities could potentially experience relatively large price fluctuations due to market volatility, and thus expose a bank to additional risks. Derivatives are instruments with values based on some underlying asset or reference, such as interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices, or commodities prices, and sudden, unexpected changes in the rate or value of the underlying references could expose derivatives holders to large losses and increased cash obligations to counterparties. In this way, although derivatives can be used to hedge risks, they can also expose an individual bank to additional risks. In addition, because counterparties in a derivative are often other financial institutions, derivatives could increase a bank's interconnectivity with the rest of the financial system. Because these activities are complex and potentially expose individual banks and the financial system to additional risks, they have been proposed as tailoring-based criteria.", "Thomas Hoenig, the vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has made one such proposal. He argues a new classification of banks\u2014\"Traditional Banking Organizations\" (TBOs)\u2014should be established that would make qualifying banks eligible for certain regulatory relief. In the original April 2015 proposal, he suggested \"defining eligibility for regulatory relief around the following criteria: ", "banks that hold, effectively, zero trading assets or liabilities; banks that hold no derivative positions other than interest rate swaps and foreign exchange derivatives; and banks whose total notional value of all their derivatives exposures\u2014including cleared and non-cleared derivatives\u2014is less than $3 billion [later proposed at $8 billion].\"", "This classification is intended to identify banks that limit themselves to minimal activity in certain markets that are perceived to be outside of a traditional commercial banking model, and exempt those from certain regulations, including certain Basel III and Dodd-Frank requirements. Advocates of this approach contend the criteria used in the classification accurately separate banks into two groups that use business models with substantially different risk profiles. ", "However, opponents of measures to separate traditional banking from other activities often argue that, while the activities identified in these criteria pose risks, it is not clear whether they pose greater risks to bank solvency and financial stability than do traditional banking activities, such as mortgage lending. Furthermore, taking on additional risks in different markets might diversify a bank's risk profile, making it less likely to fail. If this assessment is accurate, the TBO criteria would arguably be inappropriate measures of bank riskiness and thus not necessarily an appropriate basis for regulatory tailoring.", "In the 115 th Congress, S. 2155 , H.R. 10 and H.R. 2121 would put certain activities-based criteria into statue, and in the 114 th Congress, H.R. 4647 also addressed these criteria.

Importantly, capital\u2014unlike liabilities\u2014does not require repayment of a specified amount of money, and so its value can fluctuate. Thus, capital gives banks the ability to absorb losses without failing. Because a primary goal of prudential regulation is to ensure that banks (whatever their size or activity) are unlikely to fail, and because how a bank chooses to fund itself is an important aspect of its business model, some policymakers have proposed tailoring criteria based on a bank's capital levels.", "Banks are currently required to satisfy several minimum capital requirements, generally expressed as ratios between items on bank balance sheets. Capital ratios fall into one of two main types\u2014a leverage ratio or a risk-weighted ratio . A leverage ratio treats all assets the same, requiring banks to hold the same amount of capital against the asset regardless of how risky each asset is. A risk-weighted ratio assigns a risk weight\u2014a number based on the riskiness of the asset that the asset value is multiplied by\u2014because some assets are more likely to lose value than others. Riskier assets receive a higher risk weight, which requires banks to hold more capital\u2014to better enable them to absorb potential losses\u2014to meet the ratio requirement. Tailoring regulations using capital-based criteria would entail identifying at least one of these ratios or constructing another to serve as the benchmark and establishing some level above the minimum at which a bank would be deemed well-capitalized enough to qualify for exemptions for some regulations. ", "An example of such a classification is the election option for strongly capitalized banks proposed in the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 (FCA; H.R. 10 ), which would exempt banks that maintain a minimum capital ratio from a variety of prudential regulations. Currently, most banks must maintain at least 4% leverage ratio, and many choose to hold more. Under the FCA, if a bank had a 10% leverage ratio, it could elect to be exempt from requirements, including other capital ratios, certain liquidity requirements, and stress-test requirements. The FCA is covered in more detail in the \" Selected Legislation \" section.", "Proponents of the measure argue that it is unnecessary to subject banks with high leverage ratios to other complex and burdensome regulation because holding that amount of capital makes them safe from failure. However, opponents assert that a single ratio is not a complete measure of bank riskiness and using one to exempt banks from certain requirements unwisely weakens necessary prudential regulation.

Arguably, the first bank should be subject to less burdensome regulation and the second more rigorous. However, suppose a bright line regulatory threshold has been set at $50 billion, and a regulator does not have the authority to make a determination on which regulations to apply. In this scenario, the bank with the slightly higher assets may be subject to additional regulations whereas the slightly smaller one is not. Furthermore, such thresholds can lead to \"cliff effects,\" wherein banks choose to remain below a certain threshold to avoid additional regulation even though growing larger would not necessarily increase their risk profile.

The four largest bank organizations\u2014JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup\u2014are of a very large scale, all holding assets of more than $1.8 trillion. Citigroup, the fourth largest, is more than twice as large as the fifth largest, Goldman Sachs. Another dramatic drop off occurs between the sixth and seventh largest bank, as Morgan Stanley's $841 billion in assets is almost double U.S. Bancorp's $464 billion.

For the group as a whole, the unweighted average of deposits as a share of a bank organization's liabilities is 87%, and loans at the average institution account about 69% of assets. However, among the largest four organizations deposits range between 59% and 78% of liabilities and loans between 35% and 51% of assets, indicating that these institutions are less concentrated in deposit-taking and lending. In addition, although less than 1% of the average bank's assets are trading assets and less than 1% of its liabilities are trading liabilities, the top four's trading assets account for between 5% and 16% of total assets and trading liabilities between 2% and 8% of total liabilities. The fifth and sixth largest banks are even more focused in investment bank activities as opposed to commercial bank deposit-taking and lending. Deposits make up 15% and 19% of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley liabilities, respectively, and loans 11% and 16% of assets. Meanwhile, trading assets account for 34% and 31% of their total assets, respectively, and trading liabilities were 15% of total liabilities for both firms.", "As mentioned above, identifying natural cutoffs points at lower asset sizes becomes more subjective. Because these differences between assets become more incremental, there is no clear differentiation between the business models of groups of banks. The seventh ($464 billion), eighth ($372 billion), 10 th ($351 billion), and 14 th ($220 billion) all are near industry averages in deposits as a percentage of liabilities, loans as a percentage of assets, and trading assets as a percentage of assets, but many of the organizations near these sizes are not. The largest bank to exceed the average of funding with deposits and making loans is the 17 th largest organization with $207 billion in assets. The largest to exceed both these metrics and have less than average trading assets is the 23 rd largest organization with $152 billion in assets.

For example, as of June 30, 2017, there were nine insured depository institutions with more than $250 billion in assets that together accounted for more than 50% of industry assets, up from two institutions over $250 billion that accounted for 9% of industry assets from 20 years earlier.

Critics of recent regulatory changes argue that the regulatory burden on small banks is too onerous, driving smaller banks to merge to create or join larger institutions. However, other observers cite different longer-term factors. Through much of the 20 th century, federal and state laws restricted banks' ability to open new branches and banking across state lines was restricted; branching and banking across state lines was not substantially deregulated at the federal level until the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-328 ). When these restrictions were relaxed, it became easier for small banks to consolidate or mid-size and large banks to spread operations to other markets. In addition, there may be economies of scale (i.e., cost advantages due to size or volume of output) in banking, which would also drive industry consolidation.", "Another issue to be considered regarding banks exceeding fixed thresholds over time is the effect of natural growth in the nominal value of assets due to inflation, the growth of the economy, and the growth of the financial industry. Some thresholds are indexed to change over time. For example, the Community Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 95-128 ) threshold to be classified as a \"small institution\" and exempt from certain reporting requirements is indexed to inflation. However, many thresholds are not indexed, and as a result, fixed thresholds are continually declining over time in terms of real asset value or institution size relative to the economy or the financial industry.
