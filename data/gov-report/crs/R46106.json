{"id": "R46106", "title": "Misuse of Government Purchase Cards: Background, Legislation, and Analysis", "released_date": "2019-12-06T00:00:00", "summary": ["Following their introduction in the mid-1990s, the usage of government purchase cards expanded at a rapid rate. Spurred by legislative and regulatory reforms designed to increase the use of purchase cards for small acquisitions, the dollar volume of government purchase card transactions grew from $527 million in FY1993 to $19.5 billion in FY2011. While the use of purchase cards was credited with reducing administrative costs during that time, audits of agency purchase card programs found varying degrees of waste, fraud, and abuse. One of the most common risk factors cited by auditors was a weak internal control environment: many agencies failed to implement adequate safeguards against card misuse, even as their purchase card programs grew.", "In response to these findings, Congress passed the Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 (Charge Card Act; P.L. 112-194 ), which sought to enhance the management and oversight of agency purchase card programs. Drawing on recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Charge Card Act required executive branch agencies to implement a specific set of internal controls, establish penalties for employees who misuse agency purchase cards, and conduct periodic risk assessments and audits of agency purchase card programs.", "This report begins by providing background on the origin and structure of agency purchase card programs. It then discusses identified weaknesses in agency purchase card controls that have contributed to card misuse, and examines provisions of the Charge Card Act that are intended to address those weaknesses. Finally, the report examines implementation of the Charge Card Act and analyzes ongoing risks to agency purchase card programs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The government's purchase card program has its origins in Executive Order (E.O.) 12352, issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1982. E.O. 12352 directed agencies to develop programs that simplified procedures and reduced the administrative costs of procurement, particularly with regard to \"small\" purchases ($25,000 or less). Several agencies subsequently participated in a pilot program that evaluated the use of a commercial credit card, called a purchase card, as an acquisition tool. At the time, even a routine order for widely available items, such as office supplies, typically required agency program staff to submit a written procurement request to a contracting officer, who reviewed it, obtained the necessary signatures, made the actual purchase, and processed the associated paperwork. To critics, this process was inefficient, especially for small purchases. Not only was it time-consuming for both program and procurement personnel, but it also prevented program offices from quickly filling immediate needs. Under the pilot program, nonprocurement staff used purchase cards to conduct small-dollar transactions directly with local suppliers, thus bypassing procurement officers entirely. A report on the pilot program concluded that purchase cards could reduce administrative costs and improve delivery time, and in 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) tasked the General Services Administration (GSA) with making purchase cards available government-wide.", "Participation in GSA's purchase card program was not mandatory, and card use did not initially grow as rapidly as some had expected. In 1993, however, a report issued by the National Performance Review (NPR) sparked a number of legislative and regulatory reforms intended to increase purchase card use. The NPR was a Clinton Administration initiative that sought to \"reinvent\" the federal government by making government operations both less expensive and more efficient. One of the NPR's objectives was to identify opportunities to streamline a number of government-wide processes, including procurement. Drawing on input from experts in the public and private sectors, the NPR's initial report recommended expanding the use of purchase cards across the government, a step it said would \"lower costs and reduce bureaucracy in small purchases.\" In a separate report that focused solely on procurement, the NPR estimated that if half of all small acquisitions were made using purchase cards, the government would realize $180 million in savings annually. The report further recommended amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the government's primary source of procurement guidance\u00e2\u0080\u0094to promote the use of purchase cards for small purchases.", "Building on the NPR's recommendations, Congress passed the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA; P.L. 103-355 ) in 1994. FASA introduced several reforms that increased the use of purchase cards. Among these, Title IV of FASA established a simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) of $100,000 (increased to $250,000 in 2017). Purchases at or below the threshold were exempted from the provisions of a number of procurement laws. This reform obviated the need for procurement officials to make small purchases. To further streamline procedures for the smallest acquisitions, Title IV also established a \"micro-purchase\" threshold of $2,500 (which was increased to $3,000 in 2006, and again to $10,000 in 2017). FASA further exempted micro-purchases from sections of the Buy American Act and the Small Business Act, and they could be made without obtaining a competitive bid, if the cost was deemed reasonable by the cardholder.", "At the same time, the Clinton Administration took steps to increase the use of purchase cards. Citing the need to make agency procurement procedures \"more consistent with recommendations of the National Performance Review,\" President Clinton issued Executive Order 12931 on October 13, 1994. E.O. 12931 directed agency heads to (1) expand purchase card use; and (2) delegate the micro-purchasing authority provided in FASA to program offices, which would enable them to make purchases whose value did not exceed the micro-purchase threshold. E.O. 12931 also directed agency heads to streamline procurement policies and practices that were not mandated by statute, and to ensure that their agencies were maximizing their use of the new simplified acquisition procedures. In addition, the FAR was amended in 1994 to designate the purchase card as the \"preferred method\" for making micro-purchases.", "Card use increased sharply as agencies implemented these reforms. The dollar value of goods and services acquired with purchase cards increased from $527.0 million in FY1993 to $19.5 billion in FY2011. During that same time span, the number of cardholders nearly tripled to 278,000, and the number of purchase card transactions increased from 1.5 million to just under 22.8 million in FY2011. The flexibility of the purchase card may have contributed to its growth: it could be used for in-store purchases, which allowed the cardholder to take immediate possession of needed goods, or it could be used to place orders by telephone or over the internet and have goods delivered. According to GSA, the use of purchase cards now saves the government $1.7 billion a year in administrative costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structure", "paragraphs": ["The federal purchase card program is implemented by individual agencies, with the involvement of GSA and OMB.

The agency, within the framework of OMB guidance, establishes internal rules and regulations for purchase card use and management, decides which of its employees are to receive purchase cards, and handles billing and payment issues for agency purchase card accounts. Two levels of supervision generally exist within an agency's purchase card program. Individual cardholders are assigned to an Approving Official (AO). The AO is considered the \"first line of defense\" against card misuse, and agency policies often require the AO to ensure that all purchases comply with statutes, regulations, and agency policies. To that end, the AO is responsible for authorizing cardholder purchases, either by approving purchases before they are made or by verifying their legitimacy through reviews of cardholder statements and supporting documentation, such as receipts. The AO may also be required to ensure that statements are reconciled and submitted to the billing office in a timely manner.", "Each agency also appoints an Agency Program Coordinator (APC) to serve as the agency's liaison to the bank and to GSA. At some agencies, each major component has an APC, one of whom is chosen to serve as the agency's liaison.

The SmartPay contracts established prices, terms, and conditions for credit card products and services from these five banks. Purchase cards were established as centrally billed accounts under the contracts, which meant that agencies, and not individual cardholders, were billed for purchases.

As noted, purchase card AOs are usually responsible for reviewing the cardholder's monthly statement. Given that the AO is often the only person other than the cardholder to assess the validity of a purchase before payment is made to the purchase card vendor, the review and approval process is considered one of the most critical components of an agency's purchase card control environment. Steven Kutz, GAO's Managing Director of Forensic Audits and Special Investigations, stated in testimony before the Senate,", "Basic fraud prevention concepts and our previous audits of purchase card programs have shown that opportunities for fraud and abuse arise if cardholders know that their purchases are not being properly reviewed.", "Despite the importance of the AO's role in preventing and detecting improper purchases, some agencies failed to ensure that cardholder statements were carefully reviewed prior to their approval. At the Department of Education, auditors estimated that 37% of monthly cardholder statements they reviewed had not been approved by the AO. GAO also estimated that nearly one of every six purchase card transactions government-wide had not been properly authorized.", "Even when AOs did conduct reviews, they sometimes failed to meet government standards. Agencies are required by OMB to ensure that cardholder statements are compared with supporting documentation, such as invoices and receipts, as part of the review process. This is necessary because purchase card statements are rarely itemized; they usually provide only the store or contractor name and the amount charged. For AOs, receipts and invoices are the principal means of verifying what items were purchased and determining whether those items were for legitimate program purposes. According to GAO, many agencies have not ensured that supporting documentation is available and examined as part of the review and approval process. An audit of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) purchase card program found that the agency did not have adequate documentation for 47% of transactions auditors deemed questionable\u00e2\u0080\u0094purchases from merchants that are not normally expected to do business with HUD\u00e2\u0080\u0094which meant auditors \"were unable to determine what was purchased, for whom, and why.\" Similarly, an audit of the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA's) purchase card program estimated that $313 million of its transactions lacked key supporting documentation.", "One consequence of these weaknesses was that fraudulent and abusive transactions slipped through the review process unnoticed. For instance, GAO found that AOs at agencies across the government approved cardholder statements that included questionable transactions, such as purchases of jewelry, home furnishings, cruise tickets, electronics, and other consumer goods. At the Forest Service, one employee used her purchase card over a period of years to accumulate more than $31,000 in jewelry and electronics. Similarly, HUD cardholders spent $27,000 at department stores like Macy's and J.C. Penney in a single year. In one egregious case, a Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) employee had his statement approved even though it showed he violated agency policy by charging cash advances to his purchase card\u00e2\u0080\u0094while at a casino.", "The lack of adequate oversight is also evident where AOs have approved duplicate transactions\u00e2\u0080\u0094vendors charging the government twice for the same goods or services\u00e2\u0080\u0094and purchases made by someone other than the cardholder. One audit identified an estimated $177,187 in duplicate charges at one agency. An audit at FAA discovered that a cardholder had allowed unauthorized individuals to charge over $160,000 to her purchase card account. When an AO identifies unauthorized and duplicate transactions, the agency should use the process described in the SmartPay master contract to dispute the charges. When AOs fail to identify and dispute fraudulent charges, the government often pays them in full or fails to obtain a refund from the purchase card vendor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inconsistent Program Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["GAO further found that many agencies failed to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of their purchase card controls, a responsibility that is often assigned to the APC. Monitoring and evaluation may include sampling purchase card transactions for potentially improper purchases, ensuring purchase card policies are being properly implemented across the agency or component, and assessing program results. These duties are often unfulfilled. At FAA, for example, an audit found that APCs \"generally were not\" utilizing available reports to detect misuse and fraud, nor was the headquarters APC taking steps to assess the overall program. Similarly, an audit of the Forest Service purchase card program found that the agency's APCs failed to review sampled transactions for erroneous or abusive purchases, as required by USDA regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Separation of Duties", "paragraphs": ["Agencies are required to ensure that key procurement functions are handled by different individuals. When having goods shipped, for example, the same person should not approve and place the order, or place the order and receive the goods. At many agencies, however, the cardholder may perform two functions that should be separated, which increases the possibility that items may be purchased for personal use, lost, or stolen. In March 2008, GAO estimated that agencies were unable to document separation of duties for one of every three purchase card transactions. Three Navy cardholders ordered and received $500,000 of goods for themselves with their purchase cards before getting caught. In this way, inadequate separation of duties may result in millions of dollars of items that cannot be located. Items that are easily converted to personal use\u00e2\u0080\u0094commonly referred to as \"pilferable property\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. The Department of Education, for example, could not account for 241 personal computers bought with purchase cards at a cost of $261,500.

Through training, cardholders, approving officials, and program managers learn their roles in ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and statutes, and in reducing the risk of improper card use. To that end, OMB requires all agencies to train everyone who participates in a purchase card program. Cardholder training covers federal procurement laws and regulations, agency policies, and proper card use. Approving officials are required to receive the same training as cardholders, in addition to training in their duties as AOs. Program managers are required to be trained in cardholder and AO responsibilities, as well as management, control, and oversight tools and techniques. In addition, all purchase card program participants are supposed to complete their initial training prior to appointment (e.g., becoming a cardholder, or being designated as an AO or program manager) and receive refresher training at least every three years.", "Agency audits published between 2002 and 2011 revealed a number of agencies had not fully implemented OMB's training requirements. A report by the inspector general at the Department of the Interior (DOI), for example, noted that DOI had not provided any training to its AOs, and concluded that many of those officials were not performing adequate reviews. The AOs themselves reportedly said that they did not know how to conduct a proper review of purchase card transactions, or how and why to review supporting documentation\u00e2\u0080\u0094both subjects that are normally included in AO training.", "Similarly, an audit at FAA concluded that the agency's failure to provide refresher training for cardholders and AOs may have contributed to violations of statutory sourcing requirements. The failure to comply with sourcing statutes, which require agencies to purchase certain goods and services from specified vendor categories, may undermine congressional procurement objectives. The Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWOD), for example, requires the government to buy office supplies and services from nonprofits that employ blind and disabled Americans.

GAO might be asked to evaluate specific requirements, particularly in areas that were cited by auditors prior to the Charge Card Act. Have agencies implemented policies that require separation of duties? Have agencies established appropriate dollar thresholds for various categories of cardholders? Are agencies invalidating purchase cards when an employee terminates employment or is transferred to another component?

As noted, agencies have reported that merchant block codes do not always prevent transactions from being approved at prohibited merchants. In addition, GAO found that SmartPay banks did not always retain records for the amount of time required by their contracts, in part due to confusion over which records were considered part of the transaction. An evaluation of bank services might identify additional issues that need to be addressed. It also might include a comparison of the technologies different agencies utilize and discuss what benefits they have realized. Given the potential for technology to enhance oversight, reduce administrative burden, and mitigate the risk of improper purchases, an assessment of SmartPay bank services may help agencies identify potentially useful technologies they have not yet incorporated into their charge card programs."], "subsections": []}]}}
