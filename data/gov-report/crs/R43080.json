There is no authorized level for NASA funding in FY2014; the most recent authorization act (the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, P.L. 111-267 ) authorized appropriations through FY2013.", "The FY2014 request for Science was $5.018 billion. The FY2013 appropriation (after sequestration) was $4.782 billion. The House and Senate committees recommended $4.781 billion and $5.154 billion respectively. The final appropriation is $5.151 billion.", "Within the Science account, the request for Planetary Science ($1.218 billion) included $40.5 million for observation of near-Earth objects and $50 million for management of a Department of Energy (DOE) program to produce plutonium-238, which some spacecraft use for power generation. In the past, congressional policy makers disagreed about whether NASA or DOE should fund DOE production of plutonium-238 for NASA. The House and Senate committee recommendations for Planetary Science were respectively $1.315 billion and $1.318 billion. Among other differences relative to the request, the House committee recommended increases for exploration of Mars and the outer planets and no funding for plutonium-238 production. The Senate committee's recommended increase was entirely for Mars exploration. The final appropriation for planetary science is $1.345 billion. This total included increases for exploration of Mars the outer planets and up to the requested amount for plutonium-238 production.", "Also in the Science account, the request for Earth Science was $1.846 billion. The FY2013 appropriation for Earth Science (after sequestration) was $1.659 billion. The Earth Science request included $30 million to begin development of future land imaging capabilities to replace the current Landsat satellites, operated by the U.S. Geological Survey, as well as funds to assume responsibility for certain Earth-observing satellite instruments previously held by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The House committee recommended $1.659 billion for Earth Science, and its report stated that no funds should be spent on the proposed Landsat and NOAA-related activities. The Senate committee recommended approximately the requested amount for Earth Science, including the requested funds for land imaging, but its report expressed concern about the Administration's approach and directed NASA to submit a plan for implementing future Landsat satellites at substantially lower cost. The final appropriation for Earth Science is $1.826 billion. The explanatory statement took the Senate report's position on land imaging and directed NASA to submit a plan to Congress before expending funds on some of the disputed sensors for NOAA.", "The request for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), also funded in the Science account, was $658.2 million. NASA expects FY2014 to be the peak funding year for JWST and states that the budget and schedule for the JWST program remain consistent with the 2011 revised plan. In the FY2012 appropriations conference report, Congress capped the formulation and development cost of JWST and mandated annual reports on the program by the Government Accountability Office. The House committee recommended $584.0 million for JWST in FY2014. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount. The final appropriation is the requested amount.", "The request for Aeronautics was $565.7 million. The FY2013 appropriation (after sequestration) was $529.5 million. The request for Integrated Systems Research included a new program on advanced composite materials and structures. In the Fundamental Aeronautics program, NASA planned to explore options for the future of its rotorcraft research; this planning was to be coordinated with other government agencies and industry partners. The House committee recommended $566.0 million for Aeronautics, while the Senate committee recommended $558.7 million. The final appropriation is $566.0 million.", "For Space Technology, the Administration requested $742.6 million. The FY2013 appropriation (after sequestration) was $614.5 million. The requested increase was to support existing projects that are moving from the planning and design phase to the more expensive tasks of hardware manufacture and demonstration. The request also included funds to accelerate the development of high-power solar electric propulsion technology for future spacecraft. The House and Senate committee recommendations were respectively $576.0 million and $670.1 million. The final appropriation is $576.0 million.", "The Administration's request for Exploration in FY2014 was $3.916 billion. The FY2013 appropriation (after sequestration) was $3.706 billion. This account funds development of the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and the Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lift rocket, mandated by the 2010 authorization act for human exploration beyond Earth orbit. The account also funds development of a commercial crew transportation capability for future U.S. astronaut access to the International Space Station. The request of $821.4 million for commercial crew was more than the FY2013 appropriation, while the request of $2.730 billion for Orion, the SLS, and related ground systems (known collectively as Exploration Systems Development) was less than the FY2013 appropriation. As in previous years, this apparent difference in human spaceflight priorities between Congress and the Administration was controversial. According to NASA, the amounts requested were consistent with the planned schedules for both Orion/SLS and commercial crew. NASA officials stated that the request for commercial crew was necessary to make commercial crew transportation services available in 2017, while the request for Orion and SLS was sufficient for an uncrewed flight of the SLS in 2017 and a crewed flight in 2021. The House committee recommended $3.612 billion, including $500 million for commercial crew and $2.825 billion for Exploration Systems Development. The Senate committee recommended $4.209 billion, including $775 million for commercial crew and $3.118 billion for Exploration Systems Development. The final appropriation is $4.113 billion, including $696 million for commercial crew and $3.115 billion for Exploration Systems Development.", "The FY2014 request for Space Operations was $3.883 billion. The FY2013 appropriation (after sequestration) was $3.725 billion. The Space Operations account funds the International Space Station (ISS) and the Space and Flight Support program. The House committee recommended $3.670 billion, while the Senate committee recommends the requested amount. The final appropriation is $3.778 billion.", "The request for Education was $94.2 million. The FY2013 appropriation (after sequestration) was $116.3 million. The Administration proposed to consolidate NASA education programs as part of a government-wide reorganization of programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Among the programs included in the FY2014 request for the Education account were the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program ($24 million), the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR, $9 million), and the Minority University Research Education Program (MUREP, $30 million). In the past, other NASA accounts also funded some education activities; in most cases, these additional education funds were not included in the FY2014 request for those accounts. The House committee recommended $122.0 million for Education, including the requested amounts for Space Grant, EPSCoR, and MUREP. The House report mandated the internal consolidation of NASA education activities, whereby the Education account would be NASA's \"exclusive source of appropriated funds for education and public outreach activities\"; it stated that this would improve coordination, efficiency, and accountability and reduce fragmentation. The Senate committee recommended $116.6 million for Education, including $40 million for Space Grant, $18 million for EPSCoR, and $30 million for MUREP. The Senate report stated that while the committee encouraged the streamlining and consolidation of education activities within NASA, it did not support the Administration's proposal to terminate certain NASA education activities in order to fund additional STEM education activities at other agencies. The final appropriation for Education is $116.6 million, including the same amounts as the Senate report for Space Grant, EPSCoR, and MUREP. In addition, the explanatory statement maintained funding for education and public outreach within the Science account, \"consistent with longstanding NASA practice.\"", "The Administration has proposed a NASA mission to capture a small asteroid robotically, redirect it into orbit around the Moon, and explore it with astronauts as one of the first destinations for Orion and the SLS. The FY2014 budget request included initial funding for this mission in three different accounts: $20 million in Science for identification and characterization of a suitable asteroid, $45 million in Exploration for mission definition and planning and development of capture mechanisms, and $40 million in Space Technology for development of the solar electric propulsion technology that would be used to redirect the asteroid's orbit. The House report called the proposed asteroid mission \"premature\" and stated that the House committee's recommendation \"does not include any of the requested increases associated with the asteroid retrieval proposal.\" The Senate report was silent about this mission. Noting that the proposed mission was \"still an emerging concept,\" the joint explanatory statement stated that \"NASA has not provided Congress with satisfactory justification materials,\" and additional groundwork \"is needed ... prior to NASA and Congress making a long-term commitment to this mission concept.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Science Foundation (NSF)78", "paragraphs": ["The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in the non-medical sciences and engineering.

", "Since FY2006, overall increases in the NSF budget have been at least partially driven by the so-called \"doubling path policy.\" Under the doubling path policy, Congress and successive Administrations have sought to double funding for the NSF, Department of Energy's Office of Science, and National Institute of Standards and Technology's core laboratory and construction accounts (collectively \"the targeted accounts\"). However, actual funding for the targeted accounts did not typically reach authorized levels during the authorization period, which ended in FY2013. It is unclear if policy makers will seek to continue the doubling path policy in FY2014 or beyond. ", "Congress typically appropriates to NSF at the major account level. NSF's major accounts are Research and Related Activities (R&RA), Education and Human Resources (E&HR), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC), Agency Operations and Awards Management (AOAM), the National Science Board (NSB), and the Office of Inspector General (IG). In some cases, such as the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF), program funding may come from two or more of these accounts.", "R&RA is the largest NSF account and the primary source of research funding at the NSF. The Administration sought $6.212 billion in funding for R&RA in FY2014 noting \"strong support for cross-cutting research priorities such as advanced manufacturing, clean energy and sustainability, break-through materials, robotics, cyberinfrastructure, and cybersecurity.\" NSF consolidated certain R&RA sub-accounts in FY2013, moving from 11 directorates and offices to 8. FY2013 current plan funding for R&RA was $5.544 billion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provides $5.809 billion to R&RA in FY2014.", "The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $5.676 billion for R&RA in FY2014. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $6.018 billion. The House report would have provided $13.9 million for new investments in cognitive science and neuroscience research, offered the requested levels for various (unspecified) R&RA advanced manufacturing proposals, and supported a temporary reduction in Antarctic research funding in order to provide funds for the implementation of certain recommended safety and management changes. The Senate report directed NSF to apply the $194.0 million reduction to R&RA (from the requested level) to the so-called OneNSF initiatives. Among other things, the Senate report also would have provided the full request for SEES ($222.8 million). The Joint Explanatory Statement that accompanied the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014\u2014referred to hereafter as the \"explanatory statement\"\u2014incorporates the Administration's proposed R&RA reductions, provides the requested amount for the International Ocean Discovery Program ($50.0 million) and rejects Senate report limitations on OneNSF initiatives.", "The FY2014 request for R&RA's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program was $163.6 million. FY2013 current plan funding for EPSCoR was $147.8 million. The Senate report would have provided the requested level to EPSCoR in FY2014. The House report was silent on the question. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provides $158.2 million to EPSCoR in FY2014. ", "The Administration sought $880.3 million in funding for E&HR in FY2014. E&HR is the primary source of funding for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at the NSF. FY2013 current plan funding for E&HR was $833.3 million. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $825.0 million for E&HR in FY2014. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $880.3 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provides $846.5 million to E&HR in FY2014.", "For FY2014 the Administration proposed a reorganization and consolidation of many federal STEM education programs. Under the Administration's plan, NSF would have played a leadership role in federal undergraduate and graduate STEM education efforts. (The Department of Education and Smithsonian Institution would focus on K-12 education and informal STEM education, respectively.) The House and Senate reports both rejected the proposed reorganization plan for programs within the purview of the FY2014 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations act. The House report noted that there may be ind ividual instances in which the c ommittee accepts a change. The Senate report deferred action on the reorganization until the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) finalizes STEM education program assessments as required by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ). The explanatory statement rejects the proposed reorganization (unless expressly noted) and directs OSTP to examine\u2014in consultation with federal agencies and major external stakeholders\u2014other possible reorganizations of the federal STEM education effort.", "The foundation's FY2014 budget request for E&HR highlighted several changes associated with the Administration's plan for STEM education: establishment of the Catalyzing Advances in Undergraduate STEM Education (CAUSE) program; expansion of the GRF to serve the whole of the federal enterprise; and creation of the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT), which would have replaced the Integrative Graduate Education Research Traineeship (IGERT). The House report specifically rejected the establishment of the CAUSE program or the change to a federal government-wide GRF program. The Senate report asked NSF to work with OSTP to determine \"how NSF could implement a broader program for graduate and undergraduate programs across the entire Federal Government, and to identify which programs across Government could benefit from such a program.\" ", "The FY2014 NSF request also sought to shift certain programs between E&HR divisions and to merge the Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP) and Computing Education for the 21 st Century (CE21) programs. The merged program would be called, \"Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, including Computing Partnerships (STEM-C Partnerships).\" The FY2014 request for STEM-C was $57.1 million.

Both House and Senate reports would have provided the requested level for ATE. The Senate report would have provided $60.9 million for Noyce and $45.0 million for the SFS program. The Senate report would have provided the FY2012 level for the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program ($61.4 million); however, the explanatory statement reduces this amount to $55.0 million. The House report directed NSF to continue disseminating the findings of a report on best practices in STEM education and to develop methods to track and evaluate the implementation of recommendations from that report.

It also provides the FY2013 current plan funding level for CREST ($23.0 million). Provisions in the explanatory statement direct NSF to comply with both House and Senate report provisions related to (1) the foundation's efforts to meet the needs of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) through existing programs, and (2) to consider establishment of an HSI-specific program similar to other NSF broadening participation programs. ", "The FY2014 request for the MREFC account was $210.1 million. NSF indicated that this amount would provide a final year of funding for the Advanced Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (AdvLIGO) and Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), as well as the first year of funding for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Funding for the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) would continue. The House report would have provided an amount ($182.6 million) that is equal to the funding request for continuing projects, but that would not have covered costs of the first year of construction for the LSST. The Senate report would have provided the requested level and welcomed the start of LSST construction. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provides $200.0 million to MREFC in FY2014.
