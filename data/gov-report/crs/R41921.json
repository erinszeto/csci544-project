", "Given the attention on PTSD, it is worth noting that prevalence estimates from other sources (generally not limited to users of VA health care) vary widely. A 2010 RAND analysis of 29 relevant studies found prevalence estimates for PTSD ranging from around 1% to 60% among OEF/OIF servicemembers; variation was attributed in part to the use of different samples and different methods of identifying PTSD.

Congressional testimony has raised questions about the extent to which these policies are implemented in practice.", "PTSD treatment provided by the VA includes both medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy (a category of talk therapy). Every VA Medical Center has specialists in PTSD treatment. Some facilities offer specialized PTSD treatment programs of varying intensity and duration, including (among others) PTSD day hospitals (four to eight hours per day, several days per week); evaluation and brief treatment PTSD units (14-28 days); specialized inpatient PTSD units (28-90 days); and PTSD residential rehabilitation programs (28-90 days living in a supportive environment while receiving treatment).

Data Limitations", "In order to understand the limitations of the data presented in this report, it is helpful to understand their sources. The VA identifies PTSD and substance use disorders by searching VA administrative data for diagnosis codes associated with specific conditions (e.g., 309.81 for PTSD). These codes are entered into veterans' electronic medical records by clinicians, in the normal course of evaluation and treatment.", "The data provided by the VA should be interpreted in light of at least three limitations, each of which is discussed below.", "First, some conditions may be overstated, because veterans with diagnosis codes for a condition might not have the condition, as a result of provisional diagnoses or noncurrent diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis code may be entered into a veteran's electronic medical record when further evaluation is required to confirm the diagnosis. A diagnosis may be noncurrent when a veteran who had a condition in the past no longer has it. In either case, the code remains in the veteran's electronic medical record. ", "Second, some conditions may be understated, because veterans who have a condition might not be diagnosed (and therefore might not have the diagnosis code in their records), if they choose not to disclose their symptoms. Veterans might not want to disclose information that would lead to a diagnosis of mental illness. Veterans have reported not wanting to disclose trauma for fear that that they will not be believed, that others will think less of them, that they will be institutionalized or stigmatized, or that their careers will be jeopardized, among other reasons. Also, veterans using VA health care services may receive additional services outside the VA, without the knowledge of the department. ", "Third, the numbers provided by the VA should not be extrapolated to all OEF/OIF veterans, or to the broader veteran population, because OEF/OIF veterans using VA health care are not representative of all OEF/OIF veterans or the broader veteran population. Veterans who use VA health care may differ from those who do not, in ways that are not known. Potential differences include (among other characteristics) disability status, employment status, and distance from a VA medical facility. ", "Appendix B.
