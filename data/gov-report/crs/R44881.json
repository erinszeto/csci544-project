In some cases, slight changes in the underlying models or assumptions can lead to large effects on projected deficits, receipts, or expenditures. ", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) computes current-law baseline projections using assumptions set out in budget enforcement legislation. Since Congress and the President have resolved certain questions related to expiring tax policy and have enacted specific policies set to control discretionary spending over the next decade, there are fewer policy uncertainties affecting the baseline levels under current law. On the revenue side of the budget, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ; see additional discussion below) permanently set into law many individual tax rates and tax policy provisions. On the spending side, baseline discretionary spending levels are largely constrained by the caps and automatic spending reductions enacted as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) and further modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA 2013; P.L. 113-67 ) and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015; P.L. 114-74 ). ", "The CBO baseline also incorporates policy provisions in current law that have historically been revised before the subsequent policies actually take effect. Specifically, the CBO baseline assumes that discretionary budget authority from FY2018 through FY2021 will be restricted by the caps as created by the BCA, and that certain expiring tax provisions will not be extended. This leads to baseline projections of lower spending and higher revenue levels relative to what some consider likely based on previous policy actions.", "In addition to these elements of current law, macroeconomic assumptions, including those related to GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates, will also affect the baseline estimates and projections. Minor changes in the economic or technical assumptions that are used to project the baseline also could result in significant changes in future deficit levels.", "CBO's current baseline projections, released in June 2017, show rising budget deficits over the next several years. Such a trend represents a reversal from the significant declines in inflation-adjusted deficits experienced in the past few fiscal years. Those declines were primarily due to continued increases in employment (which increased revenues collected from income and payroll taxes) and reductions in discretionary spending. While the baseline projections include continued declines in discretionary outlays, those reductions are more than offset by increases in mandatory spending, which are largely due to the rising cost of Social Security and Medicare programs.", "Baseline projections also include increases in debt held by the public throughout the 10-year budget window. Debt held by the public finances budget deficits and federal loan activity, and is a function of three things: (1) the size of existing debt, (2) economic growth, and (3) interest rates. Debt held by the public increased in FY2016 for the eighth time in the last nine fiscal years. Debt held by the public was 77.0% of GDP at the end of FY2016, and is projected to be 91.2% of GDP at the end of FY2027.", "CBO also provides projections based on alternative policy assumptions, which illustrate levels of spending and revenue if current policies continue rather than expire as scheduled under current law. If discretionary spending caps established by the BCA are lifted and expiring tax provisions are extended, CBO projects an increase in the budget deficit of more than $1.0 trillion relative to the current-law baseline, exclusive of debt servicing costs, over the FY2018 to FY2027 period.

Between FY2009 and FY2012, spending and revenue deviated significantly from historical averages, primarily as a result of the economic downturn and policies enacted in response to financial turmoil. In FY2016, the U.S. government spent $3.85 trillion and collected $3.27 trillion in revenue.

In the ensuing decades discretionary spending as a share of the economy underwent a gradual decline, and totaled 6.1% of GDP in FY2000. Discretionary spending increased in most years between FY2000 and FY2010, largely as a result of increases in security spending and federal interventions designed to stimulate the economy. Discretionary spending peaked in FY2010 at 9.1% of GDP. Since FY2010, discretionary spending has fallen, due to both the wind down of stimulus programs and the implementation of restrictions established by the BCA.

By FY2021, discretionary spending is projected to fall to 5.9% of GDP, which would be its lowest level ever; discretionary spending is projected to total 5.4% of GDP by FY2027.

Mandatory spending was a much smaller source of outlays than discretionary spending in earlier years, totaling just 4.7% of GDP in FY1962. Over time the share of mandatory spending has consistently grown, initially due to the increase in subscription in large mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare and then due to demographic and economic shifts that further increased the sizes of those programs. Mandatory spending totaled 13.2% of GDP in FY2016, up from 9.4% of GDP in FY2000. Mandatory spending peaked in FY2009 at 14.5% of GDP. Mandatory spending levels during the FY2009-FY2012 period were elevated mainly because of increases in outlays for income security programs as a result of the recession. The continuing economic recovery has resulted in lower mandatory spending on certain programs. However, mandatory spending is projected to continue its upward trend towards the end of the budget window due to growth in certain entitlement programs.

The budget projects that the real economic growth rate (measured as the percentage change in GDP) will rise from 1.6% in FY2016 to 3.0% per year over the FY2021 through FY2027 period. That total is higher than the assumptions included in CBO's June 2017 forecast, which includes real economic growth projections of 1.9% per year from FY2021 through FY2027. Previous iterations of the President's budget have also included differences in economic projections with those produced by CBO, though such differences have typically been smaller than the current projection gap. The United States last experienced real economic growth of greater than 3.0% in FY2005. The increased growth accounts for improved economic outcomes under the President's budget, reducing deficits by $2.06 trillion over the FY2018 to FY2027 window."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deficit Projections in the President's FY2018 Budget", "paragraphs": ["The Trump Administration provided two deficit projections in its FY2018 budget. First, OMB projected a Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA) baseline as required by statute. The BBEDCA baseline, or \"pre-policy\" baseline, assumes that discretionary spending remains constant in real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) terms and revenue and mandatory (or direct) spending continue as under current law. Under this scenario, the FY2018 deficit is projected to total $413 billion, the FY2027 deficit is projected to be $1.34 trillion, and cumulative deficits are projected to be $8.78 trillion over the FY2018-FY2027 period.", "The other deficit projection, the proposed budget, illustrates the impact on the budget outlook if all of the policies proposed in the budget are implemented. In FY2018, the Administration projects that the deficit will reach $440 billion, or 2.2% of GDP. Under the proposed budget, deficits would steadily decrease from FY2019 through FY2026, and produce a budget surplus of $16 billion (0.1% of GDP) in FY2027. The net budget deficit from FY2018-FY2027 totals $3.15 trillion in the proposed budget. ", "The deficits under the proposed baseline in the President's budget incorporate economic effects in a manner that has attracted considerable attention. The President's budget includes a line item for the effects of economic feedback separate from other policies in its list of proposals. However, in the budget publication, it states that, ", "The Administration projects a permanently higher trend growth rate as a result of its productivity-enhancing policies, such as tax reform, infrastructure investments, reductions in regulation, and a greatly improved fiscal outlook.", "Some outside analysts, including former Secretary of the Treasury and National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers, contend that the Administration therefore double-counted the deficit reduction attributable to its economic growth, using it both to make policies such as tax reform deficit neutral and then again as a separate line-item. If economic feedbacks are removed as a separate line item from the President's budget, the proposed budget would project a deficit of $442 billion (2.2% of GDP) in FY2018. Deficits under that scenario would then gradually decline from $550 billion (2.6% of GDP) in FY2019 to $480 billion (1.5% of GDP) in FY2027.", " Figure 5 illustrates how the levels in the President's proposed budget with and without separate economic feedback effects included compare to current law (CBO baseline) and the Administration's pre-policy baseline over the next decade. The proposals in the President's budget are projected to result in deficit reductions of $5.63 trillion over the next decade relative to the pre-policy baseline. If the economic feedback effects assumed to be separate from the policy-specific budget estimates are removed, the proposed budget reduces deficits by $3.56 trillion over the FY2018-FY2027 period relative to the pre-policy baseline.

In August 2011, the BCA placed limits on discretionary budget authority and included provisions for additional spending cuts to be implemented through an automatic process. Since enactment of the BCA, Congress and the President have modified the BCA several times, primarily to allow increases in discretionary spending (for more information, see the section titled \"Recent Budget Policy Legislation and Events\").

In FY2018, the President's budget would increase the cap (or allow for greater spending) on discretionary defense spending by $54 billion and decrease the discretionary nondefense spending cap by the same amount. The increases to the defense spending caps slowly decline in future years, while the decreases to nondefense spending caps increase over that time period. In FY2021, the last year that the caps are scheduled to be effective under current law, the President's budget proposes to increase the defense cap by $52 billion and decrease the nondefense cap by $121 billion.

Congress may also choose to revisit the deficit reduction measures imposed by the BCA, as amended, ahead of FY2018, which include discretionary caps on defense and nondefense budget authority through FY2021 and spending reduction measures on certain mandatory programs through FY2025. Congress elected to lift the discretionary caps (allow for more spending) in each year from FY2013 through FY2017 relative to their values established in the BCA. Each of those modifications increased annual caps on defense and nondefense spending by equal measures, which is sometimes described as the \"parity principle.\" ", "Congress may also choose to modify the statutory debt limit. Treasury is currently implementing extraordinary measures to stay under the debt limit, which was reinstated in March 2017. Extraordinary measures were previously adopted in March 2015. Coupled with short-run budget surpluses in March and April of that year (which result primarily from the receipt of annual income tax returns), those measures were estimated to be exhausted in early November 2015, or shortly after the most recent debt limit suspension. The latest CBO budget forecast projects a larger nominal budget deficit in FY2017 ($559 billion) than the federal deficit in FY2015 ($466 billion).

Occasional budget deficits are not necessarily problematic. Deficit spending can allow governments to smooth outlays and revenues to shield taxpayers and program beneficiaries from abrupt economic shocks in the short term, while also temporarily boosting GDP when the economy is underperforming. Persistent deficits, however, lead to growing levels of federal debt that may lead to higher interest payments and may also have adverse macroeconomic consequences in the long term, including slowing investment and lowering economic growth. Since the debt cannot grow faster than GDP indefinitely, large deficits will eventually need to be reduced through increases in taxes, reductions in spending, or both. ", "Some measures of fiscal solvency in the long term indicate that, under current policy, the United State faces major future imbalance, specifically as it relates to rising retirement and health care costs and the likely impact on government-financed health care spending. Existing deficit reduction policies like the BCA have improved recent and near-term deficits but do not make significant changes to the parts of the budget that are projected to grow the fastest in the long-run. Therefore, many budget analysts believe that additional deficit reduction is required to put the budget on a sustainable path over the long term. CBO's current law baseline projects inflation-adjusted deficits that are greater than the postwar average in each year of their most recent 10-year baseline.", "CBO, GAO, and the Trump Administration agree that the current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable in the long term. The nation's aging population, combined with rising health care costs per beneficiary, may keep federal health costs rising faster than per capita GDP. CBO projected in March 2017 that under current policy, federal spending on health programs (including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and exchange subsidies) would grow from 5.5% of GDP in FY2017 to 8.8% of GDP in FY2047. A 2017 GAO report on fiscal health also cited health spending as a source of concern. Though these forecasts are highly uncertain, it seems probable that spending on these programs will rise as a share of GDP over time.", "In addition, growing debt and rising interest rates are projected to cause interest payments to consume a greater share of future federal spending. CBO projects that under current law, spending to service the federal debt (net interest payments) will grow rapidly, from 1.4% of GDP in FY2017 to 5.2% of GDP in FY2047. GAO's recent long-term fiscal simulations, under an alternative policy scenario, projected that debt held by the public as a share of GDP would exceed the post-World War II historical high in the next 15 to 25 years.", "Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP, or approximately at its historical average, and leaving fiscal policies unchanged, according to CBO projections, would require drastic reductions in all spending other than that for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, or reining in the costs of these programs. Under CBO's extended baseline, maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio at today's level (77%) in FY2047 would require an immediate and permanent cut in non-interest spending, increase in revenues, or some combination of the two in the amount of 1.9% of GDP (or about $380 billion in FY2018 alone) in each year. Maintaining this debt-to-GDP ratio beyond FY2047 would require additional deficit reduction. If policymakers wanted to lower future debt levels relative to today, the annual spending reductions or revenue increases would have to be larger. For example, in order to bring debt as a percentage of GDP in FY2046 down to its historical average over the past 50 years (40% of GDP), spending reductions or revenue increases or some combination of the two would need to generate net savings of roughly 3.1% of GDP (or $620 billion in FY2018 alone) in each year.", "The alternative to decreased spending as a means of deficit reduction is to increase revenues through modifications to the federal tax system. Recently discussed reforms include the \"A Better Way Proposal\" released by House Speaker Paul Ryan in June 2016 and recent tax reform goals published by the Trump Administration. Congressional scorekeepers have not yet evaluated the budgetary effects of those proposals, though in each case the authors have expressed a desire for the reforms to be \"revenue neutral,\" or to keep total revenue projections unchanged over the 10-year budget window. While tax reform proposals may intend to address other policy goals, those that are revenue neutral are therefore unlikely to significantly alter the long-run budgetary outlook.", "In the long-run, increases in federal debt are constrained by the amount of remaining \"fiscal space,\" or the amount of government borrowing that creditors are willing to finance. The amount of fiscal space available depends on both the current size of the debt and how fast it is increasing relative to GDP. The latter depends on the size of deficits, the government's borrowing rate, and how quickly the economy is growing. With continuously increasing debt levels, at some point debt would become so large that investors would no longer be willing to finance deficits and fiscal space would be exhausted. There is great uncertainty about when investors would stop financing federal borrowing. Because interest rates are presently lower than their historical averages, there is little concern that the federal government is in danger of running out of fiscal space in the short run."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
