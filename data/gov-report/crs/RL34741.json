The question of whether to allow oil and gas drilling under the Great Lakes has been contested within states bordering the Great Lakes and in Congress. Some opposed to drilling under the Great Lakes are concerned about the potential environmental, economic, and public health consequences of drilling. They contend that drilling will raise the risks of oil spills, hazardous gas leaks, and pollution that may harm lakeside residents and the Great Lakes ecosystem. Proponents of drilling contend that the risks of oil spills and other accidents are extremely low due to new technologies, that drilling would not be environmentally harmful, and that it would lead to the generation of revenues, additional employment, and expanded domestic energy supplies.", "Obtaining permits for drilling under the Great Lakes has largely been banned by various state and federal laws. A Great Lakes-wide ban may have initially been driven by the signing of a \"statement of principle against oil drilling in the Great Lakes\" by eight Great Lakes governors in 1985. All states viewed this non-binding agreement as prohibiting drilling for natural gas and oil in the lakes and, with the exception of Michigan, as prohibiting directional drilling. Various states have enacted permanent or temporary bans against drilling.", "The federal government became involved in banning drilling in the Great Lakes when the Congress enacted a temporary ban on the federal and state issuance of permits for drilling under the Great Lakes in 2001 ( P.L. 107-66 ; Title V, \u00a7503), extended it in 2003 , and then again through 2007. Some also proposed a permanent ban against drilling in or under the Great Lakes. A permanent ban on issuing federal or state permits for new directional, slant, or offshore drilling in or under the Great Lakes was included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ). Section 386 specifically states that \"no federal or state permit or lease shall be issued for new oil and gas slant, directional, or offshore drilling in or under one or more of the Great Lakes.\"", "The U.S. ban on drilling in the Great Lakes has generated controversy. Some contend that the decision of whether to drill in the Great Lakes should be made by each state bordering the lakes. They view a federal ban on drilling in the Great Lakes as a violation of states' rights and suggest that a federal ban constitutes a \"taking.\" Some proponents of the ban contend that state laws are not uniform in permanently banning drilling in the lakes. Indeed, as described later in this report, some Great Lakes states have enacted permanent bans on providing new oil and gas drilling permits in state waters, other states have no bans, and some are considering permanent bans in pending legislation.", "Some in Congress have expressed concern over Canadian offshore drilling operations in Lake Erie. The impact of a major spill or blowout could be harmful to the ecosystem and difficult to remediate.

Oil development in the mid-1950s was encouraged in the state of Ohio. The Ohio General Assembly provided the policy framework to allow for the extraction of oil and gas from under Lake Erie, and leasing and production procedures were established by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. However, opposition to drilling in Lake Erie began in 1957 because of environmental concerns, and the program was abandoned by 1968. No offshore or onshore wells were drilled in Lake Erie in Ohio state waters afterwards, and several temporary bans were placed on all types of drilling under Lake Erie in Ohio, the latest one in 2003.", "In Pennsylvania, there has been no history of oil or gas production under Lake Erie; two onshore exploratory wells were drilled in 1957 but no commercial deposits were found. In Michigan, since 1979, 13 onshore wells under the Great Lakes have been drilled; six were reported dry, and seven are still in production (one oil well and six natural gas wells). Five producing wells are under Lake Michigan and two wells are under Lake Huron. All producers in Michigan are employing directional drilling technology, which originates on land and drills underneath the lakes. In Michigan, no onshore or offshore drilling can take place under the Great Lakes, except by those who obtained leases and commenced drilling prior to April 5, 2002. Prior to that date, state law authorized removal of oil and gas under the Great Lakes if directional drilling was employed.

Canada began modern commercial production of natural gas in Lake Erie in the 1960s. (See Figure 2 .) This came after decades of exploration activity that began as early as 1913. Offshore gas wells are permitted in the Canadian Great Lakes, but offshore oil wells are prohibited. If a gas well shows evidence of oil, it must be closed and plugged, according to Canadian regulations. Directional oil and gas drilling is allowed under the Canadian Great Lakes, and has been extensively done in Lake Erie. In Lake Erie, annual natural gas extraction rose to 15.2 billion cubic feet (bcf) in 1985 and has since declined to about 10 bcf in 2000.

If deposits are significant, and drilling commences and expands, local and state governments would also benefit from revenues generated from permits, leases, and taxes on the quantity of oil and gas sold. In some Great Lakes states, revenues from oil and gas leases potentially benefit the environment. For example, in Michigan, some revenues from leasing rights to drill under the Great Lakes would go to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources Trust to purchase and protect environmentally sensitive areas. Depending on their scope and number, drilling operations would also generate employment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was a national average of 5.7 jobs generated per $1.0 million of sales by oil and gas producers in 2002.", "Potential economic costs from drilling under the Great Lakes may stem from drilling infrastructure and oil and gas releases. The presence of infrastructure may lower tourism and recreational opportunities, harm the Great Lakes ecosystem, affect scenic vistas, and lower property values.

Some have expressed concern over the long-term effects of buried drilling wastes and injected production water on ecosystems. Drilling wastes are generally buried onshore and in some cases produced water is injected in drill holes for storage. Both substances contain a variety of toxic chemicals that could be hazardous to the ecosystem.", "Although spills are normally associated with acute impacts, some oil spills have also demonstrated chronic exposure and effects. There is increasing evidence that chronic, low-level exposures to oil contaminants can significantly affect the survival and reproductive success of marine birds and mammals. However, because of the complexity of factors, including a longer time period and presence of other pollutants, determining the precise effects on species and ecosystems due to chronic oil exposure in a particular locale is difficult for scientists.

In aquatic habitats, spills or toxic discharges may degrade water quality, lower dissolved oxygen, contaminate sediments, and alter aquatic vegetation. Water flow influences the potential impact of spills. In areas where there is a high flow of water (e.g., rivers), impacts will be less (but potentially more widespread) than in areas where water flow is minimal, such as in wetlands. In low-flow areas, spills can persist longer and damage vegetation and other organisms that use these habitats. In the Great Lakes, water flow is variable and therefore spills can have different impacts. For instance, water that enters Lake Superior takes approximately 182 years to be completely replaced. This could be considered a low-flow area compared to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, which take approximately three and six years, respectively, to replace water.

There is an impermeable geologic barrier between the hydrocarbon deposits and the lake. According to an evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of directional drilling, there is little risk of contaminating the Great Lakes through spills at the reservoir and well.

According to a source cited in the Corps study, there has been one reported oil spill directly attributed to a drilling operation in the Canadian Great Lakes since 1959 and no reported oil releases from subsurface formations into overlying waters. Compared to spill rates from oil extraction and production operations in U.S. waters, the Canadian spill figures are noteworthy. However, as mentioned above, Canada only allows directional drilling, thus making a spill into the Great Lakes more unlikely than offshore well locations.", "Offshore oil exploration and production in the Great Lakes would increase the risk of oil spills in the region. The risk of oil well blowouts is relatively low, although not impossible, as proven by the British Petroleum blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Advances in drilling technology have led to decreases in spills and releases, and lower footprints for drilling rigs, according to some industry advocates. Three-dimensional seismic imaging technology, for example, allows explorers to identify areas where commercial quantities of oil and gas may have accumulated. This technology provides a greater rate of success in finding oil and gas deposits and therefore could reduce the number of exploratory wells used to tap deposits. In some drilling operations, slimhole drilling is employed. Slimhole drilling is defined as drilling the smallest hole size to meet production objectives in the most cost-effective manner. This method decreases waste volumes and takes up as much as 75% less surface area than traditional wells. Other innovations include modular rigs which lower the footprint of drilling, as well as pipeline sensors that monitor for pipeline corrosion or wall defects.", "Regardless of these advancements, offshore drilling would yield some level of risk from an oil well blowout.

Longstanding Supreme Court precedent indicates that individual states hold title to the submerged lands beneath the waters within their boundaries that were navigable at the time the state entered the Union. The determination as to whether a given body constitutes navigable waters is made by application of a test developed under federal law. That test states that waters are navigable when they are \"used, or are susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.\" That the Great Lakes would satisfy this test appears certain. Thus, under the common law approach, states would hold title to some U.S. portions of the Great Lakes.", "This approach is confirmed by the federal Submerged Lands Act (SLA).

Still, the federal government does have certain authorities at its disposal to regulate the use of Great Lakes resources as well, which it has exercised by banning new leases and permits related to Great Lakes oil and gas development. Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to regulate both the navigable waters and oil and gas development. While Congress likely possesses the authority to regulate or ban oil and gas drilling in or under the Great Lakes, such action might also constitute a \"taking\" of private property for which just compensation would be required. The legal analysis a court would likely undertake in determining whether a taking has occurred is described below.", "A preliminary issue is whether the federal ban on oil and gas leasing or permitting would be covered by federal navigational servitude. As stated in the SLA, a state's title to the navigable waters is subject to the navigational servitude, meaning that the property interest held by the state is subject to a dominant federal right to act in the interests of navigation. Thus, under its Commerce Clause authority, when Congress regulates waters for their navigability, a property right is not taken within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, and no compensation is due. The exact limits of the navigational servitude and whether the regulation or banning of drilling in or under the Great Lakes is sufficiently related to navigability are unclear. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that when regulating the navigable waters, the navigational servitude applies despite a regulatory purpose that is unrelated to navigation. Under this broad interpretation, the current ban on oil and gas leasing or permitting in or under the Great Lakes may not constitute a taking. However, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, as well as the Supreme Court, has held that the navigational servitude applies only when the government has \"bona fide navigational grounds ...\" for its regulation. It is arguable that a drilling ban could be based on navigational grounds. For example, the Army Corps of Engineers has claimed that it has regulatory authority over both directional and vertical drilling in the navigable waters under the Rivers and Harbors Act, which authorizes the Corps to permit obstructions to navigability. As the case law varies among the courts that have examined the issue and as it is not immediately clear whether a ban on drilling would fall under the navigational servitude, it is unclear whether this doctrine would prevent a taking from occurring.", "Assuming the navigational servitude would not preclude a Fifth Amendment taking, additional analysis becomes necessary. A taking can occur in a variety of manners and a ban on leasing or permitting, and thus potential drilling, like other forms of government regulation, could arguably constitute a taking. Generally, for a court to find a regulatory taking, the regulation must result in a sufficient impairment of property interests. The extent and nature of regulation necessary to establish a taking under these circumstances is, however, debatable. As stated in the Supreme Court's Penn Central decision, these determinations are generally to be made on a case-by-case basis focused on analysis of several particularly significant factors, namely the nature of the government action, the economic impact of that action, and the \"extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations ....\" In addition, it would appear that, generally, the economic impact and interference with investment-backed expectations must be severe for regulation to constitute a taking.", "Takings analysis in this particular context is complicated by the numerous entities with existing property rights in Great Lakes oil and gas resources: the current leaseholders, who may or may not be presently engaged in drilling; and the states themselves. A person who acquired a lease prior to the enactment of the federal ban has obtained a right, as expressed in the lease, that is considered property for Fifth Amendment purposes. Assuming that the navigational servitude does not preclude a taking, a total ban on drilling , which would effectively render an oil and gas lease valueless, might constitute a taking as, in general, the more narrow the property right held, the easier it is to prove that a taking has occurred.", "However, the federal ban currently in place does not appear to affect leases or permits issued prior to the enactment of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. Thus, leaseholders with permits in place that are now or might soon begin operating would not appear to have been subjected to a taking of any property interest. Still, it is arguable that permit renewal might now be banned by federal law. Further, permits necessary for oil and gas development would likely not be issued to current leaseholders who had not obtained permits prior to the ban. In these situations, the leaseholders may be able to successfully argue that their property interests, as expressed in the lease, have been rendered valueless and thus been subjected to a taking. Whether this is the case, however, would depend on the facts specific to each of the leases.", "Whether the current federal ban on lease or permit issuance constitutes a taking of the state's property right appears more complex. The states are seen to hold title to portions of the Great Lakes, the lakebed, and the minerals underlying the lakebed. It is also arguable that the federal ban on future leasing effectively renders any oil and gas accumulations valueless, unless oil and gas can be extracted by a non-lease arrangement (e.g., contracting). Thus, if a court were to define the relevant property interest for purposes of a takings analysis as the oil and gas estate alone, it might conclude that a taking would occur by virtue of a leasing ban. However, this analysis may be complicated by the application of the whole parcel rule. The whole parcel rule, as explained by the Supreme Court in Penn Central , states that \" taking jurisprudence does not divide a single parcel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether rights in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated.\" Thus, in that case, regulation affecting only a portion of the plaintiff's property, leaving the rest unaffected, did not constitute a taking. It is thus arguable that a 'taking' of the mineral interest does not result in a Fifth Amendment taking because the whole parcel, the totality of a state's rights in the Great Lakes, remains otherwise unaffected. While the whole parcel rule is backed by considerable precedent, courts have been willing to sever certain property interests for takings analysis purposes, and among those interests is the subsurface mineral estate. Most recently, in Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council , the U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that it rejects conceptual severance of property rights, although this case did not address severance of the mineral estate. Thus it remains unclear whether a taking of state property would be found as a result of the current oil and gas leasing ban.", "Finally, there is another possible argument for concluding that any ban on leasing, permitting, or drilling in or under the Great Lakes is not a taking, based on the Supreme Court's holding in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Commission . Under Lucas , a taking does not occur, even if the total value of property is eradicated by government regulation, if the regulation could have been imposed under the background principles of property and nuisance law existing when the property was acquired. It is arguable that drilling in or under the Great Lakes could result in pollution or damage that could be regulated as a nuisance under common law. Several Great Lakes states have addressed the issue, albeit in different contexts from the present scenario, as to whether oil and gas drilling constitutes a nuisance. These cases would seem to indicate that oil and gas drilling is not a nuisance per se, but that the right circumstances could result in a finding that drilling constitutes a nuisance. Thus, it may follow that the ban on leasing or permitting activities could constitute regulation of a nuisance and that no taking has occurred; however, whether a nuisance would exist in this case would appear to depend on the specific issues a drilling ban is intended to address."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Oil and gas drilling under the Great Lakes is opposed by many who contend that the potential environmental risks associated with drilling do not justify the potential economic gain. Proponents of drilling, however, contend that risks associated with drilling are not high due to advances in drilling technology and safety, and that drilling would provide jobs and income for the states where it is done. Congress has weighed in on these issues and enacted a permanent ban on the issuance of new federal or state leases or permits for oil and gas drilling in or under the Great Lakes. This ban would only affect drilling in U.S.-controlled waters of the Great Lakes and would not affect Canadian production."], "subsections": []}]}}
