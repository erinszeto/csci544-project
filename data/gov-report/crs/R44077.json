In the case of a non-TANF family, one of the parents has to request a review within the three-year time frame for a review and modification to occur. If a request for review and modification is made outside the three-year cycle, the requesting party must demonstrate that there was a substantial change in circumstances. Child support modifications must be in accordance with a state's child support guidelines.

Child support arrearages often (1) hinder the noncustodial parent's ability to make regular child support payments in full and on time; (2) become a source of uncollectible debt; (3) cause added friction in the relationship with the child's other parent, which may negatively impact the noncustodial parent-child relationship; and (4) block work opportunities for noncustodial parents because past-due child support obligations are reported to credit reporting agencies, which provide the information, upon request, to employers.", "Although many custodial parents agree to a certain extent that some noncustodial parents are \"dead broke\" rather than \"deadbeats,\" they contend that the states and the federal government need to proceed with caution in lowering child support orders for low-income noncustodial parents.

Child support guidelines are designed to (1) protect the best interests of the children by trying to ensure that the child or children in question continue to benefit from the financial resources of both parents in situations in which the parents go their separate ways and (2) make the calculation of child support fair, objective, consistent, and predictable (which in many instances has the added benefit of reducing conflict and tension between the parents).", "Child support guidelines were created to address three major problems in the issuance of child support orders. First, guidelines were needed to bring uniformity and consistency to the issuance of child support orders, so as to result in greater fairness to families. Second, the predictability resulting from guidelines was intended to promote settlement and reduce conflicts, to the benefit of both the parties and the courts. Third, research at the time (i.e., during the 1980s) showed that orders were too low to reflect the real needs of children.", "Child support guidelines are part of a process that orders a noncustodial parent to pay financial support for the care of his or her children based on the parent's income (and other factors) and that allows the child to share in the increases (or decreases) in the parent's income as if the parent and child lived together. The guidelines also permit the courts to set child support without the necessity of a review of individual costs of care. The amount of child support is based primarily on how much the parent would share with the child if the parent and child lived together. States decide child support amounts based on the noncustodial parent's income or on both parents' income; other factors may include the age of the child, whether a stepparent is in the home, whether the child is disabled, and the number of siblings. Guidelines ensure the adequacy of child support orders by taking into account economic evidence on the cost of raising children, thereby improving children's well-being.", "Guidelines development requires making value judgments and balancing competing interests to allocate limited economic resources between children, parents, other relatives, the state CSE agency, courts, taxpayers, and society at large.", "States currently use one of three basic types of guidelines to determine child support award amounts (i.e., the child support order):", "income shares , which is based on the combined income of both parents (37 states and Guam); percentage of income , in which the number of eligible children is used to determine a percentage of the noncustodial parent's income to be paid in child support (10 states and the District of Columbia); and Melson-Delaware , which provides a minimum self-support reserve for parents before the cost of rearing the children is prorated between the parents to determine the award amount (three states).

What constituted a change in circumstances sufficient to modify the order depended on the state and the court. The person requesting modification was responsible for filing the motion, serving notice, hiring a lawyer, and proving a change in circumstances of sufficient magnitude to satisfy statutory standards.

However, if the noncustodial parent was brought to court, having made no prior attempt to modify the order, the order might be reduced to $100 a month retroactive to 36 months prior to the date of modification. This retroactive modification would reduce the arrearage from $5,400 to $3,600.", "Cases such as this, which had serious impacts on custodial parents and their children, convinced Congress to take action.

Pursuant to the Bradley Amendment, a child support payment becomes a judgment by operation of law when it becomes due and unpaid, and it is entitled to full faith and credit (in the originating state and in any other state) to be enforced as any other judgment of the initiating state.", "The 1986 provision greatly restricted retroactive modification to make it more difficult for courts and CSE agencies to forgive or reduce arrearages.

They also reflected recognition that the traditional burden of proof for changing the amount of the child support order was a barrier to updating. The 1988 law addressed the need for states to at least expand, if not replace, the traditional \"change in circumstances\" test as the legal prerequisite for updating support by making state guidelines the presumptively correct amount of child support to be paid.", "To ensure that the use of the guidelines would result in appropriate child support award amounts, the Family Support Act required states to review their guidelines at least once every four years and have procedures for review and modification of orders, consistent with a plan indicating how and when child support orders are to be reviewed and modified.

Some have argued that this issue should be addressed through legislation, not regulation. However, many policymakers agree that helping low-income noncustodial parents find work often leads to such parents making their child support payments on a more consistent and timely basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Is There Inequitable Treatment Among Various Categories of Nonpaying Noncustodial Parents?", "paragraphs": ["According to one study, states indicate that 30%-40% of their \"hard to collect from\" cases consist of noncustodial parents who have a criminal record. Many incarcerated parents have child support orders that were established before they entered jail or prison but after incarceration no longer have the income to pay child support. The average incarcerated parent with a child support order reportedly has $10,000 in child support arrearages when entering state prison and $20,000 in child support arrearages when leaving prison. In recent years, policymakers have focused on implementing strategies to help incarcerated and formerly incarcerated noncustodial parents modify their child support orders to enable them to pay those orders on a consistent basis.", "Several recommendations of policymakers and observers specifically related to incarcerated parents include (1) enabling courts to consider an individual's obligations to his or her children at the time of sentencing; (2) prohibiting incarceration from being defined as voluntary unemployment (a term used to describe someone who has chosen not to work), thereby allowing a noncustodial parent's child support order to be modified when he or she enters prison; and (3) requiring states to modify (or forgive) automatically child support orders of noncustodial parents who are in prison (during the prison-intake process), only for the length of their prison sentence, unless the custodial parent objects because the inmate has income and/or assets that can be used to pay child support.", "Some observers contend that there has been too much focus on the need to help noncustodial parents who are in prison. They argue that persons who suffer a long-term injury or illness and those who are unemployed or underemployed face the same challenges with regard to no income or lower income as those who are in jail or prison. They argue that child support modification laws should be changed so they are more sensitive to periods during which the noncustodial parent's ability to pay child support decreases, regardless of whether the decline in income is from unemployment, injury or illness, or incarceration. They maintain that states should offer enhanced review and modification assistance to all vulnerable noncustodial parents, not just those who are incarcerated.", "Some observers argue that policymakers, when considering policies related to reducing the child support obligations of prisoners, also must consider equity issues related to the treatment of low-income noncustodial parents who may be unemployed as opposed to being in prison. They assert that it is sending the wrong message to unilaterally lower payments of persons who have broken the law and not make similar allowances for law-abiding citizens who are unemployed."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
