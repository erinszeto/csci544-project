DHS was organized into four major directorates: BTS;Emergency Preparedness and Response; Science and Technology; and Information Analysis andInfrastructure Protection.", "The BTS Directorate, along with the U.S. Coast Guard, is responsible for the first line ofdefense against terrorism and for securing and managing the nation's borders. Included in theseresponsibilities are the inspection, investigative and enforcement operations of the formerImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which had been responsible for managing andcoordinating the entry of people into the United States, and for enforcing immigration laws. DHSborder and transportation security objectives also include fulfilling the newly expandedresponsibilities of the TSA in protecting the nation's transportation systems, initially involving airlinepassengers, baggage, and freight.", "The Customs function, previously the responsibility of the Department of the Treasury's U.S.Customs Service, now also forms part of BTS. The Customs functions administered by DHS, inconjunction with the U.S. Coast Guard, are intended to effectively secure all commercial trafficentering the nation's ports. The Directorate also assumes responsibility for inspecting andmonitoring plants and animals entering the United States to minimize the risk that noxious pests anddiseases will be introduced into the country.", "The activities for which BTS has assumed responsibility are organized into three bureaus: the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP); the Bureau of Immigration and CustomsEnforcement (ICE); and the Transportation Security Agency (TSA). The inspection and borderpatrol functions of the legacy Customs, INS, and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service(APHIS), were merged into CBP. The investigative and interior enforcement functions of the legacyCustoms and INS were merged within ICE. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), the Federal LawEnforcement Training Center (FLETC), and the Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) were alsoincluded under BTS by the Homeland Security Act. Subsequently, the Federal Air Marshals (FAMs)have been transferred from TSA to ICE; the US-VISIT program has been transferred from ICE tobe managed at the BTS directorate level; and ODP has been reconfigured and renamed the Officeof State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (OSLGCP) and is managed at theDHS level. The Coast Guard remains a direct report, or free standing agency, within DHS butoutside the BTS directorate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Secretary Chertoff's Second Stage Review", "paragraphs": ["On July 13, 2005, the Secretary of DHS, Michael Chertoff, announced the results of themonths-long Second Stage Review (2SR) that he undertook upon being confirmed as DHSSecretary.

(4) The Secretary has designed a six-point agenda based upon theresults of the 2SR:", "increase overall preparedness, particularly for catastrophicevents;", "create better transportation security systems to move people and cargo moresecurely and efficiently;", "strengthen border security and interior enforcement and reform immigrationprocesses;", "enhance information sharing with our partners;", "improve DHS financial management, human resources development,procurement and information technology; and", "realign the DHS organization to maximize missionperformance.", "Specific new policy initiatives and proposed actions announced on July 13 by the Secretaryinclude several significant BTS changes, including the proposed elimination of the BTS Directorate. The Secretary announced the creation of a new Directorate of Policy (subject to legislative approval),which would, among other things, assume the policy coordination responsibilities of the BTSDirectorate. The operational agencies that comprise BTS (CBP, ICE, TSA) would report directlyto the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of DHS. Through this reorganization, DHS proposes tostreamline the policy creation process and ensure that the department's policies and regulations areconsistent across the department.", "In terms of immediate policy changes, the Secretary announced that the US-VISIT programwould be moving from the 2-print fingerprinting standard to a 10-print standard. (5) The Federal Air Marshals(FAMs) program will be moved out of ICE and back into TSA, to increase operational coordinationbetween all aviation security entities in the department. Regarding immigration, the Secretary statedthat the DHS would be looking at restructuring the immigration process, adding more personnel andtechnology to assist in gaining control of the border. Specific details on the nature of these changesare not currently available, however. In terms of cargo and supply chain security, the Secretaryannounced a new initiative called \"Secure Freight.\" Though few details are currently available,presumably this initiative builds upon the concepts explored under the Advance Trade Data Initiative(ATDI). Through Secure Freight CBP would seek to obtain additional cargo and supply chain datato supplement the data they currently receive through the submission of advanced electronic cargomanifests. Secretary Chertoff also called for increasing the number of inspections carried out atforeign ports before cargo is loaded on U.S.-bound vessels, increasing the speed of cargo inspections,and for completing the deployment of radiation portal monitors to the nations ports.", "On July 22, 2005, the Administration also submitted a revised budget request for DHS toreflect the organizational and policy changes recommended by the 2SR.

While the transfer of functional lines of authority andthe personnel to carry out those functions was relatively straightforward, problems arose with theinitial attempts to ascertain the exact amount of appropriated funds that were actually transferred tothe new department. Comparisons of responsibilities and analyses of requests for increased budgetauthority proved difficult to develop. This was due to the fact that the functions now performed byDHS were previously performed by predecessor agencies, and that some of these functions often hadnon-homeland security purposes prior to the creation of the department. As a result of this, thefunding lines between FY2003 and FY2004 were not identical to lines of functional responsibilitybefore and after the transfer. This reality, in turn, was exacerbated because the basic documentationof appropriations in the President's FY2004 Budget was prepared after the formation of DHS butbefore final enactment of appropriations for the remainder of FY2003. However, with thecompletion of appropriations for FY2004, a baseline has been established, making futureappropriations decisions more easily compared to the previous year's levels. It is too early to tell,however, what the just announced reorganization of the department will mean for next year'sappropriations cycle.", "The distinction between BTS functions and other functions funded through the same accountlines is somewhat arbitrary. Our analysis in this report attempts to identify a functional classificationfor \"border and transportation security.\" This functional grouping includes the activities of the CoastGuard, a separate agency in DHS which is not part of the Directorate for BTS, but which has anessential role in providing \"border and transportation security\" as those words are commonlyunderstood. Additionally, some functions contained in other accounts within DHS that are relatedto border and transportation security, such as those aspects of the Science and Technology accountwhich are used to improve security, are excluded from this table because that is not the main functionof the account. We also exclude the grant programs available to localities through the Office forDomestic Preparedness and the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparation,despite the fact that some of these grants may be used to secure transportation assets, because thatis not necessarily the primary function of the grant programs and because they are not an operationalcomponent of border and transportation security within DHS.", "The tables presented throughout this report show an approximation of costs for border andtransportation security, based on identifying the accounts for which such security functions are theprimary function involved. They do not necessarily reflect DHS breakdowns as to estimatedamounts specifically associated with the Directorate for BTS, nor the absolute total of the fundsbeing spent directly and indirectly on border and transportation security by the department.

Between Ports of Entry, both the House and Senateadded funding to the President's request to accommodate the hiring, training, and deployment of1,000 additional Border Patrol Agents.

CBP is proposingto add 210 agents to the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) workforce in FY2006 to backfill positionsvacated along the Southwest border. These vacancies were the result of agents being transferred outfrom the Southwest border in order to fulfill the requirement enacted in the USA PATRIOT Act( P.L. 107-56 , \u00c2\u00a7402) to triple the number of agents assigned to the Northern border. This increaseis well below the 2,000 additional agents authorized by the Intelligence Reform and TerrorismPrevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 , \u00c2\u00a75202). Given the disparity between the authorization andthe President's request, a possible issue for Congress may be what the appropriate level of staffingfor the Border Patrol is in order to achieve its mission of detecting and interdicting the entry ofterrorists, WMD, and unauthorized aliens between ports of entry. House appropriators haveaddressed this issue by adding $150 million to the President's request, which, combined with the$124 million available in the FY2005 supplemental appropriation ( P.L. 109-13 ), will allow theBorder Patrol to hire, train and deploy 1,500 agents to its workforce by the end of FY2006. (15) The Senate AppropriationsCommittee concurs with the House in adding 1,500 agents to the USBP in FY2006 and increasesthe President's request by $241 million. However, the Senate also included funding for 220 missionsupport positions, relocation costs, and information technology costs in its appropriation, resultingin a $136 million increase over the appropriation proposed by the House. Additionally, the Senateincluded $20 million for upgrading and modernizing the Border Patrol's fleet of aircraft, includingthe purchase of 12 single engine helicopters. (16) ", "IDENT/IAFIS. According to CBP, the integration ofthe Border Patrol's Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) and the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation's Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) is progressing andinteroperable IDENT/IAFIS workstations have been deployed to all USBP stations. This wouldseem to address some of the concerns about the slow pace of the integration project raised by Houseappropriators in FY2005. (17) The president's request includes an increase of $3 million for thesystem and notes that BTS has assumed ownership for the integration project. While the integrationof the two biometric databases has given USBP agents access to the FBI's criminal records, leadingto an 8.5% increase in the identification of criminal aliens, a possible issue for Congress may be theUSBP's apparent lack of access to the name-based Terrorist Watchlist at their stations. This may beof concern due to recent Congressional testimony by DHS then acting Secretary Admiral James Loythat Al-Qaeda is considering infiltrating the Southwest border due to a belief that \"illegal entry ismore advantageous than legal entry for operational security reasons.\" (18) House appropriatorsexpressed frustration with CBP that the report they requested in the FY2005 appropriation bill onthe IDENT/IAFIS integration project has not been delivered yet. They directed DHS to submit thereport by July 1, 2005. The Senate Appropriations Committee funds the President's request anddirects DHS to submit the report on the project that was requested in FY2005 which continues tobe outstanding. The Senate also included $3 million in its amount to allow CBP to reimburse theUS-VISIT program for its use of the IDENT/IAFIS system. (19) ", "Arizona Border Control Initiative (ABCI). Inresponse to a continuing high level of apprehensions in the Tucson sector, the ABCI was launchedon March 16, 2004. ABCI is a multi-disciplinary initiative that seeks to coordinate federal, state,and local authorities to control the Arizona border. ABCI is specifically aimed at stoppingcross-border smuggling operations by detecting, arresting, and deterring all groups seeking to bringpeople, drugs, weapons, and other merchandise into the country illegally. Two hundred additionalpermanent border patrol agents and 60 special operations agents trained for search and rescueoperations were assigned to the Tucson sector over the summer of 2004, bringing the total numberof agents there to approximately 2,000. According to DHS, in the first six months of the ABCI,apprehension of unauthorized aliens increased 56% from apprehensions during the same period ofthe previous year. From March 16, 2004 to September 7, 2004, 351,700 unauthorized aliens wereapprehended compared to 225,108 unauthorized aliens during the same period in 2003. CBPproposes an increase of $1 million to continue this multi-disciplinary program in FY2006, thoughmost funding for the program will come from ICE. House appropriators support this multi-agencyapproach to protecting the border and fund the President's request and direct CBP to work closelywith the Tohono O'odham Nation along the Arizona border to ensure that the Nation is fully awareof CBP's actions on their territory.

House appropriators fully fund the President's request. However, the Housecites its concern with the contracting problems identified in the ISIS program by the GeneralServices Administration Inspector General and requests a report by January 16, 2006 on theseproblems and the specific measures taken by CBP to address them. Additionally, the House expectsDHS to consult with the Appropriations Committee as it searches for a contractor to oversee theintegration of new technologies into the existing ASI system. The House also notes that it expectsthe ASI will permit the Border Patrol to gather, analyze, and share information regarding thenumbers and types of intrusions by creating a database. To this end, the House requests a report onthe specific performance metrics used by the ASI program by January 16, 2006.

The following sections outline the main issues identified within the President'srequest and the House and Senate Appropriations Committee Reports.", "Financial Management at ICE. ICE inherited itsfinancial organization and systems from the former INS. An independent audit of ICE's financialstatements concluded that the agency's accounting records were inadequately maintained duringFY2004. The situation was characterized as especially grave regarding intra-departmental andintra-governmental agreements and transactions, costs, and budgetary transactions. This requiredextensive reconciliation and adjustment at the end of the fiscal year, which ICE was unable tocomplete. The report noted that ICE had served as the accounting services provider for several otherDHS agencies (26) whilesimultaneously experiencing significant turnover among its financial management staff. This ledthe agency to fall \"seriously behind in basic accounting functions, such as account reconciliations,analysis of material abnormal balances, and proper budgetary accounting.\" Additionally, serving asthe accounting provider for other agencies led ICE to experience budget shortfalls due to tardyreimbursements for expenses it provided to cover other agencies' costs. This budget shortfall forcedthe agency into a freeze on hiring and non-mission critical expenditures, including training. Theauditors concluded that DHS should immediately address the \"void in ICE's financial managementinfrastructure\" in order to fix the lack of oversight and controls that led ICE to become anti-deficientor that prevented DHS management from knowing whether ICE was anti-deficient. (27) ICE recently requesteda $500 million reprogramming for FY2005 to cover funding shortfalls within the agency. (28) House appropriatorsexpressed concern and disappointment over the continuing financial troubles at ICE. The committeenotes that the agency has been forced to employ drastic cost-cutting measures that the committeebelieves adversely limited ICE's operations. The committee directs DHS to provide monthly reportson ICE's financial condition. (29) ", "Office of Investigations/Immigration Functions. TheOffice of Investigations (OI) in ICE focuses on a broad array of criminal and civil violationsaffecting national security such as illegal arms exports, financial crimes, commercial fraud, humantrafficking, narcotics smuggling, child pornography/exploitation, worksite enforcement, andimmigration fraud. ICE special agents also conduct investigations aimed at protecting criticalinfrastructure industries that are vulnerable to sabotage, attack or exploitation. (30) The Homeland SecurityAct of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ) abolished the INS and the U.S. Customs Service, and transferred mostof their investigative functions to ICE effective March 1, 2003. There are investigative advantagesto combining the INS and Customs Services as those who violate immigration laws often areengaged in other criminal enterprises (e.g., alien smuggling rings often launder money). Nonetheless, concerns have been raised that not enough resources have been focused oninvestigating civil violations of immigration law, and that ICE resources have beendisproportionately focused on terrorism and the types of investigations performed by the formerCustoms Service. (31) ", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 , \u00c2\u00a75203)authorized for FY2006, subject to appropriations, the addition of at least 800 new investigators toinvestigate violations of immigration law. The $1,496 million requested in the President's budgetfor the OI (32) includesincreases in the base funding for two groups responsible for immigration enforcement, the VisaSecurity Unit (VSU) (33) and Temporary Worker Worksite Enforcement, and includes a total of 148 new positions for theseunits. The President's budget requests an additional $18 million for temporary worker worksiteenforcement to add 143 positions responsible for investigating and prosecuting violations underexisting immigration law for hiring unauthorized aliens, and supporting and implementing theprovisions of possible temporary worker legislation. The President's request also includes anincrease of $5 million to add five new officers to the VSU, open a new overseas location, and expandtraining programs. H.Rept. 109-79 recommends $19 million to expand the Visa Security Program,and S.Rept. 109-83 recommends an additional $4.8 million for nine positions for an additional VSU. Furthermore, H.Rept. 109-79 recommends an additional $18 million over the President's request for200 new Immigration Enforcement Agents (IEAs). (34) H.Rept. 109-79 also recommends $19 million for an additional150 criminal investigators. (35) S.Rept. 109-83 recommends an additional $37 million for 300new immigration investigations positions, and $18 million for 200 IEAs, but does not provide afunding increase for temporary workers worksite enforcement.", "Detention and Removal Operations. Detention andRemoval Operations (DRO) in ICE provides custody management of aliens who are in removalproceedings or who have been ordered removed from the United States. (36) DRO is also responsiblefor ensuring that aliens ordered removed actually depart from the United States. Many contend thatDRO does not have enough detention space to house all those who should be detained. A study doneby DOJ's Inspector General found that almost 94% of those detained with final orders of removalwere deported while only 11% of those not detained who were issued final orders of removal left thecountry. (37) Concernshave been raised that decisions on which aliens to release and when to release them may be basedon the amount of detention space, not on the merits of individual cases, and that the amount of spacemay vary by area of the country leading to inequities and disparate policies in different geographicareas. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 , \u00c2\u00a75204)authorized, subject to appropriations, an increase in DRO bed space of 8,000 beds for each year,FY2006-FY2010. The President's budget requests an increase for FY2006 of $90 million for 1,920new beds. H.Rept. 109-79 recommends $90 million for 1,920 new beds, (38) and House-passed H.R.2360 would withhold $50 million of the appropriated funds for ICE salaries and expenses until theAssistant Secretary of ICE submits to the Appropriations Committee a national detentionmanagement plan. S.Rept. 109-83 recommends $77.4 million for 32 positions for CustodyManagement, and 2,240 new beds.", "Alternatives to Detention. Due to the cost of detainingaliens, and the fact that many non-detained aliens with final orders of removal do not leave thecountry, there has been interest in developing alternatives to detention for certain types of aliens whodo not require a secure detention setting. In 2004, ICE began a pilot program, the IntensiveSupervision Appearance Program (ISAP), for low-risk, non-violent offenders. (39) The program, providesless restrictive alternatives to detention, using such tools as electronic monitoring devices (e.g., anklebracelets), home visits, work visits, and reporting by telephone, to monitor aliens who are out onbond while awaiting hearings during removal proceedings or the appeals process. (40) H.Rept. 109-79 recommends $10 million and 49 new positions for this program, and S.Rept. 109-83 recommends$15.4 million and 32 new positions.", "Interior Repatriation. ICE proposes a $25 millionincrease for the Interior Repatriation program. On June 9, 2004 the White House announced it hadreached agreement with the Mexican government to begin piloting the Interior Repatriation Program,which aims to reduce the number of aliens who immediately try to cross back into the United Statesby flying them into the interior of Mexico. Due to constitutional constraints in Mexico, theapprehended aliens' return to the interior must be strictly voluntary and the willingness of theirparticipation must be certified by Mexican consular officers. (41) In order to continue theprogram in FY2006, the Administration is requesting $39.3 million; $25 million for CustodyManagement and $14.3 for Transportation and Removal. This represents a $25 million increasefrom the $14 million spent on the pilot program in FY2005. H.Rept. 109-79 directs theCommissioner of CBP to report no later than January 16, 2006 on the performance of the InteriorRepatriation Program, including its cost, the number of agents required for its functioning, and therelevant statistics related to the number of aliens repatriated and any data on their recidivism. ", "State and Local Law Enforcement. (42) Currently the INAprovides limited avenues for state enforcement of both its civil and criminal provisions. One of thebroadest grants of authority for state and local immigration enforcement activity stems from INA\u00c2\u00a7287(g), which authorizes the Attorney General to enter into a written agreement with a state, or anypolitical subdivision to allow an officer or employee of the state or subdivision, to perform a functionof an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in theUnited States. The enforcement of immigration by state and local officials has sparked debateamong many who question what the proper role of state and local law enforcement officials shouldbe in enforcing federal immigration laws. Many have expressed concern over proper training, finiteresources at the local level, possible civil rights violations, and the overall impact on communities. Some localities, for example, even provide \"sanctuary\" for illegal aliens and will generally promotepolicies that ensure such aliens will not be turned over to federal authorities.
