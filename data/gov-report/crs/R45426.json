Specifically, the program serves expectant and parenting teens, women, fathers, and their families. This includes women of any age who are survivors of domestic violence, sexual violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The PAF program focuses on meeting the educational, social service, and health needs of eligible individuals and their children during pregnancy and the postnatal period.", "The research literature indicates that pregnancy has high costs for individuals eligible for the PAF program. Teenage mothers and fathers tend to have less education and are more likely to live in poverty than their peers who are not parenting. Nearly one-third of adolescent females who have dropped out of high school cite pregnancy or parenthood as a reason. Parenthood can also influence whether students pursue postsecondary education. One analysis found that single young women who had children after enrolling in community college were 65% more likely to drop out than their same-age peers who did not have children after enrolling. The research literature further indicates that approximately 3% to 9% of women experience domestic violence during pregnancy. Some studies indicate that this risk is greater among low-income women.", "The PAF program is administered by the Office of Adolescent Health (OAH) in the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS') Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH).

Through FY2018, HHS has awarded PAF funding to 30 states, the District of Columbia, and 5 tribal entities (\"grantees\"). These grantees can decide how to use funding under four purpose areas. Three of the purpose areas focus on providing services to the eligible expectant and parenting population through subgrants and partnerships. The fourth category focuses on public awareness about such services; however, HHS advises that grantees may not use funding solely for public awareness activities. In general, grantees have provided subgrants to school districts, community service organizations, and institutions of higher education (IHE) that directly serve the expectant and parenting population. Subgrantees have most frequently provided case management, referral services for other supports, group workshops on specific topics (e.g., pregnancy prevention), and home visiting services.", "The PAF statute and the program grant announcements include requirements for state grantees and subgrantees in carrying out activities under the program. The authorizing law requires each subgrantee to provide an annual report to the grantee about expenditures, fulfilling program requirements, and how it meets the needs of participants. Grantees must prepare an annual report to HHS on information provided by subgrantees, including participant data. In FY2016, grantees (17 states and 3 tribal entities) reported serving 16,053 individuals. Of these participants, 55% were expectant or parenting mothers, 37% were children, and 8% were expectant or parenting fathers. Most expectant or parenting participants were ages 16 through 19, and nearly half of all participants were white, about one-third were black, and the remaining share were another race or multiracial. About half of all participants were Hispanic.", "The ACA provides mandatory PAF funding of $25 million annually from FY2010 through FY2019.

", "About 194,400 births in the United States in 2017 (5.0%) were to teenagers aged 15 to 19. The research literature indicates that teen pregnancy has high costs for the families of teen parents and society more generally. Teenage mothers and fathers tend to have less education and are more likely to live in poverty than their peers who are not parents. Nearly one-third of teen girls who have dropped out of high school cite pregnancy or parenthood as a reason. Children of teenage mothers are more likely to have poorer education, health, and social outcomes than children of mothers who delay childbearing. In addition, teen births lead to larger societal impacts, such as costs related to public sector health care and lost tax revenue. Parenthood can also influence whether students pursue postsecondary education. For example, one analysis found that single young women who had children after enrolling in community college were 65% more likely to drop out than their same-age peers who did not have children after enrolling. ", "PAF also provides supports for teens and women who are victims of domestic violence or sexual violence while they are pregnant or parenting an infant. The research literature indicates that approximately 3% to 9% of women experience domestic violence during pregnancy. Some studies indicate that this risk is greater among low-income women. Domestic violence is associated with heightened sexual risk-taking by the woman or her partner, such as inconsistent condom use and greater risk of having an unplanned pregnancy or induced abortion. Women victimized during pregnancy have poorer maternal health outcomes than women who are not abused, and their babies face health challenges. These women are 2 1/2 times more likely to report depressive symptoms than pregnant women who are not abused.

In addition, some grantees reported in the process evaluation that they leveraged other public and private supports to bolster their PAF programming. Examples include funding from a governor's infant mortality budget, state general funds, and training and technical assistance provided through other federal programs, such as the MIECHV program. Given the similarities with other federal programs, Congress might consider whether the PAF law should require or encourage more formal linkages with such programs (e.g., through referrals to these programs, or needs assessments that are coordinated across programs) and whether the program should include directives about coordinating and reporting on funds from other federal programs. ", "Finally, Congress may be interested to learn more about whether PAF has assisted grantees in expanding and sustaining support for participants, or whether services were discontinued after the PAF funding period ended. This might be especially relevant for cohort 3 grantees, whose funding period was shortened from five to three years. HHS' research on a sample of former PAF grantees found that they have generally been able to continue services even after PAF funding ended. These grantees reported that they diversified their federal and other funding sources and created strong partnerships with other key stakeholders in their communities.
