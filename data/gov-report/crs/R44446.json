One of the Hobbs Act cases before the Court (Taylor v. United States) involves the robbery of suspected drug dealers. The second (Ocasio v. United States) consists of a kickback conspiracy between traffic cops and body shop owners. The third (McDonnell v. United States) involves a local drug manufacturer who showered a state governor and his wife with gifts in an apparent attempt to use the governor's office as a bully pulpit for one of his products.", "The sex offense entries involve the sex offender registration obligations of an overseas resident (Nichols v. United States) and construction of the recidivist mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of federal law (Lockhart v. United States).", "Perhaps spurred on by the result below, the Supreme Court held that stun guns used for self-defense are not necessarily beyond the guarantees of the Second Amendment right to bear arms (Caetano v. Massachusetts). The other firearms cases on the Court's docket raise interpretative issues under the Armed Career Criminal Act (Welch v. United States and Mathis v. United States) and the firearm possession disqualification triggered by a domestic violence misdemeanor (Voisine v.

North Dakota), and qualified official immunity in the face of use of excessive force allegations (Mullenix v. Luna).", "The Court's Sixth Amendment cases this term offer a variety of issues ranging from ineffective assistance of counsel (Maryland v. Kulbicki), to speedy trial (Betterman v. Montana), to forfeiture and the right to counsel of choice (Luis v. United States), to the use of uncounseled convictions as predicate offenses (United States v. Bryant).", "Capital punishment cases represent the lion's share of the Court's sentencing cases this term. However, the class also includes the matter of the retroactive application of the Miller v. Alabama prohibition on a life without parole sentence for murder by a juvenile (Montgomery v. Louisiana) and the harmless error standard in sentencing cases (United States v. Molina-Martinez).", "The menu of the Court's capital punishment cases offers cases concerning jury instructions (Carr v. Kansas); jury selection (Foster v.

Arizona); appellate court judge recusals (Williams v. Pennsylvania); and the application of habeas corpus standards (White v. Wheeler).", "The Prisoner Reform Litigation Act, designed to curb frivolous inmate suits, generated two of the cases on the Court's 2015 docket\u2014one on the act's installment payment feature (Bruce v.

Rather, to satisfy the Act's commerce element, it is enough that a defendant knowingly stole or attempted to steal drugs or drug proceeds, for, as a matter of law, the market for illegal drugs is commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. And it makes no difference ... that any actual or threatened effect on commerce in a particular case is minimal . \" ", "The Court, in a 7-1 decision written by Justice Alito, made it clear that Taylor was more about drugs than about the Hobbs Act: \"Our holding today is limited to cases in which the defendant targets drug dealers for the purpose of stealing drugs or drug proceeds. We do not resolve what the government must prove to establish Hobbs Act robbery where some other type of business or victim is targeted.\"", "Taylor, the petitioner in the case, was a member of a gang of inept home invaders who sought to rob drug dealers of their cash and drugs. The two robberies for which he was convicted netted the group a total of $40 in cash, three cell phones, a marijuana cigarette, and some jewelry. Federal prosecutors charged Taylor under the Hobbs Act, which condemns anyone who \"in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion.\" Taylor sought to introduce evidence at his trial that the victim of the robbery dealt only in marijuana grown in-state, but the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia barred admission, holding that drug dealing affects interstate commerce as a matter of law. Taylor was convicted and appealed. ", "On appeal, he questioned whether the government had satisfied the Hobbs Act's commerce element, but he faced two obstacles. Lower federal appellate courts had generally construed the \"in any way or degree\" language to mean that Congress intended to exercise the full extent of its Commerce Clause powers and that the prosecution need establish no more than a de minimis impact on interstate commerce. Second, the Supreme Court's Raich decision seemed to reenforce the government's position. The Raich opinion declared that \"Congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself commercial ..., if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.\" ", "The Fourth Circuit affirmed Taylor's conviction. It concluded that \"it was entirely reasonable for the jury to conclude that the robberies would have the effect of depleting the assets of an entity engaged in interstate commerce.... Because drug dealing in the aggregate necessarily affects interstate commerce, the government was simply required to prove that Taylor depleted or attempted to deplete the assets of such an operation.\"", "The Second and Seventh Circuits had expressed a somewhat different understanding. The Second Circuit had declared that \"[p]roof of drug trafficking is no longer regarded as automatically affecting interstate commerce; instead, even in drug cases, the jury must find such an effect as part of its verdict.\" The Seventh Circuit indicated that proof of an individualized impact is not necessary for prosecution under the federal drug law, but is required for Hobbs Act prosecutions. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected the arguments of the two circuits.", "The resolution of the Taylor case, the Court said, \"require[d] no more than ... [to] graft [its] holding in Raich onto the commerce element of the Hobbs Act.\" In Raich , the Court had recognized \"Congress' power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic class of activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\" It also had acknowledged there that \"[t]he production, possession, and distribution of controlled substances constitute a class of activities that in the aggregate substantially affect interstate commerce.\" In the eyes of the Court in Taylor , \"the market for marijuana, including its intrastate aspects, is 'commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.' It therefore follows as a simple matter of logic that a robber[, like Taylor,] who affects or attempts to affect even the intrastate sale of marijuana grown within the State affects or attempts to affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\"", "Justice Thomas dissented. He felt that the limits of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause required a holding that the Hobbs \"Act punishes a robbery only when the Government proves that the robbery itself affected interstate commerce.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ocasio v. United States", "paragraphs": ["H olding : \"A defendant may be convicted of conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act based on proof that he reached an agreement with the owner of the property in ques t ion to obtain that property u n der color of officia l right .\"", "Ocasio was a Baltimore police officer, who with several other officers received kickbacks for referring accident victims to a particular auto body shop. For his efforts, Ocasio was convicted of extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion under the Hobbs Act. The Hobbs Act punishes anyone who \"in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by ... extortion or attempts or conspires so to do.\" It defines extortion to include \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent ... under color of official right.\" ", "Ocasio argued at trial and on appeal that the Hobbs Act does not outlaw obtaining property from a co-conspirator. His argument proceeded under alternative theories. First, he contended that a statute which punishes conspirators for obtaining the property \"of another\" under color of law is limited to victims who are \"other\" than conspirators. Second, he asserted that otherwise every victim would be liable as a conspirator: \"The law must require that a victim under the Hobbs Act be a person outside the conspiracy because otherwise every victim's 'consent' could be considered an agreement to enter into a conspiracy with its victimizer, thereby creating a separately punishable conspiracy in every \u00a71951(a) case.\" ", "Ocasio claimed persuasive support from a Sixth Circuit case, U.S. v. Brock , which seemed to endorse his alternative theories. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, however, was not convinced. It responded that Ocasio's \"property of another\" argument was undermined by the fact that the term \"property of another\" might easily mean the property of anyone other than one acting \"under color of law.\" As for his \"consent\" argument, it was foreclosed by an earlier Fourth Circuit case \"which underscored the proposition that mere acquiescence in an extortion scheme is not conspiratorial conduct. Rather, conduct more active than mere acquiescence is necessary before a person may depart the realm of a victim and may unquestionably be subject to conviction for aiding and abetting and conspiracy.\" Therefore it is \"wrong to suggest that every extortion scheme will necessarily involve a conspiracy to commit extortion.\"", "The Supreme Court affirmed the Fourth Circuit's decision. The Court's conspiracy case law provided his undoing. Justice Alito wrote the opinion for the Court joined by four of his colleagues. He pointed to earlier Court decisions which held \"that a person may be convicted of conspiring to commit a substantive offense that he or she cannot personally commit.\" They confirmed that \"[i]t is sufficient to prove that the conspirators agreed that the underlying crime be committed by a member of the conspiracy who was capable of committing it.\" In Ocasio's case, the body shop owners could not commit extortion because they could not act \"under color of official right.\" Nevertheless, \"they could ... conspire to commit Hobbs Act extortion by agreeing to help [Ocasio] and the other officers commit the substantive offense.\" And as a consequence, Ocasio could be convicted of conspiring with them. ", "Justice Alito also responded with precedent to Ocasio's argument that the Court's conspiracy theory would eliminate the distinction between extortion (coercive corruption) and bribery (consensual corruption). Justice Alito explained that the Court had already declared in Evans that Hobbs Act \"color of law\" extortion is the \"rough equivalent of bribery.\"", "Justice Thomas dissented, as he had in Evans , because that case \"erred in equating common-law extortion with taking a bribe.\" Justice Breyer joined in the majority opinion, but offered a concurrence acknowledging that he finds troubling, but binding, the Evans \"extortion is the rough equivalent of bribery\" precedent. Justice Sotomayor and Chief Justice Roberts dissented because they did not believe that \"a group of conspirators can agree to obtain property 'from another' in violation of the Act even if they agree only to transfer property among themselves.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "McDonnell v. United States", "paragraphs": ["Holding : Arranging a meeting or hosting an event does not qualify as an \"official act\" for purposes of the federal bribery statute unless it involves \"the formal exercise of governmental power\" with respect to some pending or anticipated \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\"", "On September 4, 2014, a jury convicted former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife on corruption charges based on his activities as governor. The convictions covered wire fraud, conspiracy, and Hobbs Act offenses. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. On January 15, 2016, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the lower court's definition of the term official act \u2014a necessary element of the mail fraud conviction and by implication of the Hobbs Act convictions.", "The governor, and his wife, had been showered with gifts during the governor's term in office. Their benefactor, a constituent, was a drug manufacturer who hoped to have one of his products, an antismoking substance, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which would require studies of the products. To that end, he sought to have state university medical research and facilities test and report favorably on the products' efficacy. ", "For his part, the governor forwarded promotional material and the company's suggested research protocol to the state official with authority to approve the study. The governor's name was used on invitations, and he attended a promotional luncheon at the Governor's Mansion on behalf of the company. The governor also pitched the company's product to the official responsible for determining the products covered by the state's employee health plans.", "The wire fraud statute under which the governor was convicted outlaws the use of wire communications as part of a scheme to defraud another of his property. A second statute defines the scheme to defraud element to include any scheme to defraud another of \"honest services\" to which he is entitled. The Supreme Court, however, has construed this honest services definition to encompass no more than bribery or kickbacks. The Court understands honest services bribery to correspond to the misconduct described in the general federal bribery statute. There, bribery is a corrupt quid pro quo\u2014the exchange of something of value for a public official's commission or omission of an official act.", "The same kind of official act will upon occasion be an element of the extortion prong of a Hobbs Act violation. Among other things the Hobbs Act outlaws obstructing interstate commerce in any manner by extortion under color of law. The Supreme Court views this Hobbs Act extortion offense as the rough equivalent of bribery\u2014accepting something of value for the commission or omission of an official act.", "An official act for bribery purposes is defined as \"any decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official's official capacity, or in such official's place of trust or profit.\"", "The prosecution argued that the governor had committ ed at least five qualifying official acts: ", "\"(1) arranging meetings for [Williams] with Virginia government officials, who were subordinates of the Governor, to discuss and promote Anatabloc; ", "\"(2) hosting, and ... attending, events at the Governor's Mansion designed to encourage Virginia university researchers to initiate studies of anatabine and to promote Star Scientific's products to doctors for referral to their patients; ", "\"(3) contacting other government officials in the [Governor's Office] as part of an effort to encourage Virginia state research universities to initiate studies of anatabine; ", "\"(4) promoting Star Scientific's products and facilitating its relationships with Virginia government officials by allowing [Williams] to invite individuals important to Star Scientific's business to exclusive events at the Governor's Mansion; and ", "\"(5) recommending that senior government officials in the [Governor's Office] meet with Star Scientific executives to discuss ways that the company's products could lower healthcare costs.\"", "The governor argued that the instructions to the jury permit it to convict him without finding that he had exercised or endeavored to influence the formal exercise of governmental power necessary to constitute an official act. The Supreme Court unanimously agreed. It found the instructions deficient on three grounds. First, the jury was not instructed that it must find \"a 'question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy' involving the formal exercise of governmental power .\" Without such guidance, the jury may have \"thought that a typical meeting, call, or event was itself a 'question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy'\" and was enough without more to constitute an official act.", "Second, the jury was not instructed that \"the 'question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy' must be more specific and focused than a broad policy objective.\" And so, the jury may have erroneously concluded, as the prosecution argued in closing, that \"[w]hatever it was Governor McDonnell had done, it's all official action.\" ", "Finally, \"the jury was not told that merely arranging a meeting or hosting an event to discuss a matter does not count as a decision or action on that matter.\" And so, the jury may have thought arranging a meeting or hosting an event did constitute an \"official act,\" without making the additional finding that the governor agreed to take or exert pressure on other officials to take an official action.", "The Court's decision seems in line with its historic reluctance to endorse federal authorities' policing of state and local political affairs in the absence of clear congressional directive. The decision, however, makes no such statement. Nor does it refer to the cases that evidence that reluctance. Instead, it builds upon its \"official act\" precedents: ", "The question remains whether\u2014as the Government argues\u2014merely setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or calling another official qualifies as a decision or action, [as an official act]\u2026. Although the word \"decision,\" and especially the word \"action\" could be read expansively to support the Government's view, our opinion in United States v.

We conclude that it may not be.\"", "The U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld a computer fraud conviction over objections that the prosecution was not timely and the jury's instructions were in error in Musacchio v. United States . The case presented two questions. First, may a defendant present a statute of limitation challenge for the first time on appeal? Second, may a conviction be undone by a sufficiency-of-the-evidence attack on an extraneous element? The Court answered no to both questions.", "Musacchio hacked into the computer network of his former employer. The portion of the Computer Fraud and Abuse statute under which he was indicted outlaws accessing a computer system without authorization or in excess of authorization. The indictment charged him with access without authorization. The judge's instructions to the jury, however, suggested that Musacchio could be convicted only if the government proved access both without authorization and in excess of authorization. Musacchio was convicted nonetheless. ", "On appeal, he conceded that there was sufficient evidence at trial to convict for access without authority, but argued without success that there was insufficient evidence to prove access in excess of authorization. He also argued to no avail that the five-year statute of limitations should have barred his prosecution, because his indictment had been filed seven years after the commission of the offense.", "The two questions had divided the lower federal appellate courts. The Supreme Court took the opportunity to answer them in a single case. First, a statute of limitations bar is ordinarily a defense that must be claimed. If a defendant does not object before conviction that prosecution of his case is untimely, the defense is lost. It may not be raised for the first time on appeal. Congress, however, is free to abrogate the general rule. It may decree that, with respect to a particular statute of limitations, prosecution of a stale charge is a fatal flaw, which may be brought to the attention of the courts at any time. Congress makes its intent clear in the language of the statute, its context, and its legislative history. The Court found no such evidence in the case of the statute at issue, general criminal statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C. Section 3282. Thus, the delay in bringing Musacchio's prosecution was not an issue that could be raised for the first time on appeal.", "Second, when jury instructions contain extraneous elements, only the necessary elements of the crime charged need to satisfy a sufficiency-of-the-evidence test. As the Court explained, \"When a jury finds guilt after being instructed on all elements of the charged crime plus one more element, the jury has made all the findings that due process requires.\" ", "The Fifth Circuit, from which the case arose, had decided it on the basis of the rule-of-the-case doctrine. The doctrine states that when a court has addressed a legal issue in a particular case it will not revisit the matter at a later stage of the same case. The Fifth Circuit, however, erroneously applied the rule with regard to a lower court ruling in the same case. For, \"the doctrine is 'something of a misnomer' when used to describe how an appellate court assesses a lower court's rulings. An appellate court's function is to revisit matter decided in the trial court.\" ", "The Court left unaddressed the questions of whether the result would have been different had the indictment contained extraneous elements or had the trial court's instructions on the necessary elements been in error.

The case turned on a matter of statutory construction. The statute at issue set a 10-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for a defendant convicted of child pornography:", "... if such person has a prior conviction under ... chapter 109A [sexual abuse of a child or adult], or chapter 117 [unlawful sex-related interstate travel involving a child or adult], or under section 920 of title 10 (article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice) [rape and sexual assault], or under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward .... ", "Lockhart had pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges. He had earlier been convicted of first degree sexual abuse of an adult under New York state law. The trial court concluded it had no choice but to assess the 10-year mandatory minimum. Lockhart appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. Its decision was in line with those of the Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits and at odds with those of the Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits. The question that divided the appellate panels was whether the phrase involving a minor or ward applied to aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse cases or only to cases of abusive sexual conduct. Did the mandatory minimum apply to Lockhart whose crime involved sexual abuse of an adult? The Supreme Court concluded that it did.", "Justice Sotomayor, writing for the Court, examined the text of the statute first under the \"last antecedent\" rule of statutory construction, which suggests that \"a limiting clause or phrase,\" such as involving a minor or ward, \"should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows; in this case \"abusive sexual conduct.\"", "The Justice then pointed out the symmetry between state and federal triggering offenses. The terms aggravated sexual abuse , sexual abuse , and abusive sexual conduct used to identify the state predicate offenses are the very terms used as captions for the federal predicate offenses in Chapter 109A. She wrote, \"If Congress had intended to limit each of the state predicates to conduct 'involving a minor or ward,' we doubt it would have followed, or thought it needed to follow, so closely the structure and language of Chapter 109A.\" ", "Moreover, the Justice was at a loss to \"explain why Congress would have wanted to apply the mandatory minimum to individuals convicted in federal court of sexual abuse or aggravated sexual abuse involving an adult, but not to individuals convicted in state court of the same.\"", "The opinion seems to have captured the seriousness with which Congress viewed repeat offenders who engage in child pornography. Nevertheless, Justice Kagan's Scalia-like observation in dissent may give one pause: \"Suppose a real estate agent promised to find a client 'a house, condo, or apartment in New York.' Wouldn't the potential buyer be annoyed if the agent sent him information about condos in Maryland or California?\"", "It is possible that Congress may reconsider the Court's construction of the repeat offender mandatory minimum in child pornography cases.

He subsequently relocated in the Philippines without appearing or returning to appear before Kansas registration officials. The Philippines deported him back to the United States, where he faced a federal indictment for failing to appear and update his Kansas registration information. He sought unsuccessfully to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that SORNA did not require him to register once he was in the Philippines. He pleaded guilty, reserving the right to appeal.", "Nichols appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, where he contended that the SORNA's change of residency requirement does not apply when an individual changes his residency in a non-SORNA jurisdiction. The Tenth Circuit rejected the argument on the basis of binding circuit precedent. The Supreme Court in a unanimous opinion by Justice Alito reversed.", "SORNA requires an offender to appear in one of \"three possible jurisdictions: where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, [or] where the offender is a student.\" It defines \"jurisdictions\" as the several states, the various territories of the United States, and certain Indian tribes.

The second is made up of drug trafficking and other enumerated crimes such as burglary, arson, and extortion.

The doctrine is calculated, in the interests of finality, to encourage resolution of a prisoner's constitutional challenges on direct appeal rather than waiting to raise them for the first time on collateral review. The doctrine bars federal collateral review to announce or apply a new rule. ", "There are two exceptions, one substantive and one procedural.

Elsewhere, however, the Iowa criminal code provided a binding definition of the \"building or structure\" element to include cars, boats, and planes. Mathis argued that the Iowa burglary convictions were not ACCA qualifying convictions. The United States District Court and Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. The Supreme Court reversed.

Strieff \u2014a case about evidence suppression in criminal proceedings. The novel question before the Court was whether evidence should be suppressed (through the exclusionary rule) if it was seized after a search incident to a lawful arrest on an outstanding warrant, when the warrant was discovered only because of an initial, illegal stop by the police. Discussion at oral argument, at times, focused on how the Court's decision would impact heavily policed communities, like Ferguson, where a significant percentage of the population has outstanding arrest warrants for minor offenses, like failing to pay traffic fines. ", "The judicially created exclusionary rule requires the suppression of evidence obtained through illegal searches or seizures, as well as evidence later obtained as a result of the earlier Fourth Amendment violation\u2014the so-called fruit of the poisonous tree. However, this rule will be applied only if a court concludes that suppression would deter future police misconduct and that the potential deterrence outweighs potential costs, such as releasing a criminal into the public. Therefore, not all illegally obtained evidence\u2014and derivative evidence\u2014will be excluded. For example, under the attenuation doctrine, a court will not suppress evidence obtained subsequent to an illegal search or seizure if \"the connection between the lawless conduct of the police and the discovery of the challenged evidence has 'become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.'\" To determine whether the intervening event was sufficiently independent of the illegal act to warrant the evidence's admission, courts balance three factors: (1) the temporal proximity of the illegal police activity and the discovery of evidence; (2) the intervening event; and (3) the purpose and flagrancy of the police misconduct. The Court in Strieff reviewed whether evidence obtained from a search incident to a lawful arrest on an outstanding arrest warrant, discovered from a warrant check (the alleged intervening event) during an illegal investigatory stop, falls under the attenuation doctrine and thus should be admissible. ", "In Strieff, the police department in Salt Lake City, Utah, received an anonymous tip that there was ongoing drug activity at a house, after which Officer Doug Fackrell surveilled the house intermittently for approximately three hours total over a weeklong period. During that time, Officer Fackrell observed short-term traffic at the house, which he believed was consistent with drug activity. When the officer saw Edward Strieff leave the house, he questioned him and asked him to produce his ID. Officer Fackrell then ran a warrant check and discovered that Strieff had an outstanding arrest warrant for failing to pay a traffic ticket and searched his body incident to arrest. The search uncovered methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia, and Strieff subsequently was prosecuted for a drug crime. ", "At the suppression hearing, the state conceded that the seizure violated the Fourth Amendment because Officer Fackrell did not have reasonable suspicion to stop and interrogate Strieff. Therefore, the dispute focused on whether the officer's discovery of the outstanding warrant sufficiently attenuated the illegal stop from the discovery of the drugs and paraphernalia. The trial court concluded that it did and denied the motion to suppress. The Utah Supreme Court reversed, however, concluding that only the defendant's voluntary conduct\u2014not police conduct (here, discovering the outstanding warrant)\u2014can attenuate evidence obtained from illegal searches and seizures.", "Neither party, however, appeared to agree with the Utah Supreme Court's interpretation of the attenuation doctrine, and on appeal to the Supreme Court both Utah and Strieff focused on the flagrancy portion of the three-part attenuation analysis. For example, Utah (with the support of the United States) argued that an arrest warrant that had been issued previously by a neutral and detached magistrate judge should erase the taint of an illegal stop (during which the warrant was discovered) so long as the stop was not \"flagrant,\" and in this case, the state contended, it was not. Conversely, Strieff contended that police activity is flagrant when, as in this case, an officer runs a warrant check during a stop when there is no reasonable suspicion or articulable fear for the officer's safety. ", "Notably, in response to these arguments at oral argument, the Court pondered whether there should be a subjective component (atypical in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence) to the flagrancy portion of the analysis, where a court would ask whether the officer was exploiting the system to obtain evidence of other crimes. Justice Kagan asserted that this potentially could deter illegal stops because, in some jurisdictions, \"[i]f you know that there is a significant possibility that somebody you stop is going to have an arrest warrant, that's another reason to stop them.\" On the other hand, Justice Alito stressed the costs associated with ruling for Strieff, pointing out that it would be \"an unusual and unprecedented result\" to suppress the fruit of a lawful search, and thus a defendant ought to present \"strong circumstances\" to justify suppression.", "The Supreme Court ultimately held, in a 5-3 decision, that the discovery of the warrant was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal stop that the evidence discovered incident to Strieff's arrest was admissible. Writing for the Court, Justice Thomas concluded that Officer Fackrell, in making the illegal stop, \"was at most negligent,\" not flagrant. The Court rejected the notion that \"this unlawful stop was part of any systemic or recurrent police misconduct.\" Rather, the Court concluded, \"all the evidence suggests that the stop was an isolated instance of negligence that occurred in connection with a bona fide investigation of a suspected drug house.\" But the dissent criticized the majority for characterizing such officer behavior as \"isolated instance[s] of negligence,\" noting that it is widespread practice in many localities to stop citizens and run warrant checks, which is especially problematic, according to Justice Sotomayor, given that outstanding warrants for minor offenses like traffic tickets are \"surprisingly common.\" In another dissent, Justice Kagan echoed Justice Sotomayor's concerns, contending that the majority's ruling will increase an officer's incentive to violate the Constitution by giving law enforcement a green light to stop persons without reasonable suspicion, knowing that \"[s]o long as the target is one of the many millions of people in this country with an outstanding arrest warrant, anything the officer finds in a search is fair game for use in a criminal prosecution.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Birchfield v.

A second consists of a search incident to a lawful arrest. A third occurs when the subject of law enforcement attention consents to the search or seizure.", "Justice Alito, the author of the opinion for the Court, began with the exigent circumstance exception.

In Riley , the Court had explained that incident to arrest claims are weighed by measuring \"the degree to which they intrude upon an individual's privacy and the degree to which they are needed for the promotion of legitimate government interests.\"", "He concluded that under such a measure breath tests qualified for the exception, but blood tests did not. \"A breath test does not 'implicate significant privacy concerns.' Blood tests are a different matter.... Blood tests are significantly more intrusive, and their reasonableness must be judged in light of the availability of the less invasive alternative for a breath test.\" Thus, \"[b]ecause breath tests are significantly less intrusive than blood tests and in most cases amply serve law enforcement interests, [Justice Alito] concluded that a [warrantless] breath test, but not a blood test, may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving.\" ", "Turning to the consent exception, Justice Alito acknowledged that the Court's \"prior opinions have referred approvingly to the general concept of implied-consent laws that impose civil penalties and evidentiary consequences on motorists who refuse to comply.\" Yet in his mind, the prospect of criminal penalties carried blood tests beyond that to which a motorist could reasonably be said to have implicitly consented.

Bernard's conviction, predicated upon a refusal to submit to a warrantless, but lawful, breath test, remained in place. Beylund, who submitted to a blood test in the face of threatened criminal prosecution and suffered the civil and administrative consequences, saw his case returned to state court to determine whether his consent was voluntary.", "Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg concurred in Birchfield and Beylund , but dissented in Bernard , because they felt the Court too readily endorsed warrantless breath tests.

The nature of the relationship between the U.S. territory and the federal government, however, remains the subject of a long-standing legal and political dispute. Based in part on statutory language providing that the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States is \"in the nature of a compact,\" arguments have been made that any change in Puerto Rico's political status must be consented to by both parties. Others argue that, under the Territory Clause, the United States has plenary authority to legislate regarding Puerto Rico without first obtaining the Puerto Rican government's consent. ", "In Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , the Court was called upon to decide whether defendants in a criminal case can be prosecuted under the local laws of Puerto Rico if they have been previously convicted under federal criminal law for the same offense. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall \"for the same offense ... be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, however, if two separate sovereigns prosecute a person for the same offense, the constitutional protection against double jeopardy is not triggered. Thus, the Supreme Court has held that state and federal prosecutions can be brought for the same offense, and similarly, it has allowed dual prosecutions by the federal government and Indian tribes. The Court, however, has also held that, as territories operate under power delegated to them by Congress, they are not to be treated as separate sovereigns for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. ", "The case came to the Court from the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, the island's highest territorial court, which held, consistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent, that since Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign, it cannot prosecute a person who has been convicted in federal court for the same crime. This view, however, conflicted with an earlier opinion by the federal appellate court with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which held that Puerto Rico should be treated as a state for purposes of double jeopardy, allowing a person to be prosecuted for the same crime under Puerto Rican and federal laws. There was also a long-standing circuit split between the First Circuit decision and an opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on this issue.

In that year, Congress passed P.L. 81-600 (Public Law 600), which contains the \"compact\" language that allowed Puerto Rico to \"organize a government pursuant to a constitution of their own adoption,\" subject to congressional approval. Puerto Rico argued that when Congress subsequently approved its constitution, this approval established the sovereignty of Puerto Rico in much the same way that other territories have achieved statehood. Puerto Rico analogized this legislatively created sovereignty to the sovereignty of Indian tribes, and further notes instances where Puerto Rico has been treated as a state in statutory contexts.

Further, the defendants argued, the legislative history of Public Law 600 provided that nothing in the law would change Puerto Rico's political, social, and economic relationship to the United States.", "The Court, speaking through Justice Kagan, concluded that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not permit the two entities, the federal government and Puerto Rico, to successively prosecute the defendant for essentially the same crime. She began with the observation that the inquiry did \"not probe whether a government possesses the usual attributes, or acts in the common manner, of a sovereign\u2026. [but] whether [the prosecuting entities] draw their authority to punish the offender from distinct sources of power.\" ", "She explained that, for example, \"the States rely on 'authority originally belonging to them before admission to the Union and preserved to them by the Tenth Amendment.'\" By the same token, \"[o]riginally \u2026 'the [Indian] tribes were self-governing sovereign political communities,' possessing \u2026 the 'inherent power to prescribe laws for their members and to punish infractions of those laws.'\" ", "In the case of Puerto Rico, Justice Kagan saw the question as: \"Do the prosecutorial powers belonging to Puerto Rico and the Federal Government derive from whole independent sources?\" She confirmed that with Public Law 600 and with the Commonwealth's subsequent adoption of a constitution, Puerto Rico underwent a profound political change. The question, however, was not about the change, but about the power to make the change. \"Congress conferred the authority to create the Puerto Rico Constitution, which in turn confers the authority to bring criminal charges. That makes Congress the original source of power for Puerto Rico's prosecutors,\" Justice Kagan reminded the parties. When \"an entity's authority to enact and enforce criminal law ultimately comes from Congress,\" she continued, \"then it cannot follow a federal prosecution with its own. That is true of Puerto Rico, because Congress authorized and approved its Constitution, from which prosecutorial power now flows.\"", "The Court therefore affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that the Double Jeopardy Clause's dual sovereign doctrine does not permit successive federal and Puerto Rico prosecutions for the \"same offense.\"", "Justices Ginsburg and Thomas joined in the Court's opinion, but offered a concurring opinion to reflect their view that the dual sovereign doctrine seems at odds with the spirit of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

The Kaley decision held that a grand jury's finding of probable cause was enough for a restraining order without the necessity of a judicial probable cause hearing.", "Luis noted that each of these cases involved tainted assets and that her case involved untainted assets.

He offered three reasons to conclude that the restraining order offended Luis's Sixth Amendment rights. First, Luis's constitutionally protected right to her counsel of choice carried greater weight than the government's interest in forfeiture and restitution. Second, as a matter of legal history, seizure of untainted property prior to conviction was virtually unheard of. Third, the government's position carried to its logical conclusion could sweep away a defendant's right to the assistance of a counsel of choice.

Montana", "paragraphs": ["Holding: T he Sixth Amendment 's Speedy Trial Clause does not apply once a defendant has pleaded guilty or has been found guilty after a trial.", "Betterman v. Montana presented the question of whether the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial applies through sentencing or, instead, ends once a conviction has been obtained. The Sixth Amendment states that \"the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,\" which the Court has described as a \"fundamental right\" that is \"specifically affirmed in the Constitution.\" The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause makes the Sixth Amendment binding on the states. The right to a speedy trial is enforced, in part, by the Speedy Trial Act of 1984, as amended, which sets deadlines (with statutory exceptions) for federal courts to complete various stages of a criminal prosecution. Montana has a corresponding constitutional right but no comparable statutory provision. The consequence of denying this Sixth Amendment right to a defendant is having the charges against the accused dismissed. ", "Brandon Betterman was charged with bail jumping after failing to appear for his sentencing hearing for a domestic assault conviction in Montana. Eventually, Betterman turned himself in, after which he was sentenced for the domestic assault charges; he remained in county jail (instead of being transferred to a state penitentiary to begin serving his sentence) during the criminal proceedings for the bail jumping charge. Fourteen months passed between the date on which Betterman was arraigned for, and pleaded guilty to, the bail jumping charge (April 19, 2012) and his sentencing hearing (June 27, 2013). While he awaited sentencing, Betterman moved to dismiss the bail jumping charge after nine months had passed since his guilty plea, contending that the delay in sentencing violated his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment. The trial court denied that motion, and the Montana Supreme Court affirmed. ", "One of Betterman's principal arguments for why the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause should apply until sentencing concludes centers on the Framers' intent and the text and history of the Clause. Yet with Justice Scalia no longer on the bench, it was hard to predict how those rationales would factor into the Court's analysis. According to Betterman, when the Framers penned the Bill of Rights, criminal proceedings were \"unitary,\" and so when using the word \"trial\" in the Amendment's text, the Framers \"adopted protections encompassing not just the petit jury stage but also the sentence and judgment that followed.\" Montana disputes Betterman's contention, and adds that the Amendment's text, which affords a right to the \"accused\"\u2014not the convicted\u2014lends support to the conclusion that the right does not continue through sentencing. The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) filed an amicus brief in support of Betterman, bringing a human-impact hook for the Court to consider. According to the NACDL, many prisoners, like Betterman, spend long periods in jail awaiting trial, but those facilities are often overcrowded and ill-equipped to handle extended stays, preventing prisoners from accessing adequate medical care and various rehabilitation programs. Thus, the NACDL argues, applying the right to sentencing proceedings could reduce the amount of time in, and allegedly oppressive consequences of, state jail stays. ", "The Supreme Court was unpersuaded by Betterman's arguments and unanimously held that the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause does not apply once a defendant has pleaded guilty or been found guilty after trial. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Ginsburg, noted that the Speedy Trial Clause helps protect the accused's presumption of innocence by \"'prevent[ing] undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial ... and ... limit[ing] the possibilities that long delay will impair the ability of an accused to defend himself.'\" But that protection, the Court clarified, \"loses force upon conviction.\" Additionally, the Court reasoned that its conclusion fits with the historical understanding of the right to a speedy trial, noting that the Framers believed that \"a presumptively innocent person should not languish under an unresolved charge,\" and thus the language chosen\u2014guaranteeing a right to the \"accused\"\u2014was purposeful and distinct from the convicted. Moreover, the Court added that \"[t]he sole remedy for a violation of the speedy trial right\u2014dismissal of the charges\u2014fits the preconviction focus of the Clause\" because, the Court reasoned, \"it would be an unjustified windfall, in most cases, to remedy sentencing delay by vacating validly obtained convictions.\" Still, the Court noted that a defendant who experiences \"inordinate delay in sentencing\" possibly may be able to seek relief through the Due Process Clause\u2014an issue that Betterman did not raise, but which Justices Thomas, Alito, and Sotomayor noted in separate concurrence.

Indian defendants in tribal courts, however, enjoy no such constitutional assurance.", "Bryant, a tribal member and reservation resident, had been convicted in tribal court of domestic violence on a number of occasions. He had been imprisoned more than once as a consequence, although always for less than a year. When he was indicted under the federal domestic violence law, he asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana to dismiss the charges. He argued that the Sixth Amendment did not permit use of his uncounseled tribal court convictions as proof of an element of the federal domestic violence offense. The district court refused to dismiss. The Ninth Circuit reversed. It felt bound by its earlier decision in United States v. Ant d ecision and was unconvinced by later developments. It concluded that \"[b]ecause Bryant's tribal court domestic abuse convictions would have violated the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had they been obtained in federal or state court, using them to establish an element of the offense in a subsequent [federal] prosecution is constitutionally impermissible.\" ", "The Ant decision held that the Sixth Amendment barred the evidence of a defendant's uncounseled tribal court guilty plea in a parallel federal prosecution. Soon thereafter, however, the Supreme Court observed in the course of its Duro v. Reina opinion that in proceedings against tribal members, a tribal court was not bound by the Bills of Rights\u2014and that even when reinforced by the Indian Civil Rights Act, there was no right to appointed counsel in tribal courts. Still later, the Supreme Court in Nichols declared \"an uncounseled [state] misdemeanor conviction[] valid ... because no prison term was imposed,\" and \"also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent [federal] conviction.\" ", "The Ninth Circuit saw no incompatibility between Ant and Nichols because \"even after Nichols , uncounseled convictions that resulted in imprisonment generally could not be used in subsequent prosecutions.\" As the Ninth Circuit conceded, the Eighth and Tenth Circuits saw it differently. For them , the lesson from Nichols was not why uncounseled convictions were valid, but that the reason didn't matter as long as they were valid convictions: \"The ultimate question ... is whether an uncounseled conviction resulting in a tribal incarceration that involved no actual constitutional violation may be used later in federal court.... As per Nichols , then, we believe it is necessary to accord substantial weight to the fact that [the defendant's] prior convictions involved no actual constitutional violation\" because the Sixth Amendment does not apply in tribal court. ", "The Supreme Court agreed. Justice Ginsburg pointed out in the opinion for the Court that \"Bryant's tribal-court convictions ... infringed no constitutional right because the Sixth Amendment does not apply to tribal-court proceedings.\" What counted for Sixth Amendment purposes was that Bryant enjoyed the full advantage of counsel at his subsequent federal Section 117 trial. Moreover, Justice Ginsburg observed, echoing sentiments expressed below, \"It would be 'odd to say that conviction untainted by a violation of the Sixth Amendment triggers a violation of that same amendment when it's used in a subsequent case where the defendant's right to appointed counsel is fully respected.'\"", "Bryant fared no better with his argument that the want of counsel in tribal court undermined the validity of tribal convictions, triggering a due process bar to their use in later federal criminal proceedings. Not so, said Justice Ginsburg. The panoply of statutory rights guaranteed there \"sufficiently ensure the reliability of tribal-court convictions.\" ", "Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion.

The case, Montgomery v. Louisiana , has several distinctive aspects. First, it grants a 69-year-old inmate relief based on a sentence imposed for a murder that occurred when he was 17. Second, it departs from a tradition under which groundbreaking Court decisions rarely travel back to long finalized cases. Third, it uses the so-called Teague doctrine as a vehicle, even though the doctrine was heretofore only invoked to limit state prisoner access to federal habeas corpus review. Finally, its burdens fall most heavily upon the states because federal juvenile prosecutions are few, and federal murder prosecutions are even more uncommon.", "If the particulars of the Court's disposal of the case were somewhat unusual, the result was probably not totally unexpected. The Court had already stated that the Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause would not permit (1) use of the death penalty for a murder committed by a juvenile; (2) a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for an offense other than murder committed by a juvenile; or (3) a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for a murder committed by a juvenile.", "At 17 years of age in 1963, Montgomery killed a deputy sheriff. He was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole, the only sentence available when the jury declined to vote for the death penalty. He asked the Louisiana courts to toss out his sentence when its constitutional defects become apparent after Miller . They refused on the ground that the Supreme Court's decisions have not been carried back to the cases of inmates like Montgomery whose appeals had long since become final.", "State prisoners may ask for review of their convictions or sentences in three stages. First, they may appeal their convictions or sentences in state court (\"direct review\"). Second, they may ask their state courts to overturn their convictions or sentences under a post-appeal procedure available in each of the states (\"collateral review\"). Finally, they may ask the federal courts to overturn their convictions or sentences under federal habeas corpus procedures. ", "Montgomery was at the second stage. Had he been at the third stage, the federal habeas corpus stage, he would have encountered the Teague doctrine. The doctrine, so named for the Supreme Court case in which it was first stated, Teague v. Lane , seeks finality. It provides that federal habeas corpus review is not available to consider an inmate's request for a \"new rule,\" that is, a groundbreaking constitutional interpretation. The doctrine has two exceptions. It does not apply to substantive new rules that void a previously valid crime or penalty. And, it does not apply when the new rule is a \"watershed\" decision, one that \"implicat[es] the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" ", "The Supreme Court in Montgomery decided to apply Teague's exception to the second stage, the stage at which Montgomery found himself: \"when a new substantive rule of constitutional law controls the outcome of a case, the Constitution requires state collateral review courts to give retroactive effect to that rule.\" In the eyes of the Court, the Miller decision is such a rule; it voided a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for a murder committed by a juvenile who was denied the opportunity to prove that he was not irreparably corrupted. The Court returned Montgomery's case to Louisiana with the option either to resentence him or to make him eligible for parole.", "Justice Thomas in dissent disagreed with the Court's jurisdictional assessment that the case involved a federal constitutional issue rather than a matter of state law.

And when the defendant's original sentence had fallen within both the incorrect and correct Guidelines sentencing ranges, courts cannot require, as the Fifth Circuit had, defendants to provide additional evidence that the sentencing outcome would have been different. ", "In United States v. Molina-Martinez, the Supreme Court addressed a circuit split concerning how to determine, under plain error review, whether a district court's application of an incorrect guidelines range affected the defendant's substantial rights. When imposing a sentence, the district judge first must calculate the defendant's advisory guidelines range by using the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (the guidelines) to determine the defendant's total offense level and criminal history score. The district judge must then choose a sentence after considering the guidelines range and weighing, among other things, aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a). If the defendant does not object to the district court's calculation at sentencing, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) limits appellate review of the sentence to plain error. To establish plain error, the defendant must show (1) that the court made an error; (2) the error was plain (i.e., obvious); and (3) the error affected the defendant's substantial rights, which typically means that it \"affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\" If the defendant makes that showing, the reviewing court has the discretion to grant relief if the court also concludes that the error \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Conversely, if a defendant timely objects at sentencing to a guidelines error, the government has the burden of proving on appeal that the error was harmless. ", "In United States v. Molina-Martinez , defendant Saul Molina-Martinez, a Mexican citizen, was convicted of being unlawfully present in the United States after having been removed previously. The district court adopted the probation office's calculation of Molina-Martinez's guidelines range of 77 to 96 months, based on a total offense level of 21 and criminal history category VI. And though Molina-Martinez objected to the total offense level calculation, which the court overruled, he did not object to the criminal history score. The district court then imposed a 77-month sentence\u2014the bottom of the guidelines range. ", "Molina-Martinez appealed to the Fifth Circuit, contending that the district court plainly erred when it incorrectly calculated his criminal history score. The government conceded that Molina-Martinez's criminal history score should have been category V, not VI, and with that score, the correct guidelines range would have been 70 to 87 months' imprisonment. The court found this error to be \"plain\" but concluded, nevertheless, that Molina-Martinez had not established that the error had affected his substantial rights. To do so in the Fifth Circuit, a defendant must show that \"but for the district court's misapplication of the Guidelines, he would have received a lesser sentence.\" And \"[w]hen the correct and incorrect [guidelines] ranges overlap and the defendant is sentenced within the overlap, \" as was the case here, the Fifth Circuit requires that the defendant provide additional evidence to show that his sentence may have been different (e.g., an indication by the district judge that the guidelines range was the primary factor relied on in choosing a sentence). Because the court concluded that Molina-Martinez did not meet that additional burden, it affirmed the district court's judgment. ", "Molina-Martinez petitioned for a writ of certiorari, limited to this question: when a district court incorrectly calculates a defendant's guidelines range, should an appellate court applying plain-error review presume that the error affected the defendant's substantial rights? Molina-Martinez had argued to the Fifth Circuit that such a presumption should apply, but the court\u2014in a footnote\u2014rejected that argument as foreclosed by circuit precedent.", "In urging the Supreme Court to establish the rebuttable presumption, Martinez-Molina pointed to the Third and Tenth Circuits, which disagree with the Fifth Circuit and presume plain error when the district court imposes a sentence after miscalculating the defendant's guidelines range. And without using the word \"presumption,\" the Seventh and Ninth Circuits have also held that a sentence based on an improperly calculated guidelines range constitutes plain error and requires a remand for resentencing. In arguing that those circuits are correct, Martinez-Molina relied on the Supreme Court's comments in Peugh v. United States that the \"federal sentencing scheme aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines\" and that empirical evidence presented \"indicat[ed] that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended effect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges.\" It follows, said Martinez-Molina, that miscalculations resulting in an incorrect guidelines range fit into a \"special category\" of errors that should be presumed prejudicial \u2014a premise that the Court raised and left open in United States v. Olano . Conversely, the government opposed the presumption, reminding the Court that it has \"repeatedly cautioned that '[a]ny unwarranted extension' of the authority granted by Rule 52(b) would disturb the careful balance it strikes between judicial efficiency and the redress of injustice.\"", "At oral argument, the Justices seemed divided over whether the Court should adopt the presumption. For example, Justice Breyer appeared to suggest that in cases in which the defendant proves that the district court incorrectly calculated his guidelines range, the burden of proof should shift to the government \"to rebut the common sense notion that of course using the wrong Guideline had an effect on the sentence.\" Conversely, Justice Scalia asked whether sentencing policy should \"establish[] a system ... that induces lawyers to make objections when objections are proper\" by continuing to make the defendant's burden more stringent on appeal when he fails to raise errors in the trial court. ", "In its unanimous ruling reversing the Fifth Circuit, the Court, in an opinion crafted by Justice Kennedy, declined to adopt Molina-Martinez's requested presumption unequivocally. Instead, the Court narrowly held that \"the error itself can, and most often will, be sufficient to show a reasonable probability of a different outcome outside the error.\" The Court reasoned that its holding was supported by the \"Guidelines' central role in sentencing,\" as the \"starting point\" and \"benchmark\" for sentencing decisions, thus making sentencing calculation errors \"particularly serious.\" Even so, the Court cautioned that \"[t]here may be instances when, despite application of an erroneous Guidelines range, a reasonable probability of prejudice does not exist.\" Still, the Court continued, \"[a]bsent unusual circumstances [a defendant] will not be required to show more\" than the error, and thus the Court explicitly rejected the Fifth Circuit's unique approach. Indeed, the Court added, \"[n]othing in the text of Rule 52(b), its rationale, or the Court's precedents supports a requirement that a defendant,\" in seeking plain-error review of a Guidelines error, \"make some further showing of prejudice beyond the fact that the erroneous, and higher, Guidelines range set the wrong framework for the sentencing proceedings.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capital Punishment", "paragraphs": ["The menu of the Court's capital punishment cases offers cases concerning jury instructions, jury selection, exclusive jury sentencing prerogatives, Brady violations, appellate court judge recusals, and the application of habeas corpus standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Kansas v.

Carr's Eighth Amendment right to an individualized sentencing determination was fatally impaired by [the] failure to\" separate the capital sentencing proceeding of the two brothers, who were thought to have antagonistic death penalty mitigating defenses.

In fact, \"he had conducted no independent investigation into Wearry's innocence and had relied solely on evidence the State and Wearry had provided.\" The Court explained, however, that the presence of the Brady error made it unnecessary to consider Wearry's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel argument.", "The Court's relatively short opinion, nevertheless, took time to observe that various members of the appellate panels below had found credible Wearry's jury selection challenges (\"Finding both jury-selection claims credible, then-Justice Johnson dissented\") and his mental competence objections (\"Justice Crichton would have ... remanded for the trial court to address [Wearry's] claim of intellectual disability under Atkins \").", "Wearry's case, however, did not turn on the state of the law, but on its application. Did the evidence withheld undermine judicial confidence in the verdict? The majority said it did.

The trial court refused to accept the waiver or to instruct the jury as requested.

The prospect of clemency was not enough to make parole \"possible.\" Arizona argued before the Court that \"nothing prevents the legislature from creating a parole system in the future for which Lynch would have been eligible had the court sentenced him to life with the possibility of release after 25 years.\" The Court didn't buy it. It had already rejected a similar argument in Simmons . The prosecution had raised the issue of Lynch's future dangerousness. The only realistic choices left to the jury were death or imprisonment for life without possibility of parole. Under those facts, Lynch was entitled to have the jury so informed. He requested such an instruction and was refused. The Arizona appellate court declined to correct the error. That decision had to be reversed and the case returned for correction.

He was sentenced to death and appealed. During post-conviction proceedings, Hurst was granted a new sentencing trial. At the second penalty phase proceeding, the jury returned a recommendation of death by a vote of 7-5. In accordance with state law, the trial court independently weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances before sentencing Hurst to death. Hurst appealed his sentence, again asserting that in light of Supreme Court precedent, the trial court committed constitutional error inasmuch as the jury had neither been unanimous in its recommendation nor required to find specific facts regarding aggravating factors. The Florida Supreme Court rejected Hurst's arguments and affirmed the death sentence, holding that the Sixth Amendment does not require that the imposition of death sentences be made by the jury and that Supreme Court precedent does not require the jury to make either specific findings of aggravating circumstances or a unanimous recommendation. ", "The Sixth Amendment in relevant part provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury.\" In a series of cases, the Court has held that given the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, judges cannot impose sentences beyond the prescribed statutory maximum unless the facts supporting such an increase are found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; these cases cover guilty pleas , sentencing guidelines, mandatory minimums, criminal fines, and capital punishment. In invalidating Florida's capital sentencing scheme, the Supreme Court relied heavily on its decision in Ring v. Arizona , in which it held that \"[c]apital defendants ... are entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in the maximum punishment.\" ", "In Ring , a jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder. Under Arizona law, Ring could not be sentenced to death, unless further findings were made by a judge conducting a separate sentencing hearing and only if the judge found that the aggravating circumstances outweigh any mitigating ones. The Supreme Court held that because Arizona's enumerated aggravating factors operate as \"'the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense' ... the Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury.\" According to the Court, \"[t]he right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment would be senselessly diminished if it encompassed the factfinding necessary to increase a defendant's sentence by two years [as in Apprendi], but not the factfinding necessary to put him to death.\"", "The Supreme Court in Hurst concluded that Florida's capital sentencing scheme is analogous to the one invalidated in Ring, as Florida requires the judge\u2014not the jury\u2014to make the requisite findings for imposing the death penalty. The Hurst Court found that the advisory nature of Florida's jury recommendation does not comport with Sixth Amendment requirements articulated in Ring . In other words, the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury make specific findings necessary to authorize a death sentence. ", "What lies in the aftermath of this decision remains unclear. While the Court invalidated the method by which Florida imposes the death penalty, it did not invalidate the death penalty itself. It appears that the Florida legislature will have to revise their procedures to make them consistent with the Hurst decision.

Kentucky, in which the Supreme Court recognized a defendant's right to object to the prosecution's peremptory challenges during jury selection on the ground that the state engaged in purposeful discrimination by attempting to exclude members of the defendant's race from the jury, the Court in Foster v. Chatman revisited how to analyze so-called Batson challenges. In jury trials, the parties' lawyers and the presiding judge have the opportunity to examine potential jurors for suitability during a process called voir dire. Based on what is learned during voir dire, the parties may strike potential jurors for cause or exercise peremptory challenges (subject to numerical limitations based on applicable state or federal law) to excuse a juror \"for any reason,\" so long as that reason doesn't violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.", "Currently, when a defendant makes a Batson challenge, courts engage in a three-step inquiry: First, the defendant must make a \"prima facie showing\" that the prosecution exercised a peremptory challenge based on the race of a particular juror; next, the prosecution must provide a race-neutral reason for striking that juror; and finally, the court decides whether the state had purposefully discriminated. In one of the Supreme Court's more recent rulings interpreting Batson, the Court left open the question whether mixed-motive analysis may be applied to Batson challenges, which would allow a prosecutor to defeat a Batson challenge by proving that, despite being motivated in part by race to strike a juror, he would have struck that juror for some other, race-neutral reason, as some circuits currently allow.", "Foster involved a Batson challenge from Timothy Tyrone Foster's 1987 capital murder trial in Georgia. The potential jury pool for Foster's trial had four black individuals, and the prosecution exercised a peremptory strike against each one. Foster, an African American, raised a Batson challenge based on those strikes, but the trial judge concluded that the prosecution rebutted his assertion of purposeful discrimination. The court noted that the prosecutor had supplied numerous race-neutral reasons for striking those potential jurors, including having ties to social workers (because, in the prosecution's view, they tend to \"sympathize\" with criminal defendants); having close relationships with people who abuse drugs and alcohol (because of Foster's own drug and alcohol problems, which allegedly played a role in the murder); giving untruthful answers during voir dire; and expressing reluctance to impose the death penalty. Foster was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death. ", "During postconviction habeas corpus proceedings in state court, Foster renewed his Batson claim, arguing that newly discovered evidence\u2014the prosecutor's notes from jury selection\u2014supported his allegation that the state dismissed the four black jurors based on their race. On the prosecution's jury pool list, each black juror's name had been highlighted in green, and there was a corresponding note explaining that the green highlighting \"Represents Blacks.\" Additionally, the four black jurors were ranked number one to number four, and were the first four names on a list labeled \"Definite Nos.\" The Superior Court of Butts County still did not find a Batson violation, and the Supreme Court of Georgia declined to issue a \"Certificate of Probable Cause,\" which would have permitted Foster to appeal the superior court's ruling.", "Although the parties' briefs focus heavily on the specific facts of Foster's trial\u2014as is typical in Batson challenges\u2014at oral argument some of the Justices raised questions that honed in on broader issues about how to resolve Batson claims. Justice Kennedy, for example, asked \"how the Court should approach the Batson analysis\" when, in a case like this, the prosecution presents a \"laundry list\" of allegedly race-neutral reasons for striking a potential juror. And Justice Sotomayor piped in, asking whether an appropriate rule for these \"laundry list\" cases would be one in which the prosecution could defeat a Batson challenge by supplying just one legitimate race-neutral reason. Foster's lawyer remarked that, in these cases, \"the Court should scrutinize the reasons very carefully\" because, otherwise, the prosecution will be \"encourage[d] ... to just give as many reasons as possible and hope that one will be acceptable.\" Justice Breyer seemed to agree with Foster's position, posing the following hypothetical:", "Now, if my grandson tells me ... I don't want to do my homework tonight at 7:00 because I'm just so tired. And besides, I promised my friend I'd play basketball. And besides that, there's a great program on television. And besides that, you know ... my stomach is upset, but I want to eat spaghetti. And so he's now given me five different reasons. What do I think of those reasons?.... And so I would say my answer to my grandchild is, look, you're not too tired to do your homework. And I think any reasonable person looking at this [case] would say no, his reason was a purpose to discriminate on the basis of race. Now, tell me why I'm wrong.", "In a 7-1, highly fact-specific ruling, the Court held that the \" prosecutors were motivated in substantial part by race\" when it struck two of the prospective black jurors from Foster's trial. In so holding, the Court reasoned that \"the focus on race in the prosecution's file plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury,\" and thus \"[t]he contents of the prosecution's file ... plainly belie the State's claim that it exercised its strikes in a 'color-blind' manner.\" However , the Court did not dive into deeper Batson issues raised by the parties and discussed at oral argument, like how to treat cases when the prosecution produces a \"laundry list\" of race-neutral reasons for excluding a prospective juror or whether a court should apply mixed-motive analysis to a Batson challenge.

Recusal is constitutionally required in the rare case when \"the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\" In assessing that probability, a court makes an objective inquiry, \"ask[ing] not whether the judge is actually, subjectively biased, but whether the average judge in his position is 'likely' to be neutral, or whether there is an unconstitutional 'potential for bias.'\" Constitutional standards for recusal differ from legislatively imposed ones, yet this case raised questions about whether certain statutory bases for recusal\u2014such as previously acting in an advisory capacity in a case \u2014should be construed as a floor for constitutional recusal standards, particularly when a judge's ruling implicates the death penalty and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.", "Terrance Williams was convicted of murder and sentenced to death 30 years ago. The prosecutor handling the case sought approval from higher-ups to seek the death penalty by setting forth aggravating and mitigating circumstances in a written memorandum that made its way to then-Philadelphia District Attorney Ronald Castille. In a handwritten notation on the memorandum, Castille approved the request. During post-conviction proceedings in 2012, newly discovered evidence showed that the trial prosecutor had withheld exculpatory evidence that could have been presented to the sentencing jury as mitigating factors weighing against the death penalty. The post-conviction court granted a stay of execution and vacated Williams's death sentence. The state appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. At the time, Castille was serving as the Chief Justice, prompting Williams to request that Castille recuse himself. Castille declined to do so and provided no explanation behind his decision. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, lifted the stay of execution and reinstated the death penalty for Williams. ", "Williams appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the following two questions: (1) whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when someone who participated in the initial decision to seek the death penalty in a criminal trial later sits on a judicial panel reviewing the penalty imposed in that same criminal case; and (2) if so, whether due process is still violated, requiring vacateur, when that judge's vote was not decisive?", "Concerning the first question, Williams argued that the likelihood of bias when \"a judge had significant prosecutorial involvement in a criminal case\" requires recusal. He pointed to cases involving criminal contempt hearings, in which the Supreme Court had ruled that the Due Process Clause forbids judges from playing certain dual roles. For example, the Court concluded in In\u00a0re Murchison that in so-called one-man grand jury proceedings (where a single judge plays the investigatory role of the grand jury), if the \"judge-grand jury\" accuses a witness of being in contempt, that same judge cannot preside over the contempt hearings. The Court later elaborated in Mayberry v. Pennsylvania that when one is \"part of the accusatory process, he 'cannot be, in the very nature of things, wholly disinterested in the conviction or acquittal of those accused.'\" It follows, said Williams, that the dual role Castille allegedly played\u2014\"personally authoriz[ing] the trial prosecutor to pursue a death sentence against Mr. Williams\" as district attorney, and then sitting as a judge on the panel deciding whether to vacate the death penalty\u2014violated his due process rights. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, described Castille's prior involvement in the case as a \"single administrative act,\" which, in its view, is insufficient to require recusal. Additionally, Pennsylvania cautioned that creating the rule Williams requested would result in a \"dramatic expansion\" of the Court's recusal precedent. ", "The second question\u2014concerning how due process may be impacted by a judge's failure to recuse when he does not cast a decisive vote\u2014had been left unresolved by the Supreme Court in Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Lavoie . In Lavoie, unlike the case here, a judge who had a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case was part of the majority in a 5-4 decision, and the Court concluded that his failure to recuse violated due process. However, the Court left open the question whether due process could be violated if the judge in question did not cast a decisive vote. Williams contended that the Court should adopt the views of three concurring justices in Lavoie that whether the judge (who should have recused) cast a deciding vote is irrelevant to the Court's analysis because the judge's \"mere participation in the shared enterprise of appellate decisionmaking\u2014whether or not he ultimately wrote, or even joined, the ... opinion\u2014pose[s] an unacceptable danger of subtly distorting the decisionmaking process.\" However, Pennsylvania argued that applying the theory that \"one bad apple spoils the bunch\" runs afoul of the principle that \"[t]he law presumes that judges will carry out their duty to maintain impartiality.\" ", "Ultimately, in a 5-3 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The Court first held that \"under the Due Process Clause there is an impermissible risk of actual bias when a judge earlier had significant, personal involvement as a prosecutor in a critical decision regarding the defendant's case.\" As applied to the facts of this case, the Court concluded that \"due process compelled [the] justice's recusal\" given that Castille had participated in the decision to overturn a postconviction court's ruling that had vacated the death penalty in a case for which he had authorized the prosecuting attorney to seek the death penalty when he was a district attorney decades earlier. Additionally, the Court answered the question left open in Lavoie , concluding that even when a judge's vote is not dispositive, a judge's unconstitutional failure to recuse in and of itself is a structural error requiring reversal. In holding that such a judicial failure is \"not amendable to harmless-error review,\" the Court reasoned that \"deliberations of an appellate panel, as a general rule, are confidential,\" and thus \"it is neither possible nor productive to inquire whether the jurist in question might have influenced the views of his or her colleagues during the decisionmaking process.\" Moreover, the Court opined that \"the fact that the interested judge's vote was not dispositive may mean only that the judge was successful in persuading most members of the court to accept his or her position,\" and \"[t]hat outcome does not lessen the unfairness to the affected party.\" Thus, the Court's ruling seemingly brings constitutional recusal standards an inch closer to one of the federal statutory standards."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Prisoners", "paragraphs": ["The Prisoner Reform Litigation Act designed to curb frivolous inmate suits generated two of the cases on the Court's 2015 docket\u2014one on the act's installment payment feature and the other on the required exhaustion of administrative remedies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Bruce v.

Blake . Congress enacted the PLRA, in part, to reduce frivolous prisoner lawsuits that purportedly had been overwhelming federal courts. The act, in relevant part, states that \"[n]o action shall be brought\" by inmates about prison conditions \"until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\" In Ross, the Fourth Circuit joined the Second Circuit in concluding that an inmate may bypass the PLRA's exhaustion requirement and maintain a suit in federal court if special circumstances created a situation in which the inmate \"reasonably believed that he had sufficiently exhausted his remedies.\" Other circuits had concluded differently, perhaps prompting the Supreme Court's review of this case.

When Madigan struck, another state corrections officer, Lieutenant Michael Ross, was holding a handcuffed Blake against a wall and failed to intervene. Blake reported the episode to senior corrections officers. The Internal Investigative Unit (IIU) of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services concluded, after a year-long investigation, that Madigan used excessive force. Blake did not submit an administrative complaint in accordance with Maryland's Administrative Remedy Procedure (ARP) for inmate grievances. He later filed a civil-rights suit under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 against Madigan and Ross (among other prison personnel), alleging that the lieutenants violated his Eighth Amendment rights when Madigan struck him multiple times and Ross failed to protect him. The district court granted summary judgment for Ross on the ground that Blake failed to exhaust available administrative remedies before filing suit. (Madigan, however, did not raise the affirmative defense of exhaustion and was found civilly liable after a trial. ) ", "Blake successfully appealed the district court's ruling for Ross to the Fourth Circuit. The court framed the question before it as whether Blake failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the PLRA. A majority of the Fourth Circuit panel concluded that \"special circumstances\" justified Blake's failure to comply with Maryland's administrative procedures. In doing so, the Fourth Circuit adopted the methodology established by the Second Circuit in an earlier case, which asks (1) whether the inmate \"was justified in believing\" that his participation in another investigatory proceeding procedurally exhausted his administrative remedies; and (2) whether the inmate's participation in that other proceeding substantively exhausted his administrative remedies by giving the prison an opportunity to address the complaint internally. The Fourth Circuit concluded that this two-part inquiry, by having a procedural component\u2014which \"ensures that an uncounseled inmate attempting to navigate the grievance system will not be penalized for making a reasonable, albeit flawed, attempt to comply with the relevant administrative procedures\"\u2014along with a substantive component\u2014which \"safeguards a prison from unnecessary and unexpected litigation\"\u2014is consistent with the purposes behind the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. Applying that test, the majority concluded that \"Blake reasonably interpreted Maryland's murky grievance procedures\" and that his participation in the IIU investigation \"provided the Department [of Public Safety and Correctional Services] with ample notice and opportunity to address internally the issues raised.\" ", "Judge Agee dissented, asserting that \"[t]he PLRA's exhaustion requirement may not even be amenable to any exceptions,\" and, even if it was, Blake failed to satisfy the test that the majority announced. Additionally, Judge Agee noted that three other circuits have ruled that an inmate does not exhaust administrative remedies by participating in an internal investigation.", "The Supreme Court, presented with the opportunity to resolve the circuit split, asked the parties to address whether the Fourth Circuit misapplied Supreme Court precedents \"in holding, in conflict with several other federal courts of appeals, that there is a common law 'special circumstances' exception to the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\" Ross argued, among other things, that the Second and Fourth Circuits' exhaustion exception conflicts with Congress's intent in enacting the PLRA as well as the Supreme Court's interpretation of the act and its goals. Ross contended that in two previous cases, Booth v. Churner and Woodford v. Ngo , the Supreme Court refused to uphold other judicially created exceptions to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. For instance, the Court stated in Booth that \"we stress the point ... that we will not read ... exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where Congress has provided otherwise.\" Additionally, Ross contended that the PLRA's mandatory exhaustion requirement was designed to fix an alleged flaw in the act's precursor\u2014the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980 (CRIPA)\u2014which authorized, but did not obligate, courts to require exhaustion \"in the interests of justice.\" Thus, Ross argued, allowing the exception would \"restore[] to courts a significant amount of the discretion expressly removed by Congress\" when enacting the PLRA. Blake, in his response brief, devoted little space to answering the question that the Supreme Court certified, contending, instead, that this case is really about whether administrative remedies were \"available\" to him. He contended that there were no \"available\" administrative remedies for him to exhaust (as the statute requires), and so he did not need to prove any exceptions to the requirement. According to Blake, when the IIU is investigating a prison incident, \"the prison will dismiss any other administrative grievance as procedurally improper\" and thus the Court should affirm on the alternative ground that Maryland's ARP was not available to Blake or dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. ", "In a unanimous ruling the Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit, concluding that the text and history of the PLRA did not allow the circuit court's \"special circumstances\" exception to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. Focusing on the PLRA's text, the Court reasoned that the language is mandatory and does not permit a court to excuse a failure to exhaust available remedies. Indeed, the Court added, to date it had \"reject[ed] every attempt to deviate ... from [the act's] textual mandate,\" including in Booth and Woodford \u2014the cases cited by Ross. The Court also agreed with Ross's contention that \"the history of the PLRA underscores the mandatory nature of its exhaustion regime,\" noting that \"[i]n enacting the PLRA, Congress thus substituted an 'invigorated' exhaustion provision\" for the \"weak exhaustion provision\" in the former CRIPA. And permitting the special circumstances exception, in the Court's view, would \"resurrect CRIPA's scheme, in which a court could look to all particulars of a case to decide whether to excuse a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. ", "Next, the Supreme Court considered Blake's contention that administrative remedies were unavailable to him\u2014the exception written into the text of the PLRA\u2014clarifying when administrative remedies are \"unavailable.\" Under that exception, \"an inmate is required to exhaust those, but only those, grievance procedures that are 'capable of use' to obtain 'some relief for the action complained of.'\" Thus, remedies are unavailable when (1) \"it operates as a simple dead end\u2014with officers unable or consistently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates\"; (2) when the administrative remedial scheme is \"so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use,\" such that \"no ordinary prison can discern or navigate it\"; and (3) \"when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation.\" Because \"[t]he facts of this case raise questions about whether, given these principles, Blake had an 'available' administrative remedy to exhaust,\" the Court remanded the case to the lower court to evaluate that question in the first instance.
