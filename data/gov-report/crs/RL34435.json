Because of their level of financial support (federal, state, and private), some believe many HBCUs are unable to engage in the level of cutting-edge scientific research conducted by many non-HBCUs. Many HBCUs face difficulty competing for federal research dollars with other research-performing universities. Coupled with limited federal support, HBCUs have experienced a decline in state support. While states are cutting funding to address revenue declines and decreases in their operating budgets, some of these HBCUs are simultaneously viewed as partners in further developing the economy of their respective states. In addition, a report of the Southern Education Foundation found that HBCUs have received attention and support from only a few private foundations.", "Federal stimulus spending provided additional revenues to some HBCUs for the past few years. Some of these institutions have reported that they used stimulus monies provided under American Recovery and Reinvestment to improve operational efficiencies. Stimulus funding, however, is now coming to an end. The end of stimulus funding for many of these institutions equates to a loss of operating support.", "Amid criticism by officials and representatives of HBCUs concerning the disparity in their receipt of federal science and engineering support, several executive orders were issued beginning in 1980 designed to strengthen and increase the participation of the HBCUs in federally sponsored programs and to improve the administrative infrastructure of the institutions. The current executive order, signed by President Obama on February 26, 2010, states that", "Each executive department and agency designated by the Secretary of Education shall prepare an annual plan of its efforts to strengthen the capacity of HBCUs through increased participation in appropriate Federal programs and initiatives. where appropriate, each agency plan shall address, among other things, the agency's efforts to: (i) establish how the department or agency intends to increase the capacity of HBCUs to compete effectively for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements and to encourage HBCUs to participate in Federal programs; (ii) identify Federal programs and initiatives in which HBCUs may be either underserved or underused as natural resources, and improve HBCUs' participation therein; and (iii) encourage public-sector, private-sector, and community involvement in improving the overall capacity of HBCUs.", "An August 2008 report of the NSF reveals that for the academic year 2006, approximately 33.0% of the black science and engineering doctorate recipients had earned their bachelor degrees at an HBCU. While HBCUs have played an important role in providing the undergraduate preparation for many of those black students entering highly specialized science and engineering disciplines, forecasts indicate that their efforts at attracting, retaining, preparing, and graduating students in the sciences and engineering may need to be expanded in order to respond to changing demographics. A September 2009 report of the Department of Education (ED) states that between 2007 and 2018, enrollment in degree-granting institutions is projected to increase 26% for black students, 38% for Hispanic students, 32% for Native American/Alaskan Natives, 29% for Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 4% for white students. These groups, the \"new majority,\" on which the economy must increasingly rely, have traditionally been underrepresented in the sciences compared to their fraction of the total population. There are those observers who believe that the problem of underrepresented minorities in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology could compromise the United States' ability to develop and advance its traditional industrial base and to compete in international marketplaces.

While three HBCUs were established prior to the Civil War, the majority of these institutions were established after the War, several with the public support of land grants through the Freedman's Bureau. The National Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862 (P.L. 37-108), otherwise known as the 1862 Morrill Act, provided public lands to various states for the purpose of constructing educational institutions. Funds appropriated under this act were distributed to the states \"with the intention that they would foster equal educational opportunities for all students, especially newly freed Blacks.\" However, the land-grant higher education system resulting from the 1862 Morrill Act failed to provide equal educational opportunities. Black students were excluded from enrolling in traditionally white institutions.", "Funds from the Morrill Act began to flow systemically to schools offering only all-white education. Congress attempted by various legislation to force racial equality, including equality of educational opportunity. However, the U.S. Supreme Court initiated a series of interpretations of the post-Civil War constitutional amendments which ultimately defeated these various legislative efforts. Culminating with its landmark 1882 decision finding the first Civil Rights Act [1866] unconstitutional, the Supreme Court held that the 14 th amendment only protected against direct discriminatory action by a State government.", "A Second Morrill Act was passed in 1890, which included language mandating States with dual systems of higher education to provide land-grant institutions for both systems. As a result, 19 institutions were established as black land-grant institutions, enrolling those black students who had been excluded under the 1862 legislation. While there was the creation of two land-grant systems\u2014one established under the 1862 Land-Grant Act (1862 Morrill Act) and the other under the 1890 Land-Grant Act (Second Morrill Act)\u2014the level of support for the 1890 institutions (both federal and state) never approximated the level received by the 1862 land-grant institutions. In particular, during the expansion of program offerings and disciplines at the 1890 institutions, the disparity in funding for research infrastructure between them and the earlier established institutions severely limited their efforts to support basic and applied research. In written testimony before the House Committee on Agriculture in support of legislation providing assistance to 1890 institutions, then Honorable Harold E. Ford noted that", "The 1890 institutions were never adequately funded the way they should have been by the various states. With assistance from the various states and Federal Government, the 1862 institutions were permitted to thrive and expand, while the 1890 institutions received meager funding from both their respective state and Federal Government.", "Furthermore, the 1890 institutions were not eligible to participate in the facilities programs provided in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the Federal Government. Under the Research Facilities Act of 1963, only the 1862 land-grant institutions were permitted to participate in this program. Not until 1967 did the Federal Government start to provide research funds to the 1890 programs. These funds were for research projects, and not for constructing research facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Classification of HBCUs", "paragraphs": ["The diversity of HBCUs parallels that of other institutions of higher education.

An important issue in the academic community, and in science and technology policy in general, is the distribution of federal R&D funds to colleges and universities. A major criticism of federal R&D funding patterns is that there is concentration in certain colleges and universities, restricting the development and expansion of scientific and technical capabilities in other institutions. In an analysis of 650 research-performing institutions, NSF found that the top 100 institutions accounted for approximately 80% of all academic R&D funding in FY2006. Those institutions falling in the top 100 category showed only minimal changes in more than 20 years. The charge is that the elite institutions (\"haves\") continue in their status, and the less-prestigious research institutions (\"have-nots\") continue to struggle for research funding. While various measures of equity can be calculated based on the number of institutions, geographic distribution, student enrollments, science and engineering students, graduate students, and so forth\u2014the following analysis will examine federal obligations for R&D to HBCUs as a percentage of all institutions receiving R&D expenditures.", "A March 2009 report of the NSF reveals that in FY2006, approximately 900 U.S. colleges and universities received R&D support.

Although funding to HBCUs has increased in the past 10 years in absolute terms, it remains only a small fraction of the total awarded to all U.S. colleges and universities. A 2009 report of the NSF reveals that for FY2006, HBCUs received approximately $237.5 million for R&D, a decrease of $39.5 million (6.8%) from the FY2006 level of $277.1 Data from FY1999-FY2007 show that while research-performing HBCUs are approximately 6.0% of all U.S. institutions conducting R&D, they receive approximately 1.0%, on average, of all federal academic R&D support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research Funding at HBCUs", "paragraphs": ["An analysis of federal academic R&D support finds that funding is concentrated at selected institutions.

However, 88% of the institutions reported that the amount of existing science and engineering research space was insufficient for meeting current research efforts. When asked to evaluate the condition of the existing space, 48% of the HBCUs indicated that their existing research space was effective for most levels of research, but required limited repair/renovation.
