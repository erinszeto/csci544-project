Depending on the particular model of early home visitation being used, the visitors may be specially trained nurses, other professionals, or paraprofessionals.

In addition to private and state and local public funds provided for early childhood home visitation, a number of federal programs have been tapped to support home visitation programs. Among others, these include Medicaid, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant, the Social Services Block Grant, the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, Community-Based Grants to Prevent Child Abuse and Neglect, Even Start, Part C early intervention services for infants under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, Healthy Start, and Early Head Start.", "The current popularity of early childhood home visitation draws, in some measure, from newer research on how the human brain develops and, specifically, the significance of prenatal and early childhood environments to later life outcomes.

While the results have been mixed, some research has shown results that promise both immediate and longer term benefits to children and their families, including improvements in birth outcomes, enhanced child cognitive development and academic success, and strengthened child-parent interactions.

This appears to be driven in some part by newer research on how the human brain develops and, specifically, the significance of the prenatal and early childhood environments to later life. To a large extent, parents shape their children's earliest experiences, and because most home visiting programs seek to help parents understand their own child's development, advocates see these programs as an opportunity to enhance child development, thereby achieving long-term positive benefits for the children, their parents, and society. Further, at least since the 1960s, a variety of early childhood home visiting models have undergone many assessments and evaluations intended to test how effectively they achieve their goals. While the results of these evaluations have been mixed, some models, or aspects of models, have been shown to be particularly effective.

Each of these home visitation models was privately originated, has established core program components and specific training standards, and has been evaluated with results published in peer-reviewed journals. Further, each of these models has available materials and other resources that may be used to replicate the model. Readers should be aware, however, that there are other models in existence that meet some or all of the criteria discussed above (e.g., Maternal and Infant Health Outreach Worker ). Therefore, the discussion of these models is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.

Accordingly, in most of the home visiting models reviewed here services are made available to families before any \"problem\" has been identified. For example, services are typically available before a family is reported as having abused or neglected a child, or before any particular developmental delay is found in a child. At the same time, some models target families with specific demographic features that suggest additional family support may be needed or useful. The Nurse Family Partnership model focuses exclusively on low-income, first time mothers who are identified during their pregnancy. The Healthy Families model typically targets a broader set of families, including pregnant women or families with pre-school age children who are identified as \"at-risk\" using a standardized assessment tool. However, individual sites where the Healthy Families model is being implemented may choose to serve only particular subgroups within that broader target population. By contrast, the Parents as Teachers model espouses a principle of universal access for families with young children (including pregnant women). Finally, the SafeCare model is more narrowly focused, and is primarily directed at families where a report of child abuse or neglect has been made. Thus while it intends to prevent additional maltreatment, it is specifically designed to intervene in families where a problem (report of child abuse or neglect) has already been identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Age of Child When Service Begins and Ends", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, several models are being used to provide home visitation programs to pregnant women or to families with young children.

By contrast, the Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) and Parent-Child Home Program models do not begin until a child is approximately 2 or three years of age, but also typically end around the time of the child's enrollment in preschool or kindergarten. Separately, the Nurse Family Partnership model requires that services begin during the first-time mother's pregnancy and end with the child's second birthday.

Among 46 states that responded to a 2007 survey conducted by Columbia University's National Center on Children in Poverty (NCCP), 40 indicated the presence of one or more \"state-based\" home visiting programs. The survey defined \"state-based\" to include any distinct program model that was administered by the state (in most instances) or otherwise coordinated by state agencies (excluding Early Head Start, Healthy Start, and the Infants and Toddlers Program funded under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). The survey separately noted that in 24 states, at least 32 distinct programs operated under a state legislative mandate or with some state-legislated program content.", "The NCCP survey indicated that most publicly funded home visiting programs targeted low income families with certain risk factors. Further, the survey showed that the most commonly identified program goals for state-based home visiting programs were related to parenting and children's early health and development. Around 70% of the state-based programs included in the 2007 survey identified program goals in those categories. Just above half of all programs identified outcomes related to pregnancy (e.g., increased time interval between pregnancies). Reduction of government services related to child abuse was cited as a program goal in a little more than 40% of the programs.", "As used in the NCCP survey, a single state-based \"program\" refers to a particular home visiting model that might be in operation at one or many sites in the state. Many of the states responding to the survey had more than one distinct \"state-based\" home visiting program in place. Further, the survey showed that while some of those programs were based on well-known home visiting models, most were not. Of the 70 state-supported, administered, or coordinated programs identified in 40 states, only 17 (identified by 14 states) were implementing one of the well-known home visiting models, such as Healthy Families, Nurse Family Partnership, Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY), and Parents as Teachers. Separately, 14 of the state-supported, administered, or coordinated programs (in 14 states) used more than one of those well-known home visiting models or some combination of different elements from those models (e.g., a \"blended design\"). However, the majority (the remaining 39) of these state-funded, administered, or coordinated programs reported using \"homegrown\" models. The use of blended or homegrown models may reflect efforts by states to address particular needs of a specific target population, to vary intensity of service by identified family need, to offer the amount of services they can financially support, and/or to provide a level of service that will be locally accepted.", "In a 2006 report reflecting on implementation of home visiting programs in several states, researcher Miriam Wasserman observed that in most locations there was not a deliberate effort to identify a program with the most evidence of success. Typically, she writes, statewide programs\u2014of whatever model\u2014were launched in one or more sites based on response to specific, locally identified needs. This attracted the notice and interest of other sites in the state (along with some entrenched local interests), which in turn led to more secure federal or state funding, and ultimately to greater proliferation of that program model. Noting that grassroots efforts have been critical, she also cites the importance of influential champions of a particular model. These might be legislators or other state leaders. As examples, she cites the importance of a 1991 early childhood initiative by then Indiana Governor Evan Bayh in the development of a statewide Healthy Families network in that state; the efforts of Michele Ridge, wife of former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, in the spread of Nurse Family Partnership in Pennsylvania; support of then Arkansas first lady Hillary Clinton in spreading the HIPPY model in Arkansas; and the arrival of the Parents as Teachers model in Idaho, which she credits to the relationship between Senator \"Kit\" Bond of Missouri\u2014where the Parents as Teachers model was first demonstrated and then broadly replicated\u2014and former Idaho Senator Dirk Kempthorne, who subsequently became governor of that state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current ACF Home Visiting Initiative", "paragraphs": ["As part of its FY2008 Budget Request, the Bush Administration sought $10 million (as a set aside within the discretionary activities account of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, CAPTA) for competitive grants to encourage and enable states to invest existing funding streams in a range of \"administrative mechanisms\" that are \"needed to successfully implement and sustain high quality, evidence-based home visitation programs that have strong fidelity to a proven effective model\" and to support a national cross-site evaluation to examine factors associated with successful replication or expansion of \"proven-effective models.\" Congress provided an initial $10 million dollars for this purpose as part of its FY2008 appropriations process ( P.L. 110-161 ) and on September 30, 2008, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at HHS awarded cooperative agreements to 17 grantees in 15 states to support \"state and local infrastructure needed for the high quality implementation of existing evidence-based home visiting programs to prevent child maltreatment.\" ", "The grants are valued at $500,000 per year and, if appropriations are available, are expected to continue for five years.

Among other things, the collaborative planning effort was meant to ensure that \"all relevant programs and funding streams are identified and included\" in the coordination efforts. Ultimately, the plan was expected to lay out the necessary infrastructure for widespread adoption, implementation, and continuation of evidence-based home visiting programs and it will serve as a roadmap for the implementation phase of the cooperative agreement. Because it is \"very interested in interagency collaborative efforts across various disciplines,\" HHS/ACF (through its Children's Bureau) has required that the planning and implementation process for these home visitation projects must include the state or local child welfare agency and the state's designated lead agency for the Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention Program (CBCAP, authorized under Title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which is administered by the Administration for Children and Families of HHS).

For other programs, such as the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, home visiting services are explicitly permitted by statute, but as one of a range of activities eligible to receive a share of program funding. Finally, there is a larger pool of federal programs, including Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which may support early childhood home visitation under broadly stated program authorities. In the latter case, the statute does not explicitly focus on home visiting; rather, some or all of the activities provided under home visiting programs can be considered to be appropriate, allowable strategies for accomplishing the program's overall goals. ", "HHS programs that have or may be used to support home visiting programs include a number authorized under the Social Security Act as well as other acts. Social Security Act programs that have been used to support home visiting include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, Title IV-A), Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services (Title IV-B, Subpart 1), Promoting Safe and Stable Families (Title IV-B, Subpart 2), Maternal and Child Health Block Grant (Title V), Social Services Block Grant (SSBG, Title XX), Medicaid (Title XIX), and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, Title XXI).

", "In addition to HHS and ED, several other federal agencies administer programs that have provided financial support for home visiting programs. Among these are the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) at the U.S. Department of Justice, which has supported home visiting through initiatives such as Safe Start; the Corporation for National and Community Service, an independent agency which supports home visiting through AmeriCorps programs; and the Department of Defense, which funds home visiting efforts as part of its New Parent Support Program for families with children ages 0-3.", " Table 3 parses these federal programs into one of two categories based on how home visiting activities relate to the program goals or statute. The first category lists programs for which home visitation is either a mandatory program component (e.g., Even Start ) or an explicitly permitted (or recommended) activity for achieving the program's goals. The latter refers to programs like Early Head Start, for which home-based programs are a primary strategy for achieving program goals and are explicitly detailed in statute and regulation. This first category also includes programs such as Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention grants, for which \"voluntary home visiting\" services are considered one of several possible core resource and support services for families. The second category includes a selection of programs that have broadly stated goals and authorities; while home visiting is not explicitly required or permitted for these programs, their expansive and flexible nature may allow them to fund some or all home visiting services. For instance, home visiting services could be funded through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs as a strategy to meet the program's goal of providing \"assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives.\" While programs in this category may support home visiting activities, it is not necessary for them to do so. Moreover, even if funds from these programs are used to support home visiting activities, they may account for only a very small portion of total spending.", "The list of federal programs in Table 3 is illustrative only. It is not meant to be exhaustive, nor is it meant to be an exact typology.

One study published in 2001 found that 44% of the reported home visiting program budget dollars came from state revenues. In addition, programs often tap into state tobacco settlement dollars to support home visiting programs. This may be due to fortuitous timing, as the tobacco settlement of 1998 awarded funding to 46 states at a time when home visiting programs were rapidly emerging across the country. The tobacco settlement required five tobacco manufacturers to make annual payments to states (allocated by formula) in perpetuity. Approximately 13 bills were then enacted by state legislatures targeting children's services with tobacco settlement funds, and home visiting organizations have encouraged programs to tap into these resources when seeking state funds.", "While federal and state sources typically provide the largest contributions to program budgets, local public funds (such as county taxes or school funds) and private funds (such as those from charitable foundations) also support home visiting efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Sources by Home Visiting Model", "paragraphs": ["Most home visiting programs are funded by multiple sources. In addition, funding sources appear to vary by program model and, in some cases, within program models over time.", "For instance, a 2004 Healthy Families America (HFA) survey found that 54% of program funding came from the federal government, 38% came from the state, and 8% came from local sources. This is a change from 2002 and 2003, when HFA survey data suggested that a greater share of the total funding came from state, rather than federal, funding streams. In 2004, the bulk of federal funding for Healthy Families America programs came from TANF (86%), with smaller contributions from Title IV-B programs (e.g., Child Welfare Services, Promoting Safe and Stable Families), CAPTA, and other federal sources. This reported composition of federal funding sources also represents a change from prior years. HFA data indicate that in FY2003 the sources of federal funding were more balanced, with Title IV-B programs representing about 35% and TANF accounting for about 28% of total federal funding. Results from these annual Healthy Families America surveys also suggest that funding for HFA programs has decreased over time, from nearly $296 million in FY2002 to almost $185 million in FY2004. Notably, results from these surveys represent only a subset of all HFA programs (due to a response rate of about 73%).", "While these survey data may provide useful insight into Healthy Families America budgets, they should not be interpreted as reflecting a comprehensive picture of HFA funding. Moreover, the results of these HFA surveys should not be generalized to other home visiting program models, as the sources of federal funding may differ across programs, depending on the program model's origin and primary focus. Healthy Families America, for example, was launched in 1992 by Prevent Child Abuse America with an explicit emphasis on preventing child abuse and neglect. Thus, it is not surprising that many Healthy Families America sites appear to receive more support from HHS human services programs (e.g., Title IV-B programs, TANF, CAPTA), while programs like the Nurse Family Partnership, by contrast, report significant support from public health programs at HHS (e.g., Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health Block Grant).", "In fact, the original Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) trial study, launched in Elmira, NY, in 1978, was funded by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) at HHS. In subsequent years, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau remained a common source of funding for Nurse Family Partnership programs, though federal support grew to include grants offered by the National Institutes of Health, as well as programs such as TANF and Medicaid. Recently, David Olds, founder of the Nurse Family Partnership, reported during congressional testimony that Medicaid was a growing source of funding for NFP programs, while the use of TANF funds was decreasing. He indicated that states had used TANF funds more during the program's start-up phase, but that they now rely more on Medicaid funding. In his testimony, Olds also pointed to the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant as a common source of federal support for NFP programs.", "In contrast to both Healthy Families America and the Nurse Family Partnership, Parents as Teachers (PAT) and Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) have both reported significant financial support from ED programs, such as Education for the Disadvantaged, Even Start, and Parent Information Resource Centers (all three programs are funded under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act). For instance, the 2005-2006 HIPPY USA End-of-Year Report notes that 120 HIPPY sites received federal funding from ED programs, compared to only eight sites that reported federal support from HHS (this split is roughly consistent with data in prior year reports). The Parents as Teachers model, meanwhile, originated largely due to support from the education community. PAT started in 1981 with a pilot project in Missouri, funded by the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Danforth Foundation. Four years later, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education had expanded the PAT program to all school districts across the state. Today, more than 160 Local Education Agencies (LEA) are using Title I funds from ED to support PAT programs. ", "In fact, both Parents as Teachers and HIPPY programs are referenced by name in the authorizing statute for three programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).

Partial information provided by some states support the assertion that no less than $250 million is currently being spent each year on home visitation and one researcher has estimated total annual spending for this purpose (from all sources) at \"perhaps $750 million to $1 billion.\" ", "Based on reporting from 31 states in the study conducted by the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP), the aggregate annual level of support for home visiting programs in responding states in 2007 was more than $250 million (covering about 55 programs). This figure represents only a partial accounting of spending for early childhood home visitation, however, because it does not include funding for programs operating in states that did not respond to this survey question and it does not capture spending on programs that did not meet the definition of \"state-based\" used in the NCCP report. ", "A survey of state appropriations for \"parent education and home visiting\" programs (including some Healthy Families America, Nurse Family Partnership, HIPPY, and Parents as Teachers programs) conducted by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) found that among the 26 responding states a total of about $250 million was appropriated for FY2007 and $281 million for FY2008. Of this total, it appears that federal funding sources account for roughly 15% of total appropriations, with most federal contributions attributed to TANF or Medicaid. The NCSL report is likely to under-represent federal contributions, as not all federal programs require state legislative action in order to be directed toward services at the state or local level. ", "Taking a broader view of home visiting programs across the United States, home visitation researcher Deanna Gomby estimated in a 2005 report that annual costs for these programs are \"perhaps $750 million to $1 billion.\" Gomby's estimate assumes a range of $1,000 to $3,000 per family per year and is based on the number of children enrolled in seven selected home visiting programs operating nationally. ", "Estimating costs for home visiting is also difficult because costs may vary significantly by program model and site, as demonstrated in Table 1 . For example, Healthy Families America estimates that their programs spent from $1,950 to $5,768 per family in FY2004, with costs averaging about $3,348 per family in that year. This was up from an average cost of $2,764 in FY2003, when spending ranged from $1,550 to $4,500 per family. The Nurse Family Partnership offers more current numbers in a 2009 fact sheet, indicating that their typical costs range from $2,914 to $6,463 per family per year. Variation in costs across program models and sites can be attributed to a number of factors, including the intensity of services provided (e.g., number of visits), the qualifications and salary requirements of staff, the differences in cost of living for communities across the country, and the variety and scope of services offered. Typically, the more comprehensive the program, the higher the cost. The average cost for a slot in Early Head Start, for instance, is estimated to exceed $11,000 annually (though this average is based on all Early Head Start programs, which include center-based, home-based, and combination programs)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Research and Evaluation of Existing Home Visiting Programs", "paragraphs": ["Looking at findings across multiple home visiting studies, researchers conclude that home visiting can provide benefits to children and their parents, including preventing potential child abuse and neglect, enhancing cognitive development, improving parenting attitudes and parenting behaviors (e.g., discipline strategies), and increasing maternal education.

(That is to say, the difference between observed outcomes for home visited as opposed to not-visited parents and children is small.) Further, while one or more individual studies may have shown positive effects with regard to many other desired outcomes, those effects have not necessarily been studied and/or achieved across more than one study or program site. Efforts to better understand the components of successful home visitation and to find additional effective methods for meeting a range of family and child needs continue with newer research providing additional information on positive outcomes.

Other researchers caution that to be effective (regardless of program model or goal) a home visitation program's goals must be aligned with the program's content (e.g., if you want to prevent child abuse and neglect you have to focus on the aspect(s) of the home visit that will accomplish this), and that home visitors must appropriately and adequately deliver the services. They also make clear that home visiting is not a silver bullet strategy that can solve all prevention needs. Instead they suggest it will be most successful if it is integrated into a broader set of services that are focused on supporting families and ensuring positive outcomes for young children. These include quality center-based education for preschoolers, preventive health care as part of medical homes for all children, parenting support groups, and clinical mental health and other treatment services for parents who need them.

Some of these studies have been designed as randomized control trials. Findings generated from these experiments, provided they are well designed and implemented, can demonstrate the level of effectiveness. In this kind of program evaluation, study participants are randomly assigned to a \"treatment\" or \"experimental\" group, while others are randomly assigned to a \"control\" group. Families assigned to the \"treatment\" group subsequently receive home visiting services; families assigned to the control group do not. The outcomes for both groups are tracked and tested for statistically significant differences. To ensure that the findings accurately reflect what is achieved, however, these studies must have a participant pool that is large enough to allow researchers to draw conclusions that are statistically significant. Finally, the experiment should be carried out in more than one site and the findings of the study should be consistent (or replicated) across those multiple sites. Follow-up studies (longitudinal analysis) of the original may be used to determine if any initial positive effects are maintained over time and/or to measure later effects (e.g., academic success in grade school of home visited versus not-visited infants and toddlers).", "Other studies that have been used to evaluate home visitation programs are referred to as \"quasi-experimental.\" Although they do not randomly assign participants, quasi-experimental studies are designed so that outcomes for the group of families and children receiving the treatment (e.g., home visiting) may be compared to a group of families who did not receive these services. Ideally, the characteristics of this comparison group closely match those of the group receiving the treatment (home visiting services) so that any differences are fairly attributed to the treatment received rather than to differences in the groups studied. As with randomized control tests, findings from quasi-experimental studies that use larger participant pools and test outcomes in more than one location are considered of greater merit than those not meeting these standards. ", "Finally, some evaluations of home visitation programs look at changes across time (e.g., pre-test, post-test) but only among the group of families who were served. This kind of program feedback can be important in implementing a program\u2014particularly if consistent data are regularly collected and reviewed as part of a structured and continuous program improvement process. However, this type of study is considered \"non-experimental\" because it lacks a contemporaneous comparison group, and some of the changes observed could have occurred even without implementing home visiting. ", "Randomized control studies may provide the clearest evidence of a home visiting program's effects, and some researchers call for continued implementation of these studies to ensure effectiveness of home visiting models. Others note that randomized control studies are expensive and time consuming, and that they require social service providers to withhold what may be valuable family support from \"control group\" members. Reflecting on their own efforts to implement a randomized control trial of a particular service strategy for children and families, two researchers at the Michigan State University Child Health Care Clinic note that these trials are based on three assumptions\u2014standardized interventions, equal groups, and equal environments\u2014and that \"most if not all, of these assumptions are difficult to meet in the complex environment of practice.\" Some researchers and home visitation advocates cite the wide range of family needs and circumstances as dictating that more than one model of home visiting is necessary and they further argue that each of those iterations can not be tested, practically, in a random trial.

The overall incidence of substantiated abuse or neglect is relatively low across the population. Generally, this means that to show a \"statistically significant\" effect, a fairly large number of participants must be included in a study. If the number of participants is relatively small, even what appears to be a large difference in the proportion of children abused among the control group and the treatment group may not be statistically significant. Differing definitions of child abuse and neglect by state as well as varied state policies for how investigators are to determine whether child abuse or neglect has occurred also complicate any national or multisite effort that uses substantiated child abuse and neglect reports to measure program effectiveness. Finally, families who are regularly visited by a nurse or other family worker are subject to a high degree of surveillance and may thus be more likely to be reported to the Child Protective Services (CPS) agency.

Overall, however, they concluded that the program did not prevent child abuse or promote use of nonviolent parenting. Among the critical issues cited by the researchers as hindering program effectiveness was the frequent failure of home visitors to identify and address family risk factors (e.g., domestic violence, mental health needs).

Further, it noted that one model of home visitation, which used nurses to visit low-income first-time mothers, was found to reduce Medicaid costs in several randomized control trials. Accordingly the Administration assumed that expanding proven effective home visitation programs would result in savings to the Medicaid program (via reductions in preterm births, emergency room use, and subsequent births) totaling $77 million in the first five years and $664 million over the entire 10 years.", "Mandatory funding for the newly proposed home visitation program was proposed at $124 million in budget authority ($87 million in \"outlays\" ) for FY2010, rising each year to $790 million in budget authority ($710 million in outlays) by year five of the program (FY2014) and to $1.837 billion in budget authority ($1.753 billion in outlays) in year ten (FY2019).

Further, the Administration would give priority to funding for models \"that have been rigorously evaluated and shown to have positive effects on critical outcomes for families and children.\" Accordingly, states, territories, and tribes seeking grants under the proposed home visitation program would be required to submit a plan describing, among other things, the program model they will follow, evidence for the effectiveness of the program model, and how the state will ensure that the proven program model is adhered to (model fidelity). Funding related to programs with strong research evidence demonstrating their effectiveness would include technical assistance, monitoring, and evaluation to ensure fidelity of the model and for \"evaluating effectiveness of these models as conditions change over time.\" The Administration also anticipates that additional funds will support \"promising programs\" such as those based on some research evidence and those that are adaptations of previously evaluated programs. Funding for these programs would also include technical assistance, monitoring, and evaluation that focuses on developing these promising models and on \"rigorous (random assignment) evaluations of effectiveness.\" Finally, the Administration proposed that no less than 5% of the program's overall funding be reserved for research, evaluation, training, technical assistance, monitoring, and administration.", "Based on its inclusion in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) budget justifications, the Obama Administration expected this HHS agency to administer the new home visiting state grant program.

Most witnesses appeared to support availability of home visitation services to any family, without regard to any specific demographic or family risk factors, although one witness clearly favored providing services to low-income mothers. At the same time, in responding to a question regarding which families they would target if limited funds were available, at least one witness cautioned against using demographic markers to select families, but suggested the importance of engaging families early, perhaps during pregnancy (via prenatal clinics or obstetric offices) or at birth (via hospital). Another witness stressed first-time young mothers as an important group, and one where research to date has shown the greatest level of successful outcomes.

Other factors given as important to program success included solid organizational capacity and linkages to other community resources and supports. ", "Appendix A. Selected Federal Programs That Provide or Support Home Visitation ", "As discussed in the section on \" Existing Federal, State, and Local Funding Streams for Home Visiting ,\" a number of federal programs are already being used to support early childhood home visitation efforts. Federal statute for these programs may require some amount of home-based services (e.g., Even Start), explicitly permit home visiting as a possible activity (e.g., Maternal and Child Health Block Grant), or allow home visiting under broad authorities or program goals (e.g., Medicaid). Selected programs, arranged alphabetically, are briefly described below. ", "Community-Based Grants for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (CBCAP)", "Title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) authorizes grants to support community-based services for the prevention of child abuse and neglect. CBCAP grants are distributed by formula to a lead entity in all states (which may be a public agency, a quasi-public entity, or a nonprofit private organization). The lead entity is charged with developing a continuum of community-based services for children and families that are designed to strengthen and support families to prevent child abuse and neglect. Core family resource and support services to be provided by community-based programs include voluntary home visiting services, parent education, community and social services referrals, and respite care services, among others. In their FY2007 program summaries, the majority of state CBCAP contacts indicated explicit support of home visiting services. For FY2010, the CBCAP program received funding of approximately $42 million ( P.L. 111-117 ). CBCAP is administered by the Office of Child Abuse and Neglect within the Children's Bureau of the Administration for Children and Families at HHS.", "Early Head Start", "Early Head Start is a federally funded community-based program for low-income expectant parents and families with infants and toddlers that seeks to (1) promote healthy prenatal outcomes; (2) enhance the development of infants and toddlers; and (3) promote healthy family functioning. Nationwide, there are more than 650 Early Head Start programs providing child development and family support services, serving approximately 62,000 children under the age of three annually. Grantees select an Early Head Start service delivery option (typically center-based, home-based, or a combination) to meet the needs of the children and families in their communities. In 2006, about half (51%) of Early Head Start slots were center-based, while 41% were in home-based programs. Children and families enrolled in center-based programs receive comprehensive child development services in a center-based setting, supplemented with limited home visits by the child's teacher and other Early Head Start staff (a minimum of two home visits a year to each family). In home-based programs, children and their families are supported through weekly home visits of at least 90 minutes and bimonthly group socialization experiences. Combination programs provide a blend of center class sessions and 90-minute home visits (regulations specify acceptable combinations of minimum numbers of class sessions and corresponding home visits). ", "Home visits are conducted by professionals who receive training in child development, family development, and community building. In FY2008, the majority of Early Head Start teachers (54%) and home visitors (66%) held a degree in early childhood education (or a related field). Legislation that reauthorized the program in 2007 ( P.L. 110-134 ) required HHS to develop standards for Early Head Start home visitors related to staff training and qualifications, as well as to conduct of home visits. ", "For FY2010, HHS estimated that Early Head Start programs would receive about $690 million out of the total appropriation provided for Head Start ( P.L. 111-117 ). In addition, Early Head Start programs are expected to receive funds in FY2010 that were appropriated in the previous fiscal year as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), P.L. 111-5 . According to HHS, nearly $1.1 billion in Early Head Start funds from ARRA remained unobligated at the end of FY2009. The program is administered by the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at HHS. ", "Even Start", "Even Start programs are authorized by ESEA Title I, Part B, Subpart 3, and are intended to integrate early childhood education, adult basic education, and parenting skills education into a unified family literacy program. Funds are distributed to all states and must be subgranted to local education agencies working in collaboration with community based organizations. Even Start programs generally serve children aged zero to seven and their parents. Services must include home-based instruction, adult literacy instruction, early childhood education, instruction to help parents support their child's education, participant recruitment, screening of parents, and staff training. An assumption underlying Even Start is that children whose parents have low literacy or basic education levels are more likely to be educationally successful if, in addition to receiving early childhood instruction themselves, their parents receive educational services plus instruction in how to help their children learn. The program is administered by the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, within the Department of Education. It was funded at the level of $66 million for FY2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ).", "Healthy Start", "The Healthy Start program provides funding through competitive grants or cooperative agreements to provide health and related services to high-risk pregnant women, infants, and mothers in communities with exceptionally high rates of infant mortality. Among other purposes, the program seeks to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the proportion of pregnancy-related maternal deaths, preterm births, and infant mortality. Healthy Start projects also work to ensure that the basic needs of mothers and infants (including \"housing, psychosocial, nutritional and education support, and job skill building\") are met. The program operates in 40 states (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) and reaches roughly 100 communities. ", "Home visits are frequently a part of services offered under this program. A 2003 survey of Healthy Start grantees (n=95) found that 99% provided home visits to at least some of their clients, with most offering home visits to a majority of their pregnant or parenting clients: 76% of grantees provided home visits to at least three-fourths of their pregnant clients and 64% of grantees provided home visits to their inter-conceptional clients. A little more than one-third of the grantees (35%) used a specific schedule to provide these home visits, but most (64%) reported scheduling visits in accordance with client need. Home visiting services provided to Healthy Start clients frequently included depression screening and treatment (84%), well baby care (75%), and smoking cessation and reduction services (73%). The large majority of grantees (87%) also conducted home visits to assess the home environment for infants and toddlers. The program is authorized under the Public Health Service Act (Section 330H, as amended by P.L. 106-310 ) and is administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of HHS. For FY2010, it received funding of approximately $105 million ( P.L. 111-117 ).", "Infants and Toddlers Program, Part C, IDEA", "The Infants and Toddlers Program (\"Part C\") component of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides grants to states to assist them in implementing statewide systems of \"coordinated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, interagency programs\" that identify children (ages birth through three) that have or are at risk of physical, mental, or social skills developmental delays. The Part C program may be targeted toward children experiencing a developmental delay in one or more physical, mental, or social skill areas; The IDEA requires that these Part C services be delivered to the \"maximum extent possible\" in a child's \"natural environment,\" and the very large majority of Part C services are delivered in the home. In fact, one report indicates that more than 80% of Part C Services are delivered in the home. However, specific services are not based on any statutorily developed curriculum. Instead, they are provided pursuant to an Individual Family Services Plan (IFSP) that must be created to address the identified developmental delays. The Part C program is administered by the Office of Special Education within the Department of Education. The program received an appropriation of $439 million in FY2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ).", "Maternal and Child Health Block Grant", "The Maternal and Child Health Block grant (Title V of the Social Security Act) is a public health program that seeks to (1) ensure access to and improve the quality of health care for mothers and children, especially those with low income or limited availability of care; (2) reduce infant mortality; (3) provide and ensure access to comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care to women (especially low-income and at-risk pregnant women); (4) increase the number of children receiving health assessments and follow-up diagnostic and treatment services; (5) provide and ensure access to preventive and child care services as well as rehabilitative services for certain children; (6) implement family-centered, community-based systems of coordinated care for children with special health care needs; and (7) provide toll-free hotlines and assistance in applying for services to pregnant women with infants and children who are eligible for Medicaid. States use Title V block grant funds for a variety of purposes, including direct services; efforts to build community capacity to deliver \"enabling services\" (e.g., home visiting, care coordination, transportation, and nutrition counseling); personal and preventive health services; and infrastructure-building services. Separately, Title V funds Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS). These projects use six specified strategies to increase capacity and integration of local service systems, including through provision of maternal and infant home health visiting, health education, and related support services for pregnant women and infants up to one year old.", "The Title V program received FY2010 funding of $662 million ( P.L. 111-117 ), the large majority of which is distributed to all states under the block grant. However, some of these funds are provided for CISS grants and others are devoted to research via the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) grants. The Title V block grant is administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) at HHS.", "New Parent Support Program", "The military's New Parent Support Program (NPSP) was developed in recognition of the unique parenting challenges faced by military families (e.g., frequent deployments, long duty hours, moves to unfamiliar locations, and separation from extended families and friends). NPSP services are available to military families who are expecting a child, or who have a child or children up to three years of age (or five years of age for the Marine Corps). Services offered may vary across military branches and installations, but all NPSP programs include a home visiting component. In addition, programs may include supervised playgroups, prenatal and parenting classes, hospital visits, and referrals to other resources. Home visitors provide parents with guidance on child growth and development and address topics such as breastfeeding, sleeping, nutrition, and behavior management. The Department of Defense notes that home visits per family may be limited unless the family has been identified as being at high risk for child abuse. Every professional NPSP program staff member is required to be licensed as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), Marriage and Family Therapist, or Registered Nurse (RN). In addition, all staff must complete a criminal background check. The NPSP program is a part of the military's Family Advocacy Program (FAP). ", "Parent Information Resource Centers", "Parent Information and Resource Centers (PIRCs) help implement parental involvement policies, programs, and activities designed to improve student academic achievement and strengthen partnerships among parents, teachers, principals, administrators, and other school personnel in meeting the education needs of children. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) (Section 5563) requires the recipients of PIRC grants to serve both rural and urban areas; use at least half their funds to serve areas with high concentrations of low-income children; and use at least 30% of the funds they receive to establish, expand, or operate Parents as Teachers (PAT) programs, HIPPY programs, or other early childhood parent education programs. Projects generally include a focus on serving parents of low-income, minority, and limited English proficient (LEP) children enrolled in elementary and secondary schools. According to the most recent data available, nearly 60% of parents served in the 2006-2007 school year were from low-income families, and nearly 25% had limited English proficiency. PIRC funding is distributed through competitive grants to nonprofit organizations or a consortium of a nonprofit organization and a local education agency (LEA). For FY2010, PIRC grants were funded at the level of $39 million ( P.L. 111-117 ), of which about 30% (roughly $11.7 million) may go toward PAT, HIPPY, or other early childhood parent education programs selected by the grantee. PIRC grants are administered by the Office of Innovation and Improvement (OII) at the Department of Education.", "Promoting Safe and Stable Families", "The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program (PSSF, Title IV-B, Subpart 2 of the Social Security Act) primarily authorizes funds to state child welfare agencies for provision of four categories of services. The statute requires that states spend a \"significant\" amount of program funding on each of the categories: family support, family preservation, time-limited reunification (for families whose children have been removed to foster care within the past 15 months), and adoption promotion and support. For FY2010, the PSSF program received funding of $408 million, of which an estimated $64 million, at a minimum, should be made available for family support services. Home visitation is typically considered a family support service and the statutory definition of \"family support services\" for purposes of the PSSF program is \"community-based services to promote the safety and well-being of children and families designed to increase the strength and stability of families (including adoptive, foster, and extended families), to increase parents' confidence and competence in their parenting abilities, to afford children a safe, stable and supportive family environment, to strengthen parental relationships and promote healthy marriages and otherwise to enhance child development.\" Current data on the number of states using PSSF dollars to support home visitation are not available.

Federal Initiatives Related to Coordination of Early Childhood Programs and\u00a0Services", "Researchers have noted the importance of providing home visitation services in the context of other community supports intended to support and improve the well-being of young children and their families. In recent years, a number of federal initiatives have been established that seek to improve coordination among early childhood health, education, and social services programs and which might be relevant to home visitation programs. Several are discussed below.", "State Advisory Councils on Early Childhood Education and Care ", "The 2007 reauthorization of Head Start ( P.L. 110-134 ) 2007 included a new requirement for governors to establish State Advisory Councils on Early Childhood Education and Care ( \"State Advisory Councils\") for children from birth to school entry. These councils are intended to improve coordination across critical early childhood programs within each state and are expected to have representation from a broad spectrum of stakeholders, ranging from the state child care and education agencies to agencies responsible for health and mental health care. State Advisory Councils must:", "conduct a statewide needs assessment; identify opportunities for collaboration and coordination among entities carrying out federally funded and state-funded child development, child care, and early childhood education programs; develop recommendations for increasing the participation of children in existing federal, state, and local early childhood education and child care programs; develop recommendations for establishing a unified data collection system for publicly funded programs offering early childhood education, development, and services; develop recommendations for a statewide professional development and career plan for early childhood education and care; assess the capacity and effectiveness of two- and four-year public and private institutions of higher education toward supporting the development of early childhood educators; and make recommendations for improvements in state early learning standards, as appropriate. ", "The Head Start Act requires that governors officially \"designate\" a council to serve as the State Advisory Council and an individual to coordinate the activities of the council (which might be a pre-existing advisory council). The Head Start Act allows HHS to award one-time start-up grants of $500,000 or more to states for the development or enhancement of high-quality systems of early childhood education and care designed to improve school preparedness. Funding ($100 million) was made available for these grants for the first time in FY2009. States have until the end of FY2010 to apply for these funds. Grantees are required to provide a 70% match. All Head Start activities, including State Advisory Councils, are administered by the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families at HHS.", "Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems", "State Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems (ECCS) are funded via competitive grants to states, and are to ensure school readiness through creation of a seamless system of early childhood services for all children. There are five core areas in which these systems, by fostering integrated efforts across health, human service, and education agencies, are meant to ensure delivery of services for young children. The five areas are (1) access to health care and medical homes; (2) assessment of and services to address socio-emotional development and mental health needs; (3) early care and learning programs; (4) parenting education; and (5) family support services. The initiative, which is supported with a part of the Title V (of the Social Security Act) Maternal and Child Health Block Grant funding reserved for Special Projects of Regional or National Significance (SPRANS), was first funded in FY2003. Nearly all states have now received these grants and were developing or implementing these systems. States have tended to focus ECCS activities on state early care and learning policies and programs, and one analysis concluded that \"most states need to give more importance to strategies that promote health, mental health, and family support.\" Home visiting is one family support strategy that is generally consistent with the overall school readiness aim of the initiative and which has received specific attention by some ECCS grantees. In its announcement of FY2009 funding (just over $7 million was made available), the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (HRSA, HHS), stated that this phase of the initiative was expected to support continued implementation of the state early childhood strategic plans and \"the integration of the ECCS program with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Project LAUNCH [described below in this Appendix], the Administration for Children and Families Home Visiting Program [see \" Current ACF Home Visiting Initiative \"], and the State Early Learning Councils mandated by the Head Start reauthorization legislation [described above in this Appendix].\"", "Project LAUNCH ", "The Project LAUNCH (Linking Actions for Unmet Needs in Children's Health) initiative provides competitive grants for states and tribes to promote the wellness (defined as positive physical, emotional, social, and behavioral health) of children from birth to age eight. Grantees are charged with supporting evidence-based initiatives to achieve the overall goal of wellness. In their applications for funds grantees have sometimes identified one or more specific home visitation models they intend to support. These have included Parents as Teachers, Healthy Steps Home Visitation Component, Baby University Nurse Home Visiting Program, First Born Home Visiting Program, Safe Care, and \"Visitation to at-risk infants and parents by Touchpoints trained visitors.\" In addition, grantees identified numerous additional parent training and family strengthening programs, along with programs focused on developmental assessments, mental health, and physical health. Among other requirements, grantees are required to create a State (or Territorial or Tribal) Council on Young Child Wellness and to include public agencies that administer health, education, and human services for young children (including child welfare agencies). In addition, grantees are specifically required to link their efforts to those of any HRSA-funded ECCS grantee in the state as well as any ACF Home Visitation grantee. Initial funding of just under $7.5 million was provided for FY2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ) under authority of Section 520A of the Public Health Service Act; for FY2009 Congress provided $20 million for the initiative ( P.L. 111-8 ) and $25 million for FY2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ).

States receiving funds under Part C are expected to establish such a council. The statute gives governors authority to appoint members to the council and goes on to specify a broad spectrum of early childhood stakeholders that should be included. At least 20% of council members must be parents of children with disabilities, a requirement that emphasizes the role of family involvement in policy and program development. The IDEA state councils are required to meet on a quarterly basis and council meetings may be open to the public. State councils are responsible for advising and assisting the lead state agency in the identification of fiscal and other resources for early intervention programs. Moreover, the councils may advise and assist the lead agency and the state educational agency on the provision of appropriate services for children from birth through age five, including the transition to preschool. The councils may also advise appropriate agencies in the state with respect to the integration of services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and at-risk infants and toddlers and their families, regardless of whether at-risk infants and toddlers are eligible for early intervention services.
