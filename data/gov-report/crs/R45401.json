Perhaps the most widely discussed of these are statewide assessments required by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which was most recently comprehensively amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95). However, U.S. students also participate in large-scale national assessments, authorized by the National Assessment of Educational Progress Assessment Act (NAEPAA; Title III, Section 303 of P.L. 107-279), and international assessments, authorized by the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA; Title I, Section 153(a)(6) of P.L. 107-279). At the national level, students participate in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). At the international level, U.S. students participate in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).", "Although there are some similarities between statewide, national, and international assessments, they differ in purpose and level of reporting. For example, the purpose of statewide assessments is primarily to inform statewide accountability systems and provide information on individual achievement. By contrast, the purpose of large-scale assessments is to highlight achievement gaps, track national progress over time, compare achievement within the United States, and compare U.S. achievement to that of other countries. Results of these assessments are not reported for individuals.", "National Assessments: The NAEP is a series of assessments measuring achievement in various content areas. The long-term trends NAEP (LTT NAEP) has tracked achievement since the 1970s and has remained relatively unchanged. The main NAEP assessment has tracked achievement since the 1990s and changes periodically to reflect changes in school curricula. The main NAEP has three levels: national, state, and Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA). States that receive Title I-A funding under the ESEA are required to participate in biennial state NAEP assessments in reading and mathematics for 4th and 8th grade. Results from the 2017 main NAEP show a small but significant increase in 8th grade reading since 2015. There were no significant changes in 4th grade reading, 4th grade mathematics, or 8th grade mathematics since 2015. Longer term, however, average reading and mathematics scores have increased significantly since the initial administrations in the 1990s.", "International Assessments: The United States participates in three international assessments: TIMSS, PIRLS, and PISA. TIMSS is an assessment of mathematics and science for 8th grade students. PIRLS is an assessment of reading literacy for 4th grade students. PISA is an assessment of reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy for 15 year old students. In general, U.S. students have made statistically significant gains since the initial administrations of international assessments; however, achievement did not consistently increase in the most recent administrations of international assessments.", "Issues of Interpretation of National and International Assessments: Results of national and international assessments are difficult to interpret. One challenge is processing the large amount of data. Another is understanding the difference between statistical significance and educational significance. Reporting statistical significance is standard practice in research, but it does not convey the magnitude of a difference and its associated educational significance. Another issue is the tendency to focus narrowly on one assessment at one point in time. A narrow focus may not provide the appropriate context to interpret results accurately. International assessment results may also be affected by socioeconomic considerations within and across countries.", "Comparing Results Across Assessments: Comparing results across national and international assessments can be challenging. Each assessment was created for a unique purpose by different groups of stakeholders, which makes direct comparisons difficult. There are a number of issues to consider when evaluating U.S. students' performance across assessments. For example, consideration must be given to the differences in (1) the degree of alignment of content standards and assessments, (2) the target population being assessed, (3) the voluntary nature of student participation, (4) the participating education systems, (5) the scale of the assessment, and (6) the precision of measurement for each assessment."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Assessing the achievement of students in elementary and secondary schools and the nation's educational progress is fundamental to informing education policy approaches.

This section of the report discusses some of the major differences between large-scale and other, smaller-scale assessments, such as state and local assessments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Purposes of Large-Scale Assessments", "paragraphs": ["The primary purposes of large-scale assessments are to highlight achievement gaps, track national progress over time, compare student achievement within the United States, and compare U.S. academic performance to the performance of other countries. Unlike statewide assessments that evaluate schools and districts, large-scale assessment results generally cannot be connected to individual students, schools, or districts. Results are typically reported at the national or state levels.", "Results from large-scale assessment that are reported at the national or state levels are well suited for broad-based analyses of achievement gaps in the United States. The \"achievement gap\" refers to differences in educational performance across subgroups of U.S. students. The most commonly reported achievement gaps are those that highlight differences by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability status, and gender.", "Results reported at the national and state level are also well suited to track U.S. progress over time. Statewide assessments tend to change periodically depending on several factors, including changes in state and federal legislative requirements, in the assessments administered, and in the vendors that assist states with assessment development. By contrast, national and international assessments have remained relatively stable over time. Due to this stability, the results are easier to interpret from year to year because they are more of a direct comparison. Some national assessment programs date back to the 1960s and allow for a broader view of educational progress than statewide assessments. ", "Results reported at the national level on international assessments are uniquely suited to compare U.S. academic performance to the performance of other countries. Statewide assessments and national assessments cannot be used for this purpose. The United States has participated in international assessments since the 1960s. Depending on the type of international assessment and year of administration, U.S. student performance has been compared to student performance in approximately 30 to 70 countries. Furthermore, some international assessments have been benchmarked against U.S. student performance in certain states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Participation", "paragraphs": ["Participation requirements for statewide, national, and international assessments differ. States are required by the ESEA to assess all students in statewide assessment programs, including students with disabilities and English Learners (ELs). In assessment terminology, states are required to assess the \"universe\" of students (i.e., all students) in statewide assessments.", "States that receive Title I-A ESEA funding (currently, all states) are also required to participate in biennial NAEP assessments of reading and mathematics for the 4 th and 8 th grades. In contrast to statewide assessments, however, states are required to administer national assessments to a subset of students. In assessment terminology, states assess a \"representative sample\" of students. Additionally, states may not be required to administer the assessments to certain students with disabilities and ELs if these students require an accommodation that is not permitted on the national assessments. Although states are required to participate in these assessments, individual participation of students remains voluntary.", "Unlike statewide assessments and the NAEP assessment, states are not required to participate in many national assessments and or any international assessments. Participation is voluntary at both the state and student levels. If a state agrees to participate, each international assessment has a different method for selecting students. Like national assessments, international assessments test a \"representative sample\" of students. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Score Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Score reporting for large-scale and smaller-scale assessments has some noteworthy similarities and differences. Statewide, national, and international assessments can all report student achievement as scaled scores. A scaled score is a standardized score that exists among a common scale that can be used to make comparisons across students, across subgroups of students, and over time on a given assessment. ", "Educational assessment often reports scaled scores instead of raw scores or percent correct. There are several reasons that scaled scores are preferable. Large-scale assessment programs usually have multiple forms of the same test to control for student exposure to assessment items. As such, students take multiple forms of the same test. Although the multiple forms of the same assessment are similar, there are inevitably differences in difficulty of certain items across forms. By creating a scaled score, the scores of students or groups of students can be directly compared, even when different forms of varying difficulty were administered. ", "Although all these assessments use scaled scores, they all have a different scale. For example, some scales from national assessments are from 0-300 while scales from international assessments are typically 0-1000. Therefore, scaled scores are not directly comparable. When a scaled score is reported in isolation, it may be difficult to determine how well a student or group of students performed. To provide a context for grade-level or age-level expectations, large-scale assessments (and some smaller-scale assessments, such as the statewide assessments required by Title I-A of the ESEA) use performance standards. ", "A performance standard is an agreed upon definition of a certain level of performance in a content area that is expressed in terms of a cut score (i.e., basic, proficient, advanced) for a specific assessment. Although statewide, national, and international assessments use performance standards and may even use the same terminology (e.g., basic, proficient, advanced) to describe one or more of their performance standards, they do not use the same performance standards. For each assessment, there may be different cut scores and different definitions of each performance level. A student who is \"proficient\" on a statewide assessment may not be \"proficient\" on a national assessment and vice versa. In addition, within an individual assessment, the range of actual student performance within the \"proficient\" performance standard, for example, will include students whose assessment results are just high enough to be considered proficient as well as students whose assessment results almost put them into the next highest performance standard level (e.g., advanced). In this example, the \"proficient\" performance standard does not distinguish between a student who is just barely proficient and one who is nearly advanced. Both students would be considered to be proficient.", "International assessments usually report scores differently than statewide and national assessments. Although international assessments do report a scaled score and sometimes a performance standard, they have additional ways of reporting achievement. Performance on international assessments is also reported as a rank or as a score relative to an \"international average\" score. Rank and international average scores tend to change from one assessment administration to the next, depending on the countries that participate in the assessment. ", "Perhaps the most important distinction between statewide and large-scale assessments is the level of reporting. Statewide assessments are administered so that scores can be reported for individual students. Because statewide assessment programs test the universe of students and each student takes all the assessment items, each student has his or her own scaled score and performance standard level (e.g., basic, proficient, advanced). In large-scale assessments, a representative sample of students is tested, and each student may only take a portion of the assessment items. This type of sampling procedure allows scores to be reported for groups of students but not individual students. Large-scale assessments, therefore, report scores for groups of students with similar demographic characteristics, groups within a large district or state, or groups within a country."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Types of Large-Scale Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Large-scale assessments are standardized assessments that are administered nationwide or worldwide.

The main NAEP program consists of three subprograms: national NAEP, state NAEP, and the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA). The United States also participates in three major international assessments: the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).

In 1996, NAGB issued a policy statement to redesign the NAEP. The most noteworthy change was splitting the NAEP into two \"unconnected\" assessment programs. NAGB proposed a \"main NAEP\" program that would become the primary way to measure reading, mathematics, science and writing. NAGB recognized, however, that the nation's curricula would continue to change over time and there would still be value in tracking long-term trends with a stable assessment. NAGB, therefore, proposed the LTT NAEP assessment would be continued, though less frequently, to track trends over time. The main NAEP assessment framework was expected to change about every decade to account for changes in the nation's curricula while the LTT NAEP assessment framework was set to be stable over time.", "Another noteworthy change of the 1996 policy statement was the development of performance standards for the main NAEP. Although the original NAEP had numeric performance levels (i.e., 150, 200, 250, 300, 350), there were no descriptive performance standards associated with these levels (i.e., basic, proficient, and advanced). Performance standards were introduced with the administration of the main NAEP in 1990. The standards were subsequently amended several times over the next five years. In 1996, NAGB committed to improving the performance standards and recommended the continued use of performance standards. Because of this policy shift, the main NAEP and its subprograms continue to use basic, proficient, and advanced as their performance levels.", "The main NAEP has evolved over time and split into several subprograms: national, state, and TUDA.

In 1996, the state NAEP program was no longer considered a trial and it included 43 states and jurisdictions. In 2001, there was a significant change to the state NAEP program due to the reauthorization of the ESEA by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; P.L. 107-110 ). The NCLB required states that receive Title I-A funding to participate in biennial NAEP assessments of reading and mathematics in 4 th and 8 th grades, provided that the Secretary of Education pays for the testing. Although states receiving funding are required to participate, only a sample of schools, and a sample of students within those schools, are selected from each state to participate, creating a representative sample of students within each participating state. Participation is voluntary at the individual level. The assessments administered in the state NAEP program are exactly the same as the national NAEP assessments. The latest reauthorization of the ESEA retained the requirement that states receiving Title I-A funding to participate in these assessments. In 2017, the most recent administration of the main NAEP, 585,000 4 th and 8 th grade students participated.", "The TUDA program assesses four subject areas: reading, mathematics, writing, and science. The TUDA began in 2002 with six participating districts. Participation has grown with each administration, and in 2017, 27 districts voluntarily participated.

When average scores are presented in a rank order, however, the United States is ranked number 15. Four education systems above the United States and five education systems below the United States had average scores that were not statistically significantly different from the United States. Strictly ranking average scores does not account for statistically insignificant differences between average scores.", "Statistical significance is an important measure of whether a change is likely to be due to chance. Statistical significance, however, may not be the most important indicator of meaningful change. A statistically significant change in assessment score is a change that is unlikely to be due to chance. Statistical significance, however, is influenced by many factors. For the purposes of this discussion, the most relevant factor that influences statistical significance is sample size. The larger the sample size, the more likely a small change in assessment score will be statistically significant. Recall that national and international assessments sample tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of U.S. students. Due to large samples, small increases or decreases in academic achievement may be statistically significant. For example, in the most recent NAEP administration, a two-point increase in 8 th grade reading performance was statistically significant.", "Statistical significance is not the same as educational significance. Educational significance is subjective and dependent on the educational context of the results. Statistical significance cannot determine the magnitude of the difference and whether or not it is of educational significance. For example, as reported above in the NAEP results, there is a statistically significant gap of one point between male and female students in 8 th grade mathematics. There is also a statistically significant gap of 32 points between white and black students in 8 th grade mathematics. While both gaps are statistically significant, the gap between white and black students may have more educational significance. ", "Some researchers argue that statistical significance can be misleading for policy purposes because a statistically significant result may be too small to warrant a change in practices or policies. Educational significance is more subjective and difficult to define when considering assessment results.

When considered in isolation, this result may indicate that the mathematics achievement of 15-year-old U.S. students is declining. Consider, however, that 8 th grade U.S. students made statistically significant gains in mathematics on TIMSS from 2011 to 2015 and showed no change in mathematics on the NAEP from 2015 to 2017. While conflicting results like these can be frustrating, it is important to consider them together as a body of evidence instead of isolated data points. There may be valid reasons that U.S. students' performance decreased on PISA and increased on TIMSS. For example, as discussed above, TIMSS measures more \"school-based learning,\" and U.S. students have historically scored relatively higher on this assessment. Perhaps the content standards and curriculum in place in the United States are more aligned with content assessed by the TIMSS and less aligned with the content assessed by the PISA. ", "Another issue to consider is the trend over time. For example, although U.S. students' performance on PISA significantly decreased from 2009 to 2015, the 2015 score is not measurably different than the average scores in 2003 or 2006. While any significant decrease may be cause for concern, it is important to recognize that scores have not decreased significantly since the initial administration of the PISA. While a statistically insignificant change in achievement across 10 to 15 years may not be considered a positive result, the long-term trend presents a different picture of achievement than the short-term trend. Examining trends allow researchers and policymakers to identify policies and practices that were implemented at a certain time that may have contributed to an observed trend.", "In general, reports from a single assessment that claim U.S. student achievement has stagnated, increased, or decreased must be interpreted with caution.

There are three main issues to contemplate when considering making a comparison: the alignment of content standards, the scale, and the definition of performance standards.", "NAEP and statewide assessments overlap in the sense that both assessment programs measure mathematics and reading achievement. The assessment programs, however, use different frameworks to decide what mathematics and reading content will be measured. For NAEP, the NAGB determines what students know and should be able to do in various content areas based on the knowledge and experience of various stakeholders, such as content area experts, school administrators, policymakers, teachers, and parents. The content assessed by NAEP is not aligned to any particular content standards. The specific content measured by statewide assessments, however, is aligned with the state's content standards. Each state has a different process for determining its content standards for mathematics and reading, but, like NAEP, it also includes input from multiple stakeholders. ", "While it may not be feasible to study the content alignment between NAEP and all states' content standards, there was a recent alignment studies between NAEP and the common core state standards (CCSS). The study used an expert panel to study the alignment of NAEP and CCSS in 4 th and 8 th grade mathematics. The study found 79% alignment for 4 th grade students and 87% alignment for 8 th grade students, concluding that alignment between NAEP and CCSS was \"strong.\" Other investigations have examined the alignment of NAEP reading and writing frameworks and the CCSS English language arts standards, however, these examinations did not determine a degree of alignment. It is important to note that many states are not currently using the CCSS or are using a modified version of the CCSS. From the data presented here, it is not possible to determine how well the NAEP framework aligns with specific state content standards in mathematics and reading.", "Even if a \"strong\" alignment between NAEP frameworks and state content standards is assumed, there are other difficult issues to consider when making comparisons between the assessment results. For example, NAEP and statewide assessments use different scales. NAEP scaled scores for reading and mathematics are reported on a scale from 0-500. Statewide assessments use a scale that is specific to the assessment used in each state. For the purpose of illustration, consider three common assessments that are in place across some states: the ACT Aspire, the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), and the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC). The ACT Aspire uses a scale that typically reports achievement in the 400-500 range (grades 3-10). The PARCC scale scores range from 650 to 850 (grades 3-11). The SBAC scale scores range from 2114-2795 (grades 3-8, and 11 th grade). Clearly, given these different scales, a scaled score cannot be compared across NAEP and a statewide assessment. Furthermore, improvement in scaled scores cannot be directly compared. If a group of students improves 20 points on the 4 th grade NAEP reading assessment, it is not equivalent to a 20-point improvement on a statewide assessment, such as the PARCC or SBAC.", "If scaled scores cannot be compared, what about performance standards? A performance standard is a generally agreed upon definition of a certain level of performance in a content area that is expressed in terms of a cut score (e.g., basic, proficient, advanced) for a given assessment. There are no generally agreed upon performance standards that apply to both NAEP and state assessments, so performance standards cannot be compared across assessments. For example, as discussed earlier, NAEP defines performance standards as basic, proficient, and advanced . By contrast, PARCC and SBAC use levels as performance standards. For example, \"Level 4\" (out of 5) on the PARCC corresponds to \"met expectations.\" Although it seems similar, it is unlikely that \"met expectations\" on the PARCC represents the same level of achievement as \"proficient\" on the NAEP. Setting cut points for these levels requires a specific standard-setting process that is assessment-specific, so it is unlikely that meeting expectations on one assessment corresponds to the same level of performance as being proficient on another. ", "Perhaps even more difficult to reconcile may be when states and NAEP use the same performance standards terminology. For example, the state of Alaska uses four performance standards: Far Below Proficient, Below Proficient, Proficient, and Advanced. \"Proficient\" is defined as \"meets the standards at a proficient level, demonstrating knowledge and skills of current grade-level content.\" Unlike NAEP, the \"proficient\" definition does not necessarily include application of skills to real-world situations or analytical skills. Neither definition of \"proficient\" is correct or incorrect, but these definitions demonstrate the difficulty in comparing \"proficient\" performance standards of NAEP to those of state assessments.", "In an effort to examine how closely the performance standards of NAEP reflect those used in the states, NCES released an alignment study to map state performance standards onto the NAEP scale. This mapping study is not an evaluation of the quality of state performance standards or NAEP performance standards but rather is intended to give context to the discussion of comparing performance standards. The study found that most \"proficient\" state standards in 4 th and 8 th grade reading and mathematics mapped at the NAEP \"basic\" level. This finding reinforces the difficulty in comparing NAEP to statewide assessments. Since the \"proficient\" performance standard on many statewide assessments may be more comparable to the \"basic\" performance standard on NAEP, it may not be possible to make meaningful comparisons between state assessments and NAEP using performance standards. Given the difference in the meaning of \"proficient\" across assessments, the number of students \"proficient\" on NAEP will likely be lower than the number of students \"proficient\" on most state assessments. If fewer students score at the \"proficient\" performance standard on NAEP, it does not mean that either the NAEP or statewide assessment measured achievement correctly or incorrectly. Rather, the assessments used a different assessment framework and cut score to define the performance standard of \"proficient.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NAEP and International Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Both NAEP and international assessments measure reading and mathematics performance of students around 4 th and 8 th grade. For instance, NAEP, TIMSS, and PISA all measure mathematics performance for students around 8 th grade. NAEP and PIRLS both measure 4 th grade reading performance. NAEP and PISA both measure reading performance around 8 th grade. Comparing NAEP to international assessments requires considering some of the same issues as comparing NAEP to statewide assessments systems: the scale, the definition of performance standards, and the alignment between the assessments. There are also some additional considerations, including the different target populations, participating education systems, differences in voluntary student participation, and the precision of measurement.", "As previously discussed, NAEP and the international assessments use different scales and different performance standards to describe achievement. These types of results cannot be directly compared. Perhaps an even larger difference between NAEP and international assessments is their assessment framework. That is, the specific knowledge and skills being measured within a content area. If assessment frameworks are significantly different, the assessments are not closely aligned. While national and international assessments may appear to have significant similarities, each was designed for a different purpose and uses a unique framework to measure achievement. Differences in results across the assessments do not necessarily imply a problem with measuring achievement but rather may represent different types of achievement. ", "NCES has studied certain issues of alignment between NAEP, PISA, PIRLS, and TIMSS. In general, NAEP was developed with national interests in mind while the international assessments were developed in a collaborative process with other countries, reflecting a consensus view of content. In terms of alignment, the NAEP and TIMSS tend to focus on \"school-based learning.\" NAEP and TIMSS are organized similarly and measure skills such as \"knowing, applying, and reasoning.\" In mathematics, these two assessments are relatively well-aligned, but they are less well-aligned in science. PISA differs from NAEP and TIMSS in that it measures real-world learning, so it draws not only from school curricula but also learning that occurs outside of school. PISA measures mathematics skills that focus on \"reproduction, connections, and reflection.\" In terms of reading alignment, the NAEP focuses more on school-based learning while PIRLS and PISA focus more on the context of reading and purposes for reading. There is potential overlap and potential differences in terms of the skills and abilities being assessed.", "In terms of target population, the NAEP, TIMSS, and PIRLS sample by grade. NAEP and TIMSS both sample students in 4 th and 8 th grade, which means the ages sampled are comparable. Likewise, PIRLS samples the equivalent 4 th grade students, which is comparable to NAEP 4 th grade students. PISA, however, samples by age. In the United States, most 15-year-old students selected for PISA are in 10 th or 11 th grades. Comparisons to younger 8 th grade students on NAEP may be less appropriate.", "Different assessments have different participating education systems. An education system is typically a country but can also include a sub-national jurisdiction, such as a province, state, or large city. For example, the United States participates in PISA, and Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico also participate as separate jurisdictions. Similarly, the United States participates in PIRLS, and Florida also participates as a separate jurisdiction. Across education systems (i.e., countries and sub-national jurisdictions), there are different types of governance. Many countries have a more centralized education administration than the United States. The implications for results may differ depending on the governance of the education system. For example, while some countries can use the results of international assessments to change policies across the board, less centralized education systems may be unable to implement unilateral, system-wide changes.", "International assessments also differ in how they treat the scores of sub-national jurisdictions. The international average score for PISA is based only on OECD countries' scores while the international average in PIRLS is based on all participating countries and jurisdictions. Thus, across assessments and administrations, international averages are based on different sets of countries, making comparisons across time more difficult. Further complicating this issue is the fact that in each administration of an international assessment, participating countries and sub-national jurisdictions can change. The average from year to year depends on which education systems participate in a particular administration.", "National and international assessments remain voluntary at the individual student level. If the group of students that choose not to participate are different than students who choose to participate, it can lead to a non-representative sample of participating students. If a non-representative sample is assessed, it can lead to selection bias in the results. On the NAEP, students with disabilities and English learners can be excluded if students require an accommodation that is not permitted by the NAEP. It is possible that if many students with disabilities or ELs are excluded, the sample would not include enough of these students to be representative of the population. Typically, large-scale assessments analyze the sample for selection bias. ED provides exclusion data for students with disabilities and ELs by state for the NAEP. Exclusion rates by state vary. For example, in 2011 for 8 th grade mathematics, state exclusion rates for students with disabilities and ELs ranged from 4% to 56%. ED also provides exclusion rates for education systems participating in the TIMSS. For example, in 2011, education system exclusion rates ranged from 0% to 23%. High exclusion rates may lead to selection bias and unreliable results that do not represent the achievement of the state or education system. Comparisons between states or education systems with high exclusion rates may be inaccurate because they may compare the achievement of a representative sample to the achievement of an unrepresentative sample.", "National and international assessments differ in how precisely they can measure student achievement. The precision of measurement depends largely on the sample size. The more students that participate in an assessment, the more likely it will be to detect significant small changes in performance or performance over time. International assessments tend to sample anywhere from approximately 5,000 to 25,000 U.S. students per administration. NAEP, on the other hand, samples hundreds of thousands of students. NAEP, therefore, can measure student performance with more precision. Furthermore, NAEP is better suited than international assessments to measure subgroups of students due to the sampling design and overall size of the sample. Because of the differences in the precision of measurement, students may make progress on a NAEP assessment but not on an international assessment. In this case, it is possible that the international assessment did not sample enough students to detect a statistically significant increase in student performance. Similarly, NAEP results may show that an achievement gap is getting bigger or smaller, but this result may not be duplicated by international assessments. International assessments may not have a large enough sample from minority groups to detect the same size of change in achievement gap as the NAEP.", "Given the difficulty of making comparisons, it is not surprising that there may be differences in results for a given year or over time among the assessments. Each assessment was developed for its own purpose and is administered in its own way, and each may present a different side of U.S. students' achievement. For example, TIMSS results may highlight how U.S. students perform on measures of school-based learning and PISA results may highlight how U.S. students perform on measures of real-world applications of learning. The fact that U.S. students perform relatively better on TIMSS than on PISA does not mean that either result is wrong but that they are measuring different skills.

The results, however, may not be particularly helpful in identifying policies that may increase student achievement or aid the United States in meeting other educational goals, such as increasing high school graduation rates. For example, U.S. students' achievement has significantly decreased over the last two administrations of PISA. A decrease in achievement could represent an actual decrease in student achievement. On the other hand, a decrease in achievement could be indicative of curricula that are misaligned with the test, teaching and learning practices in the U.S. that are different than what PISA requires, or even a lack of student engagement in the testing process. With the numerous possibilities to explain student achievement, it may be unclear how policymakers should begin to address a decrease in achievement.", "One way policymakers may consider addressing a decrease in achievement is to adopt policies and practices from countries that consistently score well on international assessments. This approach raises myriad questions. For example, is it in the best interest of the United States and its students to adopt the educational policies of countries that may be quite different than the United States? Other countries may differ from the United States in many ways, including with respect to their student populations, levels and distribution of education funding, policies regarding the tracking of students by academic ability, secondary school and university enrollment rates, and the quality of educator provided to subgroups of students (e.g., low-income students, English learners, students with disabilities, minority students). And if it is determined that adopting the policies of another country is the best course of action, the feasibility of adopting such policies must be addressed, including whether educational policies are generalizable across countries and whether the will and capacity to make needed changes exists. In addition, just as academic achievement in the United States has changed over time, the same is true for other countries. For example, earlier in the 21 st century, Finland was a top performer on PISA and viewed as a country having policies worthy of emulation. However, in both the 2012 and 2015 administrations of the PISA, Finland has seen its performance in science, math, and reading decline. This raises questions about what would have happened if the United States had focused on mirroring Finland's policies in the hopes of achieving Finland's top level of performance. ", "The example of Finland above highlights an important characteristic of international assessments \u2013 these assessments provide a snapshot of achievement, but they do not evaluate policies and practices within or across countries. The PISA did not evaluate the effectiveness of any policies or practices in place in Finland. The decline in achievement seen in Finland in the 2012 and 2015 PISA assessments may have been due to a specific policy or practice or it may have been due to factors outside of education (e.g., economic health, political climate, changing demographics, etc.). In the 1990s and early 2000s, PISA was not able to provide information on why students in Finland were high achieving, and currently, PISA is not able to provide information on why the achievement of students in Finland has declined. None of the international assessments provides data on the factors that may explain student achievement.", "Even if it is possible to identify an education policy that would increase U.S. student achievement on national and international assessments, there may be barriers to implementing that policy. Compared to many other countries that participate in international assessments, the United States has a decentralized education system that primarily reserves the power to make education policy decisions for state and local authorities. State and local authorities already rely upon state and local assessments to evaluate students, schools, and districts. While the results of national and international assessments may, in some cases, highlight a problem, the assessment results may not offer a policy solution for states. By contrast, state and local assessments are aligned with state content and performance standards, which possibly make them better suited than national and international assessments to address any perceived problems in teaching and learning at the state level. For example, if student performance is trending downward in reading on a statewide assessment, state and local authorities may choose new curricula, allocate more teaching time to reading, or provide funding for reading specialists. If student performance is trending downward in reading on an international assessment, state and local authorities cannot determine whether the score is low because student achievement is actually declining or if the test is not aligned with their content standards, curricula, or teaching practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Achievement on Economic Prosperity", "paragraphs": ["There is considerable debate about the impact of student achievement on a country's economic prosperity. Several analyses have tried to link performance on international assessments to various indicators of national wealth and prosperity. One analysis of the relationship between international test scores and \"national success\" that garnered attention was presented in 2007 by Keith Baker, a former researcher at ED. Baker used scores from 11 countries that participated in the First International Mathematics Study (FIMS) in 1964 to predict seven indicators of national success 30 years later: wealth, rate of growth, productivity, quality of life, livability, democracy, and creativity. For almost all indicators, there was no relationship or a negative relationship between scores on FIMS and national success. That is, as scores on international assessments increased, the wealth, rate of growth, etc. of a nation decreased or remained the same. Increases in achievement, therefore, were associated with decreases in indicators of national success. The one exception was the indicator of creativity (as measured by the number of patents issued). As international test scores increased, the creativity indicator also increased. ", "Baker also analyzed the relationship between PISA and national success indicators. Results showed that nations at the PISA average generally outperformed other nations scoring well above or well below average. Based on these findings, Baker concluded that there may be some baseline level of achievement that is important for national success; however, once that baseline has been reached, focusing on increasing test scores may divert time and resources away from other factors that may contribute to national success.", "Another analysis that garnered attention was conducted by Eric Hanushek and Ludgar Woessmann and published by the OECD. Their analysis used economic modeling to predict the impact of achievement on international assessments on economic growth. The model used growth in PISA scores over time to project growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in selected countries. The results indicate that if all OECD countries increased their average PISA scores by 25 points over the next 20 years, the aggregate gain of OECD GDP over 80 years would be approximately $115 trillion. Furthermore, if all countries performed at a level of minimal proficiency for the OECD, the aggregate GDP would increase $200 trillion. ", "Without a clearer picture of how performance on international assessments contributes to a country's economic prosperity, it may be difficult to decide whether attempting to increase international test scores for this purpose would be a worthwhile education policy goal. Given limited time and resources, policymakers may choose to focus efforts on other factors that contribute to educational achievement and economic prosperity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Thoughts", "paragraphs": ["Given the overwhelming amount of data gathered by national and international assessments, it is difficult to comb through all of the results and gain a clear picture of the achievement of U.S. students over time and relative to other countries. Perhaps even more difficult is understanding the policies and practices that drive performance on these assessments. For example, in the last decade, two Secretaries of Education have expressed concern over U.S. performance on the PISA and called for different reforms to address the problem. In 2010, Secretary Arne Duncan used U.S. performance on the PISA to argue for advancing the education policy goals of the Obama Administration, most notably changes to teacher recruitment, teacher evaluation, and the compensation of highly effective teachers. He argued that the OECD found that most high-achieving countries in PISA have policies that mirror the Obama Administration's focus on highly effective teachers. By contrast, Secretary Betsy DeVos used U.S. performance on PISA to argue for advancing the education policy goals of the Trump Administration, most notably school choice. She argued that countries that outperform the United States on PISA have more quickly adopted school choice policies. Clearly, education leaders have been concerned about the performance of U.S. students on international assessments; however, the data from the assessments do not point to either a conclusive policy problem or solution.", "Both NAEP and international large-scale assessments provide the United States with comparative data about student achievement that is not available through assessments administered only at the state and local level. Having these data to examine student performance at a given moment in time and over the long term can be used in many ways, including as a check to confirm or contradict what data from state and local assessments indicate about student performance. ", "While NAEP is developed and implemented solely in the United States, the results of the assessments may have limited value in identifying particular policies or practices that are and are not working for U.S. students. Since NAEP is not aligned with any particular state's standards or curricula, it cannot provide direct feedback on how well students within a state are achieving the state's standards. Although, NAEP results do provide states with an opportunity to benchmark themselves against other states that operate in the same decentralized system of educational control. International large-scale assessments also offer benchmarking and like NAEP may be less useful with respect to determining which policies and practices are contributing to student success and whether those policies and practices could be successfully implemented in locales within the United States. Thus, while national and international assessments may provide valuable data, the data do not easily translate into effective education policies. The results, therefore, may be more useful in identifying areas in need of attention or resources and may have limited utility for shaping education policy approaches.", "Appendix A.
