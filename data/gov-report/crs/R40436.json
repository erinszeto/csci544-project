The issue of which areas should be defined as \"underserved\" with respect to broadband service has long been controversial. There is no generally accepted definition of \"underserved.\" Factors such as a minimal number of existing providers, a lack of adequate market competition, unaffordable consumer prices for existing broadband service, or substandard download and upload available speeds may singularly or in combination lead some to define an area as \"underserved.\" The definition of \"unserved\" is also not uniformly accepted. For example, should unserved be defined only as an area with no terrestrial (nonsatellite) broadband service, or should areas with some terrestrial but no mobile wireless service also be considered \"unserved?\"", "The ARRA does not define either \"unserved\" or \"underserved.\" The law directs NTIA to consider whether a grant application would increase broadband affordability and subscribership, and provide the greatest broadband speeds possible to the greatest population of users in the area served. The ARRA directs NTIA to consult with the states (plus the District of Columbia and the territories) to identify unserved and underserved areas within that state. The Conferees instructed NTIA to coordinate its understanding of the terms \"unserved area\" and \"underserved area\" with the FCC. ", "In approaching an understanding of these terms, the NTIA (and the states with which the NTIA will consult on this issue) must balance competing policy concerns, particularly when developing or embracing a definition of \"underserved.\" For example, too narrow a definition may make it more difficult for rural areas in need of adequate broadband service to receive grants. On the other hand, too broad a definition of \"underserved\" may inappropriately confront existing broadband providers with government-funded competitors and may divert funding from projects in unserved areas with no broadband service whatsoever. ", "In the first NOFA, both BTOP and BIP use identical definitions of \"unserved\" and \"underserved.\" \"Unserved\" includes areas with a very small number of households served by terrestrial (non-satellite) broadband (10% or less). RUS and NTIA stated their belief that \"a definition requiring that 100 percent of households lack access to broadband service could prove overly restrictive and risk inadvertently excluding populations,\" and that \"establishing a 90 percent threshold acknowledges that a de minimis level of broadband service may exist in portions of the area, while also seeking to minimize the risk of unintentionally excluding an entire area from funding.\"", "RUS also designated separate categories of \"remote\" and \"non-remote\" areas.

For last mile projects, only remote unserved rural areas are eligible for BIP grants.", "The first NOFA's definition of \"underserved\" encompasses not only relatively low broadband availability (no more than 50%), but also low adoption (40% or less) and the lack of available higher-end advertised broadband speeds (3 Mbps or more). NTIA and RUS pointed out that the underserved definition \"includes a broadband speed criterion to recognize that a proposed funded service area can have the minimum level of broadband service available (defined as 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream), but still be considered 'underserved.'\" NTIA and RUS declined to define \"underserved\" in terms of pricing, median income, or demographic characteristics, arguing that the broadband adoption threshold would encompass those factors.", "In the second BTOP NOFA, the definitions of unserved and underserved are unchanged; however the application of these definitions has shifted from project eligibility criteria to project evaluation criteria. NTIA has removed the requirement that infrastructure projects connecting community anchor institutions, including community colleges, must be located in unserved or underserved areas. Comprehensive Community Infrastructure projects are eligible if they meet only three criteria: eligible entities, a fully completed application, and the 20% or more nonfederal match. However, to the extent that a project serves an area that is unserved or underserved, that project will receive more points during the evaluation and may have a greater chance of being funded.", "In the second BIP NOFA, the concept of \"underserved\" has been largely removed. Instead, eligible project service areas are those that do not have High Speed Access broadband service (defined as 5 Mbps, upstream and downstream combined) in at least 50% of its area. The definition of \"unserved\" has been changed to signify a service area with no access to facilities-based, terrestrial broadband service, either fixed or mobile, at the minimum broadband transmission speed.

The ARRA broadband provisions do not specify minimum download/upload speed thresholds, are technology neutral, and cite a wide variety of applications eligible for funding. ", "The issue of speed thresholds is particularly controversial. While a high speed threshold has the benefit of encouraging the construction of next generation networks (such as fiber or next generation cable systems), it also runs the risk of excluding current generation technologies that may be uniquely suitable for some unserved or underserved areas. The Conferees acknowledged this dilemma, stating in the Conference Report that while speed thresholds could have the unintended effect of thwarting broadband deployment in some areas, deploying next-generation speeds would likely result in greater job creation and job preservation. The Conferees instructed NTIA to \"seek to fund, to the extent practicable, projects that provide the highest possible, next-generation broadband speeds to consumers.\" Thus, NTIA has the flexibility to balance the sometimes competing goals of constructing next generation networks with providing broadband to unserved and underserved areas.", "In the NOFA, RUS and NTIA concluded that \"broadband service\" should be defined as the provision of two-way data transmission with advertised speeds of at least 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end users. RUS and NTIA favor this broadband speed threshold because it conforms with the established FCC standard for minimum broadband speed, allows the use of currently common broadband applications, allows for consideration of cost-effective solutions for difficult-to-serve areas, and is the most technology-neutral option because it encompasses all major wired and wireless technologies. In evaluating applications, RUS and NTIA intend to provide additional consideration to applications exceeding the minimum speed threshold or offering superior upgradeability.

The ARRA directed NTIA, in coordination with the FCC, to publish \"non-discrimination and network interconnection obligations that shall be contractual conditions of grants awarded.\" The ARRA says that these obligations, at a minimum, should adhere to the principles contained in the FCC's broadband policy statement (FCC 05-15, adopted August 5, 2005) as follows:", "To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice.", "To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement.", "To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network.", "To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers.

States are encouraged to coalesce stakeholders and partners, assess community needs, aggregate demand for services, and evaluate demand for technical assistance. The Conferees therefore expect and intend that the NTIA, at its discretion, will seek advice and assistance from the States in reviewing grant applications, as long as the NTIA retains the sole authority to approve the awards.
