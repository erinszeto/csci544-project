Financed with $200 billion in initial capital, the CIC is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in the world.", "The creation of CIC was somewhat controversial in China. Both the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reportedly wanted the CIC under their authority. In the end, the CIC reports directly to China's ruling State Council. However, as part of the interagency struggle, it was decided that the CIC would have to make significant purchases in several state-owned banks, as well as purchase the Central Huijin Investment Corporation (CHIC) from the PBOC.", "Although some of the CIC's initial investments were apparently political in nature, the CIC's top management have repeatedly asserted that future investments will be commercially based. The CIC and its subsidiaries have made several investments, including the purchase of 9.9% of the U.S. financial firm, Morgan Stanley, on December 19, 2007. Meanwhile other government-owned entities in China\u2014including the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)\u2014have started to act like sovereign wealth funds and have been making sizable overseas investments.", "According to top Chinese officials, the CIC was created to improve the rate of return on China's foreign exchange reserves and to prevent the nation's excess financial liquidity from contributing to domestic inflation. Depending on its performance, the CIC may be allocated more of China's growing stock of foreign exchange reserves in the future. However, its first-year results have raised questions about its investment strategy and calls for administrative reforms for CIC.", "A number of experts in international finance have expressed some concern about the recent growth in SWFs and China's creation of the CIC. Analysts have cautioned that major shifts in SWF investments could potentially disrupt global financial markets and harm the U.S. economy. Other experts are less concerned about SWFs and the CIC, and welcome their participation in international investment markets. China has responded by maintaining that the CIC will prove to be a source of market stability. China has also stated that it has no intention of using its SWF to disrupt the U.S. economy or global financial markets.", "There have been calls for greater oversight and regulation of the activities of SWFs. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in consultation with many of the leading SWFs, has developed a set of voluntary \"Generally Accepted Principles and Practices\" (GAPP) for the operation of SWFs. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has drafted policy guidelines for countries that are recipients of SWF investments. Some international financial experts have suggested elements to be included in such guidelines, including standards for transparency, governance, and reciprocity. Other experts have suggested that the United States should review its current laws and regulations governing foreign investments in the United States, and possibly implement special procedures or restrictions on proposed investments by SWFs. These include financial reporting requirements, limits on SWF ownership of U.S. companies, restrictions on the types of equity investments SWFs can make in U.S. companies, and special tax provisions for SWFs. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["China announced in March 2007 that it would create a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) to invest its accumulated foreign exchange reserves more profitably. In May 2007, China Jianyin Investment Company, a government agency that was designated to manage any asset purchases until the SWF was set up, bought a nearly 10% non-voting stake in Blackstone Group, a U.S. private equity firm for $3 billion. After a few delays, China's new sovereign wealth fund\u2014the China Investment Corporation (CIC)\u2014officially started operations on September 29, 2007.", "The CIC has proven to be of interest to Congress for several reasons. First, some observers are concerned that its investment activities might have adverse effects on certain financial markets and possibly the U.S. economy. Second, its creation signals China's intention to diversify its foreign exchange holdings away from U.S. government securities into other forms of investment. Third, specific proposed investments by the CIC may raise national security concerns. Fourth, some see the possibility that China could use the CIC as a mechanism to pursue geopolitical objectives.", "With an initial capital fund of $200 billion, the CIC was a significant new addition to the existing pool of SWFs (see Table 1 ). The CIC augmented the $2 - $3 trillion under management by SWFs worldwide. In addition, the SWF provides China with another avenue by which it can invest its growing foreign exchange reserves, which totaled $1.9 trillion as of December 2008. Also, the conversion of the foreign exchange reserves into capital for the CIC may help \"sterilize\" some of the excess financial liquidity in China that is reportedly contributing to China's recent inflationary pressures.", "However, China's decision to create the CIC reawakened some concerns about the impact of SWFs on global financial markets and engendered new misgivings about China's involvement in international equity markets. David R. Francis, columnist for the Christian Science Monitor , started his November 26, 2007 article, \"Will Sovereign Wealth Funds Rule the World?,\" with the words, \"Sovereign wealth funds are huge, scarily big.\" During a November 30, 2007 interview on National Public Radio's Morning Edition , Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations stated, \"The rise of sovereign wealth funds represents a shift in power from the U.S. to a group of countries that aren't transparent, aren't democracies, and aren't necessarily U.S. allies.\" In June 2007, Clay Lowery, the U.S. Treasury Department's acting undersecretary for international affairs, indicated in an interview that the rise in government-owned investment funds could cause major changes in global markets and bring about \"financial protectionism.\"", "There are also concerns about how China (and other nations) will invest the capital of their SWFs. Before the creation of the CIC, China had invested much of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. government debt, such a U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills), that were relatively risk-free, but offered relatively low rates of return on the investment. Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), indicated in a recent interview, \"Countries like China just don't need to hold any more T-bills. There's just no point.\"", "For the first half of 2008, most analysts expected the CIC to invest in overseas equities and/or acquisitions in order to obtain higher rates of return on their investments. One financial expert's analysis of China's foreign exchange reserve holdings from 2000 to 2007 shows a slight shift away from U.S. dollar denominated assets. However, as the effects of the U.S. financial crisis spread across the U.S. economy and then around the world, the CIC's interest in overseas investments seemingly waned.", "With its current capital stock, the CIC has the theoretical ability to purchase controlling interests in or acquire major corporations, raising potential national security concerns. According to financial journalist James Surowiecki, \"Were China so inclined, it could buy Ford, G.M., Volkswagen, and Honda, and still have a little money left over for ice cream.\" Surowiecki's observation was echoed by well-known investor Warren Buffett, who added that the annual U.S. trade deficit of approximately $700 billion means the United States has to \"give away a little part of the country\" every year. Buffet continued by auguring that if these trade deficits continue the United States could wind up as a \"sharecropper economy,\" in which U.S. citizens largely work for foreign-owned firms. In the opinion of former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox, \"the fundamental question presented by state-owned public companies and sovereign wealth funds does not so much concern the advisability of foreign ownership, but rather of government ownership.\"", "However, others are less apprehensive about the potential impact of SWFs on the global economy. Rogoff thinks SWFs will do \"more good than bad.\" Surowiecki maintains that \"some of the worries about the dangers posed by sovereign wealth funds are overstated,\" and that the SWFs \"will act much like other investors, and focus primarily on the bottom line.\" Preston Keat of the global risk consulting firm Eurasia Group echoes Surowiecki's assessment, pointing out, \"It's a context of mutual dependence. Blowing somebody else up does you at least as much financial damage.\"", "The investment activities of several SWFs\u2014including the CIC\u2014following the outbreak of the subprime-mortgage crisis in August 2007 lent support the views of Rogoff, Surowiecki and Keat. Some struggling financial firms received much needed injections of capital from SWFs. On December 19, 2007, CIC invested $5 billion in Morgan Stanley not long after the financial firm announced it was writing off $9.4 billion of loss-making mortgage investments. On January 15, 2008, SWFs from Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Singapore, and South Korea provided a $21 billion infusion of capital to Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. During a period of global market uncertainty, SWFs appeared to be providing a source of stability.", "However, as the ripple effects of the financial crisis spread during the summer of 2008, the CIC and other SWFs seemed reluctant to take on additional ailing financial houses, indicating a possible limit to the willingness of SWFs to play the roles of financial rescuers and suppliers of market stability. While news accounts in June 2008 reported that China's sovereign wealth fund was preparing to go on a \"global spending spree,\" by December 2008, CIC was stating it was in \"no hurry to invest overseas.\" At the end of 2008, a senior CIC official offered his view of China's role in solving the global financial crisis, \"China can't save the world. It can only save itself.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Structure of the China Investment Corporation", "paragraphs": ["The China Investment Corporation, Ltd.

In other cases, Chinese and CIC officials refuse to comment on investments reported by generally reputable media sources. While this pattern demonstrates some relative transparency about CIC activities, it also indicates an apparent reluctance to be completely forthcoming about the details of the CIC's investments.

Then, in August 2008, it was reported that CIC's capital injection into ABC was to be reduced to $20 billion, to free up more funds for overseas investments. Two months later, the ABC reportedly signed an agreement with the CHIC in which it was to receive a capital injection of 130 billion yuan ($19 billion) in preparation for an eventual stock listing. According to the ABC's vice president, the CHIC's investment in the bank would result in it holding half of the bank's equity, with the other half owned by the Ministry of Finance.

If the net inflow of foreign exchange was not \"sterilized,\" the excess liquidity in China's money supply would have contributed to domestic inflation or a speculative bubble in China's domestic asset markets (principally the real estate and stock markets).", "Prior to the creation of the CIC, China had been absorbing some of the excess foreign exchange by issuing government bonds, and then purchasing foreign government debt\u2014much of it U.S. Treasury bills\u2014with the accumulated foreign exchange.

Ervin also stated that the OECD thinks that members should strive to keep their definitions of national security as narrow as possible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The 110 th Congress took action regarding the monitoring and regulation of foreign investment in the United States. The \"Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007\" ( P.L. 110-49 ) requires that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) investigate any foreign investment transaction (including mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers) which results in \"foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States\" or if the transaction would result in foreign control of \"critical infrastructure that could impair the national security.\" The new law also adds new criteria for CFIUS to use when determining if an investigation is warranted, including whether the transaction is a \"foreign government-controlled transaction.\" In addition, P.L. 110-49 increases congressional oversight of CFIUS by requiring more detailed reports on its operations and the results of its investigations. However, the authority to suspend or prohibit foreign investments in the United States remains with the President.", "Even with the passage of P.L. 110-49 , some Members of the 110 th Congress were concerned that the new law may not sufficiently protect the United States from the risks posed by the emerging SWFs. In a February 2008 letter to their fellow Senate Banking Committee members, Chairman Christopher Dodd and Ranking Member Richard Shelby indicated their willingness to consider appropriate legislation. In an editorial opinion published in the Wall Street Journal , Senator Evan Bayh wrote, \"... China's drive for economic advantage\u2014including rampant intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and subsidies for manufacture and export\u2014raise serious concerns about how sovereign wealth funds might be used.\" Senator Bayh also suggests that the CFIUS 10% review threshold may not be a sufficient standard, and calls for the United States to implement a \"passive investment\" requirement on SWF investments.", "Some commentators maintain that while P.L. 110-49 effectively dealt with the national security risks posed by foreign investments, it did not adequately mitigate against the economic security risks . In his November 14, 2007 testimony before Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Edwin M. Truman mentioned that \"some observers\" are concerned about the stability implications for the U.S. economy and financial systems of SWF investments in \"private equity firms, hedge funds, and regulated financial institutions.\" There have been suggestions that the United States should prohibit a SWF from investing in the United States unless its home nation meets certain criteria, such as those proposed by Truman and Garten.", "On September 5, 2007, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 552 (110 th Congress) by a vote of 401 to 4, which included a reciprocity requirement that \"United States financial service regulators, in assessing whether applications from Chinese financial institutions meet comprehensive consolidated supervision standards, should consider whether the applications are for operations and activities in the United States that are currently prohibited for United States financial institutions in China ...\" However, others warn that such restrictions could lead to a wave of financial protectionism that would cause undue damage to the U.S. economy.", "Since the creation of the CIC, Congressional committees have held several hearings the SWFs in general.

President Bush reportedly said that he was \"fine\" with foreign investors buying shareholdings in U.S. banks and financial firms. U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs David McCormick commented the investments of SWFs have \"largely been long-term, very commercially focused, and very stable,\" but also indicated that more transparency and governance was needed. To that end, the Bush administration pushed the IMF to develop a system of best practices for SWFs.", "There have been no direct policy statements from the Obama administration on sovereign wealth funds or the CIC. As a presidential candidate, President Obama stated, \"I am concerned if these \u2026 sovereign wealth funds are motivated by more than just market considerations, and that's obviously a possibility.\"", "As previously mentioned, P.L. 110-49 broadened the investigatory authority of CFIUS in cases of national security risk, and increased the committee's reporting requirements to Congress. However, there have been suggestions that the recent changes do not adequately protect the United States from economic risks posed by SWFs. These potential economic risks are seen as including financial market instability, undesirable foreign control or influence over key industries or companies, access to sensitive technology, and other forms of unfair competitive advantages. Among the regulatory changes being suggested are:", "Requirements that any SWF interested in investing in the United States publicly release audited financial statements that follow international accounting standards on a regular basis; Restrictions on the percentage of a U.S. company an SWF may own\u2014other nations have such limits; for example, Hong Kong authorities have said they may withdraw the authority of Standard Chartered Bank to issue Hong Kong currency if the share of its stock owned by a Singaporean SWF exceeds 20%; Restrictions on the type of investment SWFs may make in U.S. companies\u2014alternatives include restricting SWFs to the purchase of nonvoting shares, banning SWFs from negotiating a seat on the company's board of directors or representation in the company's senior management; and Changes in U.S. tax code\u2014under current U.S. law, the profits of SWFs are generally tax-exempt; it has been suggested that the tax-exemption for SWFs be eliminated or restricted.", "In addition, there have been suggestions that access to U.S. financial markets should be contingent on the successful conclusion of a reciprocity agreement that would allow U.S. banks and financial institutions comparable access to the other nation's investment and financial markets.", "However, some commentators are concerned that increasing the regulatory constraints on SWFs will precipitate a period of global financial protectionism. In addition, China might respond to additional restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States by restricting U.S. companies' access to China's financial markets. The issue is whether the value of protection obtained outweighs the forgone benefits of investments prevented in more restrictive global and/or Chinese financial markets."], "subsections": []}]}}
