Drawing upon this power, upon its plenary authority with respect to foreign relations and international commerce, and upon the inherent power of a sovereign to close its borders, Congress has developed a complex scheme governing admission to our Nation and status within our borders.\" Further, the Fourteenth Amendment defines citizens as \"[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\" Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1, cl. 1. Although some legal scholars have argued that the phrase \"uniform Rule of Naturalization\" precludes Congress from enacting legislation granting relief to a specific individual, the courts have interpreted the phrase as simply requiring geographic uniformity throughout the States, meaning that Congress cannot enact legislation applying different rules to different States. The constitutional basis for private immigration bills generally is found in the First Amendment prohibition against Congressional enactments abridging the right of the People \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\" (Amend. I, cl. 3.) and in the power of Congress to pay the debts of the United States (Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1).

Private bills are intended to be a last resort for relief after all administrative and judicial remedies are exhausted. Aside from the individual relief granted, the number and type of private bills introduced and of private laws enacted often revealed flaws in the public laws which led to amendments to resolve such problems.

Generally, it appears that most of these laws did not grant citizenship outright, but instead they waived the application of certain requirements, which would either have barred the naturalization of a certain individual or would have presented a hardship to the individual by prolonging the naturalization process, such as residence requirements. Cases where it appears citizenship may have been granted outright generally involved either (1) women who had lost their citizenship through marriage to a foreigner and a move abroad under now obsolete laws and who sought to regain their citizenship upon being widowed or divorced and moving back to the United States; (2) children born abroad to U.S. citizens who had moved back to and resided in the United States, who mistakenly believed they were U.S. citizens, and subsequently discovered that they were not citizens, in some cases after years in the United States, including military service; or (3) persons who, while born U.S. citizens, had lost citizenship because of retention requirements under now-obsolete laws and sought to regain citizenship.", "In the 1970s, a series of corruption scandals such as Abscam, involving payoffs for the sponsorship of private immigration laws, culminated in the expulsion of one Member of the House of Representatives and led to a decline in private immigration laws, which were perceived as tainted in general by the scandals. In the past decade, the trend reached a low point with only 2 private immigration laws enacted in the 104 th Congress. The late 1990s, after the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), saw a brief increase in the number of private laws, with a decline in the wake of 9/11.

Despite the efforts of relatives petitioning for them, errors or delays on the part of the agencies responsible for processing petitions rendered the beneficiaries ineligible for an immigrant visa or adjustment to permanent resident status. The two most common circumstances that can be generalized into categories appear to be errors or delays that result (1) in an orphan adoptee aging out before the adoption and the immigrant petition or permanent resident adjustment can be completed and (2) in a conditional permanent resident petition for an alien spouse not being approved before the untimely death of a U.S. citizen spouse.", "In the orphan adoption cases, a frequent circumstance appears to be the efforts of U.S. citizens to adopt older children whose deceased parents or guardians were friends or extended family of the petitioners. Historically, the precedents regarding juveniles generally concern the natural or adopted children of U.S. citizen parents who for various reasons fell in the gaps in the public law and thus needed special dispensation to emigrate immediately to rejoin the U.S. citizen parent(s) or legal guardian(s). The justification for such expeditious treatment would be family reunification, one of the fundamental policies behind U.S. immigration and nationality laws. In certain cases, beneficiaries came to the United States as very young children but reached adulthood without obtaining LPR status because of the errors or deaths of their parents or guardians. Often, minor siblings dependent on the beneficiary are either U.S. citizens or are still eligible for administrative or judicial relief and family unification again is a factor in granting private law relief.", "The faultless actions of the beneficiary and the bureaucratic delays combined with other hardships or sympathy resulting from the death of an immediate relative who was a U.S. citizen or LPR seem to be the most common factors. Generally, the relative had a pending petition for an immigrant visa/adjustment of status for the beneficiary of the private bill, but the petition expired due to the death of the petitioning relative. Typically, the beneficiary had no other avenue for immigration or adjustment of status, has strong ties to other family members in the United States and no remaining familial ties to his/her native country. Despite having other close relatives in the United States, those relatives may be minor U.S. citizen children who are not yet old enough to petition for the beneficiary, or may be relatives who do not have a degree of relation close enough to petition for the beneficiary, such as the parents of a deceased spouse. In certain cases, special circumstances raise a case out of the ordinary, such as the death, arising out of a hate crime in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, of a person petitioning for family members or the death of a foreign national employed abroad by the U.S. Government whose dedication to his job could have cost his family the opportunity to emigrate to the United States.", "Certain cases appear to have had unique circumstances of particular national foreign-policy interest. These include the high-profile human rights activist Wei Jingsheng. His case is particularly notable because he had a pending employment-based immigration petition and was a visiting university scholar at the time the private law was enacted, so he had not exhausted other avenues for permanent lawful resident status pursuant to Subcommittee rules. Thus, enactment of the private law appears to have been an act of support for the activist and the human rights and democracy movements he represented more than relief for someone with no other recourse. Other laws benefitted Persian Gulf War evacuees with U.S. ties, persons technically ineligible for Nazi reparations, and a Swiss bank employee who exposed an attempt to unlawfully destroy the bank-account records of Holocaust victims.", "The House and Senate Subcommittee rules both favor cases of extreme or unusual hardship, which would appear to be the operative factor in cases generally disfavored according to the House Subcommittee rules discussed above. The Senate Subcommittee rules require the author of a private bill to set forth the equities of a case and why other remedies are not available in a written statement to the Subcommittee.

On September 15, 2001, in reaction to the events of September 11, an unstable man killed Mr. Hassan. Because Mr. Hassan was the petitioner for the family's adjustment, that petition became invalid upon his death. Therefore, under the I.N.A. and its regulations, his wife and four daughters who lived in suburban New Jersey faced removal from the United States. According to the House Report, \"This private bill, on behalf of the family, would not set any bad precedent. Though he did not die at the World Trade Center or the Pentagon, Mr. Hassan was indeed a victim of the events of September 11 th . The Committee is preceding with this bill only because the murder is linked to 9/11. [emphasis added] It is inappropriate, generally, for Congress to pass private bills to give status to the families of noncitizens because those noncitizens were killed while in the United States.\" A minority comment was that the public law should be amended to permit family-unification petitions to survive the death of the petitioner through no fault of the beneficiaries.", "Private Law No. 108-6 H.R. 530 Title: Private Bill; For the relief of Tanya Andrea Goudeau.

Although no private laws for immigration relief were enacted in the 109 th Congress, this provision enacted as part of a public law was intended for the relief of a couple of award-winning athletes (Tanith Belbin and Maxim Zavozin) who wished to represent the United States with their respective partners in the figure skating events of the 2006 Winter Olympics. Under the Olympics rules, both partners in the ice dancing or pairs events must be citizens of the country they are representing by the deadline for submitting the final list of competitors representing a country. The athletes involved had not been lawful permanent residents for the five years required to become naturalized U.S. citizens. They could not benefit from changes in the processing of employment-based immigrant visas and adjustment of status to permanent residence that would have enabled them to naturalize by the deadline if the new rules had been in effect when they had applied for visas. The relief provision reduced the period of time required from five years to three years, which the athletes could satisfy, and was limited to aliens of extraordinary ability who requested expedited naturalization as necessary to represent the United States at an international event and who paid a premium processing fee of $1,000. The provision, although of general application, was widely known to be intended for the relief of these athletes and sunsetted on January 1, 2006, having been signed into law by the President on December 30, 2005. Zavozin and Belbin completed the naturalization process and were sworn in as citizens respectively on December 30 and 31, 2005. As noted above, the House Subcommittee Rules disfavor the naturalization of an athlete for international competition purposes, which may have been the reason for accomplishing the relief through a public law. Also, private immigration bills generally were not favored during the 109 th Congress, as reflected by the fact that none were enacted, which had not occurred in at least 70 years."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
