To maintain coal in the world's energy mix in a carbon-constrained future would require development of a technology to capture and store its carbon dioxide emissions. This situation suggests to some that any greenhouse gas reduction program be delayed until such carbon capture technology has been demonstrated. However, technological innovation and the demands of a carbon control regime are interlinked; a technology policy is no substitute for environmental policy and should be developed in concert with it.", "Much of the debate about developing and commercializing carbon capture technology has focused on the role of research, development, and deployment (technology-push mechanisms). However, for technology to be fully commercialized, it must also meet a market demand\u2014a demand created either through a price mechanism or a regulatory requirement (demand-pull mechanisms). Any conceivable carbon capture technology for coal-fired power plants will increase the cost of electricity generation from affected plants because of efficiency losses. Therefore, few companies are likely to install such technology until they are required to, either by regulation or by a carbon price. Regulated industries may find their regulators reluctant to accept the risks and cost of installing technology that is not required.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) has invested millions of dollars since 1997 in carbon capture technology research and development (R&D), and the question remains whether it has been too much, too little, or about the right amount. In addition to appropriating funds each year for the DOE program, Congress supported R&D investment through provisions for loan guarantees and tax credits. Congress also authorized a significant expansion of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) spending at DOE in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Funding for carbon capture technology has increased substantially as a result of enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.", "Legislation introduced in the 111th and 110th Congresses invokes the symbolism of the Manhattan project of the 1940s and the Apollo program of the 1960s to frame proposals for large-scale energy policy initiatives that include developing CCS technology. However, commercialization of technology and integration of technology into the private market were not goals of either the Manhattan project or Apollo program.", "Finally, it should be noted that the status quo for coal with respect to climate change legislation isn't necessarily the same as \"business as usual.\" The financial markets and regulatory authorities appear to be hedging their bets on the outcomes of any federal legislation with respect to greenhouse gas reductions, and becoming increasingly unwilling to accept the risk of a coal-fired power plant with or without carbon capture capacity. The lack of a regulatory scheme presents numerous risks to any research and development effort designed to develop carbon capture technology. Ultimately, it also presents a risk to the future of coal."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction: Coal and Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "paragraphs": ["The world meets 25% of its primary energy demand with coal, a number projected to increase steadily over the next 25 years. Overall, coal is responsible for about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. With respect to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the most prevalent greenhouse gas, coal combustion was responsible for 41% of the world's CO 2 emissions in 2005 (11 billion metric tons).", "Coal is particularly important for electricity supply. In 2005, coal was responsible for about 46% of the world's power generation, including 50% of the electricity generated in the United States, 89% of the electricity generated in China, and 81% of the electricity generated in India. Coal-fired power generation is estimated to increase 2.3% annually through 2030, with resulting CO 2 emissions estimated to increase from 7.9 billion metric tons per year to 13.9 billion metric tons per year. For example, during 2006, it is estimated that China added over 90 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired generating capacity, potentially adding an additional 500 million metric tons of CO 2 to the atmosphere annually.", "Developing a means to control coal-derived greenhouse gas emissions is an imperative if serious reductions in worldwide emissions are to occur in the foreseeable future. Developing technology to accomplish this task in an environmentally, economically, and operationally acceptable manner has been an ongoing interest of the federal government and energy companies for a decade, but no commercial system to capture and store these emissions is currently available for large-scale coal-fired power plants.", "Arguably the most economic and technologically challenging part of the carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) equation is capturing the carbon and preparing it for transport and storage. Depending on site-specific conditions, the capture component of a CCS system can be the dominant cost-variable, and the component that could be improved most dramatically by further technological advancement. As indicated in Table 1 , capture costs could be 5-10 times the cost of storage. Breakthrough technologies that substantially reduce the cost of capturing CO 2 from existing or new power plants, for example by 50% or more, would immediately reshape the economics of CCS. Moreover, technological breakthroughs would change the economics of CCS irrespective of a regulatory framework that emerges and governs how CO 2 is transported away from the power plant and sequestered underground.", "In contrast, the cost of transporting CO 2 and sequestering it underground is likely less dependent on technological breakthroughs than on other factors, such as:", "the costs of construction materials and labor (in the case of pipelines for CO 2 transport); the degree of geologic characterization required to permit sequestration; the requirements for measuring, monitoring, and verifying permanent CO 2 storage; the costs of acquiring surface and subsurface rights to store CO 2 ; costs of insurance and long-term liability; and other variables driving the cost of transportation and sequestration.", "That is not to say that the transportation and storage components of CCS are independent of cost and timing. Depending on the degree of public acceptance of a large-scale CCS enterprise, the transportation and sequestration costs could be very large, and it may take years to reach agreement on the regulatory framework that would guide long-term CO 2 sequestration. But the variables driving cost and timing for the transportation and storage of CO 2 are less amenable to technological solution.", "This report examines the current effort to develop technology that would capture CO 2 . First, the report outlines the current status of carbon capture technology.

The following discussion provides a brief summary of technology under development that may be available in the near term. It is not an exhaustive survey of the technological initiatives currently underway in this area, but illustrative of the range of activity. Funding for current government research and development activities to improve these technologies and move them to commercialization are discussed later."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Post-Combustion CO2 Capture", "paragraphs": ["Post-combustion CO 2 capture involves treating the burner exhaust gases immediately before they enter the stack. The advantage of this approach is that it would allow retrofit at existing facilities that can accommodate the necessary capturing hardware and ancillary equipment. In this sense, it is like retrofitting post-combustion sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), or particulate control on an existing facility. A simplified illustration of this process is provided in Figure 1 .", "Post-combustion processes capture the CO 2 from the exhaust gas through the use of distillation, membranes, or absorption (physical or chemical). The most widely used capture technology is the chemical absorption process using amines (typically monoethanolamine (MEA)) available for industrial applications. Pilot-plant research on using ammonia (also an amine) as the chemical solvent is currently underway with demonstration plants announced. These approaches to carbon capture are discussed below. Numerous other solvent-based post-combustion processes are in the bench-scale stage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Monoethanolamine (MEA)", "paragraphs": ["The MEA CO 2 carbon capture process is the most proven and tested capture process available. The basic design (common to most solvent-based processes) involves passing the exhaust gases through an absorber where the MEA interacts with the CO 2 and absorbs it. The now CO 2 -rich MEA is then pumped to a stripper (also called a regenerator) which uses steam to separate the CO 2 from the MEA. Water is removed from the resulting CO 2 , which is compressed while the regenerated MEA is purged of any contaminants (such as ammonium sulfate) and recirculated back to the absorber. The process can be optimized to remove 90-95% of the CO 2 from the flue gas.", "Although proven on an industrial scale, it has not been applied to the typically larger volumes of flue gas streams created by coal-fired power plants. The technology has three main drawbacks that would make current use on a coal-fired power plant quite costly. First is the need to divert steam away from its primary use\u2014generating electricity\u2014to be used instead for stripping CO 2 from MEA. A second related problem is the energy required to compress the CO 2 after it's captured\u2014needed for transport through pipelines\u2014which lowers overall power plant efficiency and increases generating costs. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) estimated the efficiency losses from the installation of MEA from 25%-28% for new construction and 36%-42% for retrofit on an existing plant. This loss of efficiency comes in addition to the necessary capital and operations and maintenance cost of the equipment and reagents. For new construction, the increase in electricity generating cost on a levelized basis would be 60%-70%, depending on the boiler technology. In the case of retrofit plants where the capital costs were fully amortized, the MEA capture process would increase generating costs on a levelized basis by about 220%-250%.", "A third drawback is degradation of the amine through either overheating (over 205 degrees Fahrenheit [F]) in the absorber or through oxidation from oxygen introduced in the wash water, chemical slurry, or flue gas that reacts with the MEA. For example, residual SO 2 in the flue gas will react with the MEA to form ammonium sulfate that must be purged from the system. This could be a serious problem for existing plants that do not have highly efficient flue gas desulfurization (FGD) or selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices (or none), requiring either upgrading of existing FGD and SCR equipment, or installation of them in addition to the MEA process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MEA-Based Solvents (Fluor)", "paragraphs": ["One approach to addressing the shortcomings of MEA identified above is to use an MEA-based formulation of different amines. The goal of the formulation is improve the reaction rates and CO 2 carrying capacity of the solvent under typical power plant conditions. One such proprietary amine-based technology has been developed by Fluor (called Economine FG Plus). Fluor states that its MEA-based solvent is specially formulated to recover CO 2 from low pressure, oxygen-containing streams, such as boiler stack gases found in conventional coal-fired power plants. The treatment process is similar to generic gas treating processes, using simple, time-tested gas treating equipment. To address contamination of the solvent, the Fluor technology focuses on cleaning up impurities in the flue gas (e.g., SO 2 , NOx, hydrochloric acid, and hydrofluoric acid) in order to inhibit the formulation of ammonium sulfate and other heat-stable salts. Thus the process requires installation of modern SO 2 (with additional enhancements), NOx, Hg, and particulate controls upstream of the carbon capture technology to address the impurities. Solvent temperature issues are dealt with through the use of an intercooler system within the absorber. Finally, other enhancements in the process reduce the process energy consumption. ", "Fluor's technology has significant experience on a small commercial scale, including the only CO 2 recovery unit that has operated on the flue gas of a natural gas-fired turbine power plant under typical power plant conditions. Between 1991 and 2005, the Fluor facility at the Bellingham, MA, power plant captured 360 shorts tons of CO 2 daily for use in the food and beverage industry. In September 2009, NRG Energy and Fluor announced that Economine FG Plus would be installed on a 60 megawatt (MW) slipstream at NRG's WA Parish plant (Unit 7) in Texas, with a plan to be operational by 2013.

Ammonia is an amine that absorbs CO 2 at a slower rate than MEA. In a chilled ammonia process, the flue gas temperature is reduced from about 130 degrees F to about 35-60 degrees F. This lower temperature has two benefits: (1) it condenses the residual water in the flue gas, which minimizes the volume of flue gas entering the absorber; and (2) it causes pollutants in the flue gas, such as SO 2 , to drop out, reducing the need for substantial upgrading of upstream control devices. Using a slurry of ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate, the solvent absorbs more than 90% of the CO 2 in the flue gas. The resulting CO 2 -rich ammonia is regenerated and the CO 2 is stripped from the ammonia mixture under pressure (300 pounds per square inch [psi] compared with 15 psi using MEA), reducing the energy necessary to compress the CO 2 for transportation (generally around 1,500 psi).", "The chilled ammonia process is a proprietary process, owned by Alstom. In collaboration with American Electric Power (AEP) and RWE AG (the largest electricity producer in Germany), Alstom began operating its technology on a 20 MW slipstream at AEP's Mountaineer plant in West Virginia in September 2009 and injecting the captured CO 2 into deep saline formations onsite in October 2009. In March 2010, AEP received an award from DOE to cover as much as half the estimated $668 million cost required to scale up the Mountaineer project to capture and store CO 2 from a 235 MW slipstream (approximately 1.5 million tons annually). Once commercial viability is demonstrated at Mountaineer, AEP plans to install the technology at its 450 MW Northeastern Station in Oologah, OK, early in the next decade.

However, the higher flue gas temperatures also mean that upgrades to existing FGD devices would be necessary.", "This process, called ECO 2 , is being developed by Powerspan. Powerspan announced test results for its 1 MW pilot unit, located at FirstEnergy Corp's R.E. Burger Plant, in December 2009.

The technology has yet to make a major breakthrough in the U.S. market because its potential superior environmental performance is currently not required under the Clean Air Act, and as discussed above for carbon capture technology, its higher costs can not be justified (see the Virginia State Corporation Commission decision, discussed below).", "Carbon capture in an IGCC facility would happen before combustion, under pressure using a physical solvent (e.g., Selexol and Rectisol processes), or a chemical solvent (e.g., methyl diethanolaimine (MDEA)). A simplified illustration of this process is provided in Figure 2 . Basically, the IGCC unit pumps oxygen and a coal slurry into a gasifier to create a syngas consisting of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The syngas is cleaned of conventional pollutants (SO 2 , particulates) and sent to a shift reactor which uses steam and a catalyst to produce CO 2 and hydrogen. Because the gases are under substantial pressure with a high CO 2 content, a physical solvent can separate out the CO 2 . The advantage of a physical solvent is that the CO 2 can be freed and the solvent regenerated by reducing the pressure\u2014a process that is substantially less energy intensive than having to heat the gas as in an MEA stripper.", "From the capture process, the CO 2 is further compressed for transportation or storage, and the hydrogen is directed through gas and steam cycles to produce electricity. MIT estimates the efficiency loss from incorporating capture technology on an IGCC facility is about 19% (from 38.4% efficiency to 31.2%).

Using existing technology, the oxygen would be provided by an air-separation unit\u2014an energy-intensive process that would be the primary source of reduced efficiency. The details of this \"oxy-fuel\" process are still being refined, but generally, from the boiler the exhaust gas is cleaned of conventional pollutants (SO 2 , NOx, and particulates) and some of the gases recycled to the boiler to control the higher temperature resulting from coal combustion with pure oxygen.

For example, a utility would happily find a way to generate the same amount of electricity with less fuel, but without a policy that makes carbon dioxide emissions costly, it would not care specifically about the carbon content of its fuel mix in choosing between, say, coal and natural gas. For firms to have the desire to innovate cheaper and better ways to reduce emissions (and not merely inputs), they must bear additional financial costs for emissions.", "Much of the focus of debate on developing carbon capture technology has been on research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) needs.

As suggested by the previous discussion, any carbon capture technology for coal-fired power plants will increase the cost of electricity generation from affected plants with no increase in efficiency. Therefore, widespread commercialization of such technology is unlikely until it is required, either by regulation or by a carbon price. Indeed, regulated industries may find their regulators reluctant to accept the risks and cost of installing technology that is not required by legislation. This sentiment was reflected in a recent decision by the Virginia State Corporation Commission in denying an application by Appalachian Power Company (APCo) for a rate adjustment to construct an IGCC facility:", "The Company asserted that the value of this project is directly related to (1) potential future legal requirements for carbon capture and sequestration; and (2) the proposed IGCC Plant's potential ability to comply cost effectively with any such requirements.

The legal necessity of, and the capability of, cost-effective carbon capture and sequestration in this particular IGCC Plant, at this time, has not been sufficiently established to render APCo's Application reasonable or prudent under the Virginia Statute we must follow.", "At the same time, there is reluctance to invest in technology that is not required, and the unresolved nature of greenhouse gas regulation is affecting investment in any coal-fired generation. The risk involved in investing in coal-fired generation absent anticipated greenhouse gas regulations is outlined in \"The Carbon Principles\" announced by three Wall Street banks\u2014Citi, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley\u2014in February 2008. As stated in their paper:", "The absence of comprehensive federal action on climate change creates unknown financial risks for those building and financing new fossil fuel generation resources.

Unlike a mission-oriented research effort, like the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb, where the ultimate goal is victory and the cost virtually irrelevant, research efforts focused on developing a commercial device need to know what the market wants in a product and how much the product is worth. At the current time, the market value of a carbon capture device is zero in much of the country because there is no market for carbon emissions or regulations requiring their reduction. All estimates of value are hypothetical\u2014dependent on a reduction program or regulatory regime that doesn't exist.

By 1977, there were 14 vendors offering full-scale commercial FGD installation.", "Despite this growth, only 10% of the new coal-fired facilities constructed between 1973 and 1976 had FGD installations. In addition, the early performance of these devices was not brilliant. In 1974, American Electric Power (AEP) spearheaded an ad campaign to have EPA reject FGD devices as \"too unreliable, too impractical for electric utility use\" in favor of tall stacks, supplementary controls, and low-sulfur western coal. This effort was ultimately unsuccessful as the Congress chose to modify the NSPS requirements for coal-fired electric generators in 1977 by adding a \"percentage reduction\" requirement. As promulgated in 1979, the revised SO 2 NSPS retained the 1971 performance standard but added a requirement for a 70%-90% reduction in emissions, depending on the sulfur content of the coal. At the time, this requirement could be met only through use of an FGD device. The effect of the \"scrubber requirement\" is clear from the data provided in Figure 7 . Based on their analysis of FGD development, Taylor, Rubin, and Hounshell state the importance of demand-pull instruments:", "Results indicate that: regulation and the anticipation of regulation stimulate invention; technology-push instruments appear to be less effective at prompting invention than demand-pull instruments; and regulatory stringency focuses inventive activity along certain technology pathways.", "That government policy could force the development of a technology through creating a market should not suggest that the government was limited to that role, or that the process was smooth or seamless. On the latter point, Shattuck, et al., summarize the early years of FGD development as follows:", "The Standards of Performance for New Sources are technology-forcing, and for the utility industry they forced the development of a technology that had never been installed on facilities the size of utility plants. That technology had to be developed, and a number of installations completed in a short period of time. The US EPA continued to force technology through the promulgation of successive regulations. The development of the equipment was not an easy process. What may have appeared to be the simple application of an equipment item from one industry to another often turned out to be fraught with unforeseen challenges.", "The example indicates that technology-forcing regulations can be effective in pulling technology into the market\u2014even when there remains some operational difficulties for that technology. The difference for carbon capture technology is that for long-term widespread development, a new infrastructure of pipelines and storage sites may be necessary in addition to effective carbon capture technology. In the short-term, suitable alternatives, such as enhanced oil recovery needs and in-situ geologic storage, may be available to support early commercialization projects without the need for an integrated transport and storage system. Likewise, with economics more favorable for new facilities than for retrofits, concentrating on using new construction to introduce carbon capture technology might be one path to widespread commercialization. As an entry point to carbon capture deployment, a regulatory approach such as NSPS may represent a first step, as suggested by the SO 2 NSPS example above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Creating Demand Through a Price Signal: Carbon Taxes, Allowance Pricing, and Auctions", "paragraphs": ["Much of the current discussion of developing a market-pull mechanism for new carbon capture technology has focused on creating a price for carbon emissions. The literature suggests that this is an important component for developing new technology, perhaps more important even than research and development. As stated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO):", "Analyses that consider the costs and benefits of both carbon pricing and R&D all come to the same qualitative conclusion: near-term pricing of carbon emissions is an element of a cost-effective policy approach. That result holds even though studies make different assumptions about the availability of alternative energy technologies, the amount of crowding out caused by federal subsidies, and the form of the policy target (maximizing net benefits versus minimizing the cost of reaching a target).", "Two basic approaches can be employed in the case of a market-based greenhouse gas control program: a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade program. The carbon tax would create a long-term price signal to stimulate innovation and development of new technology. This price signal could be strengthened if the carbon tax were escalated over the long run\u2014either by a statutorily determined percentage or by an index (such as the producer price index). A carbon tax's basic approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions is to supply the marketplace with a stable, consistent price signal\u2014a signal that would also inform innovators as to the cost performance targets they should seek in developing alternative technologies. Designed appropriately, there would be little danger of the price spikes or market volatility that can occur in the early stages of a tradeable permit program.", "A cap-and-trade program creates a price signal for new technology through a market price for carbon permits (called allowances)\u2014an allowance is a limited authorization to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e). In a cap-and-trade system, these allowances are issued by the government and either allocated or auctioned to affected companies who may use them to comply with the cap, sell them to other companies on the market, or bank them for future use or sale. The resulting market transactions result in an allowance price. This price on carbon emissions, however, can be both uncertain and volatile. In addition, a low allowance price may be insufficient to encourage technology development and refinement. For example, the 1990 acid rain control program effectively ended the development of FGD for retrofit purposes by setting an emission cap that resulted in low allowance prices and that could be met through the use of low-sulfur coal. Noting that only 10% of phase 1 facilities chose FGD to comply with its requirements, Taylor, et al., state:", "The 1990 CAAA, however, although initially predicted to increase demand for FGD systems, eroded the market potential for both dry and wet FGD system applications at existing power plants when the SO 2 allowance trading market returned low-sulfur coal to its importance in SO 2 control.... As a result, research in dry FGD technology declined significantly. In this case, the flexibility provided by the 1990 acid rain regulations discouraged inventive activity in technologies that might have had broader markets under the traditional command-and-control regimes in place prior to 1990. [footnotes from original text omitted]", "A cap-and-trade program need not have such a result. For example, to more effectively promote carbon capture technology, the price signal under a greenhouse gas reduction program could be strengthened by requiring the periodic auctioning of a substantial portion of available allowances rather than giving them away at no cost. The SO 2 program allocated virtually all of its allowance at no cost to affected companies. Auctioning a substantial portion of available allowances could create a powerful price signal and provide incentives for deploying new technology if structured properly. The program could create a price floor to facilitate investment in new technology via a reserve price in the allowance auction process. In addition, the stability of that price signal could be strengthened by choosing to auction allowances on a frequent basis, ensuring availability of allowances close to the time of expected demand and making any potential short-squeezing of the secondary market more difficult.", "One positive aspect of the acid rain cap-and-trade experience for encouraging deployment of technology was the effectiveness of \"bonus\" allowances and deadline extensions as incentives to install FGD. Specifically, about 3.5 million of the allowances were earmarked for Phase 1 power plants choosing to install 90% control technology (such as FGD). Such units were allowed to delay Phase 1 compliance from 1995 to 1997 and receive two allowances for each ton of S02 reduced below a 1.2 lb. per mmBtu level during 1997-1999. The 3.5 million allowance reserve was fully subscribed, and was a major factor in what FGD was installed during Phase 1 of the program.

Substantial auctioning of allowances also places a price on carbon emissions, a price that can be strengthened by incorporating a reserve price into the structure of the auction.", "However, each of these signals ultimately depends on the environmental goal envisioned and the specifics of the control program: (1) the stringency of the reduction requirement; (2) the timing of desired reductions; (3) the techniques allowed to achieve compliance. The interplay of these factors informs the technology community about the urgency of the need for carbon capture technology; the price signal informs the community what cost-performance parameters are appropriate for the emerging carbon market. The nature of that price signal (regulatory, market, stability) informs the community of the confidence it can have that it is not wasting capital on a \"white elephant\" or on a project that the market does not want or need.", "The issues for technology-push mechanisms are broader, and include not only the specifics of any reduction program and resulting price signal, but also international considerations and the interplay between carbon capture technology, storage, and the potential need for CO 2 transport. Groups as diverse as The Pew Center, the Electric Power Research Institute, DOE, and MIT have suggested \"roadmaps\" and other schemes for preparing carbon capture technology for a pending greenhouse gas reduction program. Generally, all of these approaches agree on the need for demonstration-size (200-300 MW) projects to sort out technical performance and cost effectiveness, and identify potential environmental and safety concerns. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110 - 140 ) reflected Congress's desire for more integrated demonstration projects, and ARRA provides a dramatic step increase in funding for CCS technology over a relatively short period.", "Finally, it should be noted that the status quo for coal with respect to climate change legislation isn't necessarily the same as \"business as usual.\" The financial markets and regulatory authorities appear to be hedging their bets on the outcomes of any federal legislation with respect to greenhouse gas reductions, and are becoming increasingly unwilling to accept the risk of a coal-fired power plant with or without carbon capture capacity. This sort of limbo for coal-fired power plants is reinforced by the MIT study, which makes a strong case against subsidizing new construction (allowed for IGCC under the EPAct2005) without carbon capture because of the unattractive costs of retrofits:", "Coal plants will not be cheap to retrofit for CO 2 capture . Our analysis confirms that the costs to retrofit an air-driven SCPC [supercritical pulverized coal] plant for significant CO 2 capture, say 90%, will be greater than the costs to retrofit an IGCC plant. However, ... the modifications needed to retrofit an IGCC plant for appreciable CCS are extensive and not a matter of simply adding a single simple and inexpensive process step to an existing IGCC plant.... Consequently, IGCC plants without CCS that receive assistance under the 2005 Energy Act will be more costly to retrofit and less likely to do so.", "The concept of a \" capture ready \" IGCC or pulverized coal plant is as yet unproven and unlikely to be fruitful. The Energy Act envisions \"capture ready\" to apply to gasification technology. [citation omitted] Retrofitting IGCC plants, or for that matter pulverized coal plants, to incorporate CCS technology involves substantial additional investments and a significant penalty to the efficiency and net electricity output of the plant. As a result, we are unconvinced that such financial assistance to conventional IGCC plants without CCS is wise.

Ultimately, it also presents a risk to the future of coal."], "subsections": []}]}}
