For the Kyoto Protocol, which amends the UNFCCC, the target is for Annex I nations to hold 2008-2012 emissions to a specified percentage of the 1990 baseline; sanctions for failure have not yet been defined.", "This approach has a two-fold logic: (1) the Annex I nations, having achieved development and having contributed the most to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, are generally considered rich enough to make investments in controlling greenhouse gases; and (2) the Annex II nations, undergoing development, are exempted from greenhouse gas emission limits so as not to constrain their opportunities to expand activities that may be essential to their economic growth. The success of this approach is problematic. Except for the former Soviet bloc countries, the UNFCCC voluntary targets generally were not achieved. Likewise, many signatories to the Kyoto Protocol are anticipated not to meet their targets; and further, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States, has refused to join. Finally, this approach, even if valid as a first step, could have little long-term effect on cumulative emissions, since it lacks long-term limits for any nation; and leaving developing nations free to develop without greenhouse gas limits likely means that their emissions will, at some time in the future, exceed any diminution of emissions from developed nations.", "To illustrate, if one were to assume that in 2000 all nations equaled the United States in per capita economic activity, then the global GDP would have been about $204 trillion; at the U.S. greenhouse gas intensity of 195, then global emissions would have been nearly 40 billion tons of carbon equivalents per year, compared to actual emissions of about 9.1 billion tons in 2000.", "So, are the twin objectives of holding down greenhouse gas emissions and of fostering economic growth compatible?

While those improvements were, overall, smaller than the rate of economic growth, the examples of a few nations, such as France and Sweden, suggest that high-intensity nations could improve. Public Policy initiatives at global and national levels are addressing all three forces. On population, for example, U.N. programs regarding health, children, and family planning all impact population; individual nations also have programs affecting population, some explicitly to encourage childbearing, others the opposite. On economic development, the United Nations has underway a set of programs to improve the standards of living of the world's poorest, including a goal to halve the number of persons living on less than one dollar per day by 2015; and many nations have or contribute to foreign aid programs to foster economic growth.

This in turn implies substantial decoupling of energy use and economic activity\u2014although not to an impossible level. The analyzed level of 100 has been achieved by nations that rank in the top-20 for both per capita GDP and total annual greenhouse gas emissions.", "Greenhouse gas intensity has been improving globally, and in many nations. For 1990 to 2000, the global carbon intensity declined about 13%; for various nations, see Table 8 . But over the same decade, world population grew 13.7% and per capita GDP grew 30%, so emissions rose.", "A goal of all nations equaling or bettering an intensity of 100 would represent a very substantial challenge for most nations. Some studies have suggested that improving intensity could be achieved at low cost\u2014even in some cases at a profit. But the assumption that many \"no regrets\" opportunities exist to reduce carbon emissions has not been borne out so far in practice, as evidenced by the failure of most countries to meet the UNFCCC goal (and likely problems in meeting the Kyoto Protocol limits).", "From a policy perspective, if constraining greenhouse gases were determined to be an appropriate action for all nations, the question would be the relationships of, and the relative efforts to be devoted to, international and domestic policies and programs that affect population; economic growth and development; and intensity. At present, the first two are clearly demanding proportionately more attention and resources than intensity is.", "The purpose of this analysis has been to give some tangible sense of a possible outcome from pursuing competing goals\u2014economic growth and development versus constraining greenhouse gases\u2014that are confounding efforts, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, to address global climate change. For some, the finding that one can construct an empirically based approach that achieves a standard of living for the existing population equal to that of several European nations while not increasing global greenhouse gas emissions by more than 60% will be optimistic. However, this calculation ignores population growth, and assumes a level of intensity that may appear daunting to many. For others, the emissions may appear unacceptable despite the improvement in intensity\u2014which could imply even more aggressive improvements in intensity and/or constraints on economic growth. For still others, worry about greenhouse gas emissions is misdirected.", "Appendix A. \"Above-Parity GDP\" Nations\u20142000 Per Capita GDPs Greater Than $25,850", "Appendix B. \"Parity GDP\" Nations\u20142000 Per Capita GDPs $23,500 \u00b1 10%($25,850 - $21,150)", "Appendix C. \"Below-Parity GDP\" Nations\u20142000 Per Capita GDPs Smaller Than $21,150"], "subsections": []}]}}
