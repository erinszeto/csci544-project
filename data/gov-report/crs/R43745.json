In 2011, GAO identified several weaknesses in the H-1B program's ability to protect workers: (1) oversight that is fragmented between four agencies and restricted by law; (2) lack of legal authority to hold employers accountable to program requirements when they obtain H-1B workers through a staffing company; and (3) expansions that have increased the pool of H-1B workers beyond the cap and lowered the bar for eligibility.", "A 2008 internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) investigation of H-1B visa adjudications found a 13.4% fraud rate as well as a 7.3% technical violation rate.

The investigation also discovered that some petitioning employers shifted the burden of paying various filing fees to foreign workers. A 2010 DHS investigation found a 14% \"not verified\" rate, which U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officials cited to suggest a reduced level of fraud in the H-1B program.

A related concern is that an unchecked use of L visas will foster the transfer of STEM and other high-skilled professional jobs overseas.

To qualify for the 17-month extension, F-1 students must have received STEM degrees included on the STEM Designated Degree Program List, be employed by employers enrolled in E-Verify, and have received an initial grant of post-completion OPT related to such a degree (i.e., already approved for 12 months in OPT). ", "Much like the evolution of the J visa from cultural exchange to employment, concerns have arisen that the F-1 visa is transforming into an employment visa. Many observers point to difficulties in obtaining an H-1B visa and the backlogs in adjusting to lawful permanent residence as reasons that drive the relaxation of the work rules for F-1 students. GAO recently released a report noting the potential for fraud and abuse of the OPT status. GAO concluded that DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement was unable to \"fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.\" ", "Aimed at easing the transition from international student to LPR, both S. 744 , as passed by the Senate, and H.R. 2131 , as ordered reported by the House Judiciary Committee, would make changes to the F visa category. S. 744 would allow aliens on F visas who are seeking bachelor's or graduate degrees, dual intent; thus, they could seek LPR status while maintaining F status. H.R. 2131 would allow dual intent only for aliens on F visas who are seeking bachelor's and graduate degrees in STEM fields. In other words, many F-1 students working with OPT would, if enacted, be able to apply for LPR status while engaged in OPT employment.", "In addition, H.R. 2131 would require employers of OPT students to pay either the actual wage paid to similarly employed workers or the prevailing wage (whichever is higher). DOL would also have authority to investigate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Comments", "paragraphs": ["The likelihood of enacting legislation to revise laws on the migration of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers is linked to the competing approaches to immigration reform. Among those who support immigration reform, some favor a package of incremental reform bills and others support one comprehensive immigration reform (CIR) bill. While the Senate passed a bi-partisan CIR bill ( S. 744 ), the House Republican leadership had favored approaching the issues in discreet \"chunks\" as H.R. 2131 does. At this point in time, there appears to be a consensus that action on either approach is unlikely."], "subsections": []}]}}
