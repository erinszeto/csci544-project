Many industry observers have emphasized that congressional action may be necessary to provide statutory authority to develop aquaculture in offshore areas. Offshore aquaculture is generally defined as the rearing of marine organisms in ocean waters beyond significant coastal influence, primarily in the federal waters of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Establishing an offshore aquaculture operation is contingent on obtaining several federal permits and fulfilling a number of additional consultation and review requirements from different federal agencies responsible for various general authorities that apply to aquaculture. However, there is no explicit statutory authority for permitting and developing aquaculture in federal waters. The aquaculture permit and consultation process in federal waters has been described as complex, time consuming, and difficult to navigate.", "Supporters of aquaculture have asserted that development of the industry, especially in offshore areas, has significant potential to increase U.S. seafood production and provide economic opportunities for coastal communities. Currently, marine aquaculture facilities are located in nearshore state waters. Although there are some research-focused and proposed commercial offshore facilities, no commercial facilities are currently operating in U.S. federal waters. Aquaculture supporters note that the extensive U.S. coastline and adjacent U.S. ocean waters provide potential sites for offshore aquaculture development. They reason that by moving offshore, aquaculturalists can avoid many user conflicts they have encountered in inshore areas. Offshore areas also are considered to be less prone to pollution and fish diseases.", "Environmental organizations and fishermen generally have opposed development of offshore aquaculture. They assert that poorly regulated aquaculture development in inshore areas has degraded the environment and harmed wild fish populations and ecosystems. Those who oppose aquaculture development generally advocate for new authorities to regulate offshore aquaculture and to safeguard the environment and other uses of offshore waters. Some segments of the commercial fishing industry also have expressed concerns with potential development of aquaculture on fishing grounds and competition between cultured and wild products in domestic markets.", "Proponents of aquaculture counter that in many parts of the world a combination of farming experiences, technological advances, proper siting, and industry regulation has decreased environmental impacts and improved efficiency of marine aquaculture. They argue that many who oppose marine aquaculture lack an understanding of the benefits and risks of aquaculture and that opposition persists despite research that contradicts the extent or existence of these risks.", "Generally, the outcomes associated with aquaculture development depend on a variety of factors, such as the characteristics of aquaculture sites, species, technology, and facility management. Regardless of potential environmental harm, it remains to be seen whether moving to offshore areas would be profitable and if offshore aquaculture could compete with inshore aquaculture development and lower costs in other countries.", "Comprehensive offshore aquaculture bills were introduced in the 109 th , 110 th , 111 th , 112 th , and 115 th Congresses, but none were enacted. In the 115 th Congress, the Advancing the Quality and Understanding of American Aquaculture Act (AQUAA; S. 3138 and H.R. 6966 ) was introduced; AQUAA would have established a regulatory framework for aquaculture development in federal waters. It also would have provided National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries with the authority to issue aquaculture permits and coordinate with other federal agencies that have permitting and consultative responsibilities. Conversely, since the 109 th Congress, bills have been introduced that would constrain or prohibit the permitting of aquaculture in the EEZ. The Keep Finfish Free Act of 2019 ( H.R. 2467 ), introduced in the 116 th Congress, would prohibit the issuance of permits to conduct finfish aquaculture in the EEZ until a law is enacted that allows such action. It remains an open question whether legislation could be crafted that would provide the regulatory framework desired by potential commercial developers of offshore aquaculture and avoid or minimize risks of environmental harm to the satisfaction of those currently opposed to offshore aquaculture development."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Offshore aquaculture is generally defined as the rearing of marine organisms in ocean waters beyond significant coastal influence, primarily in the federal waters of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

Regulatory uncertainty has been identified as one of the main barriers to developing offshore aquaculture in federal waters of the United States. According to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, \"aquaculture operations in offshore waters lack a clear regulatory regime, and questions about exclusive access have created an environment of uncertainty that is detrimental to investment in the industry.\" Some observers have concluded that \"offshore aquaculture will not fully develop unless governments create a supportive political climate and resulting regulatory conditions.\" A framework also may be needed to assure environmentalists, fishermen, and other stakeholders that coastal and fisheries managers would have the authority to address potential threats to the environment and other impacts. ", "According to most observers, congressional action may be necessary to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture. Comprehensive legislation has been introduced a number of times since the 109 th Congress, but none of the bills have been enacted. Controversy has stemmed from different perspectives of aquaculturalists, environmentalists, fishermen, and others. Some environmental organizations and fishermen have asserted that poorly regulated aquaculture development has degraded the environment and harmed wild fish populations and ecosystems. Some segments of the commercial fishing industry are opposed to marine aquaculture because of potential development on fishing grounds, environmental effects on fish populations, and competition of cultured products with wild products in domestic markets. Offshore aquaculture advocates counter that a combination of farming experiences, technological advances, proper siting, and industry regulation has decreased environmental impacts and improved the efficiency of marine aquaculture. It appears that renewed efforts have emerged in the 116 th Congress to meet current challenges by attempting to improve regulatory efficiency, minimize environmental degradation, and avoid impacts on existing ocean uses. ", "Additional related factors, such as technical advances, economic feasibility, and the level of government support, also are likely to affect future growth of the U.S. aquaculture industry. Although a regulatory framework appears to be necessary for establishing offshore aquaculture in federal waters, it may not be sufficient for significant development of the industry. Sometimes overlooked are the services that may be needed to establish a new industry, such as program administration, research, and other services (e.g., disaster assistance, insurance). Technical uncertainties related to harsher offshore environmental conditions and higher costs of operating farther from shore may slow extensive offshore development, especially in the immediate future.

It introduces the topic with background information that covers aquaculture production and methods, federal agencies involved in aquaculture, and potential congressional interest in the topic. It then focuses on three of the main challenges faced by the industry, including the current regulatory framework, environmental concerns, and economic viability.

From 1997 to 2016, world seafood production from wild sources (capture fisheries) leveled off at a range of 89 million metric tons (mmt) to 96 mmt. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, further growth of global wild fisheries production is unlikely, because approximately 93% of marine stocks are now either fished unsustainably or fished at maximum sustainable levels. During the same period, world aquaculture production increased from 28.3 mmt to 80.0 mmt; it now makes up 47% of global fish production. It is likely that aquaculture production will continue to expand with advances in aquaculture technologies and the need to satisfy the demand of the world's growing population. Figure 1 illustrates the growth in global aquaculture production and relatively constant wild fisheries production. Nearly all of global marine aquaculture production is from inshore areas, such as estuaries and coastal areas, not from offshore areas. ", "Wild fisheries in the United States are limited by the productive capacity of U.S. waters. Most U.S. stocks are now fished at their maximum sustainable levels. However, unlike worldwide trends, U.S. aquaculture production has generally stagnated and makes up a relatively small portion of total U.S. seafood production. In 2016, the United States ranked fifth in global seafood production at 5.36 mmt; 0.44 mmt (8.2%) of this total was produced by aquaculture. Figure 2 illustrates the relatively constant domestic production of aquaculture and wild fisheries. Most U.S. aquaculture production consists of freshwater species, such as catfish, trout, and crawfish. Growth in U.S. seafood consumption has depended on imports, which provide approximately 80% to 90% of the seafood consumed in the United States. Approximately 50% of seafood imports, such as shrimp from Southeast Asia and salmon from Norway or Chile, are produced by aquaculture in ponds and nearshore areas. According to some observers, U.S. reliance on seafood imports will continue to increase without changes to current policies and regulatory obstacles that currently impede expansion of aquaculture."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aquaculture Overview", "paragraphs": ["Aquaculture is broadly defined as the propagation and rearing of aquatic species in controlled or selected environments. Aquaculture is difficult to characterize because of the diverse nature of facilities, methods, technologies, and species that are cultured. Organisms are cultured in freshwater environments, land-based closed systems, coastal and estuarine areas, and offshore areas. Often, hatcheries are used to spawn fish and shellfish to produce eggs that are hatched and grown to specific stages; these organisms are then transferred to facilities where they are grown to marketable size. ", "Aquaculture operations range from systems where there is only minimal control over the organism's environment to intensive operations where there is complete control at each stage of the organism's life history. For example, an intensive system would include freshwater species such as catfish that are often raised in shallow earthen ponds; production relies on control of inputs. Water, feed, and disease treatment are controlled to maximize growth while minimizing costs. Farming of finfish, such as salmon, also requires stocking at high densities and relies on extensive feeding. Commercial salmon aquaculture facilities often employ net pens ( Figure 3 ), which are moored to the bottom and located in protected inshore marine areas, such as bays and fjords.", "Bivalves such as oysters and clams are grown in estuaries and inshore areas, feeding on a diet of plankton and detritus that they filter from seawater. Bivalve aquaculture may employ varying degrees of control. In some cases, they are suspended on lines, in wire cages, and on rafts. Oyster larvae are grown in hatcheries and transferred to these structures as oyster spat or seed and grown to market size. Some oyster production is less intensive and depends on enhancement of the benthic (ocean bottom) environment by placing oyster shells on the bottom to facilitate attachment of wild oyster larvae. ", "In Alaska, hatcheries are used to enhance the production of salmon fry, which are released to the wild to feed and grow until they are caught by fishermen as adults. These programs are run as nonprofit cooperatives overseen by Alaska fishermen. Most states and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service run public stocking programs, which often address a variety of objectives such as enhancing recreational fisheries and restoring depleted populations. Each strategy requires different inputs and interacts with the environment to differing degrees. Nevertheless, a common factor is to control some aspect(s) of the organism's life to enhance survival and growth. ", "Over the last decade, catfish aquaculture has accounted for most food fish production by volume and revenue in the United States ( Table 1 ). However, catfish production has declined by nearly 44% over this period due to a variety of factors, including competition from Asian imports. For freshwater species, only crawfish production (78.0%) and revenue (66.2%) increased significantly. During the same period, production of salmon and oysters increased in both volume and revenue. Cultured oysters exhibited the largest increases in production (66.0%) and revenue (86.5%), which is likely related to greater demand for high quality raw oysters. However, except for cultured oysters, production of most domestic marine seafood products is from wild marine fisheries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Offshore Aquaculture", "paragraphs": ["As stated above, offshore aquaculture is the rearing of marine organisms in ocean waters beyond significant coastal influence, primarily in the federal waters of the EEZ.

Supporters of aquaculture have asserted that development of the industry, especially in offshore areas, has significant potential to increase U.S. seafood production and provide economic opportunities for coastal communities. The potential of offshore aquaculture in the United States is likely to differ by species, region, and technology.", "Despite plans for several offshore operations, no commercial offshore aquaculture facilities are currently operating in the U.S. EEZ. Some marine aquaculture facilities are located in nearshore state waters, however. In the future, inshore marine production is likely to be constrained by the availability of suitable sites, poor water quality, high coastal land values, and competition with other ocean uses. Potential aquaculture development in offshore areas has received increasing attention because of these limitations.", "The cost of working offshore may be greater than the costs of working in inshore and land-based areas, in part because offshore aquaculture in the EEZ would be subject to relatively high-energy offshore environments caused by high and variable winds and storms. However, research and technical advances have demonstrated that operating in these environments is feasible. Expansion of offshore aquaculture into clean, well-flushed waters appears to have nearly unlimited potential, although major technological and operational challenges remain. For example, further development will require structures and materials that will contain stocks under harsh oceanic conditions and keep costs low enough to remain profitable.", "It is likely that offshore aquaculture, at least initially, would employ species with established markets and production systems that are similar to those used in inshore areas. Examples of marine species that are candidates for offshore areas may include Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ), white sea bass ( Atractoscion nobils ), cobia ( Rachycentron canadum ), and blue mussel ( Mytilus edulis ). Currently, salmon net pen facilities operate in protected inshore waters of Maine and Washington. Several other net pen aquaculture facilities have operated in exposed state waters of Hawaii and Puerto Rico that have characteristics similar to those of offshore areas. Over the last two decades, permits have been issued to conduct research and limited commercial aquaculture in the EEZ. Recently, three mussel farms received permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to operate in offshore waters. Several other ventures have been proposed; including proposals to operate commercial facilities in several regions. ", "Researchers are developing systems to adapt facilities used in inshore areas to the unique needs of offshore aquaculture. Offshore systems (e.g., submersible cages, net pens, longline arrays) may be free-floating, secured to a structure, moored to the ocean bottom, or towed by a vessel. Systems have been developed to overcome problems associated with harsh open ocean conditions, including submersible cage designs that do not deform under strong currents and waves, and single-point moorings. Cage-mounted autonomous feeding systems have been developed that can operate both at the surface and submerged. Other components under development include mechanized and remote systems that can be controlled from land-based facilities; for example, universities and private-sector research interests are developing automated buoys that can monitor the condition of stock and feed fish on a regular basis for weeks at a time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Government Involvement in Aquaculture", "paragraphs": ["Federal aquaculture, regulation, research, and support are conducted by a number of federal agencies.

Treatment of effluent is not feasible because wastes are discharged directly into the ocean through net enclosures. Impacts on the environment depend on a variety of factors, such as feed quality, digestion and metabolism, feeding rate, biomass of fish, and species. Site characteristics such as cage design, depth, currents, existing water quality or nutrient levels, and benthic features also influence nutrient dispersion and impacts.

Eutrophication may occur when net pens are placed at high densities and flushing of semi-enclosed water bodies is poor. According to studies, aquaculture's contribution to nitrogen in areas adjacent to net pens ranged broadly from none to significant levels depending on a variety of factors, including environmental characteristics and species. In some cases, it appears that nutrients are flushed away from the immediate cage area to the surrounding water body. Management practices such as choosing sites with adequate current and depth are likely to improve circulation and dissipation of waste products.

In some cases, wastes accumulate at rates greater than the assimilative capacity of the environment, and the increase of respiration from microbial decomposition decreases oxygen levels (hypoxia) and changes sediment chemistry. This may cause hypoxia in sediments and the water overlying the bottom, which may in turn affect the abundance and diversity of marine organisms in the area. Reviews have identified changes to sediment chemistry as one of the primary impacts of marine aquaculture in the United States.

Feed formulations have been modified to improve digestibility without losses in growth. When feed is more fully digested, the amount of waste (nutrient) outputs per unit of fish produced is reduced and fewer solid wastes and nutrients are released to the environment. Modifying feeding practices also has reduced the loss of uneaten food. Some facilities now use underwater devices to monitor feeding to avoid overfeeding and waste. Environmental monitoring also informs farmers and regulators of the need to leave a site fallow or to adjust feeding.

These species are now found in most of the Mississippi drainage area, and they have affected the basin's aquatic ecology and harmed species such as freshwater mussels and native fish.", "Genetic diversity could be affected if hatchery-raised fish spawn with wild conspecifics (wild fish of the same species). Interbreeding could result in the loss of fitness in the population due in part to the loss of genetic diversity. Genetic risks would depend on the number of escapes relative to the number of wild fish, the genetic differences between wild and escaped fish, and the ability of escaped fish to successfully spawn in the wild. There are also concerns that non-native fish could become established in the wild and compete with wild fish for food, habitat, mates, and other resources.", "Experiences with farmed Atlantic salmon may provide some insight regarding escape of farmed fish both within and outside their native ranges. Atlantic salmon have escaped from farms in the Pacific Northwest (outside their native range) and have been recaptured in Alaskan commercial fisheries. In 2017, over 100,000 Atlantic salmon escaped from facilities owned by Cook Aquaculture off Cypress Island, WA. Many of the escaped fish were recovered, and fishery managers assumed the remaining fish were unable to make the transition to a natural diet. In British Columbia, escaped Atlantic salmon have spawned and produced wild-spawned juvenile Atlantic salmon, but it is uncertain whether they have established self-reproducing breeding populations.", "Within the range of Atlantic salmon, farmed salmon have been found on spawning grounds during the period when wild Atlantic salmon spawning occurs. Domestication of farmed salmon has changed their genetic composition and reduced genetic variation. These changes have occurred because limited numbers of brood fish are used for spawning farmed fish and farmers select for specific traits. Much present-day farm production of Atlantic salmon is based on five Norwegian strains. Farmed and wild hybrids and backcrossing of hybrids in subsequent generations may change genetic variability and the frequency and type of alleles present in wild populations. The extent and nature of these changes to genetic variability may affect survival (fitness) of these populations. Changes in the genetic profiles of wild populations have been found in several rivers in Norway and Ireland, where interbreeding of wild and farmed fish is common. Large-scale experiments in Norway and Ireland show highly reduced survival and lifetime success rates of farmed and hybrid salmon compared to wild salmon. Some researchers have concluded that further measures are needed to reduce the escape of salmon from aquaculture farms and their spawning with wild populations.", "Researchers and managers have made several recommendations to decrease the risk of invasive species introductions and the loss of genetic diversity. There appears to be common agreement, as in the case of the Gulf of Mexico FMP, that only native species should be farmed. To decrease genetic risks associated with escapes, farmers might be required to use wild broodstock with a genetic makeup that is similar to local wild populations. However, by using this approach, farmers may forgo benefits of selective breeding. Another approach might involve the use of sterile fish created through techniques such as hybridization, chemical sterilization, polyploidy, and others.

Predation can result in loss of fish, damage to equipment, and stress to fish. Deterrence measures seek to address these concerns; for example, predator nets may be placed outside the main net to stop marine mammals directly accessing the net pen.

Economic conditions determine the costs of labor, hatchery supplies for stocking, feed, maintenance, and other inputs. For most aquaculture operations, the bulk of costs are for feed and stocking of early life stages, such as finfish fingerlings or oyster seed. Fixed costs include equipment depreciation, insurance, taxes, and lease payments. Shifts in supply result from changes in input prices, which also may be affected by technology, weather conditions, and other influences. At the level of individual farms or facilities, most costs are not set and often depend on short-run and long-run choices of the aquaculturalist. For example, in the short run, the producer may change feed quality and quantity, harvest intervals, or stocking rates, while in the longer term she may change species, location, technology, and scale. ", "Costs to produce seafood in offshore aquaculture facilities are likely to be higher than costs in inshore areas, because of the need for more resilient cage materials and construction, shore-side infrastructure, specialized vessels, and automation of facility systems. The location of offshore aquaculture facilities also is likely to increase costs for fuel, monitoring, harvest, and security. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, offshore facilities operating at distances of greater than 25 nm from shore are unlikely to be profitable, because costs increase with distance from shore. ", "Some have speculated that offshore facilities will need to take advantage of economies of scale because of the relatively high costs of transporting materials between inshore and offshore facilities. Operating large-scale operations will require new coastal facilities and networks to supply and transport feed, construction materials, fingerlings, and harvested fish. Logistics networks to supply these inputs would need to be developed in coastal areas, where \"working waterfronts\" are already threatened due to competing uses and the relatively high cost of coastal real estate. These startup costs may exclude smaller producers who may not have access to the capital and resources needed to establish large-scale operations. ", "Financial risk, generally the probability of losing money, is another factor that is related to potential viability of offshore aquaculture and may affect the availability of capital and insurance. Risk is defined as uncertain consequences, usually unfavorable outcomes, due to imperfect knowledge. Assessing risk for offshore aquaculture is complicated by different species, technologies, site characteristics, and the lack of experience working in offshore areas. Risks may be greater in offshore than inshore areas because of the threat of severe weather conditions and exposed offshore environments. Attracting investment may be difficult because offshore aquaculture is a new industry with limited experiences for investors to evaluate. As risk and uncertainty increase, generally, a greater revenue stream is required to justify the same level of investment. Known risks can be reduced by decreasing the probability of adverse outcomes, such as by using stronger materials to build more resilient structures. The cost of reducing risks must be weighed against the probability and magnitude of potential losses. ", "Another approach to reducing risk is through insurance. Insurance transfers risk from the producer to the insurance underwriter through payments of insurance premiums. The cost of insurance premiums may be higher for offshore than inshore areas because of greater uncertainty and potentially higher risks of losses for offshore facilities.

Externalities are defined as spillover costs or benefits, which are unintended consequences or side effects associated with an economic activity. For example, commercial fishermen may be harmed by habitat degradation caused by pollution from aquaculture because of associated declines of wild populations. When externalities are not considered, markets become inefficient because more of a good or service is produced than when the externality is fully considered. ", "The recognition of externalities is another way in which policymakers can examine the tradeoffs related to the private benefits from aquaculture production and the environmental harm caused by the activity. In the case of offshore aquaculture, external costs may be associated with environmental harm from pollution, escaped organisms, disease transmission, and other effects. The existence of externalities means that policymakers may need to consider whether and to what degree the government should intervene to account for these costs. Intervention may involve regulatory measures that minimize externalities while maximizing benefits associated with the industry (e.g., fish production). Decisions related to site selection, technology, and facility operations are likely to be some of the main factors that determine the level of offshore aquaculture externalities.

The value of seafood trade is now more than twice the trade of meat and poultry combined. Relatively high-value seafood from wild fisheries and aquaculture dominates imports. In 2017, the United States imported approximately 2.7 mmt of edible seafood valued at $21.5 billion. After accounting for exports valued at $5.7 billion, the value of imports was $15.8 billion greater than exports of edible seafood products. Approximately half of seafood imports are cultured. The two main imported products are farmed shrimp and salmon. In 2017, shrimp accounted for $6.5 billion and salmon accounted for $3.5 billion of U.S. seafood imports.

The Department of Commerce Strategic Plan states that, \"a strong U.S. marine aquaculture industry will serve a key role in U.S. food security and improve our trade balance with other nations.\" ", "Some may counter that the seafood trade deficit is not a good reason to support development of the aquaculture industry. Cultured salmon and shrimp imports have lowered prices and, therefore, the profits of domestic wild fisheries and aquaculture producers, but U.S. consumers have benefited from lower salmon and shrimp prices. According to economic theory, countries gain from trade when they specialize in products that they are best at producing. If other countries have an absolute or comparative advantage in aquaculture, the United States would likely benefit from supporting other industries. Advocates of aquaculture note that the United States has advantages compared to other countries because of its extensive coastline and EEZ, skilled labor, technology, domestic feed production, stable government and economy, and large seafood market. Others counter that U.S. federal waters are exposed to high winds and wave action for large parts of the year, whereas other parts of the world have readily available inshore areas and calmer offshore waters that could be developed, as well as lower labor costs.

Some have speculated that costs of inputs such as labor and less strict regulations provide producers outside the United States with an insurmountable competitive advantage. Other observers stress that costs may be lower in other countries, but if prices are high enough, U.S. producers may still be able to operate profitably. Domestic producers also have some advantages, such as a large and relatively wealthy market and lower shipping costs than those for imports. ", "The government sometimes provides government-sponsored trade protections such as tariffs or import quotas to new industries. Protection may be rationalized by an infant industry that claims it requires time to overcome short-term cost disadvantages. Cost disadvantages may be related to the need to become more efficient by constructing new facilities, training workers, and installing new equipment. In these cases, tariffs would act as a subsidy that increases the domestic price of the good. When the industry becomes more efficient, the tariff would expire.
