Like most sources of data, telephone directory listings have potential benefits and potential drawbacks. Telephone directories were chosen for a number of reasons, including the following: ", "telephone directories published by the Senate are an official source of information about the institution that are widely available; presumably, the number of directory listings closely approximates the number of staff working for the Senate; while arguably not their intended purpose, the directories provide a consistent breakdown of Senate staff by internal organization at a particular moment in time; and the directories afford the opportunity to compare staff levels at similar moments across a period of decades.", "At the same time, however, data presented below should be interpreted with care for a number of reasons, including the following:", "There is no way to determine whether all staff working for the Senate are listed in the chambers' telephone directories. If some staff are not listed, relying on telephone directories is likely to lead to an undercount of staff. In particular, staff working in Senators' state offices were not listed until 1987. This likely led to an undercount of staff, and makes comparisons pre-1987 and post-1987 difficult. It is not possible to determine if staff who are listed were actually employed by the Senate at the time the directories were published. If the directories list individuals who are no longer employed by the Senate, then relying on them is likely to lead to an overcount of staff. The extent to which the criterion for inclusion in the directories for the Senate has changed over time cannot be fully determined. Some editions of the directory do not always list staff in various entities the same way. This may raise questions regarding the reliability of telephone directory data as a means for identifying congressional staff levels within the Senate over time. Some Senate staff may have more than one telephone number, or be listed in the directory under more than one entity. As a consequence, they might be counted more than once. This could lead to a more accurate count of staff in specific entities within the Senate, but multiple listings may also lead to an overcount of staff working in the chamber. Chamber directories may reflect different organizational arrangements over time for some entities. This could lead to counting staff doing similar work in both years in different categories, or in different offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Senate Staff Data", "paragraphs": ["It appears that the Senate telephone directories started listing Senate staff working in Senators' state offices in 1987.

A potential explanation for these changes may be found in what some might characterize as an ongoing professionalization and institutionalization of congressional management and administration. Some note that as organizations such as governing institutions develop, they identify needs for expertise and develop specialized practices and processes. In Congress, some of those areas of specialization arguably include supporting the legislative process through the drafting of measures, oversight and support of floor activities, and the management of legislation in a bicameral, partisan environment. Another potential explanation related to a more institutionalized, professionalized Congress could be the demands for professional management and support. This could arise as a result of congressional use of communications technologies, and the deployment of systematic, professionalized human resources processes, business operations, and financial management. Consequently, increased specialized support of congressional legislative and administrative activities may explain increases among staff working for chamber leaders, and officers and officials.", "In another example, the distribution of staff working directly for Senators has shifted from committee settings to personal office settings. Staff in Member offices has grown while staff in Senate committees has decreased, both in real numbers and in percentage of total staff.
