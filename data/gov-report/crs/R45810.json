From the mid-1960s through the 1980s, Molycorp's Mountain Pass mine was the world's dominant source of rare earth oxides. However, by 2000, nearly all of the separated rare earth oxides were imported, primarily from China. Because of China's REE oversupply and lower-cost production, as well as a number of environmental (e.g., a pipeline spill carrying contaminated water) and regulatory issues at Mountain Pass, Molycorp, Inc. ceased production at its mine in 2002. ", "Between 2010 and 2012, there was some optimism but also criticism over Molycorp Inc.'s approach to reopen the only rare earth mine in the United States and establish a vertically integrated operation including oxide separation, production of metal alloys, and permanent magnet production. A few important questions relevant to a vertically integrated approach were raised then as they are now", "How can a fully integrated supply chain be developed domestically? Is a domestic supply chain necessary to address potential supply risk?; and With China in a near-monopoly position in all aspects of the rare earth supply chain, would an alternative supply chain outside China among allies provide reliable and less risky access to needed rare earth elements?

Permanent magnets are important parts for national defense missile systems, wind turbines, and automobiles. With higher prices came lower demand as some companies began to use less REEs, try substitutes, or diversify their source of raw material supply outside of China. With China's production (including illegal production), there was more supply than demand for many of the REEs and prices declined. As a result of rapidly falling prices and Molycorp's debt, the Mountain Pass mine was not economically sustainable. Molycorp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2015. In June 2017, MP Mine Operations LLC (MPMO) purchased the Mountain Pass mine for $20.5 million. MPMO is an American-led consortium of which the Chinese-owned Leshan Shenghe Rare Earth Company has a 10% nonvoting minority share. In 2018, MMPO reportedly restarted production at Mountain Pass.

Then in 1946, the Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act was enacted so that the United States would be prepared for national military emergencies and to prevent material shortages. The 1946 Act (P.L. 79-520) set a target of $2.1 billion of materials to be spent for the stockpile. Congress increased funding for supplying the stockpile to $4 billion over four years (1950-1953).

However, with the passage of the 1979 Strategic and Critical Minerals Stockpiling Revision Act ( P.L. 96-41 ), a three-year military contingency was reestablished as a criterion for stockpile goals. Funding for the stockpile was subsequently increased to $20 billion.", "During the Cold-War era, the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) had an inventory of large quantities of strategic and critical materials. In the early 1990s, after the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the U.S. Congress supported an upgrade and modernization of the strategic materials stockpile. By FY1993, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1993 ( P.L. 102-484 ) authorized a major sell-off of 44 obsolete and excess materials in the stockpile such as aluminum metal, ferrochromium, ferromanganese, cobalt, nickel, silver, tin, and zinc.

That is, byproduct supply is relatively inelastic (i.e., not particularly responsive to price increases of the byproduct).

High production in the unreported (informal) sector of the mining community drove prices down and forced many of the major production regions to close their operations. With low prices, investor interest is limited; investors are thus constrained by high risk in greenfield projects, (i.e., new projects or work that does not follow previous work). ", "The USGS data does not reflect the amount of production from unauthorized (often illegal) mining operations\u00e2\u0080\u0094usually artisanal mining operations. The USGS collects its data from a variety of sources but considers the tantalum industry as operating under \"a shroud of secrecy\" with incomplete access to data and not very transparent. Generally, there is insufficient data to make definitive determinations on the true production, capacity, and reserve levels for tantalum on a global basis. There are several reasons for this supply/demand material difference, including the following:", "Nonreporting or under-reporting all forms of supply (primary, byproduct, tin slag, and scrap) through the Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center (TIC) or elsewhere. High inventories. Several analysts have noted that since the recession of 2008 many companies were selling from their above-ground stocks. Illicit mining and trading. There are well-established networks for smuggling tantalum and other minerals out of Central Africa (and elsewhere) and into the marketplace. ", "Dependence on Africa's supply and that disruption could have consequences, e.g., price rises. Africa provides 80% of the primary tantalum production (60% from the DRC and Rwanda) as China dominates downstream processing and manufacturing capacity. The illicit mining component in the tantalum market makes it vulnerable and possibly unsustainable because it prevents large-scale producers from entering the market. Illegal tantalum trade has long-term implications for the entire supply chain leading to lower investment in all phases of the supply chain.", "In 2016, the USGS listed Australia and Brazil as having 85% of the world's tantalum reserves, but the USGS regularly states that data is not available for other countries or is just unknown.

This method examines four resilience of supply indicators: diversity of supply, material substitution, recycling, and stockpiling, and is dependent on three factors: resistance, rapidity, and flexibility. Mancheri's study concludes that the tantalum market is flexible and resilient based on its handling of unreported and presumably illegal trade along with its impact on conventional large-scale tantalum producers. Mancheri's study concluded that stockpiling and substitution can mitigate some supply disruption.", "Generally, tantalum follows the following supply chain steps: ", "The primary ore is crushed and milled into an ore concentrate which is further refined into oxides (metal or powder) or K-Salt (which is reduced to tantalum metal), which is used for the manufacture of capacitors, wire, super alloys, and other fabricated forms. Downstream manufacturers use these materials for parts that are used by consumer product manufacturers and others. China has 16 tantalum processing plants; the United States has one, according to the Mancheri study. There are four processing plants in Germany and four in Japan.

The Mining Law grants free access to individuals and corporations to prospect for minerals on open public domain lands, and allows them, upon making a discovery, to stake (or \"locate\") a claim on the deposit.
