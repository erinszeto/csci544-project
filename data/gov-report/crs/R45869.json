Under current provisions, (1) abortions may be funded only when the life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest; (2) funds may not be used to buy a managed care package that includes abortion coverage, except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment; and (3) federal programs and state and local governments that receive LHHS funding are prohibited from discriminating against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions or abortion services.

Starting in FY2016, the provision was modified to allow funds to be used for needle exchange programs under the following conditions: (1) federal funds may not be used to purchase the needles, but may be used for other aspects of such programs; (2) the state or local jurisdiction must demonstrate, in consultation with CDC, that they are experiencing, or at risk for, a significant increase in hepatitis infections or an HIV outbreak due to injection drug use; and (3) the program must be operating in accordance with state and local law.

Once all annual appropriations acts were enacted for FY2019 and allowable adjustments to the spending limits were made, OMB determined that those appropriations did not violate either the defense or the nondefense limit.", "Cap Adjustments, Exemptions, and Special Rules", "The BCA allows for certain adjustments to the discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. For LHHS, the BCA as originally enacted allowed increases to the nondefense limit (up to a point) to accommodate new budget authority for specified program integrity initiatives at HHS and the Social Security Administration (SSA). The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-74 ) amended the list of SSA activities that may be covered by this \"cap adjustment\" to include costs associated with work-related continuing disability reviews, Cooperative Disability Investigations, and fraud prosecutions by Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys.

The Cures Act further provided that subsequent discretionary appropriations from these accounts (up to the amounts authorized for each fiscal year) are to be subtracted from any cost estimates provided for purposes of budget controls. The Cures Act ensured that appropriations from these accounts will not count against any spending limits, such as the statutory discretionary spending limits imposed by the BCA; that is, the amounts appropriated from these accounts will be considered to be outside those limits.
