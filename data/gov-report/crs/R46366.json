ERISA specified funding rules for single-employer defined benefit (DB) pension plans, among other provisions. Single-employer DB pension plans are sponsored by one employer for the benefit of its employees. In DB pension plans, participants typically receive regular monthly benefit payments in retirement (which some refer to as a \"traditional\" pension). ERISA also authorized the creation of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which is a government corporation that insures private-sector pension benefits up to a specified maximum in the case of plan termination.", "Single-employer DB funding rules generally require several steps: calculating the value of benefits that a plan will pay in the future; determining how much a plan has set aside to pay those benefits; and determining how much, and the time period over which, an employer must contribute to the plan each year.", "Since ERISA, Congress has periodically modified funding rules for pension plans. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA; P.L. 109-280 ) outlined new pension funding standards for single-employer DB plans, among other requirements. PPA required that plans become 100% funded over time and outlined assumptions that pension plans must use to become fully funded. PPA also provided special rules for DB plans sponsored by certain employers, such as some airlines and defense contractors.", "Since PPA was enacted, legislation has further modified funding rules for single-employer DB plans for various reasons. At times, legislation has applied broadly to most private-sector DB plans; at other times, changes to funding rules have targeted plans sponsored by specific industries or types of employers.", "At times, legislation has provided funding relief , which are measures that lower employer contributions. In general, funding relief measures allow plans more time to make required payments by (1) modifying assumptions that affect the calculated value of pension benefits or (2) extending the time period to make up for plan losses.", "The adoption of a funding corridor for interest rates in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141 ) marked a significant change to single-employer DB funding rules. DB plans calculate the present value of future benefits that will be owed using certain specified interest rates for discounting. In response to a period of low interest rates, MAP-21 established a process for determining minimum and maximum interest rates for discounting based on 25-year averages of historical corporate bond yields. As originally established, the funding corridor was scheduled to widen eventually, which, when applied to the specified interest rates, would have resulted in the use of lower interest rates to calculate DB pension obligations. Subsequent legislation delayed the date when the funding corridor is to begin widening. Under current law, the widening is scheduled to begin in 2021.", "Funding relief measures do not directly affect participants' benefits. However, they can result in pension plans having lower funding levels than they otherwise would at a point in time. Thus, funding relief can negatively affect PBGC's finances because it could take over a plan that has fewer assets than the plan otherwise would in the absence of funding relief. Funding relief can also affect PBGC's ability to pay non-guaranteed benefits, such as benefit increases implemented within five years prior to plan termination. On the other hand, funding relief can positively affect PBGC finances because greater DB plan underfunding results in higher variable-rate premiums (premiums based on the amount of plan underfunding) paid to PBGC by employers.", "This report provides (1) background on single-employer DB pension funding, (2) a discussion of funding rules under PPA, and (3) provisions since PPA that have provided funding relief or otherwise modified single-employer DB pension funding rules."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["A pension is a voluntary benefit offered by employers to assist employees in preparing for retirement. Pension plans may be classified according to whether they are (1) defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) plans and (2) sponsored by one or more than one employer. In DB plans, participants typically receive regular monthly benefit payments in retirement (which some refer to as a \"traditional\" pension). In DC plans, of which the 401(k) plan is the most common, participants have individual accounts that can provide a source of income in retirement. This report focuses on DB plans. ", "Pension plans are also classified by whether they are sponsored by one employer (single-employer plans) or by more than one employer (multiemployer and multiple-employer plans). Multiemployer pension plans are sponsored by more than one employer (often, though not required to be, in the same industry) and maintained as part of a collective bargaining agreement. Multiple-employer plans are sponsored by more than one employer but are not maintained as part of collective bargaining agreements. Multiple-employer plans follow the same funding rules as single-employer plans and are generally not reported separately. This report focuses on single-employer plans. Except where noted, references to single-employer plans in this report include multiple-employer plans.", "To protect the interests of pension plan participants and beneficiaries, Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; P.L. 93-406 ). The law is codified in the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) and Labor Code (29 U.S.C.). ERISA sets standards that private-sector pension plans must follow with regard to plan participation (who must be covered); minimum vesting requirements (how long a person must work for an employer to be covered); fiduciary duties (how individuals who oversee the plan must behave); and plan funding (how much employers must set aside to pay for future benefits). In addition, ERISA established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which is a government corporation that insures DB pension plans covered by ERISA in the case of plan termination. ERISA covers only private-sector pension plans and plans established by nonprofit organizations. It exempts pension plans established by the federal, state, and local governments and by churches.

", "The amount of a participant's benefit in a single-employer DB plan is based on a formula that typically uses a combination of length of service, accrual rate, and average of final years' salary. For example, a plan might specify that retirees receive an amount equal to 1.5% of their pay for each year of service, where the pay is the average of a worker's salary during his or her highest-paid five years.", "In general, ERISA requires DB plans to have enough assets set aside to pay the benefits owed to participants.

Actuarial values are used to determine the 100% funding goal and any additional employer contributions necessary to achieve that goal. The smoothing of asset values prevents large swings in asset values and creates a more predictable funding environment for plan sponsors. ", "Some advocates of reporting market values note that smoothed values are often higher than market values (particularly during periods of market declines), which could overstate the financial health of some pension plans. Some advocates of smoothing argue that market values are useful only if a plan needs to know its liquidated value (e.g., if the plan had to pay all of its benefit obligations at one point in time), which is unlikely to be the case as most employers sponsoring pension plans are unlikely to enter bankruptcy. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Liabilities", "paragraphs": ["A pension plan's benefits are a plan liability spread out over many years in the future. These future benefits are calculated and reported as present values (also called current values). Using a formula, benefits that are expected to be paid in a particular year in the future are calculated so they can be expressed as a present value. This process is called discounting , and it is the reverse of the process of compounding , which projects how much a current dollar amount will be worth at a point in the future. The formula by which future values are calculated as present values is shown in Figure 2 .", " Figure 3 shows a simplified example of a DB pension benefit calculation. In this example, it is assumed that at the beginning of year 1, the worker has already earned a benefit of $100 per year in retirement, which is expected to begin in year 5. Retirement is expected to last four years. Each of the payments is made at the beginning of the year and is discounted using the present value formula in Figure 2 and assuming an interest rate of 10%. In this example, the first benefit is received at the beginning of year 5, so that benefit payment is discounted over four years. The benefits for the following three years are also discounted to beginning of year 1 dollar amounts and are then summed, resulting in a benefit value of $238.16 at the beginning of year 1. ", "The calculated present value of the benefit payments depends on the year in which the benefit is calculated. For example, as a worker moves closer to the expected date of retirement and recalculates the present value of the benefit, the calculated value of the obligation increases. For example, when calculated at the beginning of year 2, the simplified pension benefit has a present value of $261.97 in year 2 dollars .

Funding ratios that are less than 100% indicate that the DB plan has not set aside enough to meet the calculated value of its future benefit obligations. Because benefit obligations are typically paid out over a period of 20 to 30 years, participants in even an underfunded plan will likely receive their promised benefits in the near term. However, if the underfunding persists without additional contributions or higher investment returns, plan participants in an underfunded plan might not receive 100% of their promised benefits in the future.", "Returning to the example above, setting aside $238.16 at the beginning of year 1 would fund the year 1 value of the benefit.

This discussion of the example in Figure 3 has reviewed the funding ratio and required payments for only the first three years displayed. In practice, the DB plan funding ratio would continue to be recalculated and payments necessary to satisfy any DB plan funding ratio shortfalls would continue to be required each year to ensure the DB plan funding obligation is fully satisfied. ", "The present value of a dollar amount is inversely related to the assumed interest rate. As the interest rate increases, present value decreases; as the interest rate decreases, present value increases. In the above example, if the interest rate is 15%, then the pension benefit has a value of $187.72 calculated at the beginning of year 1, $215.88 calculated at the beginning of year 2, and $248.26 calculated at the beginning of year 3.", "In this modification of the simplified example, with the only difference being a 15% interest rate, the pension benefit would be funded\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and assuming no investment gains or losses and no additional pension benefits \u00e2\u0080\u0094with contributions of $187.72 at the beginning of year 1; $215.88 - $187.72 = $28.16 at the beginning of year 2; and $248.26 - $215.88 = $32.38 at the beginning of year 3. This example shows payments for the first three years; in practice, contributions would continue until the obligation is fully satisfied.", "Note that the amounts of the yearly payments differ depending on the interest rate used. Compared with the payments in the 10% interest rate example, the initial payment in the 15% example is lower ($187.72 versus $238.16) but subsequent payments are higher (e.g., year 2 payments are $28.16 using the 15% interest rate and $23.81 using the 10% interest rate).

The considerations include the rationale for providing relief, the effects of lower levels of plan assets on participant benefits and PBGC, and the effect on the federal budget. ", "Funding relief results in lower employer contributions to DB plans in the near term. Among the rationales for funding relief is that it allows employers the flexibility to use funds for other priorities (such as retaining or hiring employees). For example, 74 trade associations said in a 2009 letter to policymakers that, \"[P]roviding defined benefit funding relief is directly related to improving the economy and employment.\" On the other hand, some policymakers oppose funding relief to specific industries or companies because they provide \"a special-interest bailout\" and set both \"bad policy and bad precedent.\" ", "Some stakeholders have expressed concern that employers adopting funding relief measures might use the funds saved via reduced contributions for non-core business activities. For example, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-192 ) limited the ability of employers that adopted funding relief measures to provide excess employee compensation or extraordinary dividends. ", "Although employer contributions and plan assets are lower following funding relief, participants' benefits are not necessarily at risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094although they may be under certain circumstances.", "Participants in DB plans that receive funding relief remain entitled to their benefits; funding relief does not reduce these benefits. For employers that do not become bankrupt, modifying the timing of contributions generally would not be problematic\u00e2\u0080\u0094over time, the employer would need to make all required contributions for participants to receive their full benefits.", "However, in the case of employer bankruptcy, the timing of contributions may negatively affect both participants' benefits and PBGC. Participants with benefits greater than the PBGC maximum guarantee or with non-guaranteed benefits might see reduced benefits when PBGC becomes trustee of their plan. Following funding relief, there are fewer plan assets available from which to pay non-guaranteed benefits because funding relief lowers employer contributions to DB plans in the short term. In addition, PBGC receives fewer assets from the plans that it trustees, which harms its financial position. ", "ERISA requires PBGC to be self-supporting and receives no appropriations from general revenue. ERISA states that the \"United States is not liable for any obligation or liability incurred by the corporation.\" Increasingly large amounts of unfunded liabilities in terminated plans may burden PBGC's single-employer insurance program. Although PBGC ended FY2019 with a surplus of $8.6 billion, the effects of (1) the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the financial health of employers and (2) the market downturn in early 2020 on the value of DB plan assets will likely worsen the funding position of single-employer pension plans and PBGC's financial position. ", "Funding relief can result in short-term revenue for Treasury and PBGC. Because employer contributions to pension plans are generally tax deductible, decreasing a plan's required contributions for a year (either through increasing the interest rate or extending the amortization period) increases the plan's taxable income. Some stakeholders point out that because funding relief provides revenue to Treasury, it has been used for budgetary offsets without regard to the policy justifications. Funding relief can positively affect PBGC finances because greater DB plan underfunding results in higher variable-rate premiums (premiums based on the amount of plan underfunding) paid by employers to PBGC."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.

The largest plan by number of participants in 2017 was the Retirement Security Plan, which had assets of $8.6 billion and a total funding target of $9.2 billion in that year.", "To determine which plans use CSEC funding rules, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) analyzed public-use Form 5500 data from the Department of Labor (DOL) for the 2014 to 2017 plan years. 2014 is the first year that Form 5500 includes an option to indicate the use of CSEC funding rules (following P.L. 113-97 ), and 2017 is the most recent year for which complete data are available.", "Most private-sector pension plans are required to submit annual forms to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), DOL, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). These forms generally include information about the plan, such as the number of participants, financial information, and the companies that provide services to the plan. In addition to Form 5500, pension plans are generally required to file information in specific schedules. For example, most single-employer and multiple-employer plans are required to file Schedule SB, which contains information specific to these plans. Each pension plan's Form 5500 and required schedules are available by search on DOL's website. Because data are self-reported, Table A-1 may not capture all plans that used CSEC funding rules or may include non-CSEC plans that erroneously identified as CSEC plans.", " Table A-1 provides data on private-sector defined benefit (DB) pension plans that indicated using CSEC funding rules on their 2014, 2015, 2016, or 2017 Schedule SB filings. Twenty-eight plans indicated using CSEC funding rules in multiple years. One plan, the Johns Hopkins Health System Corporation Plan, appeared to start using CSEC funding rules in 2017. Table A-1 provides the total number of participants, actuarial value of assets, total funding target, and funding target attainment percentage for the 29 plans (including the Johns Hopkins plan). ", "In addition to the Johns Hopkins plan, 10 plans indicated using CSEC funding rules in a single year but not in other years. An examination of individual plan filings from the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) showed that these plans did not use CSEC funding rules in the year they indicated having done so and are not included in this analysis. The Employee Benefit Plan of Jewish Community of Louisville, Inc., indicated using CSEC funding rules in 2014, 2015, and 2016, but a Form 5500 for the 2017 plan year is not available and is not included in Table A-1 .
