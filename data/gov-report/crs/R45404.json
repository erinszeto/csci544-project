Several startup companies are developing new supersonic commercial and business jets, hoping technological advances in materials, design, and engine efficiency will make it possible to produce commercially viable aircraft.", "The main regulatory issues related to supersonic flight remain unchanged from the Concorde era: limiting ground-level noise during subsonic flight and sonic booms during supersonic flight. Aircraft noise standards have become much stricter since the Concorde entered service, and the commercial aircraft fleet is considered to be 75% quieter overall than during the 1970s.

The speed of sound in Earth's atmosphere varies depending on temperature and other atmospheric conditions. Near sea level, it is typically about 760 miles per hour (mph). At the cruising altitude of commercial aircraft, where the air is much colder, it is often less than 700 mph.", "The ratio of an aircraft's speed divided by the speed of sound is known as its Mach number", "All current commercial aircraft are subsonic, with Mach number less than 1. For example, the typical cruising speed of a Boeing 777 airliner is Mach 0.84. Flight near Mach 1 is called transonic. Aircraft typically fly at such speeds only briefly while they accelerate from subsonic to supersonic or vice versa. They do not cruise near Mach 1 because they would experience high drag. Supersonic flight is faster than Mach 1. The Concorde cruised at about Mach 2.02 (roughly twice the speed of sound) when not over land. Some military aircraft fly at even higher supersonic speeds. Flight faster than Mach 5 is known as hypersonic. Hypersonic flight is currently limited to experimental aircraft and missiles as well as spacecraft reentering the atmosphere from orbit (the space shuttle during reentry flew at about Mach 25).", "As an aircraft flies, it disturbs the air through which it moves. The disturbance includes air flow around the aircraft as well as traveling pressure waves that humans perceive as sound. In subsonic flight, sound waves may be emitted in all directions. In supersonic flight, because the aircraft is flying faster than sound travels, all disturbances are behind the aircraft. Instead of sound waves, the pressure waves combine to form a shock wave, which people on the ground perceive as a sudden sonic boom after the aircraft passes (see Figure 1 ). Boom-related environmental impacts and community objections have been major issues for supersonic flight. Companies and government research programs are attempting to address these concerns by designing aircraft so that the shock waves produced by different components (such as the nose, wings, and engine) spread out in space and time, producing a longer but quieter \"thump\" rather than combining into a single loud boom."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Early SST Development", "paragraphs": ["Flying faster than the speed of sound is not a novel concept. In 1947, a U.S. Air Force experimental aircraft became the first manned aircraft to exceed Mach 1, breaking the \"sound barrier.\" This represented an important milestone for the burgeoning post-World War II aviation industry and set the stage for fierce international competition for speed and prestige. Notable supersonic developments include the Mach 2 British/Franco Concorde supersonic aircraft and the Mach 3.3 Lockheed SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft.", "While early research and development focused on military aircraft, by the early 1960s interest in developing supersonic civil aircraft grew worldwide. The Soviet Union became the first country to fly a supersonic passenger plane, the Tupolev TU-144, in 1968. The aircraft, which was designed to fly at Mach 2.2 and carry 140 passengers, went into production in 1972. However, a fatal crash at the 1973 Paris Air Show ended the Soviet Union's supersonic passenger ambition.", "In the United States, the supersonic technology developed in military aircraft programs led to interest in developing a supersonic transport for civilian applications. In June 1963, the government announced a major program to develop a supersonic passenger aircraft under the direction of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). However, several serious problems soon surfaced, including the need for considerable federal funding because of a development cost beyond the capabilities of any aircraft manufacturer, the lack of interest by the airlines due to their heavy investment in subsonic jets and their doubts about the financial viability of supersonic passenger aircraft, and the major challenges of addressing environmental concerns.", "The FAA program was eventually terminated by Congress in 1971, amid delays in prototype development and opposition on cost and environmental grounds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demise of the Concorde", "paragraphs": ["The Franco-British Concorde was the product of a costly joint project of the British and the French governments. In January 1976, the first flight of the Concorde, also the world's first trans-oceanic supersonic passenger flight, took off from London Heathrow to Bahrain. More than 2.5 million passengers flew supersonically before Concorde was taken out of service in 2003. With a cruising altitude of about 65,000 feet (nearly twice as high as subsonic airliners) and a speed of over twice the speed of sound, a typical journey between London and New York on the Concorde took about three and a half hours, as opposed to about seven hours on a subsonic nonstop flight. Although the Concorde was considered an aeronautical achievement and a symbol of national prestige by many, it did not turn out to be a commercial success for a variety of reasons.", "As a government endeavor, the Concorde was a very costly project. Although there has not been an accurate accounting of the costs, it was argued in 1976 that the official figure of \u00a31.46 billion had been a drastic underestimate, and that the program cost of Concorde was nearly \u00a34.26 billion. This was approximately \u00a329.15 billion in 2017 pounds, equivalent to about $37.52 billion in U.S. dollars. Concorde aircraft were also expensive to operate, reportedly using almost three times as much fuel per passenger mile as subsonic aircraft. This drove up operating costs considerably, especially during the period of high oil prices in the 1970s and early 1980s.", "High subsonic noise levels during takeoffs and landings and sonic boom impacts from cruise flight generated considerable concern. Many countries banned Concorde flights from their airspace\u2014it was reported that nearly half the planned routes, especially those over land, were prohibited. U.S. civil aviation regulations did and still do prohibit overland supersonic flights in the continental United States. This contributed to Concorde's low utilization rate and effectively limited its flights to a limited number of oceanic routes between big cities, including scheduled trans-Atlantic flights between London and New York.", "Providing premium air travel on selected routes, however, failed to make Concorde flights a sustainable business. Even as the development costs of the Concorde were written off by the British and French governments, few airlines were interested in purchasing a Concorde aircraft. Of the 20 Concordes ever manufactured, 14 were sold to the state-owned carriers of the two countries involved in building the planes: seven to British Airways and seven to Air France. The remainder were built as prototypes and flight test aircraft. All other orders for the Concorde were canceled.", "Filling the seats on Concorde flights with paying customers was not easy. Concorde tickets were generally priced at about twice the regular first-class airfare on a comparable subsonic flight. For example, in 2003, a round trip across the Atlantic on the Concorde cost \u00a38,000, equivalent to about $15,475 in 2017 U.S. dollars, almost twice the first-class ticket price on a Boeing 747. Once the attraction of novelty wore off, the airlines found it difficult to fill the seats, often flying at less than half capacity. The plane was also impractical for carrying cargo or mail, given the limited cargo space on the Concorde. The airlines were therefore unable to generate additional revenue from these sources, which are important supplemental revenue streams for subsonic transoceanic passenger flights.", "According to figures from the British government, during the first five years of Concorde operations, British Airways recorded a loss of \u00a310.4 million and Air France a loss of \u00a336.7 million. However, the airlines claimed that in some years the SST operations were profitable. This occasional profitability was based on the fact that Concorde's development and capital costs were absorbed by the British and the French governments. In essence, the Concorde was too expensive for the airlines to operate and maintain with consistent profitability, even though they bore none of the cost of designing and building it.", "On July 25, 2000, Air France New York-bound flight 4590 took off from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. During the take-off acceleration, one of the tires ran over a strip of metal on the runway that had fallen from a previous aircraft. The metal strip shredded the tire. Part of the rubber hit a fuel tank, sending shock waves that burst a valve. Fuel started to pour out and was ignited by sparks from the landing gear damaged by the debris. The aircraft crashed into a hotel in the village of Gonesse, five miles from the runway. All 100 passengers and nine crew members were killed, along with four hotel employees on the ground. This sole fatal accident in the Concorde's operational history generated significant media coverage and damaged the Concorde's reputation for safety.", "Following the crash, safety modifications were made. The first test flight of a modified aircraft was completed successfully in July 2001. The first regular Concorde passenger flight after the accident soon followed, on September 11, 2001. That was also the day that terrorist hijackers used civilian aircraft to attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. The 9/11 terrorist attacks caused a significant drop in demand for air travel in general and for premium air travel in particular amid a global economic downturn. In 2003 all Concorde flights were discontinued due to financial losses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Renewed Interest in Supersonic Passenger Flights", "paragraphs": ["The Concorde demonstrated that supersonic passenger travel was technically achievable.

A supersonic aircraft may gain some advantage from its so-called \"speed dividend\"\u2014commercial airlines with scheduled flights, charter carriers, and operators of on-demand and business jets would be able to get more trips out of the aircraft, and hence greater asset utilization. However, the speed dividend can be achieved only if the airline can maintain a high load factor while keeping maintenance and ground turnaround time brief.", "A supersonic airplane designed for commercial passenger service would face competition from subsonic planes. Modern subsonic widebody aircraft such as the Airbus A 350 and Boeing 787 are able to fly very long distances nonstop, such as the Singapore-Newark route spanning 8,285 nautical miles (about 9,534 miles, or 15,343 kilometers), which Singapore Airlines inaugurated in October 2018. An airline offering SST service would need to identify a city pair between which there are enough passengers willing to pay a high enough fare to turn a profit. It will need to convince its customers that the fare premiums are worth the time saved and worth sacrificing the presumed comfort in premium cabins on competing subsonic flights.", "On the other hand, the fact that modern subsonic aircraft are able fly very long distances means flight time gets extended as well, suggesting there could be demand for higher-priced flights offering much shortened travel time. As air travel becomes increasingly commoditized and generic, supersonic flights could be a unique service that would enable an airline to differentiate itself from the crowd.", "There may be an entirely separate market for supersonic business jets. Many large corporations fly their top executives aboard private aircraft for security reasons and to minimize wasted time. Supersonic planes could be attractive for this purpose.

However, several trans-Pacific routes, routes from western U.S. cities to Europe, and flights from the United States to Africa or the Middle East would require refueling stops.

ICAO has indicated that it anticipates reaching a standard for certifying supersonic aircraft in the 2020-2025 timeframe. Operational standards pertain to the way an aircraft may be used. Noise standards in the United States and other countries, dating to the early years of the Concorde, prohibit supersonic flight over land.

If these sudden pressure changes reach the ear they will be perceived as booms, similar to the clap of thunder.", "The intensity of the boom will depend on the shape, size, and weight of the aircraft, as well as atmospheric factors such as wind, temperature, and humidity. Like explosions and other impulsive sounds, sonic booms are measured in terms of the increase in pressure (or \"overpressure\") they produce compared to normal pressure of the atmosphere (nominally 14.7 pounds per square inch, or 2,116 pounds per square foot). Humans may tend to find sonic boom overpressures above 1 pound per square foot to be objectionable. Overpressures of 1 to 2 pounds at the surface are typical of current-day supersonic aircraft, including military fighter jets and the retired Concorde supersonic jetliner, flying at typical cruise altitudes of 30,000 to 50,000 feet. Maneuvering during supersonic flight or rare atmospheric anomalies may cause higher boom overpressures to reach the surface. Higher overpressures may increase the likelihood of public reaction and, in very rare instances, may cause physical discomfort and break windows.", "Current regulations prohibit civil aircraft from operating at speeds greater than the speed of sound in U.S. airspace. Exceptions can be authorized on a case-by-case basis, and are generally requested for flight testing of military aircraft types by manufacturers and other civilian organizations supporting Department of Defense flight testing programs. In addition, manufacturers of certain civilian aircraft may petition FAA to obtain authorization to exceed the speed of sound in flight testing. In such a petition, applicants must specify a designated test area, usually over sparsely populated lands, and must demonstrate that the purpose of the flights is for testing to show compliance with aircraft certification requirements, to determine the sonic boom characteristics of the aircraft or establish means to reduce or eliminate the effects of sonic boom, or to establish the parameters under which the aircraft's supersonic flight will not cause measurable sonic boom impacts on the ground. In rare cases, FAA may approve supersonic flights outside of a designated test area if the petitioner can demonstrate that the flights will not produce measurable sonic boom overpressures that reach the ground under all foreseeable operating conditions.", "Manufacturers are likely to seek authorization to operate at supersonic speeds over land. The Federal Interagency Committee on Aviation Noise (FICAN) has indicated that, in order to obtain such authorization, a manufacturer will need to demonstrate either that the aircraft is capable of flying at supersonic speeds without its sonic boom reaching the ground (a capability known as Mach cut-off flight) or that the sonic boom impact on the ground is significantly attenuated compared to existing supersonic aircraft designs.", "The companies now developing supersonic aircraft believe that they will be able to demonstrate Mach cut-off capabilities or sonic boom signatures that are much quieter and much more acceptable to the public than existing supersonic aircraft.

The company expects that cruise speeds over land will initially be restricted to below Mach 1.0, and advertises that its plane's envisioned subsonic cruise speed of Mach 0.95 will be faster than current commercial jets and will not produce a sonic boom. The projected maximum speed over water is Mach 1.4, about 65% faster than a typical long-range jet airliner. Aerion has had to throttle back on its speed expectations due to noise and heat limitations of existing engine designs. Spike Aerospace anticipates that its Spike S-512 will be able to achieve a supersonic cruise speed of Mach 1.6 with a sonic boom having a perceived loudness of less than 75 decibels (dB) at ground level. Boom Technology seeks to produce a three-engine airliner that will be capable of cruise speeds of Mach 2.2 but will be 30 times quieter than the Concorde at supersonic speed.

Reportedly, \"[t]here are concerns that a U.S.-only standard for sonic boom could be higher than NASA's 75 PNLdB target, which compares to the Concordes's 110 PNLdB, and could jeopardize public acceptance of supersonic travel.\" If other countries insist that supersonic aircraft meet Chapter 14/Stage 5 subsonic noise standards, engine options may be more limited, potentially impacting speed, range, and emissions characteristics of supersonic designs.", "Reportedly, efforts to move forward with international certification standards for supersonic aircraft are facing resistance from European nations that want the aircraft to adhere to strict noise guidelines, particularly for landing and takeoff phases of flight. Developers of supersonic aircraft have cautioned that a protracted debate to set international standards could delay progress on development, and FAA has urged agreement on standards as soon as practicable so that manufacturers can have certainty regarding certification requirements.", "Gaining international consensus and approvals to fly supersonically over other countries besides the United States may be a critical element in determining the market viability of future civil supersonic aircraft designs. International agreements would also need to address permissible conditions for supersonic flight operations over water and over polar regions.", "Polar flights may be a first step for future supersonic aircraft operations if supersonic flight over land is not immediately authorized. Polar airspace has become increasingly important to aviation as polar routes offering shorter flights between the United States and Asia have opened up to civil aircraft operations over the past decade. Approvals to fly at supersonic speeds along these polar routes and along transoceanic routes would generally fall under the purview of countries' delegated authority to oversee the management of airspace in these regions, pursuant to ICAO standards and guidelines. The United States has been delegated authority to oversee air traffic over large areas of the northern Pacific and northern Atlantic oceans and portions of the Arctic, while Canada, Iceland, and Russia control much of the airspace overlying the polar regions of the Arctic Circle under international agreement. As the main selling point of supersonic flight is speed, access to these time-saving international routes could be a critical factor in the potential commercial success of future civil supersonic aircraft."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
