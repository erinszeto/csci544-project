Antidumping, another kind of trade remedy action, addresses products sold in the United States at less than their fair value (as defined by law) in a similar manner. Although antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) laws and procedures generally parallel each other, CVD laws contain no specific provisions for investigations on imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries, while the AD statute does provide such guidelines.", "Initial administrative attempts in 1983 to apply countervailing remedies to allegedly subsidized imports from several NME countries led to determinations by the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce (the U.S. agency charged with determining the existence and extent of subsidies) that subsidies within the meaning of the countervailing law, cannot be found in nonmarket economies. These ITA determinations were challenged in the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), which held that they were \"not in accordance with the law,\" reversed them, and remanded the cases to the ITA. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed, and reinstated the ITA's original determinations\u2014thus affirming that the ITA has the discretion not to apply the CVD law to NME countries.", "The ITA reevaluated this decision, with respect to China only, during a countervailing investigation on coated free sheet (CFS) paper. On October 18, 2007, the ITA made a final affirmative determination of subsidies in the investigation, finding net countervailable subsidies ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Although the International Trade Commission (the U.S. agency charged with determining whether the U.S. industry suffered material injury as a result of the subsidy) made a negative injury determination in the investigation, meaning that no CVD duties were assessed, other industries pursued countervailing investigations as a result of the ITA's decision. As of this writing, countervailing duties have been placed on 13 products from China, and at least 8 investigations are pending.", "Legislation seeking to apply CVD action to NME countries introduced in the 111th Congress includes H.R. 496 and H.R. 499, both introduced on January 14, 2009."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Countervailing duty laws attempt to provide relief to domestic industries that have been, or are threatened with, material injury as a result of imported goods sold in the U.S. market that have been found to be subsidized by a foreign government or public entity.

Prior to a 2007 CVD investigation on coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, the ITA determined that it would not apply CVD laws to nonmarket economy (NME) countries, including China, because the agency believed that there was no adequate way to measure market distortions caused by subsidies in an economy that is not based on market principles. However, in the context of the 2007 investigation, the ITA determined that it may be possible to identify subsidies in China because many industries in the China operate according to market principles. The ITA had previously reaffirmed that China was an NME country. The 2007 subsidy decision was a China-specific determination, and thus is not applicable to other NME countries.", "For purposes of the trade remedy laws, the ITA is also the agency responsible for designating countries as nonmarket economies, defined in U.S. law as \"any foreign country that the administering authority [the ITA] determines does not operate on market principles of cost or pricing structures, so that sales of merchandise in such country do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise.\" NME designations are based on the extent to which (1) the country's currency is convertible; (2) its wage rates result from free bargaining between labor and management; (3) joint ventures or other foreign investment are permitted; (4) the government owns or controls the means of production; and (5) the government controls the allocation of resources and price and output decisions. The ITA may also consider other factors that it considers appropriate. ITA-designated NME countries as of this writing are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.", "The ITA first made the determination not to apply CVD action to NME countries in 1983-1984 in connection with countervailing investigations of two cases of alleged subsidization, one dealing with carbon steel wire rod imported from Czechoslovakia and Poland, and the other with imports of potassium chloride (potash) from the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and the Soviet Union.

Many U.S. domestic producers alleged for years that they were adversely impacted by China's subsidizing its industries, but the 1984 ITA ruling meant that there was essentially no recourse to deal with the issue of subsidies. ", "China is the chief target of U.S. antidumping action, however, with over 80 AD duty orders in place as of August 12, 2010. In addition, AD duty amounts tend to be higher for Chinese imports, due in part to the methodology employed by the ITA when calculating AD duties for NME countries.", "A related concern involves assertions by many U.S. policymakers, business people, and labor representatives that China's currency is significantly undervalued vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar, which, they allege, makes Chinese exports much cheaper than they would be if Chinese exchange rates were determined by market forces. In turn, they maintain that the undervalued currency has contributed to the U.S. trade deficit with China, and has injured U.S. production and employment in several manufacturing sectors (such as apparel and furniture) because U.S. companies must compete with \"artificially\" lower cost goods from China. The issue of alleged Chinese \"currency manipulation\" or \"misalignment\" is another factor that led to renewed congressional interest in applying countervailing action to imports from China, and in turn, to finding currency manipulation countervailable.

Both laws also required a determination of the existence and amount of subsidization to be countervailed, but one of the laws also required a finding that the subsidized imports have caused or threatened to cause injury to a U.S. domestic industry.", "The earlier of the two laws (Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, repealed in January 1995) was a modified version of a countervailing law initially enacted by the Tariff Act of 1897. This law was applicable only to products of countries other than those \"under the Agreement.\" Countries \"under the Agreement\" referred to (1) any country to which the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Subsidies and Countervailing Code applied, or (2) had assumed Code-equivalent obligations with respect to the United States, or (3) the President determined the existence of an agreement with the United States containing certain relevant provisions specifically spelled out in the statute.

The petitions alleged that manufacturers, producers, or exporters of the product in question in either country received public benefits within the meaning of the countervailing law. Specifically, the petitions for countervailing action alleged that \"bounties or grants\" were provided in both countries in the form of a multiple exchange rate system, and a partial hard-currency retention program for exporting firms. In addition, Czechoslovakia allegedly had in effect a system of industry-specific trade conversion coefficients for the official exchange rate, and tax exemption for foreign trade earnings, while Poland provided price equalization payments for losses incurred due to foreign sales below domestic prices.", "Both cases proceeded in parallel, and the determinations on issues they had in common were identical except for a few minor, country-specific differences. Therefore, page references to the Federal Register included in this report will be only those dealing with the Czechoslovak case, unless an issue specific to one country is discussed.", "In its notices of initiation of investigation, the ITA found both countries to be \"countries not under the Agreement,\" and conducted the countervailing procedure according to provisions of Section 303, hence, without the need for determining injury. In addition, the ITA considered both of them nonmarket economy (NME) countries, but specifically pointed out that it had not yet resolved the question \"whether the countervailing duty law [either Section 303 or the countervailing duty provision of Title VII] applies to nonmarket economy countries [as such].\"", "Although this issue had arisen almost a year earlier in connection with a CVD investigation of textile imports from China, it was not resolved then because the CVD petition was withdrawn by the petitioners, meaning that the investigation terminated. The issue, however, was subsequently addressed in the preliminary determinations in the two carbon steel wire rod cases. In both cases, the ITA found that \"nonmarket economy countries are not exempted per se from the countervailing duty law,\" since Section 303, by its statutory terms as well as based on its legislative history, applied to \" any country...\"", "Weighing its own tentative initial literal interpretation of the country applicability of the provision and the arguments introduced earlier in the consideration of the China textiles case\u2014focusing on the difference in the effects of government intervention in a market and nonmarket economy\u2014the ITA, however, was \"dispose[d] to not exclude nonmarket ... economies from its application without further review in each particular case.\" The ITA, consequently, had its \"first opportunity to determine preliminarily whether practices by a government of a so-called nonmarket economy country confer countervailable benefits.\"", "Focusing on prices as the key elements of subsidization, the ITA, in the ensuing detailed analysis of the situation in both countries, pointed out that", "[i]n nonmarket economies, central planners typically set the prices without any regard to their economic value. As such, these prices do not reflect scarcity or abundance. For example, when a product is scarce in a market economy, its price will increase. In a nonmarket economy, however, the price of a scarce good will not go up unless the central planners mandate a new, higher price. Even if we can identify an internally set price, that price does not have the same meaning as a price in a market economy (49 F.R. 6770).", "The ITA then analyzed in detail the alleged subsidization programs by determining, first, whether they would confer a subsidy in a market economy, and then whether the conclusion would be different for an NME country. The ITA concluded preliminarily that multiple exchange rates, currency retention schemes, trade conversion coefficients, and price equalization payments do not confer a bounty or grant either in market or in nonmarket economies; that the Polish adjustment coefficient program did not constitute a bounty or grant within the meaning of the law; and that the agency had not received sufficient timely information on the Czechoslovak tax exemption program to make a determination. On the basis of these findings, the ITA preliminarily determined that, while Congress did not exempt NME countries as such from the CVD law, the alleged Czechoslovak and Polish practices were not providing bounties or grants within the meaning of the CVD law. As the CVD law required, the ITA continued both investigations into their final phase.", "In the final phase of these two investigations, the ITA focused on the unresolved issue of the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. In its detailed and comprehensive final determinations in the two carbon steel wire rod cases, the ITA first concluded \"that Congress never has confronted directly the question of whether the countervailing duty law applies to NME countries.\" It pointed out that Congress did not even debate, much less legislate on this issue, either in 1974 (when the concept of nonmarket economy countries was introduced into trade legislation and remedies were provided specifically with respect to imports from them, and Congress also amended the CVD law) or in 1979 (when the CVD law was thoroughly restructured, and the application of unfair-pricing remedial legislation was dealt with in detail, but only with respect to dumping by NME countries).", "The ITA found it significant that, in the Trade Act of 1974, Congress enacted remedial provisions dealing specifically with injurious imports from \"State-controlled-economy\" or \"Communist\" countries\u2014both terms functionally equivalent to that of \"nonmarket economy\" countries used in another part of the same Act\u2014in the context of antidumping and \"market disruption\" (NME-specific import-relief action) but not with respect to countervailing action. In this, pointed out the ITA, citing the Senate report on the 1974 Act (S.Rept. 93-1298), Congress recognized the need for special remedial legislation applicable to State-controlled-economy countries because traditional fair- or unfair-trade remedies were insufficient or have proven inappropriate or ineffective because in \"State-controlled-economy countries ... supply and demand forces do not operate to produce prices\" and \"because of the difficulty of [the] application [of such remedies] to products from State-controlled economies\" (cited at 49 F.R. 19373).", "Likewise, in the legislative history of the thorough restructuring of the CVD law by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, there was nothing regarding any aspect of the application of the CVD law to NME countries, although the Subsidies and Countervailing Code of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, implemented for the United States by that act, in Article 15 \"explicitly permits [GATT] signatories to regulate unfairly priced imports from NME countries under either antidumping or countervailing duty legislation\" (49 F.R. 19373).", "The ITA also consulted with other U.S. government and academic sources, which, briefly, concluded that \"it is ... only 'remotely possible' to identify and quantify subsidies in NMEs;\" \"most of the analysis used thus far for ... subsidies, is entirely inapplicable.... Theoretically, any given sale may be subsidized or not, but since there is no market reference point, it is idle to speak in such terms.\" To one author, the countervailing duty law appears to require identification and measurement of a resource transfer from the state to the producer, but \"this is simply not a measurable event in the typical nonmarket economy;\" and \"The extent to which a nonmarket system ... can be said to be subsidizing will always be unclear\" (all cited at 49 F.R. 19374).", "Claiming broad discretion in this matter earlier recognized by the judiciary, the ITA concluded that a \"bounty or grant,\" within the meaning of the countervailing duty law, cannot be found in an NME. The ITA also determined that Czechoslovakia and Poland were NMEs, since they operated \"on principles of nonmarket cost or pricing structures so that sales or offers for sale of merchandise ... do not reflect the value of the merchandise.\" Accordingly, the ITA determined that manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Czechoslovakia and Poland did not receive bounties or grants, and issued, effective May 7, 1984, final negative countervailing duty determinations.", "Shortly before the completion of the countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod, two U.S. chemical manufacturers filed (on March 30, 1984) petitions alleging subsidization of potassium chloride (potash) imported from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, whereupon the respective investigations were initiated as of April 26, 1984. Because of the subsequent determination in the carbon steel wire rod cases that bounties or grants within the meaning of the countervailing duty law cannot be found in an NME (and both countries were determined to be NMEs), the ITA on June 6, 1984, rescinded the two potassium chloride (potash) investigations and dismissed the relevant petitions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1991", "paragraphs": ["Since the conclusion of the wire rod and potash countervailing duty cases (see next section) the ITA has not initiated any countervailing investigations of allegedly subsidized imports from NME countries, with one specialized exception.

The petitioner claimed that, while China was an NME country, \"the PRC fan sector operates substantially pursuant to market principles and that the CVD law should apply.\"", "The petition was apparently based on the fact that ITA had, meanwhile, procedurally introduced into antidumping investigations of imports from NME countries the concept of market-oriented industry (MOI) as a means of determining whether an industry in an NME country is sufficiently market-oriented (i.e., free from state control) to enable the ITA to use the economic data provided by the industry itself (rather than those of a surrogate market-economy country) in determining fair market value of the imported product subject to the investigation.", "The petitioners in the Chinese fan CVD case claimed that the Chinese fan industry was an MOI with dependable self-provided data (including those relating to subsidization) and, hence, could objectively be subjected to a countervailing investigation. In its preliminary investigation, the ITA concluded that the prices of several inputs are not market-determined and, hence, the industry cannot be considered an MOI, but believed that the information used as the basis for the determination should be verified and did not rescind the investigation. In its final, more comprehensive phase of the investigation, the ITA concluded that \"the prices of several significant inputs are not market-determined\" and therefore \"the PC fans industry is not an MOI.\" ... \"As a result ... the CVD law cannot be applied to the PRC fan industry\" and the ITA issued final negative determination in the case."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Court Decisions28", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Court of International Trade (614 F.

The court emphasized that, absent clear legislative intent to the contrary, the plain language of the CVD law must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive (p. 551). Hence, it applies to any country and, therefore, does not allow for any per se exemptions of any political entity, a fact that the ITA itself appears to have recognized in its determinations.", "The ITA, in the court's view, \"institute[d], by administrative fiat, a major exemption for countries with nonmarket economies\" by redefining the term \"subsidy\" as \"a distortion of the operation [solely] of a market economy,\" thereby attempting to amend the CVD law (p. 552). Although the ITA had recognized that the CVD law did not allow for per se exemptions (see p. 3), it claimed that countries with nonmarket economies (i.e., political entities of a certain type ) were exempt because of their NME status, illogically contradicting the meaning of the CVD statute. The difficulties of the CVD law, said the CIT, are not those of its meaning , but rather problems of measurement , which are precisely within the expertise of the agency.\" The ITA \"has the authority and ability to detect patterns of regularity and investigate beneficial deviations from those patterns\u2014and it must do so regardless of the form of the economy\" (p. 554).", "As to the ITA's argument that Congress' \"silence\" on the applicability of the CVD law to NME countries and its apparent preference for other remedial measures\u2014among them antidumping law, which does contain specific provisions dealing with NME countries\u2014the CIT pointed out that those measures have been established for remedying specific trade problems other than subsidization. Moreover, said the court.

It also does not affect ITA's determination that it is unable to find subsidies in NME countries other than China. Therefore, Congress may want to consider legislation ensuring that the CVD laws and actions specifically apply to other NME countries as well as China. Vietnam, another U.S. trading partner of increasing significance, is also an NME country. However, the amount of trade with the other remaining NME countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) is not particularly significant at present, and to date, there are no outstanding AD orders or other significant trade disputes with these countries.", "Second, there are currently no specific factors to consider or methodologies provided in the trade remedy laws for administrative authorities to use when identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies.

AD duties tend to be higher than countervailing duties in general, and AD duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries tend to be even higher, in part due to the use of the third-country data methodology to calculate the amount of dumping. If China retained its NME status and subsidies were found on targeted merchandise for which AD duties were already in place, some of the companion AD duties might have to be revised downward in order to avoid \"double counting\"\u2015or the possible inclusion of export subsidy amounts in certain AD duty calculations). In a June 2005 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated that this consideration \"introduces a level of uncertainty about the magnitude of the total level of protection that would be applied to Chinese products,\" and \"may result in combined rates that are lower than might be expected.\"", "Therefore, a determination by ITA that it can target subsidies in China, or legislation amending the statute, could result in the unintended consequence of an overall reduction in the amount of protection provided. However, since the two remedies address substantially different forms of price manipulation, it is also possible that some U.S. industries that had not been able in the past to obtain relief through the AD statute may be able to do so through CVD procedures."], "subsections": []}]}}
