Hydropower currently accounts for about 6% of the electricity produced in the United States, and the generation of electricity from hydropower produces essentially no emissions of carbon.

That balance can be aided by research into new technologies and forward-thinking regulations that encourage the development of these resources in cost-effective, environmentally friendly ways which recognize that such facilities, once built, can last for at least 50 years.", "A feasibility study by the Idaho National Laboratory in 2006 presented an assessment of the potential for development of small and low-head power resources for hydroelectric generation in the United States. Approximately 5,400 of 100,000 sites were determined to have potential for small hydro projects (i.e., providing between 1 and 30 Megawatts of annual mean power). The U.S. Department of Energy estimated that these projects (if developed) would result in a greater than 50% increase in total hydroelectric power generation. Low-head hydropower usually refers to sites with a head (i.e., elevation difference) of less than five meters (about 16 feet).", "Run-of-river hydropower facilities generally rely on the natural flow of rivers and streams, and are able to utilize smaller water flow volumes without the need to build large reservoirs. Infrastructure designed to move water in conduits such as canals, irrigation ditches, aqueducts, and pipelines can also be harnessed to produce electricity. Pressure reducing valves used in water supply systems and industry to reduce the buildup of fluid pressure in a valve or to reduce pressure to a level appropriate for use by water system customers offer additional opportunities for power generation.", "Several bills currently pending in Congress for climate change mitigation and clean energy seek to establish a federal renewable energy (or electricity) standard (RES).

Under current proposals, the RES would require retail electric suppliers to obtain increasing percentages of renewable electricity for the power they provide to customers. Although hydropower is generally considered as a clean source of electric power, only hydrokinetic technologies (which rely on moving water) and limited applications of hydropower would qualify for the RES. Given the current language in pending bills, it is unlikely that most new run-of-river low-head and small hydropower projects would meet the requirements for \"qualified hydropower\" unless these projects are installed at existing non-hydropower dams.", "Given the smaller size of projects relative to the costs for development for small and low-head hydropower, incentive rates for electricity produced over time may increase the feasibility of a project based on power sales.

Another approach to hydropower does not usually require significant water storage and depends on the flow of rivers or streams to generate electricity. These are called \"run-of-river\" plants.", "Impoundment of water in reservoirs behind dams allows power generation to be easily controlled, and makes the release of water adaptable to changing levels of demand for electricity. Water flows down a \"penstock\" or pipe to turn the blades of a turbine-generator (see Figure 1 ). The amount of electricity that can be produced depends on the volume of water flow, and the elevation difference (called \"head\") between the water's surface and the turbine-generator. The power produced can be used locally or sent over transmission lines to industrial or population centers.

When dams flood significant portions of land upstream, turning rivers into lakes, the change in habitat can affect wildlife and have especially dramatic impacts on migratory fish populations. Similarly, the development of dams can adversely affect water quality, as the clearing of trees can result in soil erosion and landslides which can lead to a buildup of sediments and clogged streams. Spilling water from dams can force atmospheric gases into solution in the basin water below, making the basin water supersaturated. Fish in these waters can be killed when dissolved gases in their circulatory system come out of solution to form bubbles which block the flow of blood through the capillary vessels.", "Water quality for aquatic life can also deteriorate if reservoirs limit the natural flow of water in summertime. Water can become stratified, with warmer water collecting at the surface and cooler water staying at the bottom. Because the bottom water is isolated from aeration, it loses its oxygen. Many fish cannot live in these conditions. When this deep water passes through hydropower turbines, it is still low in dissolved oxygen and it can also affect the quality of water downstream of the dam. A lack of oxygen in deep reservoir water can also cause certain metals to dissolve more readily from surrounding rocks, and these metals can be released to the downstream river where they can cause water to become toxic. ", "Even if the water quality is not degraded, major habitat impacts can occur if the natural hydrology of the river is changed (i.e., \"in-stream flow\" effects). If the amount of water released downstream changes, either on a seasonal basis or even on an hourly basis, adverse effects on fish and other organisms can result. Dams are also associated with a number of other unfavorable environmental consequences, such as the release of soil mercury into aquatic environments, and the release of methane from decaying vegetation, but these effects may be temporary (i.e., less than 10 years).

In certain instances, it may be possible to replace PRVs with a \"reverse pump\" which can reduce the pressure in a water system while simultaneously generating electricity. A similar concept can generate electricity when water is transferred between reservoirs or is released to rivers to maintain seasonal water levels.

Most of the negative environmental impacts of small hydro development can be mitigated by good design and operating practices to avoid interference with seasonal water flows and minimize impacts on fish and flooding patterns. Nonetheless, environmental impacts can occur. Greenfield development at a small hydropower site can cause problems due to dam construction, and operation and flooding of the upstream river. Although flooding is not an issue with small hydro developments at existing dams, the installation of a hydroelectric development, if not operated as run-of-river, can change the flow regime and affect fish and other wildlife and their habitats above and below the dam. Low-head hydropower development also has the potential to affect environmental components such as water quality, soils, and groundwater, as well as terrestrial and aquatic habitats and associated animals and plants, with the construction and operation phases of a project potentially affecting the local environment.

With the power output of a turbine/generator largely dependent on head and flow rate, decreased head must be compensated for by increased flow to produce the same amount of power. The size and cost of water conveyance structures and electromechanical equipment depend largely on flow rate. Construction costs can proportionately increase per installed kilowatt for low head developments. While placing a turbine/generator set directly in a stream can reduce the need for structural works, lower head electromechanical equipment usually gives less power per unit of weight. Also, with many low-head hydro projects being subject to a large variation in either the head or the flow, expensive frequency and voltage control equipment is often needed. ", "Some of the new ideas emerging for low-head hydropower include concepts such as unregulated turbines which vary speed with head or flow, and permanent magnet-type generators (PMG) which produce an output voltage that varies with head and flow. Although varying the output voltage in this way may allow for a greater range of operation, PMG technology faces challenges in achieving electric grid connection approval because of synchronization issues. PMG may see increasing applications to hydropower projects as the cost of producing the magnets from rare earth metals is decreasing with patent expirations, and electronic interfaces are developed to provide synchronization. Other technologies are being developed for very low-head turbines, such as a direct-drive variable speed PMG which can be placed directly in a flow channel with approximately four to eight feet of head. This concept can reduce civil works required for intake structures or water conveyance, and the associated cost of those works.
