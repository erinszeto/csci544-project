Collectively, these policies have been referred to by some as the \"fiscal cliff.\" Extending current revenue policies (e.g., extending the Bush tax cuts) and changing current spending policies (e.g., not allowing the BCA sequester to take effect) would increase the projected budget deficit relative to current law. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that if current law remains in place, the budget deficit will fall by $502 billion between FY2012 and FY2013.", "Revenue provisions that are set to expire at the end of 2012 include the \"Bush tax cuts,\" as well as provisions related to the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Collectively, the Bush tax cuts reduced income taxes by reducing tax rates, reduced the marriage penalty, repealed limitations on personal exemptions and itemized deductions (PEP and Pease, respectively), expanded refundable credits, and modified education tax incentives. The Bush tax cuts also reduced estate tax liabilities by increasing the amount of an estate exempt from taxation and by lowering the tax rate. The two-percentage-point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax is also set to expire at the end of 2012 and a number of temporary tax provisions (also known as \"tax extenders\") expired at the end of 2011 with more scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. Under current law, these provisions are collectively estimated to reduce the budget deficit by nearly $400 billion between FY2012 and FY2013.", "There are a variety of spending policies set to change at the end of 2012 or early in 2013. These include the federal share of extended benefit payments for unemployment and the authorization for temporary emergency unemployment benefits. Payments to physicians under Medicare are scheduled to be reduced by 27% in 2013 under the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system. Automatic spending cuts enacted as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) are scheduled to reduce spending beginning in FY2013. Under current law, these policy changes are collectively estimated to reduce the budget deficit by over $100 billion between FY2012 and FY2013.", "In making fiscal policy choices, Congress will have to weigh the benefits of deficit reduction against the potential implications of fiscal policy choices for the ongoing economic recovery. Maintaining current revenue and spending policies will add to the deficit, while increasing revenues and reducing spending, as under current law, could slow economic growth. Thus, deficit reduction measures must be balanced against concerns that spending cuts or tax increases could dampen an already weak economic recovery. CBO has concluded that allowing current law fiscal policies to take effect will dampen short-term economic growth, but accelerate long-term economic growth. Conversely, CBO has concluded that postponing the fiscal restraint would accelerate short-term economic growth, but dampen long-term economic growth. In that context, several policy observers have recommended implementing a credible medium-term plan that balances economic considerations with deficit reduction."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The federal budget deficit has exceeded $1 trillion in each of the last three fiscal years and is expected to exceed that level in FY2012. Concern over these large deficits, as well as the long-term trajectory of the federal budget, has resulted in significant debate during the 112 th Congress over how to achieve meaningful deficit reduction and how to implement a plan to stabilize the federal debt. At the same time, the economy is recovering from its largest downturn since the Great Depression, and concerns have been expressed that growth in the United States may falter to the point where the U.S. economy again experiences recession. This has resulted in some renewed debate over whether additional stimulus may be needed.", "Over the next few months through the early part of calendar year 2013, Congress will be facing choices on how to deal with numerous expiring provisions, across-the-board spending cuts, and other short-term considerations that will have major effects on the federal budget.

If Congress and the President allow all of these measures to expire as scheduled under current law and let the spending cuts under the Budget Control Act (BCA) take effect (see discussion below), the budget deficits beginning in FY2013 will gradually fall as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) and are projected to remain at sustainable levels through FY2022. The decline in projected budget deficits is a result of declines in spending levels and increases in revenue levels as a percentage of GDP, relative to the levels seen over the past few fiscal years.", "Under current law, the budget deficit is estimated to fall $502 billion between FY2012 and FY2013 (see Table 1 ) as a result of fiscal policy changes set to take place at the end of 2012 and early in 2013. This estimated deficit reduction assumes that current law will be implemented as scheduled. If, however, Congress changes the trajectory of these policies by increasing spending (i.e., by eliminating the BCA automatic spending cuts) or decreasing revenue (i.e., by extending a portion of the Bush tax cuts), these policies would increase the deficit relative to the baseline. However, the amount by which the deficit would increase as the result of such policy changes could be different than the figures shown below. This is due to various factors that are taken into account when compiling a cost estimate. Because these factors could be different than the ones assumed in the figures below, the budgetary impact of reversing these policies may not be directly comparable to their impact on the deficit under current law.", "The full effects of the economic and budgetary impact of these policies may not be felt immediately. Immediate effects would be felt by individuals who have been receiving emergency unemployment compensation who would face the expiration of long-term benefits. The effects of tax changes, such as the expiration of the two-percentage-point payroll tax rate reduction, would be spread out over the course of the year. Likewise, for taxpayers experiencing an increase in tax liability as a result of the expiration of Bush tax cut provisions, these effects may be spread out over the course of the tax year through adjusted tax withholdings, or may be realized when 2013 taxes are paid early in 2014.", "The effects on the spending side may also be muted in the early part of 2013. The automatic cuts scheduled to be implemented as part of the Budget Control Act will result in agency budget authority being immediately reduced on January 2, 2013. The effects of these reductions will be seen throughout the remaining nine months of the fiscal year, and in future fiscal years, as outlays that would have otherwise occurred, do not.

This result reflects the general tendency for policies that increase income of lower-income households to have greater short-run stimulative impacts than policies that benefit higher-income households. Lower-income households are more likely than higher-income households to spend additional disposable income, thus providing a greater contribution to aggregate demand in the short-run.

The substantial tax policy considerations being faced at the end of 2012 continue to stimulate interest in fundamental tax reform.
