Section 217 defines a \"computer trespasser\" as someone \"who accesses a protectedcomputer (5) withoutauthorization and thus has no reasonable expectation of privacy in any communication to, through,or from the protected computer.\" Section 217 also specifies the conditions under which thecommunications of a computer trespasser may be intercepted. Those conditions are: the owner oroperator of the protected computer authorizes the interception; the person acting under color of lawis lawfully engaged in an investigation; the person acting under color of law has reasonable groundsto expect the content of the computer trespasser's communication is relevant to the investigation; andthe interception acquires only the trespasser's communications within the invaded computer.

Many observers believe that the most important changes affecting law enforcementofficials are those provisions allowing for nationwide warrants, court orders, etc. to facilitate thetracking of computer trespassers. In the case of investigating offenses after the fact, these provisionsmay save more resources than time. However, in cases where officials are trying to track computertrespassers in real time, time is of great importance and the provisions should be that much moreeffective. In regard to increasing the penalties for computer trespassers, there is some debate aboutwhether doing so will have the hoped for deterrent effect.

(16) ", "However, some have raised concerns that Title III (as well as other provisions) may have abroader scope than many of its supporters intend. (17) While many are concerned that the civil liberties of individualsmay be compromised if law enforcement officials extend their reach, Title III may also haveimplications for a wide range of e-commerce activities. It is unlikely that the Act will immediatelyaffect retail e-commerce (e.g., online catalogue orders) or business-to-business e-commerce (e.g.,the use of the Internet for inventory ordering and management). While these forms of e-commerceare growing very rapidly, to date they have not been identified as being particularly susceptible tomisuse by terrorists. Retail e-commerce and business-to-business e-commerce require verifiableinformation between parties that may include names, addresses, credit card numbers and otherinformation, and can be traced relatively easily. However, some observers have not ruled outterrorists using existing e-commerce exchanges to facilitate their activities in the future. (18) ", "The more common method of using e-commerce for illicit and terrorist purposes is throughfinancial transactions. For example, the terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks reportedlyused wire transfers routinely to fund their activities in the United States. Most money transfers,even relatively small amounts transferred as money orders by firms like Western Union, MoneyGram, and other smaller companies, are done electronically. There is no need to establish a bankaccount or fill out credit reporting forms, identification requirements are minimal, a money wirefirm's outlet may be located in a supermarket or drugstore and staffed by store employees, and it cantake less than fifteen minutes to send money around the world. (19) The USA PATRIOT Actaddresses wire transfers and money orders by requiring, among other provisions, the registration ofall money order agents by December 31, 2001, and increasing the criminal penalties for those whoknowingly conduct or assist in transferring money that is intended to promote or support an illegalactivity. These provisions not only cover the physical transfer of money for these purposes, butelectronic transfers as well. (20) ", "Larger financial institutions which conduct much of their business electronically--andtherefore are part of the e-commerce business sector--are also affected by the USA PATRIOT Act. Among the provisions affecting large multinational financial corporations are increased authorityfor U.S. law enforcement officials to gain access to institutions' records and data bases; due diligenceby U.S. financial institutions concerning money laundering by non-U.S. persons; enhanced standardsfor correspondent accounts held by U.S. banks; and prohibition of correspondent accounts with shellbanks (banks which have no physical presence in their chartering country). (21) ", "Critics contend that the USA PATRIOT Act will not prevent nor prohibit the types ofactivities that terrorists engaged in before September 11. While U.S. money order and wire transfer firms will have greater reporting responsibilities and tighter restrictions under the Act, the sheervolume of transactions, many under $3,000, is enormous--in 2000, Western Union alone did 89million wire transfers of money. Particularly in the Middle East a significant amount of money istransferred or exchanged by hawla , a remittance system outside of, and running parallel to, thebanking system. Whether the USA PATRIOT Act can be effectively applied to terrorists' use of hawla is not clear. Some also question whether the time and cost to track large portions of electroniccommerce conducted through hawla will prove to be an efficient use of government and privatesector resources. (22) ", "Others contend that large U.S. financial institutions may also expend significant time andresources to comply with the Act without providing any assistance in the war against terrorism. According to Ellen Zimiles, a partner in KPMG's forensics practice, a large U.S. bank spends $10million per year to fight money laundering--and the Act may add to that cost, as well as adding newcosts for brokers, insurers, and others connected with the financial industry. (23) According to anotherexpert, a U.S. bank typically has one million to five million ATM transactions daily, and 100,000wire transactions per day. U.S. financial institutions will likely have to address how they willbalance increased security provisions, broader access to their accounts by law enforcement officials,and ensuring customers that the privacy and integrity of financial accounts will not be compromisedby compliance with the Act. (24) ", "Abroad, many U.S. financial institutions and multinational organizations routinely transfercurrency internally and externally, often crossing national borders. These institutions andcorporations often engage in routine short-term lending or borrowing to balance accounts or tofinance projects. There are several established mechanisms and procedures for these transactions. The London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) is an overnight lending rate by which multinationalcorporations electronically borrow or lend money to balance their accounts. The LIBOR is set bythe largest banks, and the transactions are usually made with \"Eurodollars.\" (25) These transactions occuron a daily basis and range in the trillions of dollars. There is no indication that any U.S. institutionsusing the LIBOR to settle accounts have aided or abetted terrorist activities. Still, these transactionscould fall under the USA PATRIOT Act. If U.S. law enforcement officials begin to examineaccounts, or even seize funds, under the Act, how might multinational corporations react-- may theyeven attempt to avoid compliance to the Act? Will foreign banks and governments acquiesce to U.S.actions? ", "Still, it is important to note that, to date, most (if not all) of the concerns raised by critics,other than those of costs of compliance, have been hypothetical. There have been no reported widespread law enforcement intrusions into financial institutions' databases, nor have there been anyreported e-commerce or electronic fund transfers disruptions linked to the war on terror since theAct was signed into law. The events of September 11 resulted in a fundamental change in the waythe United States views its defense and security.

So far, no such standards have been established. ", "The challenge of establishing a large scale PKI system raises many issues. Some of theseinclude the lack of federal interoperable standards, the feasibility of implementation, and highcosts. (33) First, the lackof federal interoperable standards raises the question of who would be responsible for developingand promulgating such standards. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) oftenworks with industry to facilitate and develop technical standards and measurements. However, itis currently unclear what role NIST would play in developing any PKI standards. Assuming theacceptance of the PKI approach, it is also unclear whether the federal government should work tocreate a standard for its own use, or if it should rely on the development of an industry standard,which may take longer to emerge. Second, large scale, full-featured PKI systems are not common,raising questions regarding the scalability of the technology and the resources needed to accomplishthe task. Implementation of such a system would require policy makers to decide if the federalgovernment has sufficient expertise and resources to create a large scale PKI system in-house, or ifit will need to be outsourced to one or more private contractors. Third, the largely uncharted natureof such an undertaking and the high costs of PKI systems generally, raises concerns for budgetplanning and oversight. Proponents of a government-wide PKI system maintain that if these issuescan be adequately addressed, the creation of a single government-wide PKI system could promotethe utilization of secure Web portals to ensure the data integrity of transactions between thegovernment and citizens and business. ", "Privacy. In contrast to the two previouslydiscussed issues, the implications of the USA PATRIOT Act on privacy could have a negative effecton e-government initiatives. Surveys have shown that the loss of privacy as a result of e-governmentis a significant concern among citizens. (34) As mentioned in the earlier section on computer security, the Actexpands the type of information that may be collected by law enforcement officials from providersof electronic communications services or remote computing services. It also allows for the issuanceof nationwide search warrants to facilitate the tracking of computer trespassers. Concerns aboutpotential misuse of these data collection provisions could dampen citizen enthusiasm for carryingout electronic transactions with the government.

(36) The practices of law enforcement agencies in monitoring theactivities of individuals as they use the Internet for electronic mail (e-mail) or visiting Web sites wasan important, but less visible, issue. Congress addressed it primarily in the context of ensuring thatthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did not overstep its authority in using a software programcalled Carnivore (later renamed DCS 1000). (37) With a court order, the FBI could install Carnivore on theequipment of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to monitor a suspect's Internet activity, which raisedconcern about whether the software was sufficiently precise to avoid monitoring the activity of otherISP customers and hence impinging on their privacy. ", "While Congress remains interested in overseeing the FBI's use of Carnivore, the September11 terrorist attacks sharpened the debate over how to strike a balance between law enforcement'sneed to investigate criminals and protecting what most citizens believe to be their \"right\" toprivacy. (38) Congressincluded provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act that make it easier for law enforcement to monitorInternet activities. Also, many ISPs that opposed law enforcement monitoring of their customers'Internet activity reportedly have been quite willing to assist law enforcement in its search for e-mailand other Internet evidence relating to the attacks.

Cable companies had sought, in particular, to clarify their obligations with regard to releaseof personally identifiable information about subscribers and whether they were required to notify thesubscriber that the information had been requested by a governmental entity as required under the1992 Cable Act. Under this section, no notification is required, but disclosure specifically does notinclude a subscriber's video programming choices.", "Section 212 allows ISPs to divulge records or other information (but not thecontents of communications) pertaining to a subscriber if they believe there is immediate danger ofdeath or serious physical injury or as otherwise authorized, and requires them to divulge suchrecords or information (excluding contents of communications) to a governmental entity undercertain conditions. It also allows an ISP to divulge the contents of communications to a lawenforcement agency if it reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of deathor serious physical injury requires disclosure of the information without delay.

In the wake of the terrorist attacks, the public appearsmore willing to make sacrifices in the privacy arena to protect the country against further attacks andbring the perpetrators of the September 11 assault to justice. Criticism of the USA PATRIOT Actfrom a privacy standpoint has been relatively muted, possibly because of the perception that thepublic is willing to accept such measures at this time. An October 2001 Harris Poll found that 63%of Americans favored monitoring of Internet discussions and chat rooms, and 54% favoredmonitoring cellphones and e-mail. (42) ", "However, privacy advocates worry that, in this emotionally charged climate, Congress ispassing legislation that it later will regret. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU), Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), Electronic Privacy Information Center(EPIC), and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) urge caution, fearful that, in an attempt to trackdown and punish the terrorists who threaten American democracy, one of the fundamental tenets ofthat democracy--privacy--may itself be threatened. The ACLU issued a press release (43) on October 24 stating thatit was deeply disappointed with the House passage of H.R. 3162 , and, after the billcleared Congress, vowed to monitor its implementation. (44) CDT's Executive Director said on October 25 that \"This bill hasbeen called a compromise but the only thing compromised is our civil liberties.\" (45) Among CDT's concernsis that Section 216, which is not subject to the sunset provision, allows law enforcement officials tocollect information about Internet usage without what CDT considers to be meaningful judicialreview. (46) ", "There are other privacy issues, too. Peter Swire, who served as privacy counselor at theOffice of Management and Budget during the Clinton Administration, worries that the Act does notinclude sufficient provisions to deal with potential abuses by law enforcement of the new authoritiesgranted in the Act. (47) Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Orson Swindle has suggested that ISPs relook attheir privacy policy statements in the wake of passage of the Act, particularly with regard to ISPs'new authority under Section 212 to voluntarily disclose information. (48) The FTC oversees howbusinesses, including ISPs, adhere to their privacy policies. Mr. Swindle also pointed out that it ishis understanding that the law does not cover Web sites, only ISPs. He wondered if an onlinebookseller received many requests for books on, for example, how to make bombs or fly an airplane,\"and the name of the purchasers reflected one or another ethnic group, would that be alarming underconcern for terrorism? ... It would seem to me that common sense would say that would be alarmingbut they're not covered by this.\" (49) John Kamp, an attorney with Wiley, Rein & Fielding,commented that the definitions in the Act were murky and Web sites might be covered, but that \"Itis clear that this law wasn't designed to go there.\" (50) ", "The question of definitions is raised by others, including EFF. In particular, EFF cites thelack of definitions of \"content\" of e-mails that cannot be retrieved without a warrant, and the term\"without authority\" in the definition of a computer trespasser. (51) Packets of data thatcomprise e-mail messages may contain both content and non-content information (such as routinginformation). The Act allows law enforcement officials access to non-content information, but notto content. Thus this definition could be quite important. Regarding computer trespassers, Section217 defines a computer trespasser as a person who accesses a protected computer withoutauthorization, but it does not include a person with an existing contractual relationship with theowner or operator of the computer. EFF wants that term to mean only individuals who intentionallybreak into computers with which they have no relationship. ", "Some ISPs express satisfaction that guidance issued by the Justice Department implementingthe USA PATRIOT Act clarifies that ISPs may use their own tools to obtain information requiredby law enforcement officials rather than rather than being required to allow the FBI to installsoftware such as DCS 1000. EarthLink executive David Baker called it a \"silver lining in what manyotherwise describe as a cloud....\" (52) ", "Like the ACLU, most of the privacy advocate groups assert that they will closely monitorhow law enforcement officials implement the Act and try to ensure that the law is not misused.Congress may conduct oversight of the Act's implementation, both from the standpoint of the valueof providing law enforcement officials with these additional tools to combat crime and terrorism,and in terms of any detrimental consequences that could arise."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
