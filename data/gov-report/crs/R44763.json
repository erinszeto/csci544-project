Mandatory spending is composed of budget outlays controlled by laws other than appropriation acts, including federal spending on entitlement programs. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid make up the bulk of mandatory spending. Other mandatory spending funds various income support programs, including Supplemental Security Income (SSI), unemployment insurance, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), as well as federal employee and military retirement and some veterans' benefits. In contrast to mandatory spending, discretionary spending is provided and controlled through appropriations acts. Net interest spending is the government's interest payments on debt held by the public, offset by interest income that the government receives.", "In FY2016, mandatory spending accounted for an estimated 63% of total federal spending and over 13% of gross domestic product (GDP). Social Security alone accounted for about 24% of federal spending. Medicare and the federal share of Medicaid together accounted for an estimated 27% of federal spending. Therefore, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid now make up about half of total federal spending. In previous decades, mandatory spending accounted for a smaller share of federal outlays. In 1962, before the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, mandatory spending was less than 30% of all federal spending. At that time, Social Security accounted for about 13% of total federal spending or about half of all mandatory spending.", "Mandatory spending is projected to continue rising over the next decades. Over the next decade, mandatory spending is projected to reach 15% of GDP in FY2026, while discretionary spending is projected to fall to 5% of GDP, its lowest level ever. Much of the projected increase in mandatory spending stems from the demographic effects of an aging population and rising health care costs. Baby Boomers will continue to retire over the coming decade, and the proportion of retirees over age 85 has been rising steadily, thus increasing the expected flow of federal benefits. While health care costs per beneficiary have increased in recent years more slowly than previously expected, concerns remain that health care cost growth could again accelerate.", "Other countries with advanced economies also face challenges related to rising costs of social insurance programs, although per capita health care costs are generally lower in those countries than in the United States. Some of those countries have more extensive social safety nets. Some in the United States have called for expanding certain social insurance benefits, or for programs that would do more to address challenges faced by non-elderly families, such as expanded options for repayment of student loans or support for child care.", "Over the long term, projections suggest that if current policies remain unchanged, the United States could face major fiscal imbalances. According to CBO's extended baseline projections, Social Security would grow from 4.9% of GDP in FY2016 to 5.9% of GDP by FY2026 and 6.4% by FY2036. Federal mandatory spending on health care is projected to expand from about 5.5% of GDP in FY2016 to 6.5% in FY2026 and to 7.9% by FY2036. The share of mandatory spending in total federal spending is also projected to rise.", "Because costs of mandatory programs account for nearly two-thirds of total federal outlays, some budget experts contend that putting federal finances on a sustainable path would require significant reductions in federal spending, including cuts in entitlement spending. Other budget and social policy experts contend that curtailing entitlement program eligibility or benefits would compromise the goals of improving the economic security of the elderly and the poor, as well as mitigating the financial consequences of adverse events such as unemployment or disability."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Mandatory spending is composed of budget outlays controlled by laws other than appropriation acts, including federal spending on entitlement programs.

In addition, mandatory spending encompasses certain veterans' benefits, federal employee retirement, as well as many smaller budgetary items, such as salaries of Members of Congress, certain federal judges, and the President.

That discussion focuses on mandatory spending programs that have had the most direct effect on federal finances.", "The report also discusses some implications of the growth of mandatory spending on budget policy and on the long-term fiscal stance of the federal government. Trends that have influenced mandatory spending over time, such as the growth of health care costs in excess of general inflation and the retirement and aging of the Baby Boom generation, present policy makers with choices whether to increase federal revenues, change the structure of mandatory programs, reduce spending on other programs, or some combination of those strategies. In recent years, net interest outlays and growth in health care costs have been lower than expected, keeping mandatory spending below previously projected levels, although whether those favorable trends will continue is uncertain.

In 1962, Social Security was not yet an actuarially mature program. As the number of retirees grew, so did outlays for Social Security. Congress also acted many times to expand eligibility or enhance benefits for Social Security and other mandatory programs. In 1965, the federal government made a major commitment to support the health needs of the elderly through Medicare and the poor through Medicaid. As prices for medical and hospital care grew, spurred by the demands of newly insured beneficiaries and largely unconstrained by cost controls, so did federal outlays for health programs. In the 1980s and 1990s, those cost pressures prompted efforts to curtail some benefits and limit the trajectory of health care prices. Nonetheless, some initiatives sought to expand coverage of federal health programs to particular vulnerable populations or to limit the financial consequences of serious medical episodes to existing beneficiaries.", "Mandatory spending trends also reflect the business cycle. Economic downturns reduce household incomes, and thus expand the pool of those eligible for income support programs such as unemployment insurance.

In coming years, however, benefit payments are expected to exceed collections, thus requiring a draw-down of trust fund balances. The Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program faces more immediate challenges. According to actuarial projections of the Social Security trustees, the DI trust fund will be exhausted by 2023 under current policies, although tax collections in that year would be able to cover about 90% of promised benefit payments.

After that date, incoming payroll taxes could cover about 87% of that program's costs. The Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund, which supports Medicare Part B benefits, is not vulnerable to exhaustion because of how that program is financed.

Mandatory spending typically is provided in permanent or multi-year appropriations contained in the authorizing law. Funding therefore becomes available automatically each year, without further legislative action by Congress. In most cases, the authorizing law requires payment, based on a benefit formula, to an individual or entity (e.g., a state) if eligibility criteria are met.

Most discretionary spending supports operations of federal agencies. In some cases, activities funded by mandatory and discretionary spending may be similar.

Such entitlement spending is referred to as appropriated entitlements. The level of spending for appropriated entitlements, like other entitlements, is based on the benefit and eligibility criteria established in law. The amount of budget authority provided in appropriations acts for these specific programs is based on meeting projected spending levels. Since the authorizing legislation effectively determines the amount of budget authority required, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA; P.L. 101-508 ) classified appropriated entitlement spending as mandatory.", "The terms \"entitlement\" or \"entitlement authority\" are often used in conjunction with mandatory spending. The definition of an entitlement, however, is tied to a judgement of whether the federal government is legally obliged to pay a person or government. Some federal programs, such as Social Security, may be clear examples of entitlement programs, but determining whether other programs could be so considered may involve complex legal issues.

Rather than being accounted for on a cash basis, FCRA programs are accounted for on a net subsidy basis. FCRA required that the reported budgetary cost of a credit or loan program equal the estimated subsidy costs at the time the credit is provided.

The CBA enabled Congress to exercise greater control on how federal funds were spent. The CBA also provided instruments to conform budgetary legislation to what Congress considered appropriate levels of aggregate spending, revenue, deficits (or surpluses), and debt. ", "Some pre-CBA budgetary practices, such as the use contract authority or borrowing authority, had eroded the ability of Congress to constrain certain types of spending. Reestablishing more effective fiscal control over those spending types required an evolution in how Congress considered funding not controlled in the annual appropriations process. Budget discussions in the mid-1970s included overlapping concepts such as entitlement spending, uncontrollable spending, programs funded via trust funds, and permanent authorizations. Distinctions between categories of spending took on special importance in 1985 when Congress established sequestration procedures, which could require across-the-board cuts for some accounts but exempted others.

More gradual social trends, such as urbanization, industrialization, higher rates of migration, rising incomes, labor conditions, the broadening of market ties across the national and world, expansions and contractions of electoral franchise, and improved longevity also played important roles in changing American society, as well as influencing the structure and role of the federal government. ", "From the early 19 th century to the early 20 th century, the United States was transformed from a largely agricultural and rural nation to a mostly urban and industrial one. Moreover, in the post-Civil War decades, the federal government gained wider legal and regulatory authorities, although those activities accounted for a small fraction of federal outlays and employment. Not until after World War I, however, did social expenditures, apart from veterans' pensions and other benefits, make up an appreciable portion of the federal budget. The Great Depression that commenced in late 1929 prompted deeper changes in how the federal government addressed social challenges.", "This section outlines public demands for federal responses to national challenges and social forces that may have contributed to the establishment of federal mandatory programs.

Costs of that care were funded by compulsory deductions from seamen's wages.

Proponents of social insurance contended that when voluntary or private insurance arrangements were not forthcoming to cover certain risks, such as unemployment or industrial accidents, then governments could advance public interests by establishing mandatory social insurance programs among certain employment or population categories. Mandatory coverage can mitigate the traditional insurer's concern of adverse selection, which occurs when voluntary plans attract disproportionate numbers of high-risk or high-cost persons. Social insurance, however, can be vulnerable to moral hazard, a second traditional insurance concern, which occurs when insured individuals act in ways that increase risks or costs. For instance, whether disability insurance would discourage employment among some has been a long-standing issue.", "Social insurance can also help protect individuals with low incomes that may struggle to afford private insurance.

One common thread, however, was a more scientific approach to government and social conditions.
