This, in turn, can reflect how policymakers consider the policy advice they are given by the scientific and technical community.", "Science for policy and technology for policy are when scientists, engineers, and health professionals (see Box 1 ) provide analysis, knowledge, and data to inform policymakers with the goal of enhancing their ability to make wise decisions. This scientific and technical guidance is available for almost any public policy arena. A classic example is global climate change. Policymakers debate questions such as at what point actions, if any, should be taken to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. If no action is taken, what are the possible impacts of global climate change on the United States and other countries? If policymakers decide to take action, what policy steps could the United States take to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or to adapt to global climate change? Policymakers are the ones who decide what steps should be taken to manage these risks. They can base their decisions on the guidance provided to them by the science, engineering, and health communities.", "In contrast, policy for science and policy for technology are when policymakers take actions that influence the S&T community or the actions in which they engage such as research or S&T-business related activities (e.g., patent law).

In general, research was supported primarily through the philanthropy of wealthy individuals. During the Civil War, however, research became part of the military's mission, and the federal government more actively engaged in policy for science , establishing the land-grant college system focusing on agricultural research (1862) and the Weather Bureau (1870), providing a telescope for the Naval Observatory, and supporting polar explorations and surveys of the Western United States. Issues began to arise regarding how science should fit into the federal government's structure. As a result, in 1884, Congress set up a Joint Commission made up of three members each from the House and the Senate, chaired by Senator W. B. Allison. The Allison Commission discussed proposals for a Department of Science and a national university, as well as the need for the government to cooperate, not compete, with universities and concerns about duplication. In the end, the Allison Commission affirmed the utility of federal funding of science, but did not recommend a separate department or any other actions.", "At the beginning of the 20 th century, prior to World War I, additional issues became the focus of the nation's science and technology policy including conservation, medicine, and public health; and a number of additional science organizations were established in the federal government (e.g., Food and Drug Administration). In addition, the first industrial research laboratories and large-scale mechanized industry were started. World War I brought about additional application of science and technology to weapon development.", "During the period between World War I the end of World War II, the role of the application of research to provide technology for both military and economic purposes became evident. No longer were philanthropists the primary sources of funding for research and development (R&D); instead it was the federal government. This lead to a fundamental change in the relation between the federal government and the S&T community. This policy for technology focused on areas such as weaponry, communications, and medical needs such as surgical innovations. During this period, the capabilities of science and technology were widely recognized due to the use of chemicals, aircraft, mechanized weapons, radar, and other technological applications in World War II. As a result, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Office of Scientific Research and Development (1941). The Manhattan project also began its work at this time, managed by the Manhattan Engineer District of the Army Corps of Engineers, and tasked with the goal of building an atomic bomb prior to the Japanese or Germans.", "Following World War II, the utility of science and technology to society as exhibited during the War was crystallized in Science, the Endless Frontier , a 1945 report by Vannevar Bush, director of the White House Office of Scientific Research and Development, to President Franklin Roosevelt. This report, which proposed a \"program for postwar scientific research,\" set the stage for today's view of the relationship between the federal government and the S&T community regarding policy for science . In his report, Bush indicated that scientific progress was essential for the war against disease, for national security, and for the public welfare. The report also recommended that the federal government should undertake responsibility for renewing the nation's scientific talent. To respond to these needs, Bush proposed a new federal agency that would \"accept new responsibilities for promoting the flow of new scientific knowledge and the development of scientific talent of our youth.\" This recommendation eventually led to the establishment of the National Science Foundation (NSF).", "Today, science and engineering research and innovations are intricately linked to societal needs and the nation's economy in areas such as energy, transportation, communication, agriculture, education, environment, health, defense, and jobs.

This is often the case with basic research performed by industry or mission-driven agencies. Applied Research: The objective of applied research is to gain knowledge or understanding to meet a specific recognized need. In industry, applied research includes investigations to discover new scientific knowledge that has specific commercial objectives with respect to products, processes, or services. Development: Development is the systematic use of the knowledge or understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes.", "These definitions are based on the traditional linear model of innovation that some believe creates a false distinction between basic and applied research.

In these situations, the S&T community may believe a decision is needed quickly due to the nature of the risk involved, while the policymaker is concerned about the political and economic implications of taking the action recommended by the S&T community.

Figure 1 illustrates the magnitude of federal funding in each of the R&D categories, by agency. As shown here, Department of Defense (DOD) R&D funding, which accounts for approximately half of all federal R&D funding, is focused on major systems development with approximately 11% for basic and applied research.

According to OMB, the FS&T budget \"highlights the creation of new knowledge and technologies more consistently and accurately than the overall R&D data.\" While the R&D budget includes funding for defense development, testing, and evaluation, the FS&T budget does not.

A Stanford University Hoover Institution study found that if U.S. students performed in science and mathematics education at a level comparable with the world's leaders, U.S. GDP would increase.

One perspective of innovation policy, based on the linear model of innovation, leads some policymakers to believe that it is inappropriate to use federal resources to invest in technological development. Rather, private resources should be used to invest in this portion of the innovation process as private entities will receive the returns on investment. An alternative perspective is that research and innovation can be so interrelated that it is not possible to separate the two. Policymakers with this perspective on innovation policy believe that investing federal resources to enhance technological innovation is appropriate and a wise use of federal funds.", " Figure 3 illustrates the linear model of innovation. As shown here, the federal government invests in research and development moving from basic research to applied research to development creating intellectual property. The responsibility then falls to the private sector including inventors, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and industry to use that intellectual property to capture that idea and translate it into technology, moving it through several stages: a prototype, then a product, and finally commercialized in such a way that consumers are interested in purchasing the result.", "The gap between these two stages, however, is sometimes called the \"valley of death,\" because of the challenges of taking the intellectual property and transferring that idea to private entities who may or may not be interested in turning that intellectual property into technology. As a result, some believe that the linear model is insufficient as a basis for S&T policy decisionmaking today\u2014that the linkage between science and technological innovation is far more complex. One visual perspective on this theory of science and innovation, called the \"Pasteur's Quadrant\" model, describes a closer link between research and its intended outcome (see Figure 4 ).", "As described by Stokes, there are four types of research:", "Pure basic research , pursued with the goal of fundamental understanding, without any consideration of the use (e.g., Niels Bohr, whose goal was to enhance our understanding of atomic structure); Pure applied research , pursued with the goal of use, without any consideration of fundamental understanding (e.g., Thomas Edison, whose goal was commercially profitable electric lighting); Use-inspired basic research , pursued with the dual goals of basic understanding and use (e.g., Louis Pasteur's use of his discovery of the process of disease at the microbiological level to develop mechanisms to combat anthrax in sheep and cattle, cholera in chickens, spoilage in milk, wine and vinegar, and rabies in people.) Phenomena exploration , pursued due to research curiosity regarding particular phenomena, inspired by neither understanding nor use (e.g., the marking and incidence of bird species or why an apple falls from a tree). Such exploration might lead to the type of research represented by Bohr's quadrant or Edison's quadrant.", "As with previous models presented in this report, some would contend that the barriers illustrated in the model are not concrete, but porous. Research can easily move from one category to another as illustrated by the Pasteur example mentioned earlier. For example, there is little distinction sometimes between basic research, applied research, development, and commercialization. There may not be much difference, for example, in biotechnology research conducted at a university or at a small company funded by venture capital.", "As a result, some policymakers believe that in a knowledge-based economy, federal investment in R&D should be inspired not only with the goal of fundamental understanding, but also, on occasion, with the goal of use. In addition, in order for the nation to obtain the return on federal investment in R&D and the related societal and economic goals, some contend that federal investment should not stop at the point just before prototype and product technological development. This, some believe, is particularly important as, in a global economy, foreign firms are as easily able to capture the results of federal investment in research as U.S. firms.", "On the other hand, some policymakers express concerns that investing in R&D in a sector closely linked to industry\u2014or, for that matter, at any stage of technology commercialization\u2014may result in the federal government picking \"winners and losers.\" For example, although some believe that federal investment in information technology R&D has resulted in benefits for the country and helps by setting industry standards, others believe that federal investment in information technology R&D is inappropriate because it is the federal government, not industry, who is determining the direction for research and determining technological \"winners and losers.\"", "In terms of technology for policy , differing views regarding policy issues are not that dissimilar as those for policy for technology . Differing perspectives in technology for policy focus on the degree to which it is appropriate for the federal government to focus on a particular technology. Some believe it is important to undertake policies to encourage implementation of a technology. Others believe that such policy actions might inappropriately influence the market by supporting one technological option more than another. For example, some may question which is better, a hybrid electric vehicle, a plug-in electric vehicle, a fuel cell vehicle, or enhancing current vehicles? Although there may be a common policy goal of reducing fossil fuel consumption, undertaking policies that may favor one of these technologies versus another creates \"winners and losers,\" which some policymakers believe is inappropriate.

For example, federal decisionmaking regarding nuclear power includes", "Nuclear Regulatory Commission - Safety and design; Federal Power Commission - Rate bases and authority; Occupational Safety & Health Administration - Worker safety; Environmental Protection Agency - Environmental impact studies; Department of Energy - Nuclear power research and development; Federal Emergency Management Agency - Nuclear power plant emergency; Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Coast Guard, and others - Nuclear power plant security; and Department of Transportation - Shipment of radioactive materials.", "Critics of the current S&T policy decisionmaking process say it can be challenging to make logical and consistent policies as each of these federal agencies may assess the risk of a given policy from a different perspective without a unified assessment. There are many organizations and individuals in Congress, the judicial branch, state and local governments, and outside of government such as industry, advocacy groups, think tanks, and others who also offer their thoughts on any given S&T policy. As a result, this diversity leads some experts to believe that S&T policy decisions can not be made coherently and consistently.", "Further, some critics say that public policies do not always reflect what is known about science and technology, and neither policymakers nor the public have sufficient understanding to make appropriate decisions. A reliance on experts may help policymakers make decisions, but some express concerns that the experts themselves are unable to separate their personal biases sufficiently to provide an independent analysis of the situation. For example, on climate change, some have expressed concerns that some scientists are unable to separate their personal beliefs regarding public policy when providing the results of their research to policymakers. In addition, experts do not always agree with one another due to the inherent uncertainty in science. As a result, policymakers may find it challenging to obtain a sufficiently clear answer for decisionmaking. Policymakers must often decide whether to make a choice on a current assessment of the costs and benefits of taking action based on imperfect information or to await additional scientific and technical information. Moreover, while scientific knowledge and technological development is changing constantly, the same is not always true of public policy. As a result, policies developed a number of years ago may not reflect the latest scientific and technological knowledge.", "Finally, critics say that accountability for political decisions can also be a challenge. The decentralized nature of S&T policy decisionmaking can make it challenging to separate sources of advice and make those providing advice accountable. For example, a Member of Congress may rely on a presidential appointee who in turn relies on his or her science and engineering staff. That staff may develop their opinion based on federal advisory committees, and experts outside the federal government, who in turn rely on peer reviews of the work of individual scientists and engineers, who are not able to be held accountable to the public for public policies based on their knowledge and guidance.", "Despite these challenges, scientific and technical knowledge and advice has the potential of being useful in making decisions related to public policy. Policymakers have an opportunity to make their decisions based on the best knowledge and guidance available, along with the other factors they must take into account. Perhaps one way to recognize the value of scientific and technical knowledge and guidance in the policymaking process is to think of the many countries in which policymakers must make decisions with limited scientific and technical advice. An intuitive sense can only go so far in such situations, while scientific and technical knowledge and guidance can help policymakers assess the potential risk and benefits of a decision they make so that societal and economic benefits are enhanced and losses are mitigated."], "subsections": []}]}}
