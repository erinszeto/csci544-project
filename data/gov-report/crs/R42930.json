Although China is not the only nation that has sought to press its maritime territorial claims, actions taken by People's Republic of China (PRC) actors, including its maritime law enforcement authorities and the People's Liberation Army (PLA), have been a particular concern. Chinese maritime authorities have taken actions include harassing vessels, destroying equipment, and blockading islets and shoals. Observers are concerned that the increasing frequency of such events raises the possibility of miscalculations that could lead to overt conflict at sea.", "In the South China Sea, the PRC makes extensive claims, including marking on its maps an ambiguous \"nine dash line\" that covers approximately 80% of the sea, including the Spratly and Paracel island groups and other features such as Scarborough Shoal. These claims overlap with those of four Southeast Asian nations\u2014Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which themselves have claims that conflict with each other. Taiwan also makes extensive claims mirroring those of the PRC. In the East China Sea, China, Japan, and Taiwan all claim a Japan-administered island group that Japan calls the Senkakus, China the Diaoyu Islands, and Taiwan the Diaoyutai Islands. Other territorial disputes exist between Japan and South Korea in the Sea of Japan, and between China and South Korea in the Yellow Sea.", "Although the United States has no territorial claim in these waters and does not take a position on the various sovereignty disputes, it is long-standing U.S. policy to oppose the use of force, threat, or coercion to promote sovereignty claims, and to support the use of international law, including arbitration mechanisms, to resolve disputes peacefully.", "The ability of the disputing countries, and of the United States and other parties, to manage tensions touches on numerous U.S. interests including", "maintaining peace and stability among maritime nations in the Asia-Pacific; protecting free and unimpeded lawful commerce along some of the world's busiest maritime trade routes; protecting the U.S. Navy's ability to operate in these areas; managing U.S. treaty alliances with nations involved in the disputes; encouraging rules-based regional norms that discourage coercion or the use of force; and avoiding intimidation of U.S. companies that may seek to operate in the region.", "The 113th Congress has held several hearings on the issues surrounding maritime disputes in East Asia. In 2013, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution (S.Res. 167) which expressed strong support of the United States for the peaceful resolution of territorial, sovereignty, and jurisdictional disputes in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains. In the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4310/P.L. 112-239), Congress stated its position that the Senkakus are administered by Japan, and that no acts of other nations will change their status. Another resolution, S.Res. 412, has been referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In the House, H.R. 4495 has been referred to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.", "There are other issues relating to East Asian maritime disputes that the 113th Congress may choose to address. The Senate may consider offering its advice and consent on the United States becoming a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Congress also may choose to examine the economic and security implications of a greater U.S. military presence in disputed areas, or the merits of providing additional resources to Southeast Asian nations to monitor and police their maritime domains. It also may choose to support efforts to lower tensions, including discussions between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on a Code of Conduct for parties in the South China Sea."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Rising tensions over overlapping maritime territorial claims in East Asia have become a pressing challenge for U.S. policy makers, raising important questions about U.S. diplomacy and security commitments in the region. These issues raise a series of challenges for Congress, including broad oversight of the Obama Administration's policies in Asia, decisions about military priorities and resources in and around disputed areas, how deeply to support the development of military capabilities of disputant nations, and how to manage relations with parties involved in the disputes, particularly China, Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which have been involved in increasingly frequent maritime incidents in the East China Sea and South China Sea.", "The territorial disputes at the heart of these tensions are decades old, and incidents among the parties have been ongoing for many years. Observers have noted a sharp uptick in maritime incidents and diplomatic tensions over recent years, posing one of the first major challenges for the U.S. strategic \"rebalancing\" towards the Asia-Pacific. Although the People's Republic of China (PRC) is not the only nation that has sought to press its maritime territorial claims, actions taken by PRC actors, including China's maritime law enforcement authorities and the People's Liberation Army (PLA), have been a particular concern. ", "The most serious sets of disputes are in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The former include the competing claims by China, Japan, and Taiwan over a set of Japanese-controlled islets called the Senkakus by Japan, the Diaoyu Islands by China, and the Diaoyutai Islands by Taiwan. The South China Sea disputes involve competing claims by Brunei, Malaysia, China, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Other disputes involve Japan and South Korea in the Sea of Japan, and China and South Korea in the Yellow Sea. ", "The South China Sea, the East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan are among the world's busiest waterways, and incidents at sea can create risks for vessels operating in both seas. Incidents arise for many reasons, including the desire of nations around a sea's periphery to demonstrate sovereignty and to protect their ability to exploit economic resources including oil and gas, or fish. In addition, incidents can be propelled by populist pressures in many of the nations involved. ", "The United States is not a claimant in any of these waters, and it has consistently taken no position on the specific sovereignty questions. However, U.S. government officials regularly voice U.S. opposition to the use of force, threat, or coercion by nations seeking to strengthen sovereignty claims over landmasses, and support for the use of customary international law and available arbitration mechanisms to resolve disputes peacefully. U.S. officials also have voiced the position that maritime claims should be based on relevant international law, as indicated in the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).", "To many observers, Chinese actions in the disputed waters will be a key factor for regional security, and a test of China's development as a regional power and a responsible global actor. Many analysts argue that because China has more military might than many of the claimants, as well as economic leverage and geopolitical clout, its behavior in these disputes sets the tone for maritime security in the region. PRC officials, by contrast, regularly have argued that they are responding to the actions of other nations rather than acting aggressively. They have reacted particularly strongly to U.S. actions and statements which they perceive as supportive of other claimants, arguing that the United States is contributing to regional instability by emboldening other nations. ", "In this context, U.S. policy makers face numerous simultaneous challenges: discouraging what many see as aggressive or coercive Chinese behavior while retaining a productive relationship with Beijing, supporting U.S. allies while discouraging them from taking actions that could further escalate tensions, and helping the region's nations forge multilateral \"rules of the road\" for managing tensions\u2014all at a time when the frequency of maritime incidents continues to grow. Administration officials say the disputes and tensions will likely continue in the region for years.", "This report will discuss the territorial claims in East Asia that underlie the growing tensions, U.S. interests that are at stake, factors that may be driving the growing tensions, and possible options for Congress to consider.

They have become one of the most challenging aspects of U.S. policy in Asia, touching on the management of treaty alliances, particularly those with Japan and the Philippines, where treaty obligations could be invoked if either country becomes involved in an active conflict with another of the claimants (for more, see the \" Treaty Obligations \" section below), and on the Obama Administration's efforts to help Asian nations build regional \"rules and norms\" that foster stability. ", "Long-standing U.S. policy holds that the United States has no territorial claims in the region and does not take a position on any of the specific sovereignty disputes, but that it supports freedom of navigation in these waters and opposes the use of coercion, intimidation, threats, or force by claimants trying to assert their territorial claims.", "The Obama Administration has taken several steps to raise the level of U.S. involvement in the disputes. In what many analysts regard as a touchstone moment in the U.S. approach, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated at the July 2010 meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Hanoi, Vietnam, that the United States has a \"national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia's maritime commons, and respect for international law in the South China Sea.\" Chinese officials reacted angrily to the statement, and to the fact that 11 other nations at the meeting also voiced similar concerns. At nearly every regional security dialogue since that meeting, U.S. and other regional officials have voiced concern about the issues, while China has sought to have them removed from the multilateral agenda, arguing that the maritime territorial disputes and incidents are bilateral issues to be resolved by the nations involved. ", "In the East China Sea, where the frequency of Sino-Japan maritime incidents has grown to levels that many observers find alarming, the Obama Administration has raised the profile of the long-standing U.S. position that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, under which United States is bound to protect \"the territories under the Administration of Japan,\" covers the Senkaku islets because they are administered by Japan. On an April 2014 state visit to Japan, President Obama became the first President to state this publicly, prompting an angry Chinese response. Administration officials have coupled statements to this effect to statements that the United States takes no position on the question of sovereignty and that it opposes unilateral attempts to undermine Japanese administration. ", "To some Japanese observers, the growing Sino-Japan maritime confrontation is a concrete manifestation of the threat Japan has faced for years from China's rising regional power. It brings into relief Japan's dependence on the U.S. security guarantee and its anxiety that Washington will not defend Japanese territory if doing so risks war with China. In this context, the rebalancing strategy has been reassuring to many Japanese leaders. However, Obama Administration officials also have communicated concerns to their Japanese counterparts that Tokyo should not be seen as unnecessarily provocative on disputes with its neighbors.", "Many Chinese observers see the confrontation in the opposite way: a concrete manifestation of the threat China faces from a re-militarizing Japan, backed by U.S. support. China considers Japan to have set off the current round of tensions in 2012 by purchasing the islets from private Japanese owners. China also believes the U.S. rebalancing has contributed to the rising tensions, emboldening Japan and changing what it says had been a stable situation. The diametrically opposed views underscore how hard it will be to reduce tensions.", "In the South China Sea, the United States has voiced support for multilateral dialogues to help manage tensions, acknowledging that the territorial disputes are long-standing, involve numerous parties, and will be very difficult to resolve in the near term. It has voiced particular support for discussions between China and ASEAN over a Code of Conduct for disputants in the region. To many analysts, such a set of mutual understandings\u2014ideally with some form of enforcement mechanism\u2014could contribute to preventing potential conflict. Although ASEAN-China negotiations on a code were restarted in 2013, disagreement among parties about what should be included, and whether a Code should have binding dispute resolution mechanisms, has stymied progress. ", "In recent months, many observers note that Obama Administrations officials also have become more specific in their calls for all parties to adhere to customary international law, as embodied in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and to clarify the precise nature of their claims. In February 6, 2014, testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Asia Subcommittee, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel said: \"... we do take a strong position that maritime claims must accord with customary international law. This means that all maritime claims must be derived from land features and otherwise comport with the international law of the sea.\" During an April trip to the Philippines, President Obama praised Manila's decision to file for international arbitration in its maritime disputes with China.", "At the same time, the tensions raise the issue of whether the United States should seek to improve the capabilities of Southeast Asian nations to monitor and police their maritime territory in the South China Sea, where several nations have disputes with China. The United States has transferred to the Philippines two 3,350-ton Hamilton-class high-endurance cutters that originally entered service with the U.S. Coast Guard in 1967. In December 2013, the Administration announced two security assistance packages\u2014a $40 million, three-year package for the Philippines under the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF), to aid the Philippine Coast Guard and National Police improve maritime domain awareness, logistics, engineering, communication, and vessel maintenance; and a $32.5 million regional assistance package\u2014including $18 million for Vietnam\u2014to enhance the capacity of coastal patrol units. The latter package included new maritime law enforcement training courses at the International Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok, Thailand."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Maritime disputes in East Asia raise numerous issues for Congress, including broad oversight of the Obama Administration's policies and relations with each of the claimant nations. Congress faces questions of how much to support the development of military capabilities of Southeast Asian disputants, each of which is at a military disadvantage with China, and how to manage relations with China and Japan, which have been involved in increasingly frequent maritime incidents in the East China Sea. Congress may choose to examine the rebalancing towards Asia and its implications for relations between China and other claimant nations. It may choose to assess whether the Obama Administration's approach is fostering stability, and whether the Administration has a clearly articulated strategy for dealing with the disputes. ", "One key congressional concern has been the possibility that the United States could be drawn into a conflict in the region. Some analysts point to the risk of a conflict that could bring in the United States, arising from scenarios that include:", "Chinese action to block U.S. surveillance activity within China's 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (the area from 12 nautical miles from China's coast to 200 nautical miles from its coast), where China takes the position that foreign militaries must seek its approval to conduct any activity; Armed conflict between China and another claimant, perhaps as an escalation of an inadvertent incident such as a collision. This would be of particular concern in the cases of Japan or the Philippines, both of which have treaty alliances with the United States. As noted above, the U.S. position is that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty of 1960 applies to the Senkaku Islands, which are claimed by China, Japan, and Taiwan, and administered by Japan. The 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines is less definitive about the United States' responsibilities in the event of an attack on Philippine-claimed territory in the South China Sea.", "East Asian maritime territorial disputes may play a role in consideration of various legislation during the 113 th Congress, especially defense authorization and appropriation bills. Defense authorization legislation may consider the implications of the reallocation of military resources within the Asia-Pacific region on the political dynamics among the various claimants in the East and South China Seas. Similarly, Congress may examine defense appropriation legislation which may provide for the provision of military resources to Southeast Asian nations. H.R. 4495 , introduced in the House on April 28, 2014, called on the Department of Defense to conduct an assessment of the maritime balance of forces in the Asia-Pacific region over the next 10-year period, and ensure the United States maintains its defense commitment to the region.", "Overall, Congress has the ability to lend its voice in support of processes to lower tensions and seek resolution of the disputes, or to speak forcefully about what it sees as aggressive or coercive actions by parties in the disputes. It can urge that U.S. relations with China, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asian claimants, and multilateral bodies such as ASEAN be conducted in ways that serve U.S. interests in the region. For example, Congress inserted in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 4310 / P.L. 112-239 ) a resolution stating among other items that \"the unilateral action of a third party will not affect the United States' acknowledgment of the administration of Japan over the Senkaku Islands.\" ", "The Senate has considered resolutions regarding maritime security in East Asia. On July 29, 2013, it unanimously agreed to S.Res. 167 (\"Reaffirming the strong support of the United States for the peaceful resolution of territorial, sovereignty, and jurisdictional disputes in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains.\"), which condemns the use of coercion and urges all parties to the disputes to exercise self-restraint; supports a South China Sea code of conduct, collaborative diplomatic processes, and adherence to international law, including the use of international arbitration; and encourages the strengthening of U.S. partnerships and military engagement in the region. On April 7, 2014, Senator Robert Menendez introduced S.Res. 412 (\"Reaffirming the strong support of the United States Government for freedom of navigation and other internationally lawful uses of sea and airspace in the Asia-Pacific region, and for the peaceful diplomatic resolution of outstanding territorial and maritime claims and disputes.\"), which has been referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. H.R. 4495 , mentioned above, makes many similar statements of support for peaceful resolution of the disputes. It has been referred to both the House Armed Services Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee.", "The Senate also could offer its advice and consent to U.S. adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which went into force in 1994 and is widely considered the governing regime for oceans and the primary (though not the only) venue for making maritime territorial claims and adjudicating maritime territorial disputes. The United States signed UNCLOS in 1994 but has not ratified it. In the 112 th Congress, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held four hearings on UNCLOS, considering the opinions of the Obama Administration, military leadership, the private sector, and opponents of accession. The committee held no vote on the Convention in the 112 th Congress, and no hearings have been held in the 113 th Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background: Who Claims What?", "paragraphs": ["The persistence of complex and overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Sea of Japan, and the Yellow Sea is at the base of tensions that have existed for decades, and that have flared up substantially in recent years. The disputes stem from myriad factors, including different interpretations of history, different interpretations of UNCLOS, the unwillingness of some parties to submit to dispute settlement procedures, and\u2014with rare exceptions\u2014the inability of the disputants to negotiate settlements among themselves.", "One of the most complex issues surrounding maritime territorial disputes is that there is no single agreed-upon venue or protocol for resolving them. UNCLOS\u2014to which each of the claimant states is a part\u2014presents one possible venue for making formal claims to maritime territory. UNCLOS hosts dispute-resolution mechanisms including the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and can also refer disputes to the International Court of Justice (ICG). However, when China became a Party to the Convention, it formally did not accept its dispute-resolution chapters.", "Furthermore, UNCLOS's provisions do not govern decisions on who owns which land or landmasses\u2014they apply only to the maritime rights countries can claim around their sovereign land territory. The PRC's expansive and vaguely defined claims in the South China Sea are not based on UNCLOS's provisions, relying instead on historical documents predating UNCLOS, which Beijing argues show it enjoyed centuries of administrative control of the areas. Countries have relied on numerous tools to demonstrate sovereignty claims, including evidence of historical administrative control or de facto administrative control through occupation or construction on islands and other landmasses. Nations have declared islets, some of them no more than rocks at high tide, as sovereign territories. ", "This dynamic has led to numerous instances of aggressive behavior by claimants trying to demonstrate administrative control over an area. Many observers argue that the rising frequency of Sino-Japan incidents in the Senkakus relates to a Chinese effort to demonstrate that Japan does not exercise undisputed administration over the uninhabited islets, and a Japanese effort to demonstrate that it does. Other incidents in the South China Sea\u2014including a 2012 China-Philippines dispute over a set of outcroppings known as Scarborough Shoal and a May 2014 China-Vietnam standoff after the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) moved an exploration rig into waters claimed by both nations\u2014can be seen as attempts to show which claimant has effective control over an area. Such behavior is not new: Beginning in the 1940s, claimants including China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam have each occupied islands and rocks in the South China Sea in order to demonstrate administrative control.", "If sovereignty over an island or rock can be established, UNCLOS allows its members to claim various types of adjoining maritime territory, with varying associated rights and privileges (see Table 1 ). In essence, a landmass is entitled to an Exclusive Economic Zone of up to 200 nautical miles if it is habitable, although the Convention does not give a precise definition of the term. If the landmass is not habitable but extends above the sea level at high tide, it is deemed under UNCLOS to be a rock, and entitled to only a 12 nautical mile territorial sea. The distinction is one reason why claimants in the South China Sea have built extensive structures and even based people above land features that are little more than rocks at high tide. Under UNCLOS, rocks that do not extend above sea level at high tide are not landmasses and do not allow a claimant to claim any maritime territory."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "South China Sea Claims", "paragraphs": ["Maritime boundaries in the South China Sea are particularly problematic because they involve six separate claimants in a mostly enclosed body of water with a large number of disputed land features. The South China Sea, one and a half times the size of the Mediterranean Sea, is ringed by Brunei, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam, and dotted with hundreds of small islands, shoals, reefs, and rocks, many of them occupied by the disputants. ", "China, Taiwan, and Vietnam each claim the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the sea. China controls them in practice, having forcibly taken control of the group in 1974 from the former Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). Further south, the Spratly Island chain is claimed in totality by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, and partially by Brunei, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Each of the claimants except Brunei occupies at least one of the Spratly islands or shoals. Virtually none of the landmasses in the Spratlys is habitable, but control over them could give a claimant rights to an area thought to be potentially rich in energy resources. Some claimants have gone to the extent of building extensive structures atop small rocks, or basing troops or other personnel on islets with no fresh water. Most observers say these actions are intended to demonstrate control, and in some cases even habitability.", "The most problematic set of disputes derive from the broad and ambiguous claim that China makes to around 80% of the sea through a U-shaped nine-dash line that overlaps with the claims of each of the other claimants. Over the years, Chinese officials have been ambiguous about what the line means\u2014whether China is claiming the entire sea and seabed, or just the landmasses within the line and whatever adjacent waters it is entitled to under international law. ", "The nine-dash line overlaps with exclusive economic zones (EEZs) that other states draw from their mainland territory, citing UNCLOS. This creates uncertainty about what the coastal states have authority to do in these waters. As an example, in 2012, the state energy companies of China and Vietnam issued overlapping tenders for offshore energy exploration in areas that lie within both Vietnam's claimed EEZ and the nine-dash line. Similarly, China and the Philippines engaged in a prolonged standoff in 2012 over a dispute about which nation has the right to police Scarborough Shoal, an outcropping of rocks that lies within the Philippine EEZ and also inside China's nine-dash-line claim. ", "The territorial disputes have been made more complicated over several decades by frequently aggressive behavior by rival claimants. Claimants have harassed fishing, exploration, and naval vessels in disputed waters, publicly disputed resource exploration by other nations or companies working under contract, and instituted measures to assert legal or administrative control over disputed waters and landmasses outside their actual control.", "The following is a claimant-by-claimant discussion of claims in the South China Sea."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "People's Republic of China", "paragraphs": ["The PRC contends that China was the first country to discover and name the islands in the South China Sea (which it calls Nanhai , or South Sea). China asserts that it developed these landmasses, islets and shoals, and exercises political jurisdiction over them. The PRC maintains that people from China started to fish around the Spratly Islands during China's Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and that the Spratly Islands first came under the political jurisdiction of China during the Yuan Dynasty (1271 to 1368, when the Mongolian empire conquered and ruled China). ", "As noted above, the PRC makes the most expansive claims of any of the South China Sea claimants, marking its maps with a broad U-shaped, nine-dash line that includes around 80% of the sea. It adopted the dashed line from maps with an 11-dash line first drawn in 1947 under the pre-revolution Republic of China government, which are also the basis of Taiwan's claim. China has not clarified whether it is claiming sovereignty over the entire sea and seabed enclosed by the nine-dash line, or is making a more limited set of claims, such as to the land features within the line or to historical rights, such as fishing or navigation rights. This ambiguity has been an important driver of tensions, and has made negotiations with other South China Sea claimants difficult.", "In a 2009 submission to the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, a UNCLOS body, China included a map with the nine-dash line in a response to a claim by Malaysia and Vietnam, and asserted \"indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters.\" This raised questions among legal observers about the nature of the Chinese claim, and whether it comports with international law, as embodied in UNCLOS. (See section on \" The Role of UNCLOS ,\" below.) ", "PRC maps call the nine-dash line a \"national border,\" and PRC officials commonly refer to the South China Sea as China's territory. In March 2012, the commander of a PLA Navy submarine base discussed the South China Sea as China's \"maritime national territory\" and called the nine-dash line China's \"intermittent national boundary in the South China Sea,\" while stating that actions to assert China's jurisdiction were needed to support the marking of the national boundary. In June 2012, the PRC announced it was upgrading the administrative level of Sansha, a city located on an island in the Paracels, to administer disputed areas of the South China Sea, and in July 2012 it announced it would set up a People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison there. These announcements prompted a detailed State Department response that the moves \"run counter to collaborative diplomatic efforts to resolve differences and risk further escalating tensions in the region.\"", "In 1999, the PRC first imposed a unilateral fishing ban in the northern part of the South China Sea. This ban has been re-imposed annually, and PRC maritime patrol ships have periodically detained foreign fishermen, expelled fishing boats, or confiscated the catch of fishermen operating in this part of the sea, particularly from Vietnam. On January 1, 2014, amended regulations announced by China's Hainan province took effect, to implement the PRC Fisheries Law. Article 35 requires foreigners to seek permission from authorities of the State Council to fish in Hainan's \"jurisdictional waters,\" which were not defined but appeared to cover more than half of the South China Sea. The amended regulations applied the PRC law explicitly to foreign nationals and PRC citizens. On January 9, 2014, the State Department said: ", "The passing of these restrictions on other countries' fishing activities in disputed portions of the South China Sea is a provocative and potentially dangerous act. These regulations appear to apply to the maritime space within China's so-called nine-dash line. China has not offered any explanation or basis under international law for these extensive maritime claims.", "Like each of the claimants except Brunei, the PRC occupies some land features in the South China Sea, including the entire Paracel Island chain, which the PLA Navy forcibly took over from South Vietnam in 1974, and a set of reefs in the Spratlys, including Subi (Zhubi in Chinese), Gaven (Nanxun), Kennan (Dongmen), Johnson (Chigua), Fiery Cross (Yongshu), Cuarteron (Huayang), and Mischief (Meiji). In 1995, the PRC used naval ships to take over Mischief Reef, which was previously inhabited by the Philippines. The PRC occupies the small rocks that make up Mischief Reef using large hexagonal platforms built above the rocks below.", "Other Chinese actors have indirectly made territorial assertions for China, including China's national oil companies. On May 2, 2014, the state-owned China National Overseas Oil Corporation (CNOOC) moved a large exploratory oil rig into waters that Vietnam says lie on its continental shelf. The rig was less than 20 miles from one of the Paracel Islands claimed by both China and Vietnam. Around 80 Chinese ships reportedly entered the area escorting the rig, and some used water cannons to disperse Vietnamese patrol boats. Yi Xianliang, deputy director general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of China's Foreign Ministry, was quoted as saying the rig is in \"China's inherent territory.\"", "The PLA also has appeared to challenge the U.S. military in international waters and airspace. In a recent incident on December 5, 2013, a PLA Navy ship reportedly placed itself in the path of the cruiser USS Cowpens , forcing the cruiser to take evasive action to avoid a collision. The incident occurred in the South China Sea, in an area widely considered to be international waters, at a time when the Cowpens reportedly was about 30 miles from the Chinese aircraft carrier the vessel was accompanying. The actions of the Chinese ship, like those of Chinese ships in earlier incidents with U.S. ships in 2001 and 2009, may have violated China's obligations under the October 1972 multilateral convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (28 UST 3459; TIAS 8587; commonly known as the COLREGs, or the \"rules of the road\"), to which both China and the United States are party."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Taiwan", "paragraphs": ["Taiwan (as the Republic of China, or ROC) has asserted \"historical claims\" to the four groups of islands, reefs, and atolls in the South China Sea.

The United States and other nations have concerns about ensuring access given China's growing anti-access and area-denial capabilities. For their part, some Chinese officials suspect the United States is pursuing a \"containment\" policy and see its strategy as defensive \"strategic deterrence\" to protect political power and territory. Other Chinese officials argue that China must develop the naval capacity to protect its vital trade links. Since the 2011 announcement of the U.S. policy of rebalancing to Asia, Chinese commentators have complained that U.S. statements and actions have emboldened countries engaged in territorial disputes with China, particularly Japan and the Philippines, increasing regional instability. Many U.S. officials and analysts argue that U.S. policy has been in response to regional calls for U.S. leadership on maritime issues.", "The PRC's deployment of a greater number of fishing boats and official paramilitary or law-enforcement patrol ships partly explains the rise in confrontations over the past few years. The PRC regularly has asserted control and claims using civilian maritime patrol ships from civilian agencies which carry out functions similar to those of the U.S. Coast Guard. For a number of years, some analysts in the PRC and overseas attributed the increasing frequency of incidents at sea to a lack of coordination between these agencies, but China restructured its civilian maritime agencies in 2013, bringing the former China Marine Surveillance (CMS), Coast Guard, Fisheries Law Enforcement Command (FLEC), and Maritime Anti-Smuggling Police under a unified Chinese Coast Guard that is part of the State Oceanic Administration. The SOA answers to the Ministry of Land and Resources, although the Coast Guard is also meant to get \"operational guidance\" from the Ministry of Public Security.", "The frequency of Chinese maritime patrols in these waters has increased. CMS ships, for example, started regular patrols in the East China Sea in 2006 and expanded to regular patrols in the Yellow Sea, Gulf of Tonkin, and South China Sea in 2007. FLEC ships began regular patrols around the Senkaku Islands in 2010. In May and June 2010, two armed FLEC ships, escorting a PRC fishing fleet near the Natuna Islands off Indonesia, aimed guns at an Indonesian naval ship, and demanded the release of one of the fishing boats. ", "China also has broadened the scope of its naval patrols. In March 2013, the PLA Navy sent ships to James Shoal, a submerged feature 50 miles off Malaysia's coast, at the southernmost tip of the PRC's South China Sea claims. In January 2014, another incident occurred in which the PLA Navy's South Sea Fleet reported that it sent an amphibious landing ship and two destroyers that patrolled and trained around the Paracel and Spratly Islands, as well as the waters at James Shoal. ", "According to the Defense Department's 2012 report to Congress, China's announced defense budget grew at an average rate of 11.8% in inflation-adjusted terms annually from 2000 to 2011. In 2004, PRC leader Hu Jintao announced a set of \"New Historic Missions\" for the PLA, which included protecting China's expanding national interests farther from China. This has been accompanied by an expansion of naval resources. Since 1995, the PLA Navy has been acquiring seven new classes of submarines. In 2011, on top of older boats, the PLA Navy deployed 56 submarines, including 53 diesel-electric or nuclear-powered attack submarines. The PLA Navy has expanded a major base on Hainan Island near the South China Sea for submarines and ships. The PLA Navy commissioned its first aircraft carrier on September 25, 2012, though deploying operational fighters is expected to take years.", "According to some observers, such improved Chinese naval capabilities have facilitated a greater range of potentially coercive tools against rival claimants in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Thus, many argue that there may be rhetorical PRC commitment to maintaining the status quo while strengthening actual control of waters surrounding disputed reefs and islands. Such control arguably could be used to solidify Chinese sovereign claims to the landmasses and the waters around them. A version of this strategy appears to be behind two recent developments\u2014Beijing's near-constant deployment of ships since September 2012 to patrol in the waters near the Senkakus, and its moves to retain physical control of Scarborough Shoal while negotiating a de-escalation with the Philippines, including cordoning off the area.

Some analysts argue that there is an issue for U.S. policy makers surrounding whether Taiwan coordinated with the PRC in asserting sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands against Japan amid rising tension in September 2012. Beijing has urged cooperation over the islands to advance cross-strait ties. Taipei's officials have denied cooperating with the PRC. ", "Even without explicit coordination, the parallel actions of the PRC and Taiwan in the 2012 East China Sea flare-up that followed the Japanese government's purchase of the Senkakus have added pressure against Japan. Both the PRC and Taiwan deployed government patrol ships and military assets that raised concerns about the potential for accidental collisions and the escalation of tensions.

A sixth, Singapore, is a heavily trade-dependent nation that regularly asserts its national interest in protecting freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.", "ASEAN and China have been discussing a Code of Conduct for parties in the region since the 1990s, without success. In 2002, ASEAN's members and China agreed on a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which outlined principles for avoiding conflicts but did not create mechanisms to solve them. The declaration stated: \"The Parties concerned undertake to resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned, in accordance with universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.\" The declaration formally called on signatories to work towards a formal Code of Conduct, but subsequent discussions between ASEAN and China have not led to such a code.

To others, however, the prospect of a formal, binding code that would deal with an actual crisis is likely years away, making it an insufficient means for addressing a security crisis occurring now. Although regular ASEAN-China meetings on a code were restarted in 2011 and formal negotiations restarted in 2013, disagreement among parties about what should be included, and whether a Code should have binding dispute resolution mechanisms, has stymied progress. Some observers believe China is dragging out negotiations on the Code of Conduct while it continues to consolidate greater effective control over the South China Sea.", "Some analysts argue that ASEAN's lack of unity and emphasis on consensus has made it an unwieldy place to discuss these issues. In July 2012, an ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, failed to produce a communiqu\u00e9, stalled by disagreements over whether specific mention should be made of South China Sea incidents. Reports indicated that Cambodia, the meeting's chair and widely seen as China's closest ally in the region, blocked any such mention. This was followed by a Cambodia-hosted ASEAN-China Leaders Meeting in November 2012 in which Cambodia and others, particularly the Philippines, publicly argued about whether the group had agreed on a common stance on how to proceed with negotiating a code.", "Two other ASEAN nations, Indonesia and Singapore, have played increasingly active roles in diplomacy over the South China Sea. ", "Indonesia: Indonesia's position is unique in that it has negotiated each of its maritime borders in the South China Sea with its neighbors, and in the small area where Indonesian waters overlap with the nine-dash line, there are no landmasses to dispute with China. Indonesia is also Southeast Asia's largest and most populous nation, and it carries disproportionate diplomatic weight within the group. In the wake of the unsuccessful July 2012 ASEAN ministerial meeting in Phnom Penh, Indonesia's foreign minister shuttled to other capitals to gain an agreement on six points related to the South China Sea. These included agreement on the need for early conclusion of a regional Code of Conduct; the continued exercise of self-restraint and non-use of force by all parties; and the peaceful resolution of disputes, in accordance with universally recognized principles of International Law, including UNCLOS. ", "Singapore: Singapore has become more vocal in urging actions to lower tensions in the region. In a high-profile September 2012 speech in Beijing, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: \"The many overlapping claims by multiple claimants in the South China Sea are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Hence ... the involved parties must manage the disputes responsibly. All sides should avoid escalating tensions or precipitating confrontations that will affect the international standing of the region.\" Because the speech was made at the Chinese Communist Party's Central Party School, observers believe it was meant as a pointed message to China's leadership.

", "China's increase in patrols around the Senkakus since the fall of 2012 appears to many to be an attempt to demonstrate that China has a degree of administrative control over the islets, thereby exploiting the U.S. distinction between sovereignty and administrative control. In its own attempt to address this perceived gap, Congress inserted in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 4310 ) a resolution stating among other items, that \"the unilateral action of a third party will not affect the United States' acknowledgment of the administration of Japan over the Senkaku Islands.\" As noted, President Obama made a similar statement during his April 2014 visit to Tokyo.", "The Philippines has been an outspoken proponent of an extensive U.S. role in resolving maritime disputes.

China has taken a position that military craft need permission to operate in another nation's EEZ. This has become a deep point of contention between the United States and China, but if China's interpretation of the UNCLOS provisions on EEZs were to become widely accepted, it could affect U.S. surveillance and other military activity worldwide. According to the Navy, 26 other nations subscribe to views similar to that of the PRC, including South China Sea disputants Malaysia and Vietnam, although Vietnam's 2012 Law of the Sea relaxed Vietnam's position, requiring notification of such activity rather than approval. Extended continental shelf claims . As discussed above, UNCLOS has a formal body, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, that may consider formal claims that extend beyond 200 nautical miles from a coastal state. UNCLOS gave parties the right to make such claims, based on the depth of the seabed beyond their EEZs. Malaysia and Vietnam submitted such a claim in 2009, to which China objected. In December 2012, China made such a claim in the East China Sea, which may also be considered by the Commission. Definitions of inhabitable islands . UNCLOS allows nations to claim 12 nautical mile territorial waters around uninhabitable rocks and shoals, but a 200 nautical mile EEZ around islands that can support permanent inhabitation. This difference has influenced moves by each of the disputants to base people and build structures and other infrastructure on or over small islands and shoals which would not otherwise support life. China's designation of a settlement on Woody Shoal in the Paracels as an administrative capital, and its moves to build a sewage system on the small island, are seen as moves to both demonstrate administrative control over the area and to demonstrate its inhabitability.", "Opponents of accession argue that UNCLOS does not, in and of itself, solve the territorial disputes and because many of China's claims do not rely on UNCLOS's provisions, U.S. accession would do little to make the PRC any more willing to submit to dispute resolution procedures.
