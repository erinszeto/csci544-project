Specifically, both bills would address certain operations of the CVP and SWP in relation to biological opinions (BiOps) associated with the threatened Delta smelt and with threatened and endangered salmon species under ESA. A BiOp is the formal response of either the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to a federal agency stating whether or not a proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a species listed under ESA or result in the destruction or adverse modification of the species' critical habitat. A BiOp can have an incidental take statement (an allowance of how many individuals of a listed species can be taken) and reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to proposed activities.

For example, H.R. 2898 would address water flow requirements for Delta smelt by setting fixed flow rates in the Old and Middle River s unless the Secretary determines there is an imminent negative impact on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt. In contrast, S. 1894 would not set specific pumping rates in relation to Delta smelt populations.

Section 103(a) of H.R. 2898 is a broad provision that would require the director of FWS to use the best scientific and commercial data to evaluate, refine, or amend the RPAs in the Delta smelt BiOp. It would direct the Secretary of the Interior, however, to make all \"significant decisions\" under the Delta smelt BiOp and document those decisions. S. 1894 does not have this broad directive to potentially change parts of the Delta smelt BiOp; however, under Section 101(a)(8), S. 1894 would direct the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior (the Secretaries) to use all scientific tools to identify changes to the real-time operations of Reclamation and of state and local water projects that could increase water supplies. It also would require such actions to be consistent with applicable laws and regulations, including existing BiOps.

If a lower flow rate is implemented, H.R. 2898 has a series of conditions that would be required to be met to make the change. Some of these conditions would be centered on obtaining supporting data that justifies the lower rate. This analysis would be done for current as well as future BiOps addressing Delta smelt.

Under the bill, these limits would be in place \"in any year that the Sacramento Valley index is 6.5 or lower, or at the request of the State of California and until two succeeding years following either of those events has been completed where the final Sacramento Valley Index is 7.8 or greater.\" Currently, these exports are limited to a maximum of 35% under most circumstances. Section 310 of H.R. 2898 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to determine the amount of new water storage that would be made available through the Draft Plan of Operations for New Melones Reservoir (DRPO) and would direct that the plan's activities be implemented. It also would direct the commissioner of Reclamation to report to Congress on the amount of storage projected to be made available under the DRPO within 18 months of enactment. Section 313 would declare that the terms of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (Title X of P.L. 111-11 ), enacted in 2009, and a related settlement agreement would be satisfied by a \"warm water fishery\" at certain points below Friant Dam and upstream of Gravelly Ford. (Such a fishery is defined in the bill as being suitable for species other than salmon and trout.) It would also direct the Secretary of the Interior to \"cease any action\" to implement the settlement as authorized. Thus, it would effectively repeal that act. Section 504 of H.R. 2898 includes specific water supply allocations for Sacramento Valley contractors under certain water year types. Section 601 would expand the authorized service area of the CVP to include Kettleman City, CA. It would direct the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a long-term contract with the Kettleman City Community Services District for up to 900 acre-feet of CVP water; however, similar to other areas, actual deliveries would depend on annual allocations by Reclamation. Section 602 would establish an oversight board to evaluate annually the planned expenditures of the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund. The board would be composed of 11 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, including 4 representatives of CVP agricultural contractors, 2 CVP municipal and industrial contractors, 2 CVP power contractors, 1 representative of a federal wildlife refuge receiving CVP water, 1 expert on the economic impacts of the changes of water operations, and 1 member of a waterfowl-related \"wildlife entity.\" Section 603 would alter water supply accounting under CVPIA so that any restrictions on CVP water (except for certain releases to the Trinity River) to benefit fisheries imposed since enactment of CVPIA would count toward the quantity of water that CVPIA requires the Secretary of the Interior to dedicate to environmental purposes (known as b(2) water). Current law requires that only water for salmon \"doubling\" is counted toward these purposes. Section 604 would require that the Secretary of the Interior implement a \"water replacement plan\" that was originally required under CVPIA. It would also require a least-cost plan by the end of FY2015 to increase CVP water supplies by the amount of water dedicated and managed for fish and wildlife purposes under CVPIA, as well as to otherwise meet all purposes of the CVP, including contractual obligations. If changes under the water replacement plan have not increased CVP yield by 800,000 acre-feet within five years of the bill's enactment, then in any year in which water service and repayment contractor allocations are less than 50% of the contract amount the provision of b(2) water made available for fish and wildlife purposes is to be reduced by 25%. Section 605 would mandate that hatchery fish be included in making determinations regarding anadromous fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta that are covered by ESA. Currently, hatchery fish are not included in population estimates of protected species, due largely to their different genetic makeup from wild fish. The inclusion of these fish could increase the population size and potentially decrease some pumping restrictions, thus allowing for increased pumping compared with current levels. Section 606 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to enter into negotiations for the transfer of the New Melones Unit of the CVP to water users. This provision could potentially result in the removal of the New Melones Unit from the federal CVP. Section 608 would limit releases from Lewiston Dam during operation of the Trinity River Division of the CVP to those amounts allowed for in a December 2000 environmental impact statement for the Trinity River Restoration Program. This limit would effectively bar additional releases for Trinity River fisheries. Such additional releases have been allowed in recent years to prevent fish kills, among other things. Sections 609-611 would make other changes to CVPIA, including amending the act's purposes to include replacement water and expedited water transfers. Section 610 would amend the act's definition of anadromous fish to limit coverage to those found in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers as of October 30, 1992. This amendment would effectively change the baseline for fish protection and restoration to set restoration goals at population levels after some species were already listed as endangered. Section 611 would require an annual report on the purpose, authority, and environmental benefit of instream flow releases from the CVP and the SWP.

Most of these provisions relate to Bureau of Reclamation policies and project management, including alterations to bureau and other agency processes for reporting on new projects and efforts to expedite environmental studies and recommendations to Congress. One of these provisions would direct new budget authority to surface storage projects. Some of them are similar to provisions in other proposed legislation in the 114 th Congress. Examples of these titles include the following:", "Title VII, Sections 701-706, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, would establish a one-stop permitting office within Reclamation for nonfederal storage projects on lands administered by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture. The bill would establish Reclamation as the lead agency for all reviews, analyses, permits, and other requirements necessary for construction. This title is similar to S. 1533 and to legislation introduced in the 113 th Congress ( H.R. 3980 ). Title VIII, Sections 801-806, the Bureau of Reclamation Project Streamlining Act, would set up an annual reporting process to authorize Reclamation projects (including storage, recycling, desalination, and rural water supply projects) similar to that authorized for the Corps of Engineers in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-121 ). Under this process, Reclamation would report annually to Congress on requested and recommended water resource projects for potential congressional approval. Title IX, Sections 901-902 would authorize accelerated repayment (or prepayment) by nonfederal Reclamation project users for certain project construction costs that are currently paid over 40-year or 50-year terms. It would allow for the conversion of water service contracts to repayment contracts and for subsequent accelerated repayment (in the form of a lump-sum payment or annual installments) of allocable construction costs for any repayment contract. This provision would allow contractors to forgo certain requirements (e.g., acreage and full-cost pricing limitations) under reclamation laws (including the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, or RRA; P.L. 97-293 ) sooner than would otherwise be the case."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "S. 1894: Other Issues Addressed", "paragraphs": ["S. 1894 contains several titles and individual provisions that are not in H.R. 2898 .

Selected examples of these changes are highlighted below. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Alternative Water Supplies", "paragraphs": ["Many of the provisions in S. 1894 would strengthen or add to authorities for \"alternative\" water supplies; that is, efforts to make available additional water supplies outside of traditional federal support for new or augmented surface water storage. Examples include the following:", "Section 301 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to competitively award federal funds for qualifying water recycling projects (\u00a7301(b)), desalination projects (\u00a7301(c)), and innovative water supply projects (\u00a7301(d)). The innovative water supply projects would include groundwater recharge, stormwater capture, agricultural and urban water conservation and efficiency, and other projects to reduce reliance on surface and groundwater supplies. The authority appears to be limited to the 17 western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. Section 301 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to review requests for projects that are eligible and compliant with Reclamation standards, but the section also explicitly mentions review of recycling requests by 105 specified water authorities, districts, and communities in California and review of 26 specific desalination projects in California. No specific authorization of appropriations amount or federal contribution limitation is specified in Section 301. The Section 301(b) recycling projects may be eligible for assistance under Section 431 (see bullet below under \" Financing and Other Provisions \") as part of the expansion of the long-standing Reclamation Title XVI recycling program and the funds provided for that program in Section 432, which would start in FY2026. The desalination projects under Section 301(c) also would be eligible for the funds made available through Title IV, at a maximum federal cost share of 25%. No per project amount is specified; establishment of an account to fund these projects and provision of funds starting in FY2026 appears in Section 442 and Section 443 of the bill, respectively. No new account would be created for recycling activities under Section 301(b). No new account and no funds would be created specifically for the innovative water supply activities in Section 301(d); some of the Section 301(d) activities may be eligible for federal assistance under the innovative supply and conservation technologies authority that would be provided to EPA by Section 327. Section 302 would create a new desalination grant program at EPA. It would support federal grants covering up to 50% of the cost of a feasibility study for a nonfederal desalination facility and 25% of the project design costs. The program would be authorized at $10 million annually through 2020. Section 302 also would amend the Water Desalination Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-298 ) to extend and augment the authorization of appropriations and to establish priorities for both research ($5 million annually through 2020) and demonstration activities ($3 million annually through 2020). Section 322 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into voluntary agreements with public water agencies that receive water from Reclamation projects to implement water conservation programs. It also would direct the portions of water conserved from these activities to individual entities (e.g., 25% to the water agency, 75% retained by the Secretary for marketing and allocation to wildlife refuges). In addition, Section 322 would give Reclamation contractors the authority to contribute funding to these efforts. If a contractor contributed more than 50% of funding, Section 322 would allow the Secretary to provide water to that contractor for groundwater recharge and conservation. Section 323 would establish a program within the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program to provide up to 100% grants for projects such as point-of-use treatment and point-of-entry systems in homes and the construction of wells or other new water-source facilities in drought-stricken communities. Eligible communities would generally be those with a population of less than 10,000 but could include larger communities in some circumstances. Section 323 would authorize $15 million for up to 15 pilot projects. Section 431 would amend an existing federal grant funding for water recycling and reuse projects (i.e., Reclamation's Title XVI program) to authorize these projects for construction if they have a completed feasibility study and meet certain other guidelines. The new \"programmatic\" authority would be available to projects in the western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. The bill would afford priority to projects in areas that have experienced severe, extreme, or exceptional drought within the past 10 years or have been designated as disaster areas by a state, and it would authorize $200 million in competitive grant funding for these projects through FY2020. The programmatic authority for Reclamation's Title XVI program contained under this section of the bill is similar to that proposed in H.R. 2993 ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financing and Other Provisions", "paragraphs": ["S. 1894 would also authorize a number of new financing provisions, as well as amendments to existing authorities in various areas and pilot programs that would attempt to address drought. Some of the new financing mechanisms could fund \"alternative\" water supply programs noted above, among others. Selected examples include the following:", "Section 103 would address the use of State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs that assist wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, pursuant to the Clean Water Act (P.L. 92-500) and the Safe Drinking Water Act ( P.L. 93-523 ), respectively. SRF programs provide loans and other financial assistance for local water infrastructure projects. Section 103 would direct EPA, when allocating funds under these programs in a state with a declared emergency drought, to require the state to review and give priority to projects that would assist communities at risk of inadequate water supply for public health or safety or that would improve resiliency to drought. Section 315 would authorize the Corps to study and implement a pilot program for \"forecast-based\" operations to enhance water supply benefits and flood control operations. The operational changes would be based on weather and climate science, watershed data (e.g., watershed-specific runoff data), and other factors. Potential projects would be limited to states with a gubernatorial drought declaration during 2015; however, eligibility would not be limited to the western states. For qualifying states, the Corps would report on the status of water control manuals, water supply storage allocation requests, and opportunities for forecast-based operations at existing Corps reservoirs and select nonfederal reservoirs at which the Corps is responsible for flood control operations; the Corps has authority for these projects under Section 7 of the Flood Control Act of 1944. Section 315 also would authorize a pilot program for five projects to implement forecast-based revisions to water operations manuals. No authorization of appropriations and no cost-sharing requirements are specified. In addition, Section 315 would require the Secretary of the Army to report to Congress within 180 days on the forecast-based reservoir operations components of modifications to all Corps reservoir operations manuals and flood control curves. Section 321 would authorize WaterSense, which EPA established administratively in 2006. WaterSense is a voluntary labeling and recognition program that seeks to help consumers and businesses easily identify products, homes, and buildings that are highly water efficient. Section 321 would authorize $5.0 million per year for the program through FY2019, plus additional increases in subsequent years based on inflation. Section 328 would explicitly authorize an existing program within the U.S. Geological Survey, the Open Water Data Initiative, to advance the availability of water data and information and to promote use of this information. It would authorize $4 million to carry out these efforts through FY2020. Title IV, Subtitle A (\u00a7\u00a7401-412), the Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (RIFIA), would authorize a new financing mechanism for certain water supply projects. It would authorize $200 million for secured loans or loan guarantees under RIFIA for up to half of the costs of certain Reclamation projects (with a minimum cost of $20 million). Projects would be limited to the 17 western states, Alaska, Hawaii, and other states where Reclamation is authorized to provide assistance. Priority would be given to areas facing water resource challenges. The RIFIA provisions of S. 1894 are similar, but not identical, to the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) enacted in Title V of P.L. 113-121 , which created a five-year pilot program for EPA and the Corps. Similar authority for Reclamation has been proposed in other legislation in the 114 th Congress (e.g., S. 176 , H.R. 291 , S. 1837 , and H.R. 2983 ). Title IV, Subtitle D (\u00a7\u00a7441-447) would create a new fund that is not subject to annual appropriations, the Federal Support for State and Local Drought Solutions Fund. The new fund would receive surplus receipts in the Reclamation Fund beginning in FY2026 and would be authorized at a level of $150 million per year for 25 years, without further appropriation (i.e., mandatory funding). It would fund authorizations under other parts of the bill, including $75 million per year for desalination projects under Section 301(c); $40 million per year for Title XVI projects (which are proposed to receive programmatic authority under Section 431); and $35 million per year for innovative finance projects under the new RIFIA authority (Title IV, subtitle A)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Among the key issues for Congress is how to address water supply shortages in general and management of federal water supply projects in particular during times of drought and increasing demand.

Both bills call for maximizing water supplies to users, with certain limitations. H.R. 2898 also contains specific guidance on the implementation of BiOps. These conditions under both bills raise questions of how much discretion federal agencies would have in implementing the CVP's operations and how the management provisions in each bill would be implemented. Some may also question whether aspects of one or both bills contain conflicting operational directives within the bill or among other regulations. For example, how would CVP directives in either bill be implemented in relation to state water quality regulations?", "Both bills call for measuring the effects of water operations on listed species under ESA. S. 1894 states that operations are to be consistent with applicable laws and regulations (including ESA); H.R. 2898 conditions several actions on the \"negative effect on the long term survival of the species.\" Some might question if H.R. 2898 would set a new standard for measuring effects on species under ESA or if maximizing water supplies in the short term could have long-term effects on the viability of species populations.", "Each bill contains certain provisions that would direct greater data collection and monitoring. H.R. 2898 includes provisions that would specify how certain aspects of the Delta smelt and salmon BiOps would be implemented. These provisions may raise questions about how better data collection and more accurate accounting of species populations could result in higher pumping rates and water exports. Further, these proposed changes might raise the question of whether the effects of operational changes could be better detected and acted upon in a manner that will protect the species. In a broader sense, some might also question how each bill would address ESA implementation and whether the legislation might set precedents for other BiOps addressing federal activities involving listed species.", "Limited commonalities exist in other areas of the bills. Both bills would attempt to encourage new water storage in the form of expedited completion of CALFED and storage studies, as well as by facilitating the potential authorization of new or augmented surface water storage projects. Both bills would also attempt to facilitate nonfederal completion of water storage projects, to various extents. However, although H.R. 2898 would focus on streamlining or reforming current Reclamation processes to facilitate water storage activities (e.g., alterations to bureau and other agency processes for reporting on new projects, including environmental studies and recommendations to Congress), S. 1894 would expand the scope of Reclamation's authorized activities. For instance, under the Senate bill, Reclamation would gain new authorities for desalination, water reuse and recycling projects, groundwater recharge, and stormwater capture, as well as authority for a credit financing mechanism (i.e., RIFIA) that differs from traditional Reclamation project financing.
