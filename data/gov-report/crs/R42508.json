Over the years, concerns raised about medical device user fees have prompted Congress to carefully consider issues such as which agency activities could use fees, how user fees can be kept from supplanting federal funding, and which companies should qualify as small businesses and pay a reduced fee.", "The purpose of the user fee program is to help reduce the time in which FDA can review and make decisions on marketing applications.

Since medical device user fees were first collected in FY2003, they have comprised an increasing proportion of FDA's device budget. All user fees (as enacted) accounted for 35% of FDA's total FY2012 program level, and device user fees accounted for 14% of the device and radiological health program level, which was $376 million in FY2012, including $53 million in user fees."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA, also called MDUFA I) gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to collect fees from the medical device industry.

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has primary responsibility within FDA for medical device premarket review. The purpose of user fees is to support the FDA's medical device premarket review program and to help reduce the time it takes the agency to review and make decisions on marketing applications. Between 1983 and 2002, multiple government reports indicated that FDA had insufficient resources for its medical devices premarket review program. Lengthy review times affect the industry, which waits to market its products, and patients, who wait to use these products.

For prescription drugs, the manufacturer must pay a fee for each new drug application (NDA) that is submitted to FDA for premarket review.

In general, for moderate-risk and high-risk medical devices, there are two pathways that manufacturers can use to bring such devices to market with FDA's permission.

The PMA process is generally used for novel and high-risk devices and is typically lengthy and expensive.

This is called a Panel-Track Supplement when it is necessary for FDA to evaluate significant clinical data in order to make a decision on approval of the supplement. If a manufacturer requests approval of a change in aspects of an approved device, such as its design, specifications, or labeling, this is called a 180-Day PMA Supplement . In this case, FDA either does not require new clinical data or requires only limited clinical data. When a manufacturer requests approval for a minor change to an approved device, such as a minor change in the design or labeling, this is called a Real-Time PMA Supplement .

According to FDA, there were fluctuations in the numbers submitted from year to year, and fee revenues repeatedly fell short of expectations. MDUFA II added establishment registration fees , paid annually by most device establishments registered with FDA, and product fees , paid annually for high-risk (Class III) devices for which periodic reporting is required. MDUFA II also added two new application fees\u2014the 30-Day Notice and 513(g) application\u2014and substantially lowered all the existing application fee amounts (see Table C -1 ).

For example, FDA completes at least 90% of 510(k) reviews within 90 days or less.\" However, Dr. Shuren noted that these \"metrics reflect FDA time only; they do not reflect the time taken by device sponsors to respond to requests for additional information.

FDA and GAO have both studied this issue of increasing review time. A 2011 FDA analysis of the reasons behind the increased average total days for the review of 510(k)s found that FDA reviewers frequently needed to ask for additional information\u2014called an AI Letter\u2014from the 510(k) device manufacturer or sponsor due to the poor quality of the original submission. According to FDA, these quality issues involved \"the device description, meaning the sponsor either did not provide sufficient information about the device to determine what it was developed to do, or the device description was inconsistent throughout the submission.\"", "Furthermore, FDA concluded that \"sponsors' failure to address deficiencies identified in first-round AI Letters are major contributors to the increase in total review times. For example, 65% of the time FDA sent a second-round AI Letter because the sponsor failed to submit information requested in the first AI Letter.\" The 2011 FDA analysis also found \"in some cases, the FDA sent AI Letters for inappropriate reasons, such as asking for additional testing that was outside the scope of what would be required for a 510(k) submission, or asking for supporting documentation that was already covered by a standard government form.\"", "GAO also performed an analysis of FDA performance goals regarding 510(k) device review times and requests for additional information from sponsors. GAO found that although FDA met all medical device performance goals for 510(k)s, the total review time\u2014from submission to final decision\u2014has increased substantially in recent years. Regarding the agency's use of AI Letters, the GAO report notes that \"the only alternative to requesting additional information is for FDA to reject the submission.\" Use of the AI Letter allows the sponsors the opportunity to respond, and although the time to final decision is longer, the submission has the opportunity to be approved.", " Figure 3 provides information on the amount of time FDA spends reviewing non-expedited PMA applications and Panel-Track Supplements. A device may receive expedited review if it is intended to treat or diagnose a life-threatening condition or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition, and it addresses an unmet need. CDRH Director Shuren notes that although FDA is spending less time reviewing PMA applications, the average total days for the review of PMA applications has been increasing since 2004. The February 2012 GAO report found that for FY2003 through FY2010, FDA met most of the goals for PMAs but fell short on most of the goals for expedited PMAs. The February 2012 GAO report found that FDA review time and time to final decision for both types of PMAs were highly variable but generally increased during this period.", "The February 2012 GAO report also commented on communication problems between industry and FDA based on interviews with three industry groups about the medical device review process. These industry representatives noted that FDA \"guidance documents are often unclear, out of date, and not comprehensive.\" They also stated that \"after sponsors submit their applications to FDA, insufficient communication from FDA prevents sponsors from learning about deficiencies in their submissions early in FDA's review. According to one of these stakeholders, if FDA communicated these deficiencies earlier in the process, sponsors would be able to correct them and would be less likely to receive a request for additional information.\" Two industry representatives noted that \"review criteria sometimes change after a sponsor submits an application,\" and one industry representative stated that \"criteria sometimes change when the FDA reviewer assigned to the submission changes during the review.\" The February 2012 GAO report points out that FDA has taken a number of actions to address the issues of the industry representatives. For example, FDA has issued new guidance documents, improved the guidance development process, initiated a reviewer certification program for new FDA reviewers, and enhanced its interactive review process for medical devices.", "For FY2012, 35% of FDA's total budget comes from user fees.

These three provisions were included with MDUFA III along with a variety of related and unrelated issues in the final legislative package, the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, P.L. 112-144 ), which became law on July 9, 2012. Because of the importance of user fees to FDA's budget, PDUFA and MDUFA are considered to be \"must pass\" legislation, and Congress has often in the past included language to address a range of other concerns. For example, MDUFA II included provisions about the extent to which FDA can delegate activities to third parties (inspections and the review of premarket notifications); establishment registration requirements (timing and electronic submission); a unique device identification system; and reporting requirements for devices linked to serious injuries or deaths. For a complete listing of provisions that were included in FDASIA, please see CRS Report R42680, The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, P.L. 112-144) , coordinated by [author name scrubbed].", "Appendix A.
