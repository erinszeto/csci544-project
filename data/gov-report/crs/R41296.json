To accomplish this, BCAP is charged with two tasks: (1) to support the establishment and production of eligible crops for conversion to bioenergy in selected areas, and (2) to assist agricultural and forest land owners and operators with collection, harvest, storage, and transportation (CHST) of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facility.", "BCAP was created in 2008 by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246, 2008 farm bill), shortly after Congress had vastly expanded the usage mandate for renewable fuels, including cellulosic biofuels in the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140). BCAP was envisaged as a mechanism for jump-starting the production of cellulosic feedstock for what was expected to be a rapidly expanding industry. The 2014 farm bill (Agricultural Act of 2014; P.L. 113-79) extends BCAP through FY2018, but with a number of changes aimed at limiting program costs. BCAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Farm Service Agency (FSA). BCAP provides two categories of financial assistance: (1) annual and establishment payments that share in the cost of establishing and maintaining production of eligible biomass crops; and (2) matching payments that share in the cost of the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation (CHST) of biomass to an eligible biomass conversion facility. BCAP assistance for establishing and producing biomass crops is available within designated project areas. BCAP project areas are specific geographic areas where producers may enroll land into BCAP contracts and produce specified biomass crops.", "Under the 2008 farm bill, BCAP was authorized to receive such sums as necessary, meaning that funding for BCAP was both mandatory through the borrowing authority of USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation and open-ended since it depended on program participation. However, Congress imposed an upper limit on BCAP funding from FY2010 through FY2012 through appropriations bills. No funds were available for BCAP for FY2013.", "In fashioning the 2014 farm bill, Congress made a number of changes to BCAP. Standing out among the changes was a hard cap on the program's mandatory authorization level. The 2014 farm bill replaced the open-ended authorization for BCAP in the 2008 farm bill with a cap of $25 million per year of mandatory funding for FY2014 through FY2018. Congress has further limited BCAP through appropriations bills, with the result that outlays under the program have declined steeply since peaking at nearly $250 million in FY2010. In December 2014, Congress passed the Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235), which imposed an upper limit of $23 million in funding for BCAP for FY2015. In part, these changes reflect the much slower-than-expected pace at which the cellulosic biofuels industry has developed.", "Concerns that arose in the early years after BCAP was authorized\u2014for example, that it could heighten competition over eligible woody biomass, thus raising the price of that material to the detriment of traditional users, such as nurseries and others, and that the by-product of paper production, \"black liquor,\" could qualify for CHST matching payments\u2014have been addressed, and so have become less acute. Some have argued the payments are largely unnecessary and therefore wasteful. An ongoing issue is that while BCAP's primary purpose is to facilitate the development of an expanding, commercial-scale cellulosic biofuel industry by helping it meet its feedstock challenges, numerous headwinds continue to retard the development of that industry."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BCAP Overview", "paragraphs": ["The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) is intended to assist with some of the feedstock supply challenges facing the cellulosic biofuels industry.

As a result, corn use for ethanol grew from a 7% share of the U.S. corn crop in 2001 to an estimated 40% share of the 2011 corn crop. Dedicating an increasing share of the U.S. corn harvest to ethanol production evoked fears of unintended market and environmental consequences. As a result of these and other concerns, policy makers sought to redirect their bioenergy policies to provide incentives for the research and development of new agriculture-based renewable fuels, especially second-generation biofuels (based on non-food crop biomass such as cellulose and algae), and to expand their distribution and use. ", "In particular, through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140 ), Congress established a goal of 36 billion gallons of biofuel use by 2022, including 16 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuels. Similarly, the 2008 farm bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246 ) included an energy title, Title IX, with a set of bioenergy programs administered primarily by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that focused on non-corn-ethanol biofuels.

", "In an effort to enforce this division between higher-value products, in its final rule (October 27, 2010) USDA added the requirement that \"eligible material be directly harvested from the land \" in accordance with an approved conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan; be separated from a higher-value product; and not be classified as a higher-value product by USDA. For example, wood chips are considered eligible material if they are collected directly from the land. Therefore, wood chips collected from delivered and processed trees after the trees are delivered to pulp and paper facilities do not qualify. However, wood chips created in the field from diseased trees for ease of transport to a biomass conversion facility are eligible for matching payments. Another example would be corn cobs as an eligible material. If corn cobs are separated from the higher-value product (i.e., corn kernels) in the field and the cobs are then collected as residue in accordance with a conservation plan and delivered to a conversion facility they are considered eligible for matching payment. If the corn cobs are collected at a vegetable processing facility after being delivered and separated from the higher-value product, they are not considered eligible. This is considered incidental to the normal marketing of the crop and not representative of the collection or harvesting of biomass that would not otherwise be collected.", "While manufacturing industries that use wood residue offered the greatest opposition to CHST matching payments as published under the USDA notice, those in the lumber industry that were receiving higher prices also questioned the sustainability of the provision. Some in the biomass industry highlight the temporary nature of the CHST matching payments (maximum two years), and hope that future implementation will focus on the BCAP annual and establishment payments, which are longer-term. As mentioned earlier, in its final rule for the BCAP program, USDA announced a re-prioritization of program funds that emphasized annual and establishment payments, especially under existing contracts, over CHST matching payments. In addition, the 2014 farm bill lowered the maximum CHST payment rate per ton to $20, in part, to further minimize any incentive or preference away from existing uses.", "Others questioned USDA's ability to distinguish between high-value product material and renewable biomass material in the future, despite the language in the final rule requiring it to be harvested directly from the land. Some believe the fungible nature of wood could continue to generate competition between wood-based product output and renewable energy production. The 2014 farm bill explicitly addressed this issue in Section 9010, where the definition of \"eligible material\" in previous law was rewritten to include the following exclusion: \"(vi) any woody eligible material collected or harvested outside contract acreage that would otherwise be used for existing market products.\"", "Finally, the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense has asserted that the great majority of facilities for CHST payments are in the mature wood products industry, with relatively few participating facilities utilizing alternative biomass sources, such as municipal waste and bioenergy crops, in the production of advanced biofuels.

Others, including USDA, praise invasive and noxious species' inclusion in BCAP as an incentive to further eradication efforts. The BCAP program provides separate definitions of eligible material and eligible crops. Eligible crop criteria apply to the annual and establishment payments portion of BCAP and eligible material criteria refer to BCAP's CHST matching payments. Invasive and noxious species are considered ineligible as crops for BCAP's annual and establishment payments, but are not excluded as eligible material under BCAP's CHST matching payments.", "The inclusion of invasive and noxious species as eligible material has generated both concern and interest in the environmental community. Some note that while the incentive for removal is praiseworthy, such removal could have the unintended consequence of perpetuating the species. USDA's final rule addresses this concern by excluding removal and transportation during reproductive periods and requiring removal be in accordance with a new or amended conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan. If a material owner violates the current federal standards for noxious weeds, then all matching payments must be repaid. According to USDA, removal costs associated with spreading or establishing an invasive or noxious species while carrying out the activities to receive a matching payment are \"outside the scope of BCAP\" and would rely on state and other federal laws for penalties. ", "Several plant traits of an ideal biomass crop are also commonly found among invasive grasses: low energy requirements for maintenance; efficient use of light, water, and nutrients; perennial growth; and high yields. Based on comments received from USDA's proposed rule, crops of species such as giant miscanthus, pennycress, and black locust may be considered eligible energy crops. Many of these are non-native, fast-growing, perennial grass or trees that some consider an ideal energy crop for many of the reasons stated above. Others are concerned that non-sterile varieties can become invasive and noxious or that genetically engineered (GE) varieties could result in hybridization with wild relatives, resulting in invasive or noxious species causing economic and ecological damage. Some states include varieties of these species on statewide noxious weed listings. In these states, they would be ineligible as a crop under USDA's final rule; however, there is continued concern that the plant's introduction as a crop could have unintended consequences, given that the USDA final rule does not distinguish between the sterile varieties and non-sterile varieties. Even the BCAP Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS) highlights potential issues associated with the introduction of GE species and non-native varieties for use as biomass crops. To prevent the spread of invasive or noxious species, USDA is relying on thorough, site-specific environmental evaluation of a project area prior to selection. This could potentially slow implementation of the program or impose costs on biomass producers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Black Liquor\"", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, concerns emerged about \"black liquor\" meeting the definition of renewable material under BCAP, and thus potentially qualifying for CHST matching payments. Black liquor is a waste product from the paper production process composed of mostly organic lignin and inorganic pulping chemicals, and has long been used in the pulp and paper industry as a source of energy. An existing alternative fuel excise tax credit targeting blends of biofuels with petroleum products for transportation purposes was expanded under the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA; P.L. 110-140 ) to include alternative fuels used by non-transportation industries. As a result, paper companies, who were already using black liquor for processing energy at the treatment plant, by including a small mixture of diesel were now able to claim their black liquor as a biofuel that qualified for the biofuel excise tax credit. According to news reports, the black liquor loophole cost taxpayers over $4 billion in 2009. ", "A provision in the enacted health care bill ( P.L. 111-148 ) disqualified black liquor from eligibility as of January 1, 2010. USDA's final rule for BCAP states that black liquor is considered an industrial waste by-product and therefore is not eligible under BCAP. Despite this declaration, those in favor of black liquor's inclusion as an eligible source object to USDA's reasoning that black liquor is made from \"inorganic\" material, citing that \"neither the statute nor the BCAP eligible materials list requires that eligible biomass actually originate directly from the land.\"", "The 2008 farm bill definition of \"eligible material\" simply referred to renewable biomass as: \"(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014The term 'eligible material means renewable biomass.

The removal of hazardous wildfire fuels and invasive species could provide biomass for renewable energy conversion rather than being disposed of in ways that contribute additional carbon to the atmosphere. ", "In addition to biomass removal from forestland, crop residue is also considered to be viable biomass for renewable energy production. Following harvest, the remaining plant, or residue, can be left on the ground for soil health, erosion and weed control, water quality, and nutrient management. Many federal conservation programs provide financial assistance for practices that increase crop residue retention on the land, because of the environmental benefits. The BCAP payments to remove this residue for bioenergy production have caused some to question whether this is a duplication of the federal effort and is counterproductive. Soil scientists in particular are concerned that the benefits to bioenergy would not outweigh the potential soil and environmental concerns associated with the removal of crop residue and caution against removing too much residue in sensitive areas.", "Dedicated biomass crops, such as switchgrass, hybrid poplars, and hybrid willows, are considered by many to be more desirable crops because they have a short rotation (re-grow quickly after each harvest) and use fewer resources, such as water and fertilizers, than traditional field crop production. Compared with field crops such as corn, dedicated biomass crops are also thought to have less impact on available food supplies. Despite potential environmental benefits, concerns persist about the additional use of fertilizers and water resources that could be required to increase the per-acre yields for these crops to become economically feasible.

In addition, U.S. ethanol production now appears to have hit the \"blend wall\"\u2014the potential inability of the domestic market to absorb ethanol above a 10% share of domestic gasoline fuels. However, the enormous potential supply of low-cost cellulosic plant material available in the United States makes it an attractive prospective feedstock and helps to explain the continuing interest in it among policy makers. ", "The 2014 farm bill energy title provides nearly $1.5 billion in financial incentives and support to encourage the production and use of advanced (mainly cellulosic) biofuels, including the $125 million in mandatory funding for BCAP. Grants and loan guarantees leverage industry investments in new technologies and infrastructure, as well as in the production of cellulosic feedstocks. However, BCAP is the principal program designed to help \"kick start\" the U.S. cellulosic biofuels sector. BCAP attempts to remove some of the risk for biomass growers by supporting the production of dedicated crop and forest cellulosic feedstocks and by providing incentives for harvest and post-production storage and transport. ", "Despite government support for BCAP and other related federal programs, the cellulosic ethanol sector has been slow to develop. Prior to the startup of several commercial-scale facilities earlier this year, including the POET-DSM Project LIBERTY plant in Iowa and the Abengoa SA plant in Kansas, only small volumes of cellulosic ethanol had been produced by a few small refineries (mostly pilot or demonstration in scope). Due to the slow progress in establishing a commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol industry, EPA has been compelled to substantially reduce the cellulosic biofuel RFS mandates set by Congress for the years 2010 through 2014. The EPA waiver of the cellulosic biofuels RFS for five consecutive years, coupled with reduced BCAP funding under the 2014 farm bill, and the congressional climate of budget austerity, likely has increased the uncertainty associated with the future investments needed to kick-start this sector."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
