Under a prefunding schedule established by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, the USPS has made $20.9 billion in contributions since FY2007 but defaulted on its remaining $28.1 billion in payments. In its most recent financial statement, the USPS requested reforms that would integrate postal employee healthcare options with Medicare, thereby reducing costs and making the prefunding liability expense more manageable. Such reforms would require statutory authorization from Congress.", "This report also covers several issues facing the USPS workforce. In recent years, initiatives designed to restructure the USPS retail and mail processing networks allowed the USPS to implement several workforce reduction strategies that helped cut costs.

Mail volume had risen sharply and the Post Office Department lacked the institutional flexibility to quickly respond to market changes. ", "Today, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS or Postal Service) faces similar challenges but for different reasons. Between 2006 and 2015, total mail volume dropped sharply. Market changes and global economic conditions contributed to the Postal Service's financial challenges and affected its efforts to control expenses and expand revenue. Statutory mandates, such as the requirements to maintain six-day delivery and prefund health benefits for future retirees, may limit the actions USPS might take to mitigate these challenges.

On the other hand, the USPS generally cannot expand its operations beyond the scope of postal products and services and other limited nonpostal products authorized by statute. Statute also limits the USPS's ability to raise rates on certain postal products.

The PRA created the USPS, which replaced the U.S. Post Office Department, as an independent agency of the executive branch, responsible for generating enough revenue to finance its own operations. Prior to the PRA, the U.S. Post Office Department was a Cabinet-level agency and was not financially self-sustaining. ", "Since the passage of the PRA, the USPS has generated nearly all of its funding\u2014about $69 billion in FY2015 according to the USPS's most recent financial report\u2014by charging users of the mail for the costs of the services it provides. Congress, however, does provide an annual appropriation\u2014about $55 million in FY2016\u2014to compensate the USPS for revenue it forgoes in providing free mailing privileges to the blind and certain overseas voters. In addition, the annual appropriation compensates the USPS for debt it accumulated in the 1990s while providing postal services at below-cost rates to non-profit organizations. Funds appropriated to the USPS for the annual reimbursement and revenue forgone are deposited in the Postal Service Fund, a revolving fund in the Treasury that consists largely of revenues generated from the sale of postal products and services. The revenue in the Postal Service Fund is used to fund the operations of (1) the Postal Service, which includes the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); (2) the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (USPSOIG); and (3) the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC).

The first quarter of FY2016 includes the holiday shipping season, which is one of the busiest times for USPS. The improvement in USPS's first quarter financial results is due in part to an increase in shipping and package volume and revenue as compared to the first quarter of FY2015.

At the end of FY2012, the USPS reached its statutory debt limit. Further, USPS's total debt obligations have remained at $15 billion since FY2012. As the USPS pays down its existing debt, it accumulates new debt up to its statutory maximum. For example, on October 1, 2015, the USPS repaid $4 billion of its debt.

The USPS's credit lines were fully drawn at the end of FY2015.", "Additionally, financial losses have caused the USPS to default on certain statutorily required payments, such as the retiree health benefit prefunding obligations. Since FY2012, the USPS has defaulted on over $28 billion in statutorily required retiree health benefit prefunding obligations. Use of debt instruments and default on certain retiree health prefunding payments has likely allowed the USPS to maintain cash-on-hand sufficient to cover its operational expenses throughout each fiscal year.

Cross-subsidization could, potentially, provide an advantage for the USPS in the competitive market by creating artificially low prices that did not include all the costs attributable to those products. The PAEA addressed this issue by forbidding the subsidization of competitive products with market dominant revenue and establishing the Competitive Products Fund (CPF), which receives deposits from the Postal Service Fund for revenues derived from the sale of competitive products.

Furthermore, the profit margins on both First-Class Mail and Standard Mail are greater than that of Shipping and Packages. As a result, revenue from Shipping and Packages would have to grow at a substantially higher rate than the decline in First-Class Mail revenue in order to replace the lost profit contribution of First-Class Mail. ", "Furthermore, the processing and delivery costs for competitive products, such as First-Class Package Service or Priority Mail, are greater than those of most market dominant products.

This exigent surcharge is a rate increase above what USPS would otherwise receive based on the CPI-U formula. ", "In July 2010, the USPS made its first request to the PRC for an exigent surcharge. In its 2010 exigent request, the USPS sought to increase rates on its market dominant products by approximately 5.6% due to poor economic conditions and decreased mail volume. The \"extraordinary or exceptional\" circumstance, according to USPS's request, was the \"unprecedented drop in mail volume,\" which they argue was caused by the recession. The PRC denied USPS's request, in part because PRC found that multiple factors contributed to reduced mail volume, not all of which were due to the recession.", "In 2013, the USPS filed and the PRC approved a rate increase of 4.3% on market dominant products. Pursuant to the PRC's order, the increase went into effect on January 26, 2014. Originally, the increase was only to be in effect until the USPS recovered an additional $2.8 billion in lost revenue, which was the amount the PRC determined to be attributable to the recession. At the time, the temporary increase was expected to be in place for less than two years.", "The exigent price increase has allowed the USPS to hold revenue for market dominant products steady, despite continued losses in volume. The USPS challenged the PRC methodology in court, arguing that the increase should be permitted to continue indefinitely. On June 5, 2015, the DC Circuit Court delivered an opinion upholding the temporary nature of the increase. This opinion, however, stated that the one aspect of the PRC methodology for calculating the cumulative losses attributable to the recession was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and must be revisited to resolve disagreement with the methodology proposed by the USPS. Following the ruling of the DC Circuit Court, the PRC increased the amount that the USPS could collect in exigent price revenue by an additional $1.4 billion.

As of April 10, rates on many market dominant products and services have dropped to the price they were prior to the exigent surcharge. For example, the price of a First-Class Forever stamp dropped from $0.49 to $0.47, and the price of an International Forever stamp dropped from $1.20 to $1.15. Rates for select products and services used largely by bulk mailers (e.g., discounted rates for presorted mail) were adjusted using additional criteria.

Total revenue (excluding the surcharge) was $66.4 billion in FY2014 and $66.8 billion in FY2015. In the two full years that the exigent surcharge has been in place, it has contributed an estimated 2.1% and 3.2% to the total revenue of the USPS (or an estimated 2.7% and 4.0% to the total market dominant revenue, respectively)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expenses from Operations", "paragraphs": ["To address its financial challenges, the USPS has made several operational adjustments intended to align its revenue, mail volume, and operating expenses, including ", "changes to its workforce (e.g., increased use of non-career employees); consolidation of delivery routes and reductions in number of delivery facilities; reductions to retail office hours; and realignment of its mail processing and distribution network.", "For FY2015, USPS's operating expenses were about $67.7 billion.
