The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget described several important changes, including increased funding for certain domestic priorities, major programmatic reforms, and proposed spending cuts in some programs. The current economic climate continues to pose major challenges to policymakers. Federal spending tied to means-tested social programs rose due to rising unemployment, while federal revenues are projected to fall as individuals' incomes have dropped and corporate profits have sunk. Federal deficits, according to OMB and CBO projections, will likely be high relative to historic norms over the next few years, as spending rises and revenues fall relative to previously anticipated levels. FY2009 outlays rose to $3,522 billion (24.9% of GDP) and revenues fell to $2,105 billion (14.7% of GDP), yielding a total federal deficit of $1,417 billion (10.0% of GDP).", "Over the past decade, federal spending has accounted for approximately a fifth of the economy (as measured by gross domestic product\u2014GDP) and federal revenues have ranged between just under a sixth to just over a fifth of GDP. In FY2008, the U.S. government collected $2.5 trillion in revenue and spent almost $3.0 trillion. Outlays as a proportion of GDP rose from 18.4% in FY2000 to 21.0% of GDP in FY2008. Federal revenues as a proportion of GDP reached a post-WWII peak of 20.9% in FY2000 and then fell to 16.3% of GDP in FY2004 before rising slightly to 17.7% of GDP in FY2008.", "The Obama Administration released the FY2010 budget outline on February 26, 2009, followed by the remaining budget documents on May 7 and 11, 2009. Major policy initiatives included new spending targeted toward health care reform, clean energy, and education. The budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 13), which followed most of the President's initiatives, was agreed to on April 29, 2009. It specified $2,322 billion in revenues and $3,555 billion in outlays, resulting in a projected FY2010 deficit of $1,233 billion. A FY2009 war funding supplemental (P.L. 111-32) was enacted in June 2009. The House passed all 12 regular FY2010 appropriations acts by the end of July 2009. The Legislative Branch appropriations bill (P.L. 111-68) enacted October 1 contained a continuing resolution to extend funding to the end of the month. On October 30, the Interior-Environment bill (P.L. 111-88), which included a second continuing resolution to extend funding until December 18, was enacted. Five remaining bills (Commerce-Justice-Science; Financial Services; Labor-HHS; Military Construction-VA; and State-Foreign Operations) were folded into the Transportation-HUD bill, creating an omnibus spending measure (H.R. 3288; P.L. 111-117) that was enacted on December 16.

Federal loans or loan guarantee programs may help provide liquidity to distressed financial markets and stimulate economic activity, but may also expose the federal government to substantial credit risks. While many economists concurred on the need for short-term fiscal stimulus despite adverse impact on the deficit, concerns remain about the federal government's long-term fiscal situation.

Until the federal government disburses funds to make purchases, however, no outlays occur.

Appropriations legislation is generally framed in terms of budget authority because that is what Congress can most directly control.", "Estimating the precise budgetary impact of programs like TARP is difficult. For example, much of the early amounts of TARP funds were used to purchase preferred equity stakes in major banks. EESA requires those equity purchases to be costed on a net present value basis with an adjustment for market risk, so that the future sale of those equity stakes would offset much of the cost of acquiring them. Under the Bush Administration, OMB argued for a cash basis approach, so that those equity purchases would increase the federal deficit for FY2009 and future sales would reduce deficits in out-years as those equity stakes are sold off. Under the Obama Administration, however, OMB Director Peter Orszag adopted the scoring practices he advocated while head of CBO, thus eliminating some of the previous divergence between CBO and OMB budget estimates.

Outside of TARP, other federal agencies have also used their statutory authority to provide relief to the financial sector and credit markets in various ways.

The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) requires that the reported budgetary cost of credit programs equal the estimated subsidy cost at the time the credit is provided.

The Supplemental Appropriations Act, FY2008 ( P.L. 110-252 ) provided both the second part of war funding for FY2008 bringing the annual total to $187 billion, and $66 billion to cover the first part of FY2009.", "On April 9, 2009, the Obama Administration requested $83.4 billion for a FY2009 supplemental including $75.5 billion to fund DOD's war costs in Afghanistan and Iraq, $7.1 billion for primarily war-related foreign aid, and $0.4 billion for other needs. Coupled with previously appropriated war funding, the request would bring the DOD total for FY2009 to $141.4 billion. Presumably this request reflects the President's decision to send an additional 21,000 troops to Afghanistan \"to stabilize a deteriorating situation\" and to reduce the number of Brigade Combat Teams in Iraq by two, a decrease of about 18,000 troops in FY2009.

Some contend that the George W. Bush Administration used supplemental appropriations to obscure the costs of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the public. Second, the irregular timing of supplemental appropriations requests complicates comparisons of baseline budget forecasts.

On the other hand, if the baseline is run after a supplemental is passed and an overall decline in U.S. military operations is anticipated because the drawdown in Iraq is expected to be greater than the increase in Afghanistan, then assuming the same level of war funding may overstate total defense spending. In either case, when the amount for defense spending includes war funding, it overstates the amount needed to carry on DOD's ongoing baseline peacetime program, and will not capture any changes in U.S. military operations for overseas contingencies.", "Finally, many in Congress have questioned whether after seven years, war appropriations are appropriately categorized as \"unanticipated\" emergencies not subject to caps in annual congressional budget resolutions.

The independence of the Fed insulates it from political pressures and allows it to act quickly in response to new developments in the economy. The Fed, in conjunction with the Treasury Department, developed innovative responses to the financial turmoil that broke out in August 2007. As economic problems deepened in 2008, the Fed redoubled its efforts to unfreeze critical areas of credit markets.", "In the current economic situation, traditional monetary policy initiatives appear to have neared their effective limits. In their December meeting, the Federal Reserve set a target range for the federal funds rate between zero and \u00bc % and cut the rate on discount window loans (made to commercial banks and other financial institutions) by 75 basis points to \u00bd %. Thus, the Federal Reserve has little room for further cuts. In addition, declining investment demand and investors seeking a safe harbor for funds have pushed short-term interest rates on federal Treasury securities to very low levels.", "Furthermore, many economists doubt that pushing those interest rates even lower would spur much additional lending when banks and other lenders worry about the solvency of financial counterparties. Monetary policy loses much of its effectiveness in such a \"liquidity trap,\" as banks' reluctance to lend frustrates the Fed's efforts to expand the money supply. Moreover, while new Federal Reserve lending facilities may improve credit conditions or at least limit further deterioration, those programs were not designed to address the larger macroeconomic issue of stimulating economic growth. Finally, while the Fed responses in 2008 and early 2009 have been aggressive and creative, there may be limits to what additional programs can accomplish.", "Logic of Fiscal Stimulus", "The context for fiscal policy begins with national income accounting. The national income, as measured by GDP, is the sum of expenditure categories. Specifically, the national income accounting identity is", "Y \u2261 C + I + G + Net Exports", "where", "Y = national income (GDP) C = private consumption I = private investment G = government spending.", "The identity implies that national income falls when private consumption and investment fall unless offset by increases in either government spending or net exports. In the current economic environment, government spending increases have become the focus of attention as a source of stimulus as consumption and investment continue to decline. While some measures of economic activity remained resilient in the first half of 2008, despite rapidly rising unemployment and sharp drops in asset prices and in housing prices in many areas of the country, most forecasters predict sharp decreases in key economic indicators in 2009.", "Private consumption fell in the last half of 2008 for several reasons. Rising unemployment rates left some households with lost earnings, and prompted others to increase savings to cushion against possible future job losses. Some households that had borrowed using home equity credit lines, credit cards, or other types of credit became unable to continue borrowing, thus requiring cutbacks in consumption. Other households became unable to afford mortgage payments, contributing to increasing foreclosure rates and reducing consumption. Auto sales, an important component of private consumption, fell drastically as financing became harder to obtain and gas prices rose in mid-2008.", "Private investment falls when businesses believe that demand for what they sell is falling or will fall. Non-residential investment, a component of private investment, has been weak relative to historical levels since the mid-1990s, although information technology investment was strong until the collapse of dot-coms in 2000. The Federal Reserve then sharply lowered short-term interest rates. Capital inflows, especially from East Asia, pushed down market interest rates. Low interest rates helped housing prices rise and stimulated new residential construction and development, boosting fixed residential investment.", "As housing prices in many areas of the country reached their peak or began to decline in 2007, investors who once had thought that home prices would continue to rise backed away. Additionally, many investors began to fear that residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) were much riskier than anticipated, and capital markets became reluctant to put more money into the residential sector. A credit crunch, partially sparked by concerns over RMBS, emerged in August 2007. Foreclosure rates have climbed, as refinancing options for many homeowners dwindled, putting added downward pressure on home prices. High levels of fixed residential investment over the past decade have created large inventories of new houses, which may dampen incentives for future construction. All of these variables contributed to declines in private investment, which are not expected to reverse in the near term.", "The United States has run trade deficits since the mid-1980s. In recent years, the trade deficit has narrowed (so that net exports are less negative) in part because the dollar has weakened relative to most major currencies. Sharply higher energy prices in 2008 offset many of those gains, but falling energy prices in late 2008 may help shrink the trade deficit further. As trading partners have begun to face their own economic problems, demand for American exports may fall. American consumers, however, may buy fewer imported goods during the recession. The combined effect on net exports is likely to be mixed, causing them to be an ineffective source of stimulus.", "Most macroeconomists believe that reductions in private consumption and investment will cut economic growth unless debt-financed government spending increases to provide substantial fiscal stimulus. Other measures, such as investment incentives or broad tax cuts may also promote economic growth, although some economists believe debt-financed government spending is a more effective stimulus to aggregate demand in a recession.", "Applying Fiscal Policy", "Standard applied macroeconomic theory suggests that fiscal policy is more effective when short-term interest rates are extremely low. Fiscal policy therefore plays an especially important role in economic policy during economic downturns. The amount and composition of the federal spending along with the size of the federal deficit are key fiscal policy instruments.", "During economic downturns, government revenues fall and expenditures rise as more people become eligible for unemployment insurance and income support programs, causing deficits to increase or surpluses to shrink. These effects, known as \"automatic stabilizers,\" provide a countercyclical stimulus in the short run without the need for new legislative action. Automatic stabilizers, however, probably cannot provide enough fiscal stimulus to pull the current economy out of a recession.", "Higher government spending financed by borrowing, above and beyond the automatic stabilizer effects, provides a powerful fiscal policy tool that can help counteract recessions. A countercyclical fiscal policy, in which taxes are cut or spending is increased, can dampen economic fluctuations and limit the depth of economic downturns.", "Debt-financed government spending is one component of Keynesian demand management\u2014the theory that government can stabilize the economy, or at least moderate economic fluctuations by using fiscal policy to offset changes in private consumption and investment. The federal government, according to that theory, can shift buying power from future to the present more easily than firms and households, and is therefore better able to maintain stable economic conditions. In the view of most macroeconomists, Keynesian demand management, as one component of a well-designed macroeconomic policy regime, can increase economic efficiency by preventing labor and capital goods from becoming unnecessarily idle during economic downturns.", "Reducing government deficits when economic growth is robust is another key component of a well-designed macroeconomic policy regime. In this respect, responsible fiscal policy requires that spending in economic downturns be paid for by future spending reductions and/or tax increases. Of course, higher taxes in the future reduce private consumption and cuts in future government programs reduce consumption of publicly provided goods and services. If debt is not reduced, higher interest rates may reduce future investment.", "Caveats Regarding Fiscal Stimulus", "Some economists have criticized the logic of Keynesian demand management and the discretionary application of fiscal spending by governments. Some have contended that Keynesian fiscal policy arguments do not take sufficient account of choices made by firms and individual households. Others argue that Keynesian demand management policies can create administrative problems and note that mustering the political will to maintain a sustainable fiscal policy by reducing spending over the economic cycle can be hard.", "Some economists have argued that not just the government, but also households can shift spending through time via borrowing and saving. Thus households, according to some, may counteract government fiscal policies by saving during economic downturns, thus further reducing consumption. Other economists note that many households are not in a position to choose between saving and consuming and that the low interest rates typically found in economic downturns may weaken incentives to save. Some evidence suggests that high-income households may take savings measures that offset government fiscal policies, but low-income households are, in general, less able to rearrange their finances in ways that would reduce the effectiveness of fiscal policy.", "The argument for Keynesian demand management presumes that governments run surpluses during economic expansions to repay debt accumulated when applying fiscal stimulus during economic downturns. Critics of deficit-financed fiscal policy argue that policymakers are more willing to raise government spending when economic growth slows than to cut spending when growth accelerates. Certain federal programs or increased spending, enacted during economic downturns, may remain in place after they are no longer necessary because of the interests of influential beneficiaries rather than overall economic welfare. On the other hand, some programs created during the Great Depression such as Social Security, have helped make many families less vulnerable to economic shocks.", "Few economists believe that large changes in fiscal policy designed to counterbalance short-term economic downturns can be timed precisely. Certainly, macroeconomists are more skeptical about the ability to fine-tune fiscal policy than their predecessors a generation ago. Most macroeconomists nonetheless believe fiscal policy is an important tool during deep or prolonged periods of slow or negative growth."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
