It was the 161 st nomination made by a President to the U.S. Supreme Court.", "On the day of Justice Scalia's death, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stated that the \"American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.\" Additionally, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated \"Given the huge divide in the country, ... it only makes sense that we defer to the American people who will elect a new president to select the next Supreme Court Justice.\" ", "In response, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) stated that \"The president can and should send the Senate a nominee right away.... Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential Constitutional responsibilities.\" President Obama also weighed in on whether the Garland nomination should be considered by the Senate, asking that the Senate \"give him a fair hearing and then an up or down vote,\" while also stating that \"I have fulfilled my constitutional duty. Now it's time for the Senate to do theirs.\"", "The Garland nomination was not acted upon by the Senate (receiving neither a committee hearing nor a floor vote) and was not withdrawn by the President\u2014making it the first Supreme Court nomination since 1866 for which no formal Senate action was taken and which was not subsequently withdrawn or resubmitted by a President. The nomination was ultimately returned to President Obama at the end of the 114 th Congress, on January 3, 2017. On February 1, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Neil M.

The issues addressed by the report include (1) how frequently vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, particularly vacancies created by the death of a sitting Justice; (2) how the length of the Scalia vacancy compares to past vacancies on the Court (as well as how the length of time the Garland nomination was pending before the Senate compares to past nominations); (3) how often vacancies on the Court arise during presidential election years (as well as how often vacancies on the Court have rolled over into a presidential election year from a preceding year); (4) how often vacancies on the Court have arisen during one presidency but are filled during a different presidency; and (5) how often vacancies on the Court have required multiple nominations prior to the appointment of a new Justice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How often does a vacancy occur on the Supreme Court?", "paragraphs": ["Since President George Washington's initial six appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, a vacancy on the Court has occurred, on average, every two years.

In more recent years (since 1980), a vacancy has occurred, on average, slightly less frequently (every 3.1 years). The length of time, however, between the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens in 2010 and the vacancy created by Justice Scalia's death in 2016 is the fifth longest period of time between two vacancies ever occurring on the Court (specifically, 2,054 days, or 5.6 years, between the two vacancies occurring)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How often is a vacancy created on the Court by the death of a sitting Justice?", "paragraphs": ["Under the Constitution, Justices on the Supreme Court hold office \"during good Behaviour,\" in effect typically receiving lifetime appointments to the Court.

Consequently, it has not been unusual, historically, for Justices to die while in office. Specifically, of the 111 vacancies that have occurred on the Court during the past 225 years, from the first vacancy in 1791 to the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia's death in 2016, 47 (or 42%) have arisen as the result of the death of a sitting Justice. Conversely, 64 (or 58%) of the vacancies since 1791 have occurred for some other reason (e.g., a new judgeship was created by Congress, a sitting Justice retired, or an Associate Justice was elevated to the Chief Justice position).", "Over the past 60 years, however, it has been relatively rare for vacancies on the Court to be created by the death of a Justice. Of the 25 vacancies on the Court since 1956, the vacancy created by the passing of Justice Scalia is only the second instance during this period of a vacancy created by the death of a Justice. Specifically, from 1956 to 2016, 2 (or 8%) of 25 vacancies were attributable to the death of a sitting Justice on the Court. Prior to the deaths of Justice Scalia (in 2016) and Chief Justice Rehnquist (in 2005), the last sitting Justice to die while serving on the Court was Justice Robert Jackson (in 1954).", "Prior to 1900, in contrast to more recent years, it was more common for vacancies to arise on the Court as a result of the death of a sitting Justice. Of the 51 vacancies on the Court that arose between 1791 and 1899, 30 (or 59%) arose in this manner.

Vacancies on the Court, for example, have ranged from a minimum of 1 day to a maximum of 835 days (or 2.3 years). In general, vacancies on the Court lasted for longer periods of time prior to the 20 th century than during the 20 th or 21 st centuries. For example, prior to 1900, vacancies lasted an average of 165 days, or 5.4 months (with a median length of time of 105 days, or 3.5 months).

The Scalia vacancy is the longest of the 80 vacancies on the Court to have occurred since 1861. The one other vacancy since 1900 to be among the 10 longest vacancies on the Court is the vacancy created in 1969 by the resignation of Justice Abe Fortas, lasting 363 days (and which remains only one of two vacancies in the history of the Court for which the full Senate rejected two nominations in up-or-down votes on the floor).

For example, prior to 1900, nominations waited an average of 18 days for final Senate action (with a median wait time of 6 days). In contrast, since 1956, nominations have waited an average of 67 days for final Senate action, or 2.2 months (with a median wait time of 65.5 days). Along these lines, Figure 3 shows the 10 longest nominations pending for a vacancy on the Supreme Court since 1791 to the present. Eight of the 10 nominations listed in the figure have been for vacancies that have occurred since 1956.", "As discussed above, the Scalia vacancy is currently the seventh longest vacancy to exist on the Court. The first nomination submitted to fill the Scalia vacancy\u2014the nomination of Judge Garland by President Obama\u2014is the longest pending nomination for any Supreme Court vacancy since 1791. As shown by the figure, the Garland nomination was pending before the Senate for a total of 293 days (from March 13, 2016 to January 3, 2017).

Four of the nominations were ultimately approved, with the longest-pending nomination that was confirmed as that of Louis Brandeis in 1916.", "A relatively long-lasting vacancy does not necessarily mean that a nomination for the vacancy was pending in the Senate for a relatively long period of time.

Swayne by President Lincoln \u2013was pending in the Senate for only 3 days prior to Mr. Swayne's confirmation.", "Additionally, some relatively long vacancies might have multiple nominations, rather than a single nomination, that, when added together, might reflect a relatively long period of time. For example, the vacancy created by Justice Smith Thompson on December 18, 1843 lasted for 424 days, while the cumulative length of time the six nominations for the Thompson vacancy were pending before the Senate totaled 190 days."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "How often have vacancies on the Supreme Court arisen during presidential election years?", "paragraphs": ["Vacancies on the Supreme Court that have arisen during presidential election years have been relatively uncommon.

Unlike the Scalia vacancy, however, 3 of these 16 vacancies occurred in the weeks after the general election, while another 4 vacancies arose prior to the election but did not have a nomination submitted by the President until after the election.", "Consequently, since 1791, there have been a total of 9 vacancies (including the Scalia vacancy) to arise on the Court during a presidential election year in which (1) the vacancy occurred prior to the general election itself; and (2) the President also nominated an individual to fill the vacancy prior to the election.

The other two nominations that were not approved by the Senate were for vacancies that arose during presidential election years in the 19 th century (1844 and 1852).", "Additionally, since the first vacancy in 1791, there have been nine vacancies on the Court during presidential election years in which the vacancy arose prior to the election year itself, i.e., the vacancy \"rolled over\" from a preceding year into the presidential election year. ", "For eight of the nine vacancies that rolled over into a presidential election year, the Senate confirmed a nomination during the election year itself. The most recent example of this type of vacancy was the vacancy created in 1987 by the retirement of Justice Powell (for which Anthony M. Kennedy was nominated on November 30, 1987 and confirmed the following year, on February 3, 1988).", "There have also been anticipated vacancies on the Court during a presidential election year. For example, in 1968, President Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (in anticipation of the retirement of Chief Justice Earl Warren ) and Homer Thornberry to be an Associate Justice (in anticipation of the need to replace Fortas, who was already serving on the Court as an Associate Justice). After the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the Fortas nomination, President Johnson withdrew both nominations.

The death of Justice Peter Daniel created a vacancy on May 31, 1860.

Five of the vacancies listed in the figure occurred during the \"Modern Party System,\" a period from approximately 1854 to the present (the beginning of which coincides with the founding of the Republican Party).", "Of the eight vacancies, the Scalia vacancy reflects the greatest number of days (among Supreme Court vacancies that arose during one presidency and were filled during a different presidency) from a vacancy occurring on the Court to when a President left office.

Additionally, sometimes a nomination for an anticipated vacancy on the Court is unsuccessful (thus requiring at least one additional nomination).", "Since 1791, there have been a total of 20 vacancies (representing approximately 19% of all vacancies on the Court) for which more than one nomination was made prior to the vacancy being filled by the appointment of a new Justice. The Scalia vacancy is the most recent vacancy on the Court requiring more than one nomination prior to being filled.", " Figure 6 shows the 12 vacancies since 1860 (the first vacancy to occur after the start of the modern two-party system) that have required multiple nominations prior to the appointment of a new Justice on the Supreme Court. Six of the vacancies occurred between 1860 and 1899; one of the vacancies occurred between 1900 and 1955; and five of the vacancies occurred between 1956 and 2016.", "As shown by the figure, six of the vacancies involved the Senate formally rejecting one or more nominations in a floor vote.

In one case, the initial nominee whose nomination was approved by the Senate died before taking office (requiring President Grant to submit a second nomination for the Grier vacancy). ", "The Scalia vacancy is distinctive among the 12 vacancies in that it is the only vacancy to include a nomination which, pursuant to Senate rules, was returned to the President at the end of a congress after the Senate took no action to process the nomination.", "Not surprisingly, as also shown by Figure 6 , vacancies requiring multiple nominations prior to being filled have generally lasted longer than the median length of a vacancy on the Court (i.e., longer than 61 days). Eight of the 11 vacancies lasted longer than 61 days, while 7 lasted at least 100 days. Additionally, 6 of the vacancies have lasted longer than the average length of a vacancy on the court (i.e., longer than 121 days).", "The figure also shows that, for vacancies requiring more than one nomination prior to being filled, the nominee whose nomination is eventually approved by the Senate has generally received unanimous or nearly unanimous support at the time of confirmation (even after, in some cases, the Senate had narrowly rejected one or more previous nominations for the same vacancy). Four of the nominees were approved by voice vote. Of the remaining six nominees whose nominations received a roll call vote, three received zero nay votes; one received fewer than 5 nay votes; and another received fewer than 10 nay votes.
