Affected units will be subject to the permitting requirements of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V provisions. For PSD, this will include state determinations of what constitutes Best Available Control Technology (BACT) that affected facilities will be required to install. On November 10, 2010, EPA released guidance and technical information to assist state authorities in issuing permits and determining BACT.", "Among the sources likely to be affected by implementation of the PSD permit requirements are new and modified electric generating units of all kinds, but particularly those fired by coal. These sources emit substantially more than EPA's threshold of 100,000 metric tons of CO2 annually: for example, a 500 megawatt (MW) coal-fired baseload power plant would emit on the order of three million metric tons of CO2 annually. The coal mining industry and coal-fired electric utilities face at least half a dozen major regulatory actions over the next few years; industry supporters view these rules collectively as a significant threat to the future of coal. Viewed in this context, the permit requirement is one more nail in what increasingly appears to them as coal's future coffin.", "In its new guidance, EPA retains the basic five-step process for determining BACT that it has recommended to state authorities for 20 years. The primary foci of the EPA guidance package are on state discretion in determining BACT and on energy efficiency as the most likely result of a GHG BACT analysis. These foci are evident through EPA's guidance for each of the five steps.", "For those looking for bright lines and specific recommendations with respect to GHG BACT technologies, particularly with respect to coal-fired facilities, the released package does not provide them. Indeed, EPA's supplemental \"Questions and Answers\" release on the guidance seems to stress that it did not draw such conclusions. For example:", "Do these tools identify BACT for specific types of industrial facilities? No. Does this guidance say that fuel switching (coal to natural gas) should be selected as BACT for a power plant? No. Does this guidance say that carbon capture and storage (CCS) should be selected as BACT? No.", "Likewise, the guidance provides no cost thresholds for permitting authorities to consider in determining the economic impacts of alternatives nor proposes a new approach to selecting BACT for GHG emissions. Instead, the guidance focuses on the discretionary authority that states have in determining BACT\u2014discretion that ensures that BACT will continue to be determined on a case-by-case basis with states differing in what they consider appropriate control measures and what constitutes BACT. Whether industry will find such discretion provides sufficient regulatory certainty to invest billions in new plants remains to be seen.", "In short, the EPA GHG guidance is a simple expansion of the five-step BACT process that has been used for two decades to include greenhouse gases.

The agency estimates that currently about 280 sources have required PSD permits annually, and that a 100/250 ton threshold for GHGs would increase that number by 140-fold.

Faced with what it considers the \"absurd results\" of following the letter of the law, EPA in September 2009 proposed that the agency and state permitting authorities would, out of \"administrative necessity,\" focus first on the largest facilities. As proposed, the Tailoring Rule would initially have limited the PSD and Title V permit requirements to facilities that emit more than 25,000 metric tons per year of carbon dioxide (or its equivalent in other GHGs).

The overall presumption of the process is that the measure that results in the maximum reduction in the pollutant should be installed unless energy, environmental, and economic impacts of that choice justify its rejection. The five-step process, as used by EPA is as follows:", "1. Identify Available Control Options \u2014there are at least five categories of control options that states can review in identifying possible BACT in an individual case: (a) existing control technologies for sources of that type; (b) technically feasible options that are used on other source categories, but not the one under review; (c) innovative control technology that has never been commercially demonstrated ( inclusion not required ); (d) inherently lower polluting production processes, fuels, and coatings that can be evaluated alone or in combination with other control devices; and (e) specific design or operational parameters that may include such factors as combustion control techniques. These categories of options are not mutually exclusive. As stated by EPA in its guidance: \"Combinations of inherently lower-polluting processes/practices (or a process made to be inherently less polluting) and add-on controls are likely to yield more effective means of emission control than either approach alone.\" Data for control options include EPA's BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, existing EPA or state permits, equipment vendors, trade associations, permitting engineers, and technical papers and journals. 2. Eliminate Technically Infeasible Control Options \u2014control options need to be either demonstrated on a like facility or determined to be both available and applicable in the particular case.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are the Options for Coal-Fired Power Plants?", "paragraphs": ["Much of the discussion about EPA's guidance for GHG BACT has focused on coal-fired power plants. Coal-fired electric generating facilities are responsible for about 28% of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions. As noted, in general, there are five categories of control options that are considered in a BACT analysis: A review of the categories of GHG control options for coal-fired facilities reveals few readily available alternatives to significantly reduce emissions.", "1. Existing Control Technology : a technology proven to work for the particular source category being permitted. There are no existing add-on technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired facilities. 2. Technically Feasible Technology : a technology proven to work for other source categories, but not demonstrated on the particular source category being permitted. While an argument could be made that capture technology is commercially available for industrial facilities (to separate carbon dioxide from a facility's other emissions), there is no such available technology with respect to the storage of any captured carbon dioxide. It is possible in some cases that the carbon dioxide could be piped to a facility needing carbon dioxide (such as an oil field using enhanced oil recovery (EOR)), but those opportunities would be very site-specific. 3. Innovative Control Technology : a technology that has never been commercialized on any source category; it is in the pilot-plant or demonstration stage of development or deployment (for example, oxygen combustion [also called oxy-fuel]). Deployment of an innovative technology on a coal-fired power plant would likely involve substantial costs and risks\u2014costs and risks that could jeopardize the facility's viability. 4. Inherently Lower Polluting Production Processes, Fuels, and Coatings : an individual adjustment or combination of adjustments in a facility's production process, its source of fuel, and its use of coatings. Inherently lower emitting fuels are available that could either partially (co-fired) or completely replace coal. Two such alternatives would be natural gas and biomass. However, these alternatives could arguably change (or \"redefine\") the fundamental purpose of the source (a change EPA does not require under its BACT guidance), and eliminate some of the advantages of building a coal-fired facility. 5. Specific Design or Operational Parameters : adjustments in a facility's design and/or inclusion of inherently less polluting work practices in the facility's operation. For a coal-fired facility, the BACT analysis would probably focus on this last category\u2014specifically, either changing the coal-fired design to better accommodate future technology advancements (such as using integrated gasification combined cycle technology) or employing energy-efficient control measures, as discussed later. ", "With a multi-billion dollar investment in a project designed to operate for decades at stake, the lack of a definitive option arguably adds more uncertainty to future coal-fired power plants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Work Has EPA Already Done on BACT?", "paragraphs": ["With the options currently limited with respect to BACT for coal-fired power plants, much of EPA's work has focused on energy efficiency and innovative control measures, as discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Bush Administration's ANPR", "paragraphs": ["In April 2007, in a case involving a petition to EPA to establish GHG emission standards for motor vehicles, the Supreme Court ruled that EPA must address the question of whether GHGs cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers public health or welfare. The case was Massachusetts v. EPA. For nearly two years following the Supreme Court's decision the Bush Administration's EPA did not respond to the original petition nor make a finding regarding endangerment. Its only formal action following the Court decision was to issue a detailed information request, called an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), on July 30, 2008. ", "The ANPR occupied 167 pages of the Federal Register . Besides requesting information, it took the unusual approach of presenting statements from the Office of Management and Budget, four Cabinet Departments (Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, and Energy), the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, the Director of the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy at the Small Business Administration, each of whom expressed their objections to regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The OMB statement began by noting that, \"The issues raised during interagency review are so significant that we have been unable to reach interagency consensus in a timely way, and as a result, this staff draft cannot be considered Administration policy or representative of the views of the Administration.\" It went on to state that \"... the Clean Air Act is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\" The other letters concurred. ", "In its Technical Support Document for its ANPR, EPA took a narrow view of the alternatives available to it in imposing greenhouse gas performance standards. For existing electric generating sources, the EPA focused on incremental improvements in the heat rates of existing units through options that \"are well known in the industry\" with an overall improvement in efficiency likely to be less than 5%. For new electric generating sources, EPA noted the availability of more efficient supercritical coal units, the future availability of ultra-supercritical units, and the possibility of limited biomass co-firing. ", "Continuing along this line of reasoning, EPA also suggested that it could develop regulations that anticipate future technology. For example, a phase-in approach to applying CO 2 standards to power plants would be to mandate that \"carbon-ready\" generating technology be required for new construction. The objective would be to anticipate the widespread need for some form of carbon capture technology in the future by preparing for it with compatible fossil-fuel combustion technology now. The technology most discussed is integrated-gasification, combined-cycle (IGCC). With respect to some of the carbon capture technology under development, IGCC has certain advantages over pulverized coal technology. However, just how much IGCC is \"carbon ready\" is subject to debate. EPA stated in its ANPR that it believes such a staged approach is available to it under section 111 (the statutory floor for BACT determinations, and a possibility that EPA is also exploring for its BACT guidance):", "EPA believes that section 111 may be used to set both single-phase performance standards based upon current technology and to set two-phased or multi-phased standards with more stringent limits in future years. Future-year limits may permissibly be based on technologies that, at the time of the rulemaking, we find adequately demonstrated to be available for use at some specified future date.", "The technical support document does not mention some more aggressive options. These include a fuel-neutral standard or a technology-based standard. For example, for carbon dioxide emissions from a newly-constructed power plant, a fuel-neutral standard could follow the example set by the 1997 and 2005 NSPS for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the 2005 NOx NSPS for modified existing sources. Under those regulations, the NOx emissions standard is the same, regardless of the fuel burned\u2014solid, liquid, or gaseous. This standard is much more expensive for coal-fired facilities to comply with than for natural-gas-fired facilities, thus encouraging the lower-carbon gas-fired technologies. Likewise, EPA could choose to set a newly-constructed power plant standard based on the performance of natural gas burned in a combined-cycle configuration\u2014the fuel and technology of choice for construction of new power plants for the last two decades. If EPA wanted to encourage the rollover of the existing coal-fired power plant fleet to natural gas, nuclear, or renewable sources, it could apply a fuel-neutral standard to modified sources as well. For example, a CO 2 emission standard of 0.8 lb. per kilowatt-hour output could be met by a new natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility, as well as any non-emitting generating technology, such as nuclear power or renewables. In contrast, the standard would require a 60% reduction in emissions from a new coal-fired facility\u2014forcing the development of a carbon control technology, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), in order for a new coal-fired facility to be built or modified. ", "The viability of these options, or even more aggressive technology-forcing standards, would depend on how EPA determined whether a technology had been \"adequately demonstrated\" and its assessment of the seriousness of the technology's costs and energy requirements. As NSPS and BACT determinations are linked, EPA's NSPS determination will have a substantial impact on state-determined BACT actions.

However, the Work Group had a basic disagreement on the scope of its work. Some felt that the Work Group should assume that the BACT process would apply to GHGs in the same manner that it does for criteria air pollutants, arguing that existing BACT case law and EPA guidance were sufficiently broad to address GHGs. Others argued that the Work Group should explore whether another approach to BACT and GHGs would be more appropriate.

Criteria for Eliminating Technologies : With respect to the three basic criteria: (a) Environmental impacts : EPA should continue to allow permitting authorities to consider the overall environmental impacts of a GHG application. These impacts include effects on criteria air pollutant levels, water-related impacts, threatened or endangered species, hazardous and solid waste effects, and soils and vegetation. (b) Energy impacts : Scope of BACT assessment for energy efficiency is very important. (c) Economic Impacts : BACT analysis should be done on a carbon-dioxide-equivalent basis. 4. Needs of States and Stakeholders : Several areas of recommendations were agreed to with respect to (a) timely communications with all stakeholders; (b) EPA guidance on appropriate cost methodologies, approaches, and technologies for GHG reductions; (c) steps to expedite, streamline and provide certainty to the BACT determination process; (d) guidance on netting of GHG emissions; and (e) training for permitting agencies, regulated community and other stakeholders.

The cost thresholds suggested by group members ranged for $3-$15 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalence (CO 2 e) to $30-$150, with others opposed to any fixed monetary values in favor of EPA guidance to permitting authorities on cost-effectiveness values based on the status of various technologies.

The review of options may include reliability and operational characteristics of the alternative. 3. Rank technically feasible energy efficient measures . Options should be ranked according to specific GHG CO 2 e reduction potential for the new facility. 4. Evaluate most effective energy efficient measures . Evaluation should include the energy efficiency and GHG impacts, economic impacts, and environmental impact on other pollutants and media (water, solid waste, etc). Permitting authorities need to assess the tradeoffs between all BACT analyses for each regulated pollutant. The analysis should include a clear justification for elimination of any top candidates. 5. Incorporate energy efficient measures into GHG BACT emissions limit .

", "With respect to the level at which BACT analysis should occur (individual equipment, entire production line, or entire facility) the Work Group did not reach any specific consensus.", "The Work Group's discussion of introducing ways to encourage inherently efficient and lower emitting processes and practices for GHGs focused primarily on the existing Innovative Control Technology (ICT) waiver provided under the Clean Air Act. EPA may grant an ICT waiver from otherwise applicable NSPS requirements to encourage development of an \"innovative technological system or systems of continuous emission reduction\" that has a substantial likelihood of achieving greater, or at least equivalent, emission reductions than current technology with lower energy, economic, or nonair environmental impacts. The waiver applies to the portion of the source on which it is installed and applies to the deadline for compliance, not the underlying NSPS. The deadline extension is up to seven years after the waiver is granted, or four years after a source commences operation (whichever is earlier). If the technology fails, the waiver may be extended up to three years to allow the facility to comply with the NSPS through other means. EPA may grant only sufficient waivers for a given technology to ascertain whether the technology works and satisfies the energy, economic, and environmental impact criteria. ", "Although the statutory language applies to NSPS, waiver authority has been included in PSD-BACT regulations since 1980. The addition of BACT to the waiver provisions reflects the interaction between NSPS and BACT. In addition, EPA draft NSR guidance has narrowly defined the need for multiple waivers for an individual technology: \"as a practical matter, \u2026 granting of additional waivers to similar sources is highly unlikely since the subsequent applicants are no longer 'innovative.'\" The PSD-BACT ICT waiver has been rarely used. ", "The Workgroup had several recommendations to encourage the use of ICT waivers, consistent with existing statutory authority. In urging EPA to make the ICT waiver more attractive to facilities seeking permits, the Workgroup made the following recommendations: ", "1. EPA should disavow its current guidance that an ICT waiver is available for only one application of a technology. Multiple waivers for a technology should be allowed as appropriate to encourage commercialization of the technology; 2. EPA should formally and publicly state its views about the waiver's availability in terms of a technology's deployment status and breadth of use among different types of facilities; 3. EPA should reevaluate the maximum time a waiver can be issued for, on a case-by-case basis; 4.

In 2009, the EAB issued a series of opinions that rejected the 2005 EPA opinion and remanded these cases back to their respective state or EPA regional offices for further review. Reiterating its opinion in the Desert Rock case, the EAB stated in the John W Turk Jr. case: ", "However, as was the case with EPA Region 9's response to comment in the Desert Rock permit, the ADEQ [Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality] has not in fact followed EPA's interpretation on this issue because it has not applied the analytical framework outlined by the EAB in a prior decision, despite citing to that decision as part of its rationale. ADEQ has thus made the same error as EPA Region 9 by not taking a hard look at how AEP defined its project and to \"discern which design elements were inherent to that purpose and which design elements could be changed to achieve pollutant emissions reductions without disrupting [the applicant's] basic business purpose.\" See Desert Rock, Slip Op. at 69.", "In the EPA guidance, EPA suggests permitting authorities look to the EAB decision, stating: \"in assessing whether an option would fundamentally redefine a proposed source, EPA recommends that permitting authorities apply the analytical framework recently articulated by the Environmental Appeals Board.\" Indeed, EPA states clearly that it \"no longer subscribes to the reasoning used by the Agency in a 2005 letter to justify excluding IGCC from consideration in all cases on redefining the source grounds.\" ", "While EPA recommends the EAB framework, it does not restrict states to it: \"The \"redefining the source\" issue is ultimately a question of degree that is within the discretion of the permitting authority.\" This discretionary authority is evident as the guidance document discusses \"clean fuel\" options, such as whether a natural gas electric generating facility is a control option for a proposed coal-fired electric generating facility:", "For example, when an applicant proposes to construct a coal-fired steam electric generating unit, EPA continues to believe that permitting authorities can show in most cases that the option of using natural gas as a primary fuel would fundamentally redefine a coal-fired generating unit. [footnote omitted] Ultimately, however, a permitting authority retains the discretion to conduct a broader BACT analysis and to consider changes in the primary fuel in Step 1 of the analysis. ", "EPA does believe that energy efficiency measures will have a significant role in GHG BACT analysis. In its guidance, EPA divides energy efficiency measures into two categories. The first category includes technologies and/or processes that maximize the overall efficiency of the proposed facility. In examining these alternatives EPA recommends authorities focus on improving the efficiency of large components and on suites of techniques that can be judged against established benchmarks. ", "The second category of energy efficiency options includes options that improve the use of thermal energy and electricity that is generated and used on site. ", "In contrast, EPA classifies CCS as an add-on pollution control technology that is available for all CO 2 emitting facilities, such as coal-fired power plants. Therefore, EPA believes it should be listed in Step 1 for such facilities. However, EPA believes it will likely be eliminated in later steps: \"Many other case-specific factors, such as the technical feasibility and cost of CCS technology for the specific application, size of the facility, proposed location of the source, and availability and access to transportation and storage opportunities, should be assessed at later steps of a top-down BACT analysis.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Step 2 Guidance", "paragraphs": ["EPA's specific GHG guidance for Step 2 is primarily focused on CCS.

The applicant is responsible for providing evidence that a potential control measure is technically infeasible. However, the permitting authority is responsible for deciding technical feasibility. The permitting authority may require the applicant to address the availability and applicability of a new or emerging technology based on information that becomes available during the consideration of the permit application. ", "With respect to CCS, EPA expects this step to be a major barrier: \"While CCS is a promising technology, EPA does not believe that at this time CCS will be a technically feasible BACT option in certain cases.\" Particularly, technical hurdles with transport and storage of CO 2 may prevent the technology from being reasonably installed and operated in many cases.

[footnote omitted] EPA and other permitting authorities have most often used this analysis to eliminate more stringent control technologies with significant or unusual effects that are unacceptable in favor of the less stringent technologies with more acceptable collateral environmental effects. However, EPA has also interpreted the BACT requirements to allow for a more stringent technology to remain in consideration as BACT if the collateral environmental benefits of choosing such a technology outweigh the economic or energy costs of that selection. [footnote omitted] ... The same principle applies when assessing technologies for controlling GHGs. ", "In comparing the environmental impacts of GHG emissions and other regulated pollutants, EPA recommends focusing on the relative levels of emissions rather than on endpoint impacts. Because of the global nature of climate change, the impact of any individual project is likely to be slight. Thus, EPA recommends that the permitting authorities focus on the amount of GHG emissions reductions that would be gained or lost by a specific control measure and how that compares with the collateral increase for other regulated pollutants. EPA states that relatively small collateral increases of another regulated pollutant need not be of concern, \"unless even that small increase would be significant, such as a situation where an area is close to exceeding a NAAQS or PSD increment and the additional increase could push the area into nonattainment.\" ", "In discussing economic impacts, EPA notes that because of the large volumes of GHGs created by many projects compared with their emissions of other regulated pollutants, it is reasonable that cost effectiveness numbers (in $/ton of CO 2 e) for GHG control measures will be \"significantly lower\" than those for other regulated pollutant controls. ", "As part of its continuing commentary on CCS, EPA states that \"even if not eliminated in Step 2 of the BACT analysis, on the basis of the current costs of CCS, we expect that CCS will often be eliminated from consideration in Step 4 of the BACT analysis, even in some cases where underground storage of the captured CO 2 near the power plant is feasible.\" EPA notes that there may be cases where the economics do work out and that future research and development may make CCS more viable in the future.

States have the discretion with respect to its evaluation under Step 4. CCS is an available add-on control measure that should be included in Step 1. EPA expects CCS will generally be eliminated from consideration under Step 2 or Step 4. However, states have the discretion with respect to its evaluation under Step 2 and Step 4. Natural gas substitution for coal in a facility is generally considered by EPA to be an option that redefines the source and thus can be excluded under Step 1. However, states have the discretion to determine whether they believe it redefines the source and to evaluate it accordingly. ", "EPA's focus on energy efficiency for coal-fired facilities is evident in the White Paper that accompanies the guidance document. The White Paper focuses entirely on energy efficiency improvements and carbon capture and storage technologies. Other alternatives\u2014such as co-firing with biomass or natural gas, or natural gas substitution\u2014are not discussed. The White Paper provides an example of a coal-fired unit BACT analysis based on the 2007 air permit application of Consumers Energy Company for an 830 MW supercritical pulverized-coal (PC)-fired unit. During the analysis, the applicant provided an analysis that compared five generating technologies: (1) supercritical PC-fired unit with and without CCS, (2) subcritical PC-fired unit without CCS, (3) subcritical and supercritical circulating fluidized bed (CFB) units without CCS; (4) IGCC unit without CCS, and (5) ultra-supercritical PC-fired unit without CCS. EPA notes that of the units without CCS, the ultra-supercritical PC-fired unit had the lowest projected heat rate and the lowest GHG emissions rate. However, despite stating that ultra-supercritical units \"burning various coal ranks are being widely deployed throughout the world\" EPA cites a 2007 NETL study to say that \"the availability and reliability of materials required to support the elevated temperature environment for high sulfur or chlorine applications, although extensively demonstrated in the laboratory, has not been fully demonstrated commercially.\" Apparently, the state of Michigan agreed and approved the permit based on the original supercritical design in December 2009.

The Russell City Energy Center is a 612 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle project to be constructed in Hayward, CA, by an affiliate of Calpine Corporation. In addition to agreeing to greenhouse gas emission limitations, Calpine will also have to install dry low NOx combustors, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), and an oxidation catalyst to limit emissions of other pollutants (particularly NOx). Petitions to the EAB by environmental groups challenging the permit were rejected by the EAB on November 18, 2010. ", "The permit places limits on greenhouse gas emissions in carbon dioxide equivalence from the facility's two gas turbines and heat recovery steam generators (i.e., the combined-cycle), its fire pump diesel engine, and its five circuit breakers. For the combined-cycle, the limitations are 242 metric tons hourly, 5,802 metric tons daily, and 1,928,182 metric tons annually. In addition, the heat rate of the power plant is not allowed to exceed 7,730 Btu per kilowatt-hour. If the power plant maintains the efficiency required by the permit, it would be allowed to operate at about an 85% capacity factor.", "In making this determination, the five-step BACT approach was used. In identifying potential control technology, the technologies identified were thermal efficiency and carbon capture and storage. Some commenters argued in favor of non-fossil electricity generation as an alternative to the proposed plant. However, BAAQMD noted that the 1990 draft EPA guidance does not require consideration of non-fossil-fuel-fired alternatives and deferred to the California Energy Commission.

No. Does this guidance say that fuel switching (coal to natural gas) should be selected as BACT for a power plant? No. Does this guidance say that carbon capture and storage (CCS) should be selected as BACT? No. ", "Likewise, the guidance provides no cost thresholds for permitting authorities to consider in determining the economic impacts of alternatives or propose a new approach to selecting BACT for GHG emissions. Instead, the guidance focuses on the discretionary authority that states have in determining BACT; discretion that ensures that BACT will continue to be determined on a case-by-case basis, with states differing in some cases in what they consider appropriate control measures and what constitutes BACT. Whether industry will find such discretion provides sufficient regulatory certainty for it to invest billions in new plant remains to be seen. ", "In short, the EPA GHG guidance is a simple expansion of the five-step BACT process that has been used for two decades to include greenhouse gases. Whether that is an adequate response will be determined by applicants, state authorities, and future EPA regulatory actions under related parts of the act, such as Section 111 (NSPS), to which BACT is linked."], "subsections": []}]}}
