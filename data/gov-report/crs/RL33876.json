In 1935, the Philippine Constitution was adopted and the first President of the Philippines was elected. The granting of full independence was ultimately delayed until 1946 because of the Japanese occupation of the Islands from 1942-1945.", "Among other things, P.L. 73-127 reserved to the United States the power to maintain military bases and armed forces in the Philippines and, upon order of the President of the United States, the right to call into the service of the U.S. Armed Forces all military forces organized by the Philippine government. On July 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order inducting all military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines under the command of a newly created command structure called the United States Armed Forces of the Far East (USAFFE). These units remained under USAFFE command through the duration of World War II (WWII), until authority over them was returned to the Commonwealth at the time of independence.", "From time to time since 1946, Congress has passed laws providing, and in some instances repealing, benefits to Filipino veterans.

However, statements made by Senator Carl Hayden during hearings on the second Rescission Act, which affected New Philippine Scouts, provide some indication of legislative intent in the passage of the first Rescission Act, and to the subsequent passage of the second Rescission Act. Furthermore, other events at the time may provide some context in which the Rescission Acts were considered.", "At the end of World War II, when Congress was considering a $200 million appropriation for the support of the Philippine Army, Senator Carl Hayden of the Senate Committee on Appropriations sent a letter to General Omar Bradley, then Director of the Veterans' Administration, requesting information concerning the status of the Filipino servicemen and the potential cost of their veterans benefits. In his response to the committee, General Bradley indicated that the total cost of paying veterans' benefits to members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and their dependents, under then existing veterans' laws, would amount in the long run (75 years) to about $3 billion. It seems clear from Senator Hayden's statements that the passage of the first Rescission Act was meant to balance competing financial interests by providing some benefits, such as pensions for service-connected disability or death, while at the same time reducing the U.S. liability for future benefits. To accomplish this, Senator Hayden, Senator Russell and Senator Brooks included language by way of an amendment to the first Rescission bill stating that service by members of the Commonwealth Army was not considered active military, naval, or air service in the U.S. Armed Forces. Furthermore, hearings on the second Rescission Act also clearly indicate that it was Congress's intent to limit wartime benefits given to New Philippine Scouts:", "Because neither the President nor the Congress has declared an end to the war, a [New] Philippine Scout upon separation from service would be entitled to the same benefits as an American soldier who served in time of war. Unless this amendment [to the second Rescission Act] is adopted, a [New Philippine] Scout would be entitled to claim every advantage provided for the G.I. bill of rights such as loans, education, unemployment compensation, hospitalization, domiciliary care and other benefits provided by the laws administered by the Veterans' Administration. Because hostilities have actually ceased, the amendment makes it perfectly clear that these wartime benefits do not apply and that the 50,000 men now authorized to be enlisted in the [New] Philippine Scouts will be entitled only to pensions resulting from service-connected disability or service-connected death.", "In addition, the passage of the Rescission Acts may have been influenced by other bills under consideration by Congress at that time. In 1946, Congress passed the Philippine Rehabilitation Act (P.L. 79-370) and the Philippine Trade Act (P.L. 79-371). The terms of the Rehabilitation Act required the United States to pay claims for rehabilitation of the Philippines and war damage claims up to $620 million. Of this sum, $220 million was allocated for repair of public property. The remaining $400 million was allocated for war damage claims of individuals and associations. The Philippine Trade Act provided for free trade between the United States and the Philippines until July 3, 1954. These bills under consideration at the time would have provided economic stability to the newly emerging nation. According to Senator Hayden:", "As I see it, the best thing the American government can do is to help the Filipino people to help themselves. Where there was a choice between expenditures for the rehabilitation of the economy of the Philippine Islands and payments in cash to Filipino veterans, I am sure it is better to spend any equal sum of money, for example, on improving the roads and port facilities. What the Filipino veteran needs is steady employment rather than to depend for his living upon a monthly payment sent from the United States.", "Therefore, it seems clear that Congress considered the Rescission Acts in the context of providing for the comprehensive economic development of the soon to be sovereign Republic of the Philippines."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Benefit Changes, 1946-1998", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Care Benefits", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "P.L. 80-865", "paragraphs": ["Enacted on July 1, 1948, P.L. 80-865 authorized aid not to exceed $22.5 million for the construction and equipping of a hospital in the Philippines to provide care for Commonwealth Army veterans and Recognized Guerrilla Forces.
