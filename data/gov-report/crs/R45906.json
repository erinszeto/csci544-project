For FY2019, appropriations actions spanned two Congresses, between which there was a change in the majority party in the House.", "The process of drafting, considering, and enacting FY2019 appropriations began in early 2018 and included the House and Senate Appropriations Committees each marking up and reporting all 12 annual appropriations bills by the end of July. Five appropriations bills in the 115 th Congress were enacted into law by the start of the fiscal year. An additional seven appropriations bills remained in various stages of consideration. Continuing resolutions (CRs) were enacted in order to extend funding of government operations covered in these seven bills. The first CR for FY2019 provided funding through December 7, 2018. A second CR provided funding through December 21, 2018. When the second CR expired, funding lapsed for the agencies and activities covered in the remaining seven appropriations bills, and a partial government shutdown ensued. The shutdown ended on January 25, 2019, when the 116 th Congress enacted a third CR to provide funding through February 15, 2019. Appropriations actions were subsequently completed when H.J.Res . 31 , an omnibus measure covering the seven remaining appropriations measures, was signed into law on February 15, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ).", "These and other actions are detailed in this report to provide overview information and a chronology of FY2019 appropriations measures.

The House and Senate Appropriations Committees then hold hearings at which agencies provide further information and details about the President's budget. These hearings may be followed by congressional consideration of a budget resolution establishing a ceiling on overall spending within appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year. Committee and floor consideration of the annual appropriations bills occurs during the spring and summer months and may continue through the fall and winter until annual appropriations actions are completed.

In addition, the law created procedures that would automatically lower those caps if specified deficit-reducing legislation were not enacted.", "Congress has adjusted these statutory caps, including through the Bipartisan Budget Acts (BBAs) of 2013 (for FY2014 and FY2015), 2015 (for FY2016 and FY2017), 2018 (for FY2018 and FY2019), and 2019 (for FY2020 and FY2021), which provided for spending cap increases in both defense and nondefense categories.

It also provided that in the absence of agreement on a budget resolution for FY2019, the Budget Committees in the House and Senate could make committee allocations that could function as enforceable limits under Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act. In May 2018, the House and Senate submitted these filings.

In both chambers, separate regular appropriations bills were combined for floor consideration into consolidated appropriations bills, commonly referred to as \"minibuses\" (in contrast to an omnibus bill comprising most or all regular appropriations bills). These appropriations bill groupings were also used for resolving differences between the House and Senate through conference committees.", "Three appropriations bills were combined for initial consideration in the House: Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs ( H.R. 5895 ).
