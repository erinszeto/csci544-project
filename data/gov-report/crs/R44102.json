{"id": "R44102", "title": "Hunting and Fishing: Analysis of S. 556 and S. 659", "released_date": "2015-07-09T00:00:00", "summary": ["Hunting, fishing, trapping, and recreational shooting, particularly on federal lands, have been the subjects of various bills for several Congresses. In general, federal land management agencies work with state fish and game agencies in setting quotas, bag or size limits, and other specifics of management. Some agencies currently open more than 90% of their acreage to hunting and fishing. Yet there has been criticism in recent years that insufficient federal land is open to hunting. In the 114th Congress, attention has focused on a pair of companion bills, S. 556 and S. 659. While both are entitled the \"Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015,\" each addresses different issues.", "S. 556 is intended to create or reinforce an \"open until closed\" management policy regarding these activities as well as for trapping and recreational shooting on federal lands. The bill describes criteria for federal land management agencies to consider in closing federal lands to fishing, hunting, or recreational shooting, and it directs that management is subject to existing law. Ambiguities in the text leave some doubt as to which federal lands are subject to the bill's provisions, which may result in the inclusion of lands managed by the Department of Defense, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Department of Energy. Those agencies typically are not considered land management agencies. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), and Forest Service (FS) generally are considered land management agencies.", "S. 556 would change land management practices on some federal lands and require additional or different analyses, reports, or notices. For some agencies and some of the defined activities, modification may only add or change steps in the planning process. In addition, by including trapping under the definition of hunting, the practice of trapping may be added or encouraged on federal lands where it currently is not encouraged or permitted. Other provisions of the bill specify new procedures for small film crews to operate on federal lands, permit the carrying of bows and crossbows in national parks, and set aside a portion of appropriations under the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for promoting physical access to federal lands for recreationists. The bill also would require reporting of expenditures under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7504) and of payments under the federal government's judgment fund in litigation against the federal government.", "S. 659 also addresses matters related to wildlife but is less focused on federal lands. It would exempt lead shot and ammunition and fishing sinkers from the provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA; 15 U.S.C. \u00a72602(2)(B)) and allow territories and states to use more of the funds allocated to them under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7669) for projects involving public target ranges for firearms or archery. The bill would allow hunters to import polar bear trophies taken in Canada before the species was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205). In addition, it would redefine what constitutes hunting waterfowl over a baited field and allow the possession of loaded firearms at Army Corps of Engineers projects in areas open to the public. Finally, the bill would reauthorize or amend seven statutes relating to international wildlife conservation."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Various bills in the 114 th Congress address issues related to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal and state lands. Hunting and conservation have been linked in federal wildlife legislation since the passage the Lacey Act of 1900 (the first federal wildlife law, making it a federal crime to ship game killed in violation of one state's laws to another state) and then the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (regulating the killing, hunting, buying, or selling of migratory birds). Currently, hunting and fishing are allowed on the majority of federal lands (as measured in acres).", "Some believe that federal lands are unnecessarily restricted by protective designations, barriers to physical access, or burdensome agency planning processes. Others question whether opening more lands to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting is fully consistent with good game management, public safety, other recreational uses, resource management, and the statutory purposes of the lands. Two recent bills, S. 556 and S. 659 , address giving hunting and fishing activities a higher priority in land management. Although both bills address hunting, fishing, and other forms of outdoor recreation, S. 556 is focused on federal lands while S. 659 covers diverse topics such as the regulation of lead shot, imports of polar bear trophies, the funding of land acquisition for recreation, and the reauthorization of certain international wildlife conservation laws.", "Under current law, federal land managers balance hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting with good game management, public safety, resource management, and the statutory purposes of the lands. The resulting balance point will vary among agencies based on the statutory requirements of the agency, land classification, location, and other factors. The four traditional land management agencies\u2014the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all in the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture\u2014do not maintain data on how many acres of land are currently open to hunting, fishing, and/or recreational shooting. However, BLM \"estimates that over 99 percent of BLM-managed public lands are open to hunting, and 99 percent of BLM-managed public lands are open to recreational target shooting.\" FS estimates that more than 95% of its lands are currently open to these activities. Among the FWS's 594 wildlife refuges and waterfowl production areas, more than 360 are open to some form of hunting, and more than 300 units offer fishing opportunities. As of February 2014, hunting was permitted in 61 of the 401 NPS units, and fishing was permitted in 200 units. ", "Other federal agencies have various policies on the activities covered in these two bills. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), for example, allows recreational shooting but actively discourages \"repeated recreational target shooting.\" At the same time, BOR allows hunting, fishing, and trapping on its lands, subject to regulation. Roughly half of the Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps') land is open to hunting. In addition, many military bases offer access to hunters and fishers, including Camp Pendleton, California (hunting and fishing); Camp LeJeune, California (hunting, fishing, and trapping); and Camp Bullis, Texas (hunting, fishing, and target shooting). Various rules may limit participation at these bases to members of the military, veterans, and their families.", "Lands under the jurisdiction of other federal agencies may be managed for purposes that include the conservation of natural resources, including wildlife, even if conservation is not the primary purpose of these lands. Moreover, multiple executive orders direct all agencies with land to preserve the environment, and these orders apply whether the agency currently offers hunting, fishing, trapping, or even public access. (See \" Definition of Federal Public Land ,\" below.) Examples of agencies that limit access to their lands include the Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.", "This report focuses on two bills that have received considerable attention in the 114 th Congress: S. 556 and S. 659 . Both are titled \"the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015.\" S. 556 was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and S. 659 was referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. In addition to its provisions affecting federal lands, S. 556 contains a provision amending the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7504) and affecting the Judgment Fund in the Department of Justice from which claims against the United States are paid (31 U.S.C. \u00a71304). The two bills contain a number of provisions found in bills in previous Congresses.", "Both bills use definitions of federal land or similar terms in various sections in a manner that leaves some doubt as to the land under consideration.

(See Table 1 .)", "While there is no existing statutory definition of FPL, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA; P.L. 94-579 ) defines public lands as BLM lands. The Section 101 definition is broader than the FLPMA definition, and some may interpret it to include all federal lands except those explicitly excluded. As a result, even though most of the bill appears to target only BLM and FS, some provisions could be interpreted to include federal lands under other agencies, such as BOR, the Department of Defense (including the Army Corps of Engineers), the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce, all of which count natural resource conservation among their purposes. A similar, inclusive definition of federal lands was used in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ), which referred to a number of departments as being necessary to establish rights-of-way on federal lands: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, and the Interior. Also, as multiple executive orders direct all agencies with land to preserve the environment, some could argue that any such agency has as one of its purposes the conservation of natural resources and could meet the standard specified in Section 101.", "Naming specific land management agencies in the Section 101 definition would explicitly limit the federal lands to which this legislation applies. This approach is used in other legislation; the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA; P.L. 108-447 ), for example, defines f ederal land management agency as \"the National Park Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, or the Forest Service.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of Hunting", "paragraphs": ["Section 101(a) defines hunting to mean the \"use of a firearm, bow, or other authorized means in the lawful (i) pursuit, shooting, capture, collection, trapping, or killing of wildlife; or (ii) attempt to pursue, shoot, capture, collect, trap, or kill wildlife.\" ", "The definition includes trapping, an activity that traditionally is not included in the definition of hunting. Trapping currently is allowed under some circumstances on some federal lands, but the use of traps (particularly a design called leghold traps) has been controversial and is less common than traditional hunting on federal lands.", "Although the definition in Section 101 concerns hunting, the provision addressing licensing in Section 101(b)(9)(B)(i) refers to \"fish, hunt, and trap.\" The reference to trapping may be unnecessary, because the bill defines hunting to include trapping. In addition, Section 101(b)(6) refers to \"activities relating to fishing or hunting,\" potentially expanding the allowed activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of Recreational Fishing", "paragraphs": ["Section 101(a)(4) defines recreational fishing as \"an activity for sport or pleasure that involves the lawful ... catching, taking, or harvesting of fish; or ... attempted catching, taking, or harvesting of fish; or ... any other activity for sport or pleasure that can reasonably be expected to result in the lawful catching, taking, or harvesting of fish.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of Recreational Shooting", "paragraphs": ["Section 101(a) defines recreational shooting as \"any form of sport, training, competition, or pastime, whether formal or informal, that involves ... the discharge of a rifle, handgun, or shotgun, or ... the use of a bow and arrow.\" The definition appears to include hunting; shooting ranges; informal target practice; and war reenactments, both formal and informal. However, unlike the definition of hunting and recreational fishing, the word lawful is not included in this definition. Under Section 101(b)(1), managers are to \"facilitate use of and access\" to FPLs for this activity. Recreational shooting, including shooting ranges, on some lands besides those of FS and BLM that might be included in this bill likely would be controversial. Recreational shooting, generally allowed on most FS and BLM lands, has been controversial in some specific areas, due to conflicts with adjacent property owners, the presence of debris such as spent shells or damaged targets, or resource damage. Because controversy over the continued existence of shooting ranges has focused on FS or BLM lands, where shooting ranges usually have been allowed by regulation, it may be that only those lands were intended to be affected by the promotion of shooting ranges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Management of Federal Lands", "paragraphs": ["Section 101(b) would direct the heads of FPL management agencies to facilitate use of and access to lands for hunting (defined to include trapping), fishing, and recreational shooting.

This provision may raise questions because state law does not authorize actions on federal land. Instead, federal lands generally are managed for these activities consistent with state law, which establishes hunting seasons, game species, fishing licenses, etc. ", "Although agencies would be required to manage public lands to facilitate those activities, Section 101(b)(7) states that the title does not require \"a Federal agency to give preference to recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting over other uses of Federal public land.\" This provision is an example of the apparent tension in the bill between directing federal agencies generally to allow more hunting, fishing, and shooting and to facilitate such activities procedurally, on the one hand, and seeking to maintain some existing management structures and policies, on the other.", "The sections preceding Section 101(b)(4) provide directives to all FPL agencies. However, Section 101(b)(4)(C) applies to BLM and FS lands only, and it specifies that the heads of the two agencies may use existing authorities to lease or permit use of lands for shooting ranges and to designate specific lands for recreational shooting activities. Although Section 101(b)(4) applies explicitly to BLM and FS, Section 101(b)(4)(C) also directs the \"head of each Federal public land agency,\" the general term used in the rest of Section 101, to address recreational shooting. As a result, clarification may be needed for whether that particular provision is limited to BLM and FS.", "A separate management directive appears in Section 101(b)(8) that would require agency heads to consult with advisory councils established in two executive orders. The first, Executive Order 12962, established a recreational fisheries council. The second, Executive Order 13443, did not create an advisory council but referred to the Sporting Conservation Council that DOI had established a year earlier.", "Section 101(b)(3)(B) would direct that, on BLM and FS lands where hunting is prohibited by law, federal land planning documents must allow skilled volunteers to assist in culling and other management of wildlife populations. The existing practice uses employees of Wildlife Services of the Department of Agriculture instead of skilled volunteers.

As a result, S. 556 could affect existing plans that have not considered all the activities contained in the definitions of hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. The bill is silent as to how those existing plans should be treated. For example, the plans could remain in place until they are revised; they could be required to be revised immediately; or all lands could be open to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting upon the bill's enactment, regardless of restrictions in existing plans, until new plans are finalized using the new criteria.

Moreover, the provision explicitly includes units of the National Wilderness Preservation System, wilderness study areas, and areas administratively classified as eligible or suitable for wilderness designation as subject to this provision. Although Section 101(b)(4)(A)(ii) further specifies that nothing in the subparagraph authorizes motorized access, it does so only for \"wilderness study areas and areas administratively classified as eligible or suitable for wilderness designation\" and does not apply the same savings provision to designated wilderness. In testimony regarding S. 556 , Leslie Weldon, FS Deputy Chief stated ", "We are concerned that section 101(b)(4)(A)(ii) could be read to open [designated] wilderness areas administered by the Forest Service to temporary roads, motor vehicles, motorized equipment, motorboats, and other forms of mechanized transport in furtherance of recreational hunting, shooting, and fishing. Further, this provision only mentions motorized vehicles but is silent on other prohibited uses under section 4(c) of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1133(c)), such as mechanical transport, structures, and installations. As a result, this provision creates uncertainty as to whether such uses, when in furtherance of recreational hunting, shooting, and fishing, would remain prohibited under the Wilderness Act.", "Although Section 101(b)(1) applies to FPLs generally, it may be that the more specific criteria in Section 101(b)(4) would supersede application of Section 101(b)(1) to BLM or FS.
