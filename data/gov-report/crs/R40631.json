Many Southwest counties are premium locations for siting solar electricity facilities, but have constrained water supplies. One policy question for local, state, and federal decision-makers is whether and how to promote renewable electricity development in the face of competing water demands. A principal renewable energy technology being considered for the Southwest is concentrating solar power (CSP), which uses ground-based arrays of mirrors to concentrate thermal solar energy and convert it into electricity. The steam turbines at CSP facilities are generally cooled using water, in a process known as wet cooling. The potential cumulative impact of CSP in a region with freshwater constraints has raised questions about whether, and how, to invest in large-scale deployment of CSP. Much uncertainty about the water use impacts of CSP remains because its water demand is highly dependent on the location and type of CSP facilities constructed (e.g., whether thermal storage is included and whether wet cooling is used), and because the data for these evolving technologies are preliminary.", "Water Consumption and Electricity Generation Tradeoffs. In arid and semi-arid regions like the Southwest or in other areas with intense water demand, water supply is an issue for locating any thermoelectric power plant, not only CSP. The trend is toward more freshwater-efficient cooling technologies for CSP and other thermoelectric generation. Why is there concern specifically about the CSP water footprint? CSP facilities using wet cooling can consume more water per unit of electricity generated than traditional fossil fuel facilities with wet cooling. Options exist for reducing the freshwater consumed by CSP and other thermoelectric facilities. Available freshwater-efficient cooling options, however, often reduce the quantity of electricity produced and increase electricity production costs, and generally do not eliminate water resource impacts.", "The quantity of electricity produced at these facilities, the water intensity per unit of electricity generated, and the local and regional constraints on freshwater will shape the cumulative effect of CSP deployment on southwestern water resources and the long-term sustainability of CSP as a renewable energy technology.

The heat is used to generate steam via a heat exchanger to spin a steam turbine. Alternatively, steam can be generated directly by the mirror arrays. Photovoltaic (PV) solar is a separate class of solar technology that uses panels of solar cells to convert sunlight directly into electricity. Operation of CSP and PV facilities to generate electricity does not directly release greenhouse gases. There remains significant uncertainty about the future rate and level of CSP deployment.", "In some CSP installations, sunlight is concentrated from the mirror arrays onto a single, central location atop a tall solar tower where the heat typically melts salt or boils water. In other CSP installations, solar parabolic-mirror troughs, also known as solar troughs , focus sunlight on miles of piping running through a field of mirrors, heating the heat transfer fluid (usually oil). Pressurized steam, produced by the heat transfer medium, then drives a turbine-generator producing electricity. Other less common CSP technologies exist; this report focuses on solar trough and solar tower CSP technologies.", "CSP currently is better suited than PV installations for larger facilities, and the steam-cycle used in CSP is more familiar to utility engineers. Electricity from a large CSP plant is estimated to cost $0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) over a facility's operating life; electricity from a large PV facility is estimated at $0.26/kWh given current technologies. In terms of cost, both PV and CSP facilities at the scale now being developed (generally between 50 megawatts (MW) and 1,200 MW) are at an early stage in their commercial adoption and use; these early facilities are anticipated to produce electricity at more than twice the cost of conventional coal plants.

There are two major water processes in a steam turbine system\u2014the steam cycle and the cooling process. Most of the water is consumed during cooling, and the choice of cooling technology largely determines how much water is actually consumed at a facility. Fossil and nuclear power plants use the same wet-cooling technologies as those for CSP. ", "Water is used to produce steam to turn the steam turbines; this water is recycled for the generation of steam in the \"closed-loop\" steam cycle. Theoretically, water is not lost in the steam production cycle (though real-world imperfections necessitate some \"make-up\" water to compensate for leaks in the system). Steam is cooled in a condenser and condensed back to a liquid water state to be reused. ", "The condenser itself is then cooled. For wet cooling of the condenser, the most common technology is to use a separate circuit of water to remove the heat from the condenser; this water then flows to an evaporative cooling tower that dissipates the collected heat energy to the environment. Most of this cooling water is lost as clouds of water vapor to the atmosphere as the condenser water contacts the air and the cooling tower. Alternatively, wet cooling can also occur by sending the condensed steam directly to the cooling tower. The 11 large-scale CSP facilities operating in the United States all use wet cooling.", "In areas where water supplies are constrained, dry cooling technologies may be used, which blow air over extensive networks of steam pipes designed with convective cooling fins to dissipate the heat energy over their surface area. No water is used or consumed in dry cooling. Air, however, has a much lower capacity to carry heat than water; therefore, dry cooling generally is less efficient than wet cooling in removing heat. Often, massive cooling fans are used to remove the heat from the pipe array in dry cooling. These fans consume a portion of the electricity generated by the power plant. Although dry cooling reduces water use, its consumption of energy for cooling fans and reduction of thermal efficiency of the steam turbines, especially on the hottest days of the year, when summer-peaking utilities most need power, is a significant factor impeding its adoption. It may be possible to offset the effect of dry cooling on net electricity generation by using bigger solar collecting fields or perhaps PV systems to run cooling fans. Where efficiency is a concern and water is constrained, a hybrid combination of wet and dry cooling technologies may be used. (See \" Reducing the CSP Water Footprint ,\" below, for more information on hybrid cooling.) CRS was not able to identify any operating large-scale CSP facility in the United States or the world that uses dry cooling, but the technology is being considered as new CSP proposals are being developed in water-constrained areas, such as Southern California counties.

Another alternative to increase output would be to add a combustion turbine to the existing solar cycle. If higher-temperature steam can be produced, then combustion turbines operating at lower pressures can be used to augment the solar steam turbines, resulting in more efficient energy output. Ongoing research at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) has shown that an integrated solar combined cycle plant would have efficiencies higher than those of a solar-only plant, and potentially higher than those in a fossil-fuel combined-cycle plant.

This is the ratio of the amount of power generated at a facility to the maximum amount of power the facility could have generated if it operated at continuously at maximum output. Capacity is the maximum potential instantaneous power output rate at a facility. A capacity factor allows for electricity estimates to be made using information on a plant's capacity.

The virtual export of water raises policy questions about concentrating electricity generation and its impacts in a few counties and states while its benefits are distributed more broadly.

For parabolic troughs in the Southwest, the benefit in the reduction in water consumption from dry cooling resulted in cost increases of 2% to 9% and a reduction in energy generation of 4.5% to 5%. The cost and energy generation penalties for dry cooling depend largely on how much time a facility has ambient temperature above 100\u00b0F.", "In order to weigh the tradeoffs in energy generation, cost, and water use, DOE researched hybrid cooling processes that combine dry and wet cooling. The hybrid system consists of parallel wet and dry cooling facilities, with the wet cooling operating only on hot days. By using wet cooling in parallel with dry cooling on hot days, losses of thermal efficiency from dry cooling can be reduced. How often the wet cooling is used determines how much water is consumed and the effect of hot days on thermal efficiency.
