Several statutes authorize the use of administrative subpoenas primarily or exclusively for use in a criminal investigation in cases involving health care fraud, child abuse, Secret Service protection, controlled substance cases, inspector general investigations, and tracking unregistered sex offenders.", "Proponents cite administrative subpoenas as a quick, efficient, and relatively unintrusive law enforcement tool. Opponents express concern that they may result in unchecked invasions of privacy and evasions of the Fourth Amendment warrant and probable cause requirements.", "The courts have determined that, as long as they are not executed in a manner reminiscent of a warrant, administrative subpoenas issued in aid of a criminal investigation must be judicially enforced if they satisfy statutory requirements and are not unreasonable by Fourth Amendment standards.", "The Child Protection Act of 2012, P.L. 112-206 (H.R. 6063) authorized the United States Marshals Service to issue administrative subpoenas in aid of tracking unregistered sex offenders.", "This report is available abridged\u2014without footnotes, appendixes, and most of the citations to authority\u2014as CRS Report RS22407, Administrative Subpoenas in Criminal Investigations: A Sketch, by [author name scrubbed]."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Administrative subpoena authority is the power vested in various administrative agencies to compel testimony or the production of documents or both in aid of the agencies' performance of their duties.

Yet the 109 th Congress and those thereafter saw only modest proposals. In the 110 th , Congress did create an inspector general's office for the Architect of the Capitol with administrative subpoena power comparable to that enjoyed by other inspectors general. It also expanded the administrative subpoena power available in certain child sex offense investigations to include investigations of sex trafficking. Since then, proposals relating to the use of administrative subpoenas in criminal investigations have been confined to unregistered sex offenders, of the type ultimately enacted as part of the Child Protection Act of 2012.", "Proponents of the expanded use of administrative subpoenas emphasize their effectiveness as an investigative tool and question the logic of their availability in drug and health care fraud cases but not in terrorism or other cases. Critics suggest that administrative subpoena authority is little more than a constitutionally suspect \"trophy\" power, easily abused and of little legitimate use.", "More precisely, it might be said in favor of the use of administrative subpoenas in criminal investigations that they:", "provide a time-honored, court-approved means for agencies to acquire information in order to make well informed decisions; should be available for terrorism investigations; do not ordinarily require probable cause and consequently can be used from the beginning of an inquiry to gather information; can be used to gather information held by third parties other than the target of an inquiry; often can encourage the cooperation of third parties by providing immunity for cooperation similar to that available in a judicial context; often can make third parties subject to nondisclosure requirements thereby reducing the possibility that the target of an investigation will flee, destroy evidence, intimidate witnesses, or pose a risk to national security; can be made judicially enforceable both to ensure compliance and to safeguard against abuse; are less intrusive than search warrants; material is gathered and delivered by the individual rather than seized by the government; there is ordinarily an interval between the time of service of the subpoena and the time for compliance, allowing parties to consult an attorney; can be more easily and quickly used than grand jury subpoenas, but are otherwise similar; and are now available for investigations relating to some crimes and there is no obvious reason why they should not be available for other equally serious criminal investigations.", "On the other hand, it might be said that in the context of a criminal or foreign intelligence investigation that administrative subpoenas:", "are more likely to lead to unjustified intrusions of privacy; in terrorism cases, seem to replicate and expand existing national security letter authority, without an explanation as to why additional authority is needed; lack the judicial safeguards that accompany the issuance of a search warrant, probable cause and issuance by a neutral magistrate, among other things; generally lack the safeguards that accompany the issuance of a grand jury subpoena in that they ordinarily are not subject to a motion to quash or to the necessary participation of an Assistant United States Attorney; are distinguishable from grand jury subpoenas by the simple fact that the extensive powers available to the grand jury are justified in part by the fact that the grand jury is not the government but a buffer against the abuse of governmental authority; can be extremely expensive and disruptive for the person or entity to whom they are addressed long before the thresholds of overbreadth or oppression (the point at which a subpoena will not be enforced) are reached; are subject to easy abuse when they are issued against third parties who may have little interest in contesting their legitimacy; are subject to easy abuse when they are issued against third parties who are granted immunity from civil liability for the disclosures; are subject to easy abuse when they are issued against third parties who are subject to long term or permanent gag orders precluding disclosure to targets who might otherwise contest the abuse; and are sought for their speed, an environment in which mistakes often breed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Subpoenas Generally", "paragraphs": ["At common law, a subpoena was a writ ordering an individual to appear before a court or tribunal, sub poena (under penalty) for failure to comply.

Testimonial subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum remain a prominent feature of judicial proceedings to this day.", "Administrative agencies have long held the power to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in aid of the agencies' adjudicative and investigative functions. When Congress established the Interstate Commerce Commission, for example, it endowed the Commission with subpoena power:", "\"[F]or the purposes of this act the [Interstate Commerce] Commission shall have power to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all books, papers, tariffs, contracts, agreements, and documents relating to any matter under investigation, and to that end may invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents under the provisions of this section,\" Interstate Commerce Act, \u00a712, 24 Stat. 383 (1887).", "There are now over 300 instances where federal agencies have been granted administrative subpoena power in one form or another. The statute granting the power ordinarily describes the circumstances under which it may be exercised: the scope of the authority, enforcement procedures, and sometimes limitations on dissemination of the information subpoenaed. In some instances, the statute may grant the power to issue subpoena duces tecum, but explicitly or implicitly deny the agency authority to compel testimony. The statute may authorize use of the subpoena power in conjunction with an agency's investigations or its administrative hearings or both. Authority is usually conferred upon a tribunal or upon the head of the agency. Although some statutes preclude or limit delegation, agency heads are usually free to delegate such authority and to authorize its redelegation thereafter within the agency.", "Some statutes contain a specific mechanism to protect the confidentiality of subpoenaed information, others may rely upon the general proscriptions such as those that protect trade secrets, or those found in the Privacy and Freedom of Information Acts.", "Failure to comply with an administrative subpoena may pave the way for denial of a license or permit or some similar adverse administrative decision in the matter to which the issuance of the subpoena was originally related. In most instances, however, administrative agencies ultimately rely upon the courts to enforce their subpoenas. Generally, the statute that grants the subpoena power will spell out the procedure for its enforcement.", "Objections to the enforcement of administrative subpoenas \"must be derived from one of three sources: a constitutional provision; an understanding on the part of Congress ... or the general standards governing judicial enforcement of administrative subpoenas,\" SEC v. Jerry T. O'Brien, Inc. Constitutional challenges arise most often under the Fourth Amendment's condemnation of unreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination, or the claim that in a criminal context the administrative subpoena process is an intrusion into the power of the grand jury and the concomitant right to grand jury indictment.", "In an early examination of the questions, the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment did not preclude enforcement of an administrative subpoena issued by the Wage and Hour Administration notwithstanding the want of probable cause, Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling . In the eyes of the Court:", "The short answer to the Fourth Amendment objections is that the records in these cases present no question of actual search and seizure, but raise only the question whether orders of the court for the production of specified records have been validly made; and no sufficient showing appears to justify setting them aside. No officer or other person has sought to enter petitioners' premises against their will, to search them, or to seize or examine their books, records or papers without their assent, otherwise than pursuant to orders of court authorized by law and made after adequate opportunity to present objections, which in fact were made. Nor has any objection been taken to the breadth of the subpoenas or to any other specific defect which would invalidate them.", "Neither the Fourth Amendment nor the unclaimed Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination were thought to pose any substantial obstacle to subpoena enforcement:", "Without attempting to summarize or accurately distinguish all of the cases, the fair distillation, in so far as they apply merely to the production of corporate records and papers in response to a subpoena or order authorized by law and safeguarded by judicial sanction, seems to be that the Fifth Amendment affords no protection by virtue of the self-incrimination provision, whether for the corporation, or for its officers; and the Fourth, if applicable, at the most guards against abuse only by way of too much indefiniteness or breadth in the things required to be particularly described, if also the inquiry is one the demanding agency is authorized by law to make and the materials specified are relevant. The gist of the protection is in the requirement, expressed in terms, that the disclosure sought shall not be unreasonable. ", "Congress had not expressly confined the Wage and Hour Administration's subpoena power to instances where probable cause for inquiry existed. Moreover, far from taking offense at any perceived intrusion upon the prerogatives of the grand jury, proximity was thought to commend rather than condemn the procedure. The Court considered the Administration akin to the grand jury whose searches end\u2014rather than begin\u2014with the discovery of probable cause. ", "A few years later, dicta in United States v. Morton Salt C o. echoed the same message\u2014the Fourth Amendment does not demand a great deal of administrative subpoenas addressed to corporate entities, \"a governmental investigation into corporate matters may be of such a sweeping nature and so unrelated to the matter properly under inquiry as to exceed the investigatory power. But it is sufficient if the inquiry is within the authority of the agency, the demand is not too indefinite, and the information sought is reasonably relevant. 'The gist of the protection is in the requirement, expressed in terms, that the disclosure sought shall not be unreasonable.'\"", "Of course, Fourth Amendment reasonableness is most often an issue when there is a justifiable expectation of privacy, and Fifth Amendment self-incrimination only where an individual is compelled to speak. As the Court made clear, an individual can claim neither Fourth nor Fifth Amendment privileges to bar a subpoena for documents held by a bank or other third party nor to a right to notice of the subpoena's demand.", "A statute or conditions precedent to judicial enforcement, however, may require what the Constitution does not. Nevertheless when asked if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must have probable cause before issuing a summons for the production of documents, the Court intoned the standard often repeated in response to an administrative subpoena challenge:", "Reading the statutes as we do, the Commissioner need not meet any standard of probable cause to obtain enforcement of his summons.... He must show [1] that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose, [2] that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose, [3] that the information sought is not already within the Commissioner's possession, and [4] that the administrative steps required by the Code have been followed.... This does not ... mean[] that under no circumstances may the court inquire into the underlying reason for the examination. It is the court's process which is invoked to enforce the administrative summons and a court may not permit its process to be abused. United States v.

Proponents of the use of administrative subpoenas in criminal cases point out that the courts have often analogized the administrative inquiry and subpoena power to the inquiries and powers of the grand jury. Opponents contend the grand jury's powers depend upon its unique and independent constitutional status, a foundation the administrative subpoena lacks.", "The federal grand jury is certainly unique. It is a constitutionally acknowledged institution empowered to indict and to refuse to indict: \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous [federal] crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury,\" U.S.Const. Amend.V. \"[T]he whole theory of its function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional government,\" but serves \"as a kind of buffer or referee between the government and the people.\"", "Nevertheless, the federal grand jury is attended by Justice Department attorneys who, through the use of subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, arrange for the presentation of evidence before it. Unlike the search warrant, there is no threshold of probable cause or similar level of suspicion that must be crossed before the grand jury subpoena can be issued. \"[T]he grand jury can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even because it wants assurance that it is not. It need not identify the offender it suspects, or even the precise nature of the offense it is investigating.\"", "Its proceedings are conducted in secret and even attorneys for the witnesses who testify before it must await their clients outside the closed doors of the grand jury chamber. The subpoena power upon which the grand jury relies, however, is the process of the court and may be enforced only through the good offices of the court. \"And the court will refuse to lend its assistance when the compulsion the grand jury seeks would override rights accorded by the constitution or even testimonial privileges recognized at common law.\"", "A subpoena is generally considered less intrusive than a warrant. The warrant authorizes an officer to enter, search for and seize, forcibly if necessary at a reasonable time of the officer's choosing, that property to which the officer understands the warrant refers; the subpoena duces tecum instructs the individual to gather up the items described at his relative convenience and bring them before the tribunal at some designated time in the future. The validity of a warrant may only be contested after the fact; a motion to quash a subpoena can ordinarily be filed and heard before compliance is required.", "There are at least two relatively uncommon exceptions to this general scheme of disparity. First, a subpoena may order \"forthwith\" compliance, demanding immediate appearance and delivery. Second, while subpoenas ordinarily involve no bodily intrusions, grand jury subpoenas duces tecum have been issued for blood and saliva samples. Even here, however, the individual served may choose not to comply and challenge the validity of the subpoena should the government seek judicial enforcement\u2014an option the individual whose property is subject to a search warrant clearly does not have.", "The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure declare that grand jury subpoenas duces tecum may be neither unreasonable or oppressive, a standard originally borrowed from the civil rules which are now much more expressive. The criminal rule, which at a minimum is grounded in Fourth Amendment principles, is said to bar only the imprecise, overly burdensome, irrelevancy-seeking, or privilege-intrusive grand jury subpoena duces tecum. The Supreme Court demonstrated the deference owed the grand jury's power of inquiry in United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc . It observed that a party seeking to quash a grand jury subpoena duces tecum bears the burden of establishing that a particular subpoena is unreasonable because it is unduly burdensome or because of its want of specificity or relevancy and that a motion to quash on relevancy grounds \"must be denied unless there is no reasonable possibility that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce information relevant to the general subject of the grand jury's investigation.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criminal Administrative Subpoenas", "paragraphs": ["Several statutes at least arguably authorize the use of administrative subpoenas primarily or exclusively for purposes of a criminal investigation.

It provides for judicial enforcement; failure to comply with the court's order to obey the subpoena is punishable as contempt of court. The section contains no explicit prohibition on disclosure.", "Even in the case of subpoenas issued during a criminal investigation, the courts have applied the traditional standards, worded one way or another, to convey the principle that a court must enforce an administrative subpoena that satisfies minimum statutory and constitutional prerequisites: \"The critical questions are: (1) whether Congress has granted the authority to investigate; (2) whether procedural requirements have been followed; ... (3) whether the evidence is relevant and material to the investigation[; and (4) whether] Fourth Amendment 'reasonableness' [requirements have been] satisfied.\" ", "The subject of a criminal investigation lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy upon which to base a Fourth Amendment objection to an administrative subpoena directed to a third party.

There are literally thousands of institutions in the country which are somehow involved in the receipt of funds from Federal programs. Without the power necessary to conduct a comprehensive audit of these entities, the Inspector and Auditor General could have no serious impact on the way federal funds are expended. . . .", "The committee does not believe that the Inspector and Auditor General will have to resort very often to the use of subpoenas. There are substantial incentives for institutions that are involved with the Federal Government to comply with requests by an Inspector and Auditor General. In any case, however, knowing that the Inspector and Auditor General has recourse to subpoena power should encourage prompt and thorough cooperation with his audits and investigations.", "The committee intends, of course, that the Inspector and Auditor General will use this subpoena power in the performance of its statutory functions. The use of subpoena power to obtain information for another agency component which does not have such power would clearly be improper.", "[The committee recognizes that there is a substantial ongoing dispute about the propriety of so-called third party subpoenas: i.e., subpoenaing records of an individual which are in the hands of an institution, such as a bank. Since U.S. v. Miller , 425 U.S. 435 (1976), individuals have been regarded as having no protectable right of property with respect to their bank records. A law enforcement agency can obtain such records from a bank without any showing of cause to a neutral magistrate or any notice to the individual involved. The committee notes that progress has been made on legislation concerning financial privacy which would require notice to be given to an individual whose bank records are being obtained by a law enforcement agency. Hopefully, this progress will lead to legislation of general applicability to all law enforcement authorities, including Inspector and Auditor Generals].

", "Subpoena authority under the Inspector General Act is delegable, and subpoenas issued under the act are judicially enforceable.

Section 3486 is an amalgam of four relatively recent statutory provisions\u2014one, the original, dealing with health care fraud; one with child abuse offenses; one with threats against the President and others who fall under Secret Service protection; and one with sex offender registration. The first of these, the health care fraud provision, comes from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, where it caused little comment during consideration of the act. ", "The child abuse subpoenas, on the other hand, generated some illuminating commentary. Enacted as part of the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act, and originally codified as 18 U.S.C. 3486A, the subpoena provision represented a compromise. The House version authorized a general subpoena power for use in the investigation of five federal child abuse offenses. The version that ultimately passed, however, encompassed a wider range of federal child abuse statutes but only permitted subpoenas for the records of Internet and telephone communications providers. Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, explained this portion of the compromise during debate on the bill:", "The House bill would have given the Attorney General sweeping administrative authority to subpoena records and witnesses [for] investigations involving crimes against children. This proposed authority to issue administrative subpoenas would have given federal agents the power to compel disclosures without any oversight by a judge, prosecutor, or grand jury, and without any of the grand jury secrecy requirements. We appreciate that such [secrecy] requirements may pose obstacles to full and efficient cooperation of federal/state task forces in their joint efforts to reduce the steadily increasing use of the Internet to perpetrate crimes against children, including crimes involving the distribution of child pornography. In addition, we understand that some U.S. Attorneys' Offices are reluctant to open grand jury investigations when the only goal is to identify individuals who have not yet, and may never, commit a federal (as opposed to state or local) offense.", "The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute accommodates these competing interests by granting the Department a narrowly drawn authority to subpoena the information that it most needs: Routine subscriber account information from Internet Service Providers (ISP) which may provide appropriate notice to subscribers.

In the following Congress when the Secret Service sought subpoena authority in presidential protection cases, its request and the authority in health care fraud and child abuse cases were merged into the language of general authority now found in Section 3486, and Section 3486A disappeared. In the process, the demise of the compromise was scarcely mentioned, but its legacy may live on in the form of the greater detail found in the revamped Section 3486.", "Congress added the final piece to Section 3486 in the Child Protection Act of 2012. It vests Section 3486's administrative subpoena power in the United States Marshals Service for use in tracking unregistered sex offenders.", "Section 3486 is both more explicit and more explicitly protective than either of its controlled substance or IG statutory counterparts. In addition to a judicial enforcement provision, it specifically authorizes motions to quash and ex parte nondisclosure court orders. It affords those served a reasonable period of time to assemble subpoenaed material and respond, and in the case of health care investigations the subpoena may call for delivery no more than 500 miles away. In child abuse and presidential investigation cases, however, it imposes no such geographical limitation and it may contemplate the use of forthwith subpoenas. It includes a \"safe harbor\" subsection that shields those who comply in good faith from civil liability; and in health care investigations limits further dissemination of the information secured. ", "The authority of Section 3486 has been used fairly extensively. Yet, the reported case law has been relatively sparse and follows the pattern of the controlled substance and inspector general subpoena cases. One of the first simply held that the subject of a record subpoenaed from a third party custodian has no standing to move that the administrative subpoena be quashed. Others cite Oklahoma Press , Powell and Morton Salt for the proposition that administrative subpoenas under Section 3486 need not satisfy a probable cause standard.

All three, however, provide for judicial enforcement reinforced by the contempt power of the court.", "Only the controlled substance authority of 21 U.S.C. 876 clearly extends beyond the power to subpoena records and other documents to encompass testimonial subpoena authority as well.
