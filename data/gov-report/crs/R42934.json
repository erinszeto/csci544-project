The revised air quality standards were completed pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA) and, in part, in response to a court order and consent agreement. Based on its review of scientific studies available since the agency's previous review in 2006, EPA determined that evidence continued to show associations between particulates in ambient air and numerous significant health problems, including aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis, nonfatal heart attacks, and premature death. Populations shown to be most at risk include children, older adults, and those with heart and lung disease, and those of lower socioeconomic status. EPA's review of and revisions to the PM NAAQS have generated considerable debate and oversight in Congress.", "The January 2013 revisions change the existing (2006) annual health-based (\"primary\") standard for \"fine\" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (or PM2.5), lowering the allowable average concentration of PM2.5 in the air from the current level of 15 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) to a limit of 12 \u00b5g/m3. The annual PM2.5 NAAQS is set so as to address human health effects from chronic exposures to the pollutants. The existing \"24-hour primary standard\" for PM2.5 that was reduced from 65 \u00b5g/m3 to 35 \u00b5g/m3 in 2006 was retained, as was the existing standard for larger, but still inhalable, \"coarse\" particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter, or PM10. As it did in 2006, EPA set \"secondary\" standards that provide protection against \"welfare\" (nonhealth) effects, such as ecological effects and material deterioration, identical to the primary standards.", "EPA revised the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) accompanying its June 2012 proposed rule in part in response to comments received regarding the agency's cost and benefit estimates. In its December 2012 RIA, EPA estimated that the potential \"quantifiable\" health benefits (2010 $) associated with attaining the PM standard would range from $4.0 billion to $9.1 billion, and costs (2010 $) would range from $53.0 million to $353.0 million. Some stakeholders and some Members continue to express concerns that cost impacts would be more significant than those estimated by EPA for those areas out of compliance with the new standards.", "EPA's revisions to the PM NAAQS do not directly regulate emissions from specific sources, or compel installation of any pollution control equipment or measures, but indirectly could affect operations at industrial facilities and other sources throughout the United States. Revising PM NAAQS starts a process that includes a determination of areas in each state that exceed the standard and must, therefore, reduce pollutant concentrations to achieve it. Following determinations of these \"nonattainment\" areas based on multiple years of monitoring data and other factors, state and local governments must develop (or revise) State Implementation Plans (SIPs) outlining measures to attain the standard. These include promulgation of new regulations by states, and the issuance of revised air permits. The process typically takes several years.", "On January 15, 2015, EPA published its classification of 14 areas as \"Moderate\" nonattainment for the revised 2013 primary annual PM2.5 standard. EPA subsequently published amended designations on April 7, 2015. EPA's April 2015 modifications to the final area designations for the 2013 PM NAAQS resulted in nine areas consisting of 20 counties in four states designated as nonattainment. All but two of the 20 counties have been previously designated as nonattainment for the 2006 and/or the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. For a Moderate area, CAA Section 188(c)(1) of Subpart 4 establishes an attainment deadline of as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the end of the sixth calendar year after designation as nonattainment."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["On January 15, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule in the Federal Register to strengthen the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM) . The standards, set pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA), address potential health e ffects (including chronic respiratory disease and premature mortality) associated with short- and long-term exposure to particulate matter. The CAA, enacted in 1970 and amended in 1990, requires EPA to set minimum NAAQS standards for pollutants anticipated to endanger public health and welfare, and where their presence in ambient air results from numerous and diverse mobile or stationary sources. EPA has identified six \"criteria air pollutants\" under this authority: ozone (\"smog\"), particulate material (\"soot\"), sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and lead. The law also requires EPA to evaluate each NAAQS every five years to determine whether it is adequately protective of human health and the environment, based on the most recent science.", "The EPA Administrator signed the final rule revising the PM NAAQS on December 14, 2012. EPA's most recent review and process generated controversy and national debate among a variety of stakeholders including industry groups, health and environmental advocacy groups, and states, as well as oversight in Congress. EPA reportedly received and considered more than 230,000 written comments in determining the final PM standard. Similar controversy and debate transpired during the previous changes leading up to the PM NAAQS promulgated October 2006, and those established in 1997.", "As published, January 2013 final PM NAAQS rule was the culmination of EPA's statutorily required review of the NAAQS under the CAA based on studies available through mid-2009 and recommendations of EPA staff and a scientific advisory panel (Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, or CASAC) established by the CAA. The agency initiated the statutorily required periodic review not long after the 2006 promulgation of the PM NAAQS. EPA staff reassessed scientific studies considered in setting the 2006 PM NAAQS revisions, reviewed and analyzed extensive subsequent research, and considered public comments and recommendations of the CASAC. EPA has already initiated the next five-year review of the PM NAAQS.", "Based on the scientific evidence and comments considered, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson signed the final rule that would change the current standard primarily by lowering the annual health-based (\"primary\") standard for fine particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM 2.5 ). In the final rule, the \"secondary\" standards that provide protection against \"welfare\" (nonhealth) effects, such as ecological effects and material deterioration, are identical to the primary standards, the same as in 2006. The final rule relies on the existing secondary 24-hour standard to protect against visibility impairment, and did not adopt a separate standard included among options in the June 2012 proposal. Also, as proposed, the final rule did not modify the standards for inhalable \"coarse\" particles larger than 2.5 but smaller than 10 microns (PM 10 ). Some stakeholders in the agricultural community and some Members maintained a particular interest in EPA's consideration of the PM 10 standards and potential impacts that revising the NAAQS may impose on the agricultural operations.", "In its Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) accompanying the final rule assessing the costs and benefits of proposed revisions to the PM NAAQS, EPA estimated that tightening the PM 2.5 annual standard would add further health benefits beyond those anticipated with the promulgation of the 2006 PM NAAQS. Others have suggested that potential health benefits of tightening the PM NAAQS might be higher than EPA's estimates. On the other hand, tighter standards could impose additional compliance requirements on communities, states, industry, and others, at what some stakeholders and Members contend will be a substantial economic cost. EPA expects that requirements and emission reductions associated with existing and recently promulgated federal regulations under the CAA will allay impacts of complying with the revised PM standards, and anticipates that virtually all counties will meet the standards as promulgated in 2020.", "On January 15, 2015, EPA published its classification of 14 areas as \"Moderate\" nonattainment for the revised 2013 primary annual PM 2.5 standard. The areas include 38 counties or portions of counties in six states\u2014California, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. EPA also deferred the designation period for 11 other areas (including 2 entire states and all but 3 counties of another) by up to one year, and designated all other areas as \"unclassifiable\" or as \"unclassifiable/attainment.\" ", "On April 7, 2015, EPA published amendments to the final designations for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS that were published on January 15, 2015. The changes to area designations were the result of air quality data for 2014 recently submitted by affected states. The final area designations as amended and published in the April 7, 2015, Federal Register encompass 20 counties or portions of counties (nine areas) in four states as nonattainment only for the 2013 revised annual PM 2.5 standard. EPA also designated five areas in Georgia (including two adjacent counties in Alabama and South Carolina) as unclassifiable. ", "The effective date of April 15, 2015 (90 days from the date of publication) based on the January 15, 2015, final designation rule remained unchanged. CAA section 188(c)(1) of Subpart 4 requires Moderate areas achieve attainment as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than the end of the sixth year after the effective date of final designation as nonattainment. For a more detailed discussion of the designation of nonattainment areas for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS see CRS Report R43953, 2013 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5): Designating Nonattainment Areas .", "Several recent and pending EPA regulations implementing the various pollution control statutes enacted by Congress garnered vigorous oversight during the 112 th Congress. Members expressed concerns in hearings, through bipartisan letters commenting on proposed regulations, and through introduced legislation that would delay, limit, or prevent certain EPA actions. Particular attention was focused on EPA's implementation of the CAA. Because of health and cost implications, NAAQS decisions historically have been the source of significant concern to some in Congress.", "The evolution and development of the PM NAAQS, in particular, has been the subject of extensive oversight. During the 112 th Congress, some Members expressed concerns in hearings, letters to the Administrator, and proposed legislation in anticipation of potential changes to the PM NAAQS, and the January 2013 final rule is expected to generate further oversight. Some Members and industry stakeholders had urged EPA to delay the final rule, while conversely, others, including some states and various environmental and public health advocacy groups, urged timely completion of a tighter standard. Changes to the NAAQS historically have triggered litigation alleging the standards are too stringent or not stringent enough, and often resulted in delays in implementation.", "This CRS report summarizes EPA's January 15, 2013, final and June 2012 proposed changes to the PM NAAQS and includes comparisons with previous (1997 and 2006) promulgated and proposed standards.

PM 10 (or coarse PM) is an indicator used in the NAAQS to provide protection from slightly larger (in the range of 2.5 to 10 microns or thoracic \"coarse\" particles), but still inhalable particles that penetrate into the trachea, bronchi, and deep lungs. These particles are often associated with dust from paved and unpaved roads, construction and demolition operations (including mining), and sometimes with certain industrial processes and agriculture operations, as well as biomass burning.", "Establishing NAAQS does not directly limit emissions; rather, it represents the EPA Administrator's formal judgment regarding the concentration of a pollutant in ambient air that will protect public health with an \" adequate margin of safety .\" Under Sections 108-109 of the CAA, Congress mandated that EPA set national ambient (outdoor) air quality standards for pollutants whose emissions \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health (primary standards) or welfare (secondary standards)\" and \"the presence of which in the ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.\" The process for setting and revising NAAQS consists of the statutory steps incorporated in the CAA over a series of amendments. Several other steps have also been added by EPA, by executive orders, and by subsequent regulatory reform enactments by Congress.", "Section 109(d)(1)) of the CAA requires EPA to review the criteria that serve as the basis for the NAAQS for each covered pollutant every five years, to either reaffirm or modify previously established NAAQS. Prior to the January 2013 revisions, EPA has revised the PM NAAQS three times, in 1987, 1997, and October 2006, to ensure that the standards continue to provide adequate protection for public health and welfare.", "A February 24, 2009, decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had remanded elements of EPA's decisions as promulgated in October 2006, in particular the decision not to tighten the primary annual NAAQS for PM 2.5 , to the agency for further consideration but did not vacate the revised standard nor set a specific timeline. The decision was in response to petitions filed in the D.C. Circuit by 13 states, industry, agriculture, business, and environmental and public health advocacy groups, challenging certain aspects of EPA's revisions for both PM 2.5 and PM 10 . The D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part with regard to the PM 2.5 annual standard and the secondary standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10 (including visibility impairment), denying other challenges.", "Concerned with delays in EPA's schedule for proposing revisions to the 2006 PM NAAQS, the American Lung Association and the National Parks Conservation Association, and nine states separately filed petitions with the D.C. Circuit in November 2011 urging the court to order EPA's immediate compliance with the February 2009 remand. Subsequently, in February 2012 the two organizations sued EPA in the D.C. Circuit for failing to fulfill their statutory duty to review the October 2006 PM NAAQS within five years, and a coalition of 11 states filed a similar suit with the U.S. District Court Southern District of New York. In response, the D.C. Circuit initially directed EPA to sign a proposed rule concerning its decision regarding revisions to the PM NAAQS by June 7, 2012, and following a motion filed by the agency, amended the deadline to June 14, 2012. As part of a September 4, 2012, consent decree, EPA agreed to finalize revisions to the PM NAAQS by December 14, 2012.", "Promulgation of a revised NAAQS, such as the PM NAAQS, initiates a series of statutorily required actions, ultimately culminating in issuance of permits pursuant to state regulations in a State Implementation Plan (SIP). The first step is designation of attainment and nonattainment areas, based on the accumulated results of ambient air monitoring and modeling data. States first propose to designate certain geographic areas (e.g., counties) as either \"attainment\" or \"nonattainment,\" depending on whether the data indicate the concentrations of pollutants will be below or above the NAAQS. After extensive dialogue with state officials, EPA either approves the proposed attainment and nonattainment areas, or sends back to states proposed revisions. EPA and states generally come to an agreement about the area designations. Following this designation, approved by EPA, states then develop a SIP, which consists essentially of state regulations to be implemented by states that would affect the state emissions inventory, and therefore the expected or modeled concentrations of air pollutants. After approval of the SIP as being adequate to control air pollution and reduce the ambient air pollutant concentrations in designated nonattainment areas, the states then issue permits (new or modified) for facilities whose emissions affect the air in designated nonattainment areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA's January 2013 Final Changes to the PM NAAQS", "paragraphs": ["EPA's 1997 revisions to the PM NAAQS revised the standards focused on particles smaller than 10 microns (PM 10 or coarse particles) established in 1987, and introduced standards for \"fine\" particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM 2.5 ) for the first time. The primary (health protection) PM NAAQS as revised in 2006 include an annual and a daily (24-hour) limit for PM 2.5 , but only a daily limit for PM 10 . To attain the PM 2.5 annual standard, the three-year average of the weighted annual arithmetic mean PM 2.5 concentration at each monitor within an area must not exceed the maximum limit set by the agency. The 24-hour standards are a concentration-based percentile form, indicating the percent of the time that a monitoring station can exceed the standard. For instance, a 98 th percentile 24-hour standard indicates that a monitoring station can exceed the standard 2% of the time during the year. For PM 2.5 and PM 10 , the secondary NAAQS, which are set at a level \"requisite to protect the public welfare,\" are the same as the primary standards.", "In the final rule published by EPA on January 15, 2013, the PM 2.5 and PM 10 standards and other implementation changes are as follows:", "Primary (Public Health) PM Standards", "PM 2.5 : EPA revised the annual standard, which currently is 15 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m 3 ), by setting a new limit of 12 \u00b5g/m 3 (the proposal included an optional limit of 13 \u00b5g/m 3 and solicited comment for 11 \u00b5g/m 3 ); compliance with the \"annual\" standard is determined by whether the three-year average of its annual average PM 2.5 concentration (at each monitoring site in the area) is less than or equal to 12 \u00b5g/m 3 ; as proposed, EPA retained the daily (24-hour) standard at 35 \u00b5g/m 3 based on the current three-year average of the 98 th percentile of 24-hour PM 2.5 concentrations as established in 2006. PM 10 : As proposed, EPA retained the current daily standard of no more than one exceedance of concentrations of 150 \u00b5g/m 3 per year on average over three years; there is no current annual standard for PM 10 (the previous annual maximum concentration standard of 50 \u00b5g/m 3 was eliminated by EPA in 2006).", "Secondary (Welfare) PM Standards", "PM 2.5 and PM 10 : As proposed, secondary (welfare) NAAQS are the same as the primary standards, the same correlations as the 2006 PM NAAQS, with the exception of visibility impairment associated with PM 2.5 . PM 2.5 Visibility Impairment: The final rule did not add a distinct secondary standard as proposed, defined in terms of a PM 2.5 visibility index based on speciated PM 2.5 mass concentrations and relative humidity data to calculate light extinction on a deciview (dv) scale similar to the current Regional Haze Program. Specifically, the proposal would have set a 24-hour averaging time of 30 or 28 deciviews (dv) based on a 90 th percentile form over three years. EPA also sought comment on alternative levels (down to 25 dv) and averaging times (e.g., 4 hours). Based on public comment and further analysis of air quality monitoring data, EPA concluded that the current secondary standard would provide visibility protection greater than or equal to 30 dv.", "Implementation Changes", "Monitoring: 41 As proposed, updates several aspects of monitoring regulations including requiring relocating a small number of PM 2.5 monitors to be collocated with measurements of other criteria pollutants (e.g., nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO)) near-roadway monitoring so as to ensure these monitors are at one location in each urban area with a population of 1 million or more, and to be phased in starting with the largest areas (2.5 million or more populations) by January 1, 2015, and extended to the remainder of areas by January 1, 2017. Includes the use data from existing Chemical Speciation Network or the EPA/National Park Service IMPROVE monitoring network to determine whether an area meets the proposed secondary visibility index standard for PM 2.5 . No changes to PM 10 monitoring. Air Quality Index (AQI): As proposed, updates the AQI (EPA's color-coded tool for informing the public about air quality and associated measures for reducing risks of exposure) for PM 2.5 by changing the upper end range for \"Good\" category (an index value of 50) on the overall scale (0 to 500 based on conversion of PM 2.5 concentrations) to the level of the revised annual PM 2.5 standard (12 \u00b5g/m 3 ). Also as proposed, EPA is setting the 100 value of the index scale (\"Moderate\") at the level of the current 24-hour PM 2.5 standard, which is 35 \u00b5g/m, 3 and the AQI of 150 (\"Unhealthy Sensitive Groups\") at 55 \u00b5g/m 3 . The current upper ends for the \"Hazardous\" (500), \"Unhealthy\" (200) and \"Very Unhealthy\" (300) AQIs are retained. Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD): EPA revised the PSD permitting program (rules) with respect to the revised PM NAAQS so as not to \"unreasonably delay\" pending permits and establish a \"grandfather\" provision for permit applications if: the permitting agency deems an application complete by December 14, 2012; or public notice for a draft permit or preliminary determination has been published (for public comment) no later than the effective date of revised PM NAAQS (60 days after January 15, 2013, publication in the Federal Register ).

EPA administratively added the preparation of a \"staff paper\" that summarizes the criteria document and lays out policy options. This EPA document typically serves as the basis for CASAC review and comment. EPA revised certain aspects (not including reinstating the closure letter) of the CASAC review process most recently in May 2009.

However, staff and CASAC placed considerable emphasis on continuing uncertainties and lack of sufficient data to initiate relevant quantitative risk assessment to support such modifications to the standard.

Enacted as part of the 1977 CAA Amendments and modified in the 1990 CAA Amendments, NSR is designed to ensure that newly constructed facilities, or substantially modified existing facilities, do not result in violation of applicable air quality standards. NSR provisions outline permitting requirements both for construction of new major pollution sources and for modifications to existing major pollution sources. The specific NSR requirements for affected sources depend on whether the sources are subject to \"Prevention of Significant Deterioration\" (PSD) or nonattainment provisions. As discussed earlier (see \" EPA's January 2013 Final Changes to the PM\u00a0NAAQS \"), the January 2013 final PM NAAQS includes revisions to the PSD permitting program (rules) with respect to the revised PM NAAQS so as not to \"unreasonably delay\" pending permits and establish a \"grandfather\" provision for permit applications if a draft permit or preliminary determination has been issued for public comment by the date the revised PM NAAQS go into effect.", "In addition to the CAA requirement for states to submit implementation plans, EPA acts to control NAAQS pollutants through national regulatory programs. These may be in the form of regulations of products and activities that might emit the pollutants (particularly fuels and combustion engines, such as automobiles and trucks) and in the form of emission standards for new stationary sources (e.g., utilities, refineries).
