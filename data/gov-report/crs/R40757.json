However, if DIC were 50% of the disability compensation received by the veteran, a survivor would receive a basic monthly benefit (based on the veteran's disability rating) ranging from approximately $67 to $1,535.

For the military Survivor Benefit Plan and for federal employees, the remarriage age is 55 for retaining benefits, and for Social Security beneficiaries, the remarriage age is 60.

Some totally disabled veterans have expressed concern that their surviving spouses would not receive a benefit if they die from non-service-connected causes if they have not been totally disabled for at least 10 years. The 10-year disability requirement for non-service-connected deaths can be viewed as a measure of the survivor's dependence on the veteran's disability compensation.

The $800 income limit in 1968 is equivalent to $5,442.21 in 2014.

Potentially eligible survivors included spouses, children, parents, and siblings.", "Because legislation had been written in response to need, dependency and indemnity compensation was unorganized and administered by four different administrations by the mid-1950s, and congressional and executive committees were formed to make the issuance of compensation more streamlined and manageable. Death compensation was set up similar to the way it is now by the time the final report of the President's Commission on Veterans' Pensions, Veterans' Benefits in the United States: Report to the President by the President's Commission of Veterans Pensions (hereafter referred to as the Bradley Report) was written in 1956. Death compensation was provided to survivors (except for dependent parents) regardless of income. The rate of compensation depended on whether the veteran served in peacetime or wartime.", "In 1969, after review of the Bradley Report, recommendations from a commission headed by Robert M. McCurdy in 1967, and extensive testimony from several other federal administrations and veterans service organizations, Congress devised a different, more equitable system for survivor compensation that gave fixed rates to each pay grade. The base rate was adjusted for a cost-of-living increase to reflect changes in the cost of living since the last base rate had been determined in 1956, 13 years earlier. In 1969, years of service were no longer a factor in determining DIC. There were no subsequent changes of significance to DIC legislation until 1993, when the rate tables for surviving spouses were eliminated and one flat monthly rate was reinstated. In 2003, surviving spouses who remarried after reaching the age of 57 were able to retain DIC."], "subsections": []}]}}
