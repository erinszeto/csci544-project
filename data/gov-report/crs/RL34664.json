The law's provisions to extend the homebuyer tax credit mirror those contained in an amendment to H.R. 4213 that was offered by Senator Reid. The law only affects those people who would have qualified for the credit if they had completed their purchase before July 1, 2010. This means that before May 1, 2010, they must have entered into a binding contract to purchase a residence and that contract must have called for closing before July 1, 2010.

The credit also had two characteristics that made it unlike most other tax credits\u2014it was refundable, and it was repayable; however, the repayment requirement was subject to certain exceptions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) modified the first-time homebuyer tax credit for those taxpayers purchasing principal residences in 2009, increasing the amount of the credit, extending the eligible purchase dates through November 30, 2009, and generally eliminating the repayment provision for purchases after 2008. ", "In addition to extending the eligible dates of purchase and allowing an additional two months in which to complete the purchase, the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 expanded the statutory definition of \"first-time homebuyer\" by introducing an exception for those who have owned and used the same residence as their principal residence for any period of five consecutive years during the eight-year period that ends on the date they purchase a subsequent property to use as their principal residence. These \"long-time residents\" generally are treated as first-time residents; however, their credit is capped at $6,500. P.L. 111-92 also raised the income limitation for all qualifying purchases, making more buyers eligible to claim the full credit. However, the law imposed new restrictions on qualifying for the credit. For purchases after November 6, 2009, property costing more than $800,000 is no longer eligible for the credit.

If the individual is married at the time the property is purchased, neither spouse may have had such an interest in the three-year period. However, unmarried individuals who buy property as co-owners are not \"tainted\" by another co-owner's recent ownership interest in a principal residence\u2014each unmarried co-owner's status as a first-time homebuyer is determined independently. Ownership of real property that has not been used as a principal residence within the three-year period does not disqualify an individual for the tax credit. Examples of such property include vacation homes and rental or investment properties.", "For residences purchased after November 6, 2009, P.L. 111-92 introduced an exception to the general definition of first-time homebuyer as described above. The exception applies to \"long-time residents of the same principal residence\" (long-time residents). These individuals are those who have both owned and used the same property as their principal residence for five consecutive years during the eight-year period that ends on the day a subsequent principal residence is purchased. Long-time residents will be treated as first-time homebuyers and be eligible for the tax credit if they otherwise qualify and purchase a new property after November 6, 2009, that they will begin using as their principal residence. The law specifically requires that, in the case of married taxpayers, both taxpayers have owned and used the same property as their principal residence for the required five consecutive years. It does not include a provision for imputing the five-year period of ownership to a non-owner spouse nor for allowing any portion of the credit when only one spouse meets the usage requirement.

Unlike those who are married when they purchase a new residence, two people who are unmarried on the date of purchase could each qualify as long-time residents using different prior residences. Similarly if one unmarried person who was a long-time resident purchased a new residence with another unmarried person who had not owned a home within the last three years, each person could qualify for the homebuyer credit\u2014the first as a long-time resident and the second as a first-time homebuyer. In that case, the credit could be divided between them so long as the long-time resident claimed no more than $6,500.

Section 121 provides no explicit definition but uses the term and refers to situations in which property that might otherwise not be thought of as a principal residence will nonetheless be considered one. However, a Treasury regulation provides guidance regarding property that may be considered a principal residence.", "According to regulation \u00a7 1.121-1, to be a principal residence, property must first be used as a residence. Facts and circumstances determine whether property is used as a residence. The regulation notes that \"a houseboat, a house trailer, or the house or apartment that the taxpayer is entitled to occupy as a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation\" may be a residence, but personal property that is not a fixture under local law is not included.", "A taxpayer may have more than one residence, but can have only one principal residence. When there is more than one residence, determining which of the residences is the principal one depends on facts and circumstances. Some of the factors that can be relevant are where the taxpayer works; where the taxpayer's family lives; where the taxpayer banks; where the taxpayer attends religious services; where the taxpayer belongs to recreational clubs; the taxpayer's usual mailing address for bills; and the addresses used on income tax returns, driver's licenses, car registrations, and voter registrations. When a taxpayer relocates due to employment, the residence in the new location may or may not be the taxpayer's principal residence. If the taxpayer's family remains in the old location temporarily until a house is sold, a lease expires, or a school year is completed, the residence in the new location could be considered the taxpayer's principal residence. However, if the taxpayer leaves the family indefinitely in the old location and lives in a small dwelling in the new location, it becomes more likely that the old residence will remain the taxpayer's principal residence. Thus, if the taxpayer's spouse and four children remain in a large rental property in another location, that rental property might continue to be the taxpayer's principal residence even if the taxpayer purchased a small condominium in the new location. The taxpayer would not be eligible for the first-time homebuyer's credit on the newly purchased property if the rental property was still the taxpayer's principal residence.", "Even if a property is used as the taxpayer's principal residence when it is purchased, it will not qualify for the credit if the taxpayer ceases to use it as the principal residence before the end of the tax year in which the residence was purchased."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is a Purchase?", "paragraphs": ["The law defines a purchase as generally being \"any acquisition,\" but excludes certain acquisitions\u2014notably, those acquired by inheritance or from a related party.

Taxpayer purchases a house for $250,000 and reports $7,500 as the first-time homebuyer credit on Form 1040 in the year of purchase. Two years later, before repaying any of the credit and without doing anything that would change the basis of the property, the taxpayer moves to another state and must sell the property. The sales price is $265,000. Expenses of sale are $15,000. The taxpayer has no gain from the sale for income tax purposes:", "However, to determine the extent to which the credit must be repaid, another gain calculation is required. For this calculation, the property's basis is reduced by the amount of the credit that has not yet been repaid; therefore for this calculation, the adjusted basis is $242,500 ($250,000 - $7,500 [the outstanding credit]). Using this number, there is a gain of $7,500, so the entire $7,500 credit must be recaptured on the tax return for the year in which the property is sold.", "Example 2\u2014Outstanding Cre dit Must Be Partially Recaptured . Assume the same facts as in the first example except that the sales price is $260,000 and the property is sold four years after purchase. For both the second and third years after purchase, $500 of the $7,500 credit would have been recaptured on the taxpayer's tax returns each year. Thus, $1,000 has been recaptured, and the outstanding credit is $6,500. Again, for tax purposes there is no gain.", "However, the basis must be reduced by the outstanding credit to determine the amount of outstanding credit that must be recaptured. Since $1,000 has been recaptured, only $6,500 of the credit is still outstanding. When the basis is reduced by $6,500, the result is $243,500 ($250,000 - $6,500). Using this number in the gain calculation, there is a $1,500 gain. Therefore, $1,500 of the outstanding credit must be recaptured on the tax return in the year of sale, but the remaining $5,000 will never be recaptured.", "Example 3\u2014No Recapture of Outstanding Credit . Use the same facts as in example 2, except that the sales expense is $17,000. Again, there would be no gain for tax purposes:", "Again, the basis as reduced by the outstanding credit would be $243,500 ($250,000-$6,500).
