Those factors whichhave been identified as contributing to the high price of oil include the resumption of relatively rapidgrowth rates of gross domestic product in many countries around the world, a declining value of theU.S. dollar, gasoline prices, the changing structure of the oil industry, OPEC policies, and thepersistently low levels of U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories.", "Expectations concerning future market conditions are quickly embodied in oil prices formedin futures markets like the New York Mercantile Exchange.

First, few commodity markets have an institution like the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Since its creation in 1960, OPEC has had a variableinfluence on the price of oil through its member nation quota system. Second, oil has been subjectto supply disruption due to political instability as well as technical factors.

As production proceeds, the level of proved reserves declines. As new oil discoveriesare made, recovery technologies improve, or as the price of oil rises, the stock of proved reservesincreases. A standard measure of the potential availability of oil over time is the reserve toproduction ratio (R/P). The R/P can be interpreted as the number of years that the existing reservebase can sustain the current level of production.

On one level, thedata suggest that the U.S. position is improving. The U.S. R/P has increased from 7.7 years in 1993to 11.3 years in 2003 and total U.S. reserves have also increased to 30.7 billion barrels from 30.2billion barrels in 1993. However, the U.S. R/P has increased because U.S. production has declined,from 8.6 million b/d in 1993 to 7.4 million b/d 2003. As U.S. total consumption has increased overthe period, the result has been that U.S. imports of oil have increased along with our dependence onother nations and the world oil market. The declining reserve position of North America in generalmeans that, absent new major discoveries, the United States will continue to depend on the worldmarket, and the OPEC, Persian Gulf nations for a large part of its supply.

Overall, the data suggest thecontinuation of an integrated world oil market. Any region, or nation, might well experiencedifficulty in trying to implement a singular oil policy, independent of the world market. ", "Another conclusion that might be drawn from the R/P data is that it provides little supportfor the escalated prices of the first quarter of 2004. Since little has changed in the long term balancebetween reserves and production, it is unlikely that the R/P has been the source of upward pricepressures. Long term oil prices might be affected by reserve and production positions in the future,but R/P ratios do not appear to be a major cause of recent oil price increases. ", "The world R/P has stayed roughly constant over the past 2 decades because investments havebeen made in exploration, development, and production. The International Energy Agency estimatesthat over $3 trillion, or $103 billion per year will need to be invested in the oil sector through 2030if its projections for increased demand materialize. It estimates that 70% of this total will be spenton exploration and development, with the remainder in refining, transportation and the developmentof non-conventional oil sources. (10) ", "Oil industry investment is only partly required to meet new demand. Only 16% of totalinvestment is projected to meet new demand growth. The remaining 84% is required to compensatefor declining production from the reserve base. The reason so much investment is needed tocompensate for declining fields lies in the decline rates observed in producing fields. Decline ratesdepend on a wide variety of factors, including geology, extraction technology, field age, andproduction policies. Decline rates range from 4% to over 11% per year. If production levels are tobe maintained, new reserves and production must continually be developed to compensate, financedby investment in exploration and development.

However, a feedback relationship exists which canmitigate this effect. To the extent that oil prices rise, reflecting increased oil demand, GDP growthrates might decline for two reasons. (16) If the monetary authorities interpret increasing oil costs asgeneralized price inflation, they may adopt restrictive monetary policies which could slow theeconomy's growth. Also, if oil product prices rise, and consumers are unable or unwilling to reduceoil product consumption, consumers may reduce expenditures on other goods and services, againpotentially slowing the rate of GDP growth.

For Russia, it is likely that expansion of the oilsector led the growth in Russian GDP. This behavior is typical of nations whose oil exporting sectoris a major component of their GDP. For nations in this category, high oil prices, based on rising oildemand, create an inflow of oil derived revenue, increasing GDP growth. The danger for thesenations is that if prices go too high, and stay high, GDP growth in the consuming nations mightdecline, reducing the demand and price of oil. An additional factor is that high prices lead toincreases in exploration and development budgets around the world.

First, if the value of the dollar declines against other currencies the dollars received by oil exportingnations are worth less in terms of world purchasing power. If oil exporters are able to exert marketpower in setting prices, or if market conditions permit oil exporters to dictate higher prices, they haveincentives to increase the money price of oil in an attempt to preserve the purchasing power they earnthrough selling a barrel of oil.

For the United States, of course, anyincrease in the dollar price of oil is immediately felt as an increased price burden, possibly leadingto decreases in demand. For the Euro area consumers, the situation is different. Since the value ofthe euro has increased in terms of dollars, the effect of any increase in dollar denominated oil pricesis offset by the amount of euro appreciation. For example, if the euro appreciates by the samepercent that the price of oil in dollars increases the two effects cancel each other.

Additionally, on the NYMEX a condition known as\"backwardation\" was common during the first half of 2004. In this situation the near-month futurescontract, in this case regular grade gasoline delivered to New York harbor, is persistently pricedhigher than the price level of the same gasoline, scheduled for delivery months further in the future. The effect of this pricing condition is to make the acquisition of inventories in the present monthmore expensive than acquiring them further in the future. Backwardation provides an incentive tokeep current inventories low. The low current inventory position then acts as a factor keeping priceshigh, because low inventories are taken to be indicative of a tight supply situation in the market.

Traders could hypothesize that since the price of gasoline is high, this might be the result of tight oil markets. Ifnot, there would be more oil refined, and gasoline produced, driving down the price. Theseexpectations could be acted upon through the NYMEX futures markets.

The goal of financial traders is tomake a profit on the contract, which may necessitate the price of the contract rising or fallingdepending on the trader's position in the market and current prices. The implication of this is thatfinancial traders may have an interest in the price moving either up or down, almost without regardto the underlying fundamentals of the market. ", "The rationale for this view is that financial traders have entered the NYMEX oil market inlarge numbers seeking profits that stock and bond markets have not produced since the boom yearsof the late 1990s. Profits can be earned on futures and options markets when prices of the underlyingcommodities go steadily up, or down, stay the same, or even when they exhibit more or less randomvolatility, depending on the strategic position the trader has created.

Within the region, mostof the large gains in demand are in nations with small initial consumption levels led by Azerbaiijan,Belarus, Austria, and Poland. These nations account for 1.2% of world demand. Although lowerthan average European oil demand growth may be tied to levels of economic activity, they may alsobe tied to changing consumption patterns and conservation, especially in Western Europe wheremotor vehicle transportation costs are very high.

However, the Russian economy has been in trouble for many years. If economic growth picks upand the economy restructures and stabilizes, consumption might return to levels similar to those in1993 when 3.8 million b/d were consumed. Russian consumption at that level might reduce theamount of oil available for export, pushing other consuming nations to become increasinglydependent on Middle Eastern supplies.", "The Asia Pacific region includes some nations with the highest year-to-year growth rates inthe world, while other nations in the region experience declining demand. In 2003, Chinastrengthened its position as the second largest oil consuming nation in the world by increasing itsmargin over Japan from only 20,000 b/d in 2002, to 431,000 b/d in 2003. Given the disparity ofeconomic growth rates, geographic and population factors, as well as the comparative density oftransportation, it seems that the Chinese lead over Japan may widen. At current growth rates, a morerelevant question might be when China will overtake the United States as the world's largestconsumer. This is most likely not a competition either nation will directly benefit from winning. The United States imported about 63% of the oil it consumed in 2003, and production has fallenevery year since 1993. China imported about 45% of the oil it consumed, and production increasedby only 1.5% for 2003, less than the 11.5% increase in demand.

(36) This mix reflects the U.S.use of oil as a transportation fuel, with car and light truck use responsible for the relatively highgasoline percentage. The U.S. refinery industry is unable to supply adequate gasoline to thedomestic market. As a result, imports of finished gasoline and gasoline blendstocks have increasedto almost one million barrels per day. U.S. refineries operate at near full capacity, but a lack of newcapacity expansion by the industry suggests further increases in imported gasoline, if available onthe world market. (37) ", "Europe has different preferences in transportation fuels than the United States. Middledistillates dominate the European product slate at 44%, with gasoline at 24.4%. These values reflectthe on-going shift to diesel engines in European passenger vehicles. As product demand shifts,refiners are following by investing in the technology needed to produce greater proportions of middledistillates and less gasoline. As this transformation proceeds, European refiners may find that theyhave less surplus gasoline available for export to the United States. This outcome could lead totightening U.S. gasoline markets, keeping an upward pressure on the price of gasoline, and indirectlysupporting high oil prices.

Conditions in the oil and oil products industries might not be so accommodating. Excess capacity in the crude oil market is low, with most estimates averaging less than 1.5 millionbarrels per day. If we add the increased estimate of consumption in 2004 to the projected increasein 2005 it is clear that the crude oil industry is likely to be at full production capacity through 2005.", "It has been reported that Aramco (Saudi Arabia) has a plan in place to expand production by1 million barrels per day within a year. Non-OPEC production is expected to increase by about 1.4million barrels per day in 2004, but only smaller increases are expected in 2005.

For the high price case, AEO assumes a price of $32.80 per barrel in 2010and $34.90 per barrel in 2025.

Someof the factors influencing the market might be temporary, some may be cyclical, and others maypossibly be permanent. While the high prices that resulted from the tight balance between oildemand and supply caused increased energy expenditures for consumers, business, and industry, italso led to higher incomes for energy producers. It is possible that the economy as a whole mightexperience macroeconomic effects, not only from the high oil prices themselves, but as a result ofthe monetary and fiscal policy responses that might be taken if the high prices persist and aredetermined to constitute inflation.", "Although it has been under pressure in 2003, 2004, and into 2005, the oil market has shownthat the market process is functioning. The factors discussed in this paper that affected oil andgasoline demand as well as the supply response of OPEC and other producers caused prices to rise,but there has been little, or no, evidence of physical shortage or supply disruption. ", "Effective policies to mitigate high oil prices are difficult to define at the national level. Theprice of oil is determined on a world market. It is unlikely that any consuming nation can insulateitself from the forces driving the world market. For example, if a nation decided to reduce oreliminate its direct dependence on the Persian Gulf, it might succeed in doing that by buying oil fromother nations. However, this would reduce the total amount of non-Persian Gulf oil available toother nations, increasing their dependence on the region and leaving the level of world dependenceunchanged. If political events in the Persian Gulf caused the price of oil to rise, that price increasewould be transmitted to all oil produced around the world. It is not possible to isolate oneself fromthe world market, except perhaps by cutting domestic consumption to the level of domesticproduction. ", "The market in 2004 was likely affected by a \"fear factor\" premium on the price of oil, raisingits price above that indicated by market fundamentals. Some estimates of the \"fear factor\" run ashigh as $15 per barrel, while others rate it at only a few dollars, or nothing at all. (41) The threat of supplydisruption due to potential terrorism or political instability appears to be the source of this pricefactor. An important question is, how long this factor will influence price? In the past, fears of political instability, especially in the Persian Gulf, tended to be quelled in relatively shorttime-frames. Today, with the war on terrorism perceived as a long term reality, it may be that oilprices will incorporate a \"fear factor\" for a significant time.", "The nature of the exploration and production cycle in the oil industry encourages majorswings in the price of oil even in more politically stable times. This cycle makes it difficult forgovernments to time oil policies effectively. In the past, periods of high oil prices have led to a rapidexpansion of exploration, and given improving technology, have led to substantial oil finds in manyplaces in the world. As newly discovered extra oil comes on the market several years later, theincreased supply tends to overwhelm demand, causing price to drop. While demand tends toincrease incrementally, by a few percent per year, supply tends to increase discrete amounts inresponse to a period of high prices. This relationship leads to cyclic price volatility. Set against thisrecord is the opinion of some that world oil production is soon to peak as a result of geologicalfactors and the likelihood that the largest oil reserves have already been discovered. (42) ", "A major continuing factor in the market is the emergence of China as a major importer ofcrude oil. In addition, the possibility exists that India, and perhaps other Asian nations, might expandtheir imports of oil as industrial production expands in those nations. Although the 2005 projectionof Chinese import growth moderates to approximately 7% from the 2003 level of 11.2%, in thelonger term much depends on whether oil use for private automobiles in China expands very quicklyor is moderated by the government. However, either of these yearly growth rates imply stress forthe world oil market. Based on China's consumption of almost 6 million barrels per day in 2003, itmay generate increases of demand of 500 thousand b/d or more in the next few years. In a marketwith very limited excess capacity, and possibly facing the discovery of fewer giant fields, increasesin demand of these magnitudes promise to contribute to an upward pressure on price.", "The 2004, and potentially for 2005, oil market reflects the influence of a number of factorsall of which have led to upward pressure on price. Although some of these factors might have beenjudged temporary in the past, there is a danger that in the current political environment they mayperpetuate themselves, keeping oil prices well above the OPEC price target."], "subsections": []}]}}
