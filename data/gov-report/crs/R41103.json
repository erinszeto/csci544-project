EPA, the Court held 5-4 that greenhouse gases (GHGs), widely viewed as contributing to climate change, constitute \"air pollutants\" as that phrase is used in the Clean Air Act (CAA). As a result, said the Court, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had improperly denied a petition seeking CAA regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles by citing, among other reasons, the agency's lack of authority over such emissions.", "This report offers a chronology of major federal agency actions, mainly by EPA, that involve GHGs or climate change and that occurred after Massachusetts v. EPA. Most of the listed actions trace directly or indirectly back to the decision. Examples include EPA's \"endangerment finding\" for GHG emissions from new motor vehicles; the resulting EPA standards (issued on multiple occasions) for GHG emissions from new motor vehicles; EPA's proposal of performance standards (again on separate occasions) for CO2 emissions from new, and modified or reconstructed, fossil fuel-fired power plants; and EPA's proposal of emission guidelines for CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants. Several listed EPA actions, taken on the agency's view that regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles triggers new source review of GHG stationary sources, are now either void or will have to be limited slightly in scope, owing to the 2014 decision of the Supreme Court in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA.", "A few agency actions were included in the report solely because of their relevance to climate change and their post-Massachusetts occurrence\u2014that is, they were not legally compelled by Massachusetts v.

The case, Massachusetts v. EPA , was a challenge to the denial by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of a petition asking it to take two actions\u2014(a) find under the Clean Air Act (CAA) that greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from new motor vehicles \"cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\" through their climate change effects, then (b) issue standards for those GHG emissions. EPA's petition denial was based in part on its claim that it lacked authority to regulate GHGs. To the contrary, said the Supreme Court by 5-4, GHGs constitute \"air pollutants\" under the CAA, hence EPA does indeed have the authority to regulate GHG emissions. The Court gave EPA three options: (a)\u00a0determine that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles \"cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\" then promulgate standards limiting those emissions; (b) determine that such GHG emissions do not cause or contribute to such endangerment; or (c) explain adequately why the agency cannot or will not make a determination under either (a) or (b).", "EPA chose option (a)\u2014that is, to make a positive \"endangerment finding\" for GHG emissions from new motor vehicles. That finding was made in December 2009, and under CAA section 202 required EPA to promulgate standards for new motor vehicle emissions to address the endangerment. That action, or rather actions, the agency also has taken, beginning in May 2010. ", "In EPA's view, the 2010 motor vehicle standards, in turn, triggered CAA duties for stationary sources (factories, power plants) of GHG emissions as well. More specifically, the agency adopted regulations under which major new stationary sources and major modifications of existing stationary sources, when proposed for Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) areas, must undergo \"new source review\" based on their expected CO 2 emissions. If subject to PSD new source review, the CAA required those sources to install \"best available control technology\" (BACT) to control GHG emissions. Reading the CAA literally, EPA believed, new source review and BACT would be required for any major new source or modification that emitted or increased CO 2 emissions by the same low threshold amount applied by the CAA to non-GHG emissions. And the BACT requirement, EPA argued further, triggered CAA Title V operating permitting requirements\u2014again, on a literal reading of the CAA, with the same low threshold as for non-GHG emissions. Given the huge amount of CO 2 emitted by even some small stationary sources, this literal reading of the CAA brought a correspondingly huge number of sources under the act's new source review, BACT, and Title V permitting requirements. In an effort to shrink this large number to administratively practical levels, EPA construed the act to allow a phase-in of the statutory thresholds through a so-called \"tailoring rule.\"", "In 2014, the Supreme Court in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA rejected EPA's argument that regulation of motor vehicle GHG emissions necessarily triggers PSD new source review of the same emissions from stationary sources. As the Court saw it, PSD new source review and BACT cannot be triggered solely by a source's GHG emissions. On the other hand, EPA's application of CO 2 BACT to \"anyway\" sources\u2014sources subject to new source review based on their non-GHG emissions\u2014was seen by the Court as a reasonable reading of the CAA. In a related holding, Utility Air Regulatory Group voided EPA's tailoring rule as an impermissible rewriting of the CAA's emission thresholds.", "This report is a chronology of the major climate change-related actions taken by federal agencies, principally EPA, in the wake of Massachusetts v.

Reg. 12156. The CAA preempts state controls on new motor vehicle emissions, but offers California, and California alone, the opportunity to request a waiver of CAA preemption. EPA must grant the preemption waiver if certain conditions are met. The importance of this \"California waiver\" is magnified by the fact that once EPA grants the waiver, states that adopt motor vehicle emission standards identical to California's also partake of the preemption waiver for the same vehicles. In the present case, California sought a waiver of CAA preemption for its GHG emissions limits for 2009 and later model year motor vehicles. EPA denied the waiver on finding that the state did not need those emission limits to meet \"compelling and extraordinary conditions,\" as required by the CAA.

In PSD areas of the country, the CAA requires only pollutants \"subject to regulation under [the CAA]\" to be controlled by potentially expensive BACT\u2014when emitted by new major emitting facilities or major modifications of existing facilities. Since there were no \"actual\" GHG regulations under the CAA when the Johnson memorandum was issued, this meant that for the near term at least, new major emitting facilities and major modifications of existing facilities proposed for PSD areas did not have to install BACT for GHG emissions.

Based on the \"cause, or contribute to\" phrase, the second finding was that the four GHGs emitted by new motor vehicles in the United States contribute to the endangering air pollution otherwise present in the atmosphere.

In a refinement, however, EPA stated that \"subject to regulation\" does not apply to a newly regulated pollutant (like GHGs) until a regulatory requirement to control emissions of that pollutant not only is promulgated, but also takes effect . For GHGs, that \"regulatory requirement\" is the new GHG emission standards for light-duty motor vehicles, noted immediately below.

Regarding NHTSA, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended in 2007, requires that agency to prescribe separate fuel economy standards for passenger and non-passenger automobiles beginning with model year 2011, to achieve a combined fuel economy average for model year 2020 of at least 35 miles per gallon. EPA and NHTSA acted jointly because motor vehicle GHG emissions are directly linked to fuel consumption. In order to provide a consistent set of standards for auto manufacturers to meet, the White House brokered an agreement under which EPA would develop GHG emissions standards under the CAA that would be compatible with fuel economy standards developed by NHTSA.", "The EPA and NHTSA standards apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles, covering model years 2012 through 2016, and purport to represent a harmonized and consistent national program.

The tailoring rule began, on January 2, 2011, with GHG emissions thresholds for PSD new source review and Title V that are much higher than those in the CAA (EPA hoped to phase in the statute's low statutory thresholds after many years). Indeed, the thresholds in the final tailoring rule are higher than those in the proposed rule. For example, beginning January 2, 2011, PSD requirements will apply to projects that increase net GHG emissions by at least 75,000 tons per year CO 2 equivalent, but only if the project also significantly increases emissions of at least one non-GHG pollutant.
