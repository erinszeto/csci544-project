The Department of the Interior (DOI) has jurisdiction over OCS sources in federal waters in the western Gulf of Mexico and most of the central Gulf. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74), transferred air emission authority in the OCS off Alaska's north coast from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to DOI. EPA has jurisdiction over sources in all other federal waters.", "The primary difference between the EPA and DOI programs is rooted in the different statutory authorities: the 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) and the 1978 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). The primary objectives of these statutes are different\u2014air quality versus offshore energy development. The two regulatory programs reflect these underlying differences. For much of the past 30 years, these differences received little attention, primarily because most of the federal oil and gas resources in EPA's jurisdiction have been subject to moratoria. In 2008, moratoria provisions expired, potentially opening many of the areas in EPA's jurisdiction to oil and gas leasing activity. If more OCS areas in EPA's jurisdiction are open for oil and gas leasing, policymakers' interest in these differences will likely increase.", "For OCS sources in EPA's jurisdiction, requirements depend on whether the source is located within 25 miles of a state's seaward boundary (\"inner OCS sources\") or beyond (\"outer OCS sources\"). Inner OCS sources are subject to the same requirements as comparable onshore emission sources, which vary by state and depend on the area's air quality status; outer sources are subject to various CAA provisions, including the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. In contrast, OCS sources in DOI's jurisdiction are subject to air emission requirements only if emissions would \"significantly affect\" onshore air quality.", "A key difference between the EPA and DOI programs is the federal emission threshold that would subject a source to substantive requirements. For sources in EPA's jurisdiction, this is the PSD threshold of 250 tons per year (tpy) of regulated emissions. Sources that exceed this level would likely be subject to Best Achievable Control Technology (BACT) and other provisions. States' analogous thresholds that apply to inner OCS sources may be more stringent. By comparison, a DOI OCS source applies an exemption formula, based on distance from shore (e.g., a source 30 miles from shore would have an emission threshold of 990 tpy). If a source remains subject after this step, it must conduct air modeling to assess whether its emissions would have a significant effect on onshore air quality. In effect, this two-step process constitutes a much less stringent threshold than EPA's 250 tpy threshold.", "Another substantial difference is the time frame allotted to the agencies for reviewing a potential source's permit (EPA) or activity-specific plan (DOI). In addition, the EPA permit process allows greater opportunity for input from the public. In particular, EPA's Environmental Appeals Board offers parties a powerful tool to compel agency review.", "Therefore, two identical operations, located in separate jurisdictions, could face considerably different requirements and procedural time frames. Some stakeholders would likely argue that the additional opportunities for public involvement in EPA's permit process help create a balance between resource development and environmental concerns. Others would likely contend these steps present unnecessary burdens and timing uncertainty in the process."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The same group of air pollutant emissions from outer continental shelf (OCS) operations are subject to different regulatory programs, depending on the location of the operation.

Although active leases are located in EPA's jurisdiction, none of the Gulf of Mexico platforms are in EPA's jurisdiction.", "In 2008, moratoria provisions expired, allowing many of the areas in EPA's jurisdiction to potentially open for oil and gas leasing activity. In addition, estimates of oil and gas resources have spurred interest in areas other than the Gulf ( Table 1 ). For example, OCS areas off the Atlantic coast have also received attention in recent years. In 2007, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) proposed a lease sale in an area offshore of Virginia. The lease sale was set to take place in 2011. In the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Obama Administration canceled the sale (May 27, 2010). In addition, in DOI's most recent five-year plan for OCS leasing, DOI decided not to include the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas.

The House has passed several bills that would direct DOI to hold lease sales in particular areas, including the formerly proposed Virginia lease sale and areas of Southern California. ", "In addition, areas of the U.S. Arctic region, which were not subject to the moratoria, have generated recent congressional interest as industry has sought to establish a greater presence in the area. A primary driver for the activity in this region is the shrinking Arctic ice cap, or conversely, the growing amount of ice-free ocean in the summertime. ", "As interest in developing OCS resources in EPA's jurisdiction has increased, the EPA OCS air program has received increased scrutiny from some Members. In particular, Members have focused on the permit activity of Shell in the Chukchi Sea, part of the federal waters off Alaska's north coast. This interest led to the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ) on December 23, 2011, which transferred air emission authority in the OCS off Alaska's north coast from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to DOI.", "This report will provide an overview and brief history of the separate regulatory programs, examine and compare the requirements of the programs, and highlight potential implications of the differences.

Operations in the Arctic region may involve icebreaker vessels, which may generate considerably more emissions than other support vessels.", "A Senate Report from the 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments stated: \"The construction and operation of OCS facilities emit a significant amount of air pollution which adversely impacts coastal air quality in the United States. Operational emissions from an OCS platform and associated marine vessels can routinely exceed 500 tons of nitrogen (NO x ) and one hundred tons of reactive hydrocarbons annually.\"", "Based on a review of EPA OCS permit documents, the 1990 Senate Report estimate is still valid, particularly for nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions. Table 2 identifies emission ranges of selected air pollutants from seven OCS oil/gas operations seeking, or recently receiving, air permits in EPA's jurisdiction. In some cases, the ranges cover a wide spectrum. For each source, NO x emissions account for the majority of the operations' regulated pollutants. ", "Four of the pollutants in Table 2 are considered \"criteria\" pollutants and have a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Both NO x and volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions lead to ozone (O 3 ) formation (sometimes described as smog), which is also a criteria pollutant.

For example, the 1970 law (among other provisions) set national standards for air quality, created a program to require the best available control technology at major new sources of air pollution, and established a program to regulate air toxics.
