Specifically, this report focuses on Division A (or I) of H.R. 3200 from those committees.", "Division A of H.R. 3200 focuses on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, and providing financial assistance to certain individuals and, in some cases, small employers. In general, H.R. 3200 would require individuals to maintain health insurance and employers to either provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment, with some exceptions. Several insurance market reforms would be made, such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal. Both the individual and employer mandates would be linked to acceptable health insurance coverage, which would meet required minimum standards and incorporate the market reforms included in the bill. Acceptable coverage would include (1) coverage under a qualified health benefits plan (QHBP), which could be offered either through the newly created Health Insurance Exchange (the Exchange) or outside the Exchange through new employer plans; (2) grandfathered employment based plans; (3) grandfathered nongroup plans; and (4) other coverage, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Exchange would offer private plans alongside a public option. Based on income, certain individuals could qualify for subsidies toward their premium costs and cost-sharing (deductibles and copayments); these subsidies would be available only through the Exchange. In the individual market (the nongroup market), a plan could be grandfathered indefinitely, but only if no changes were made to the terms and conditions of that plan, including benefits and cost-sharing, and premiums were only increased as allowed by statute. Most of these provisions would be effective beginning in 2013.", "The Exchange would not be an insurer; it would provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to insurers' plans in a comparable way. The Exchange would consist of a selection of private plans as well as a public option. Individuals wanting to purchase the public option or a private health insurance not through an employer or a grandfathered nongroup plan could only obtain such coverage through the Exchange. They would only be eligible to enroll in an Exchange plan if they were not enrolled in other acceptable coverage (e.g., from an employer, Medicare, and generally Medicaid). The public option would be established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), would offer three different cost-sharing options, and would vary premiums geographically. For the public option, the Ways and Means and Education and Labor versions would have the Secretary set payments to health care providers based on Medicare payment rates, while the Energy and Commerce version would require the Secretary to negotiate rates with medical providers. The Energy and Commerce version also would establish a federal grant and loan program to assist the establishment and initial operation of health insurance cooperatives. Such cooperatives would be state-licensed, non-profit, member-run organizations not sponsored by the state, and offer coverage through the Exchange.", "Only within the Exchange, credits would be available to limit the amount of money certain individuals would pay for premiums and for cost-sharing (deductibles and copayments). (Although Medicaid is beyond the scope of this report, H.R. 3200 would extend Medicaid coverage for most individuals under 133\u2153% of poverty; individuals would generally be ineligible for Exchange coverage if they were eligible for Medicaid.)"], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Status of House Legislation", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 3200 , America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, as introduced on July 14, 2009, was referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, Education and Labor, Oversight and Government Reform, and the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.

This information is useful in setting the stage for understanding how and where H.R. 3200 would reform health insurance. Primarily, however, the report summarizes provisions affecting private health insurance in Division A (or Division 1) H.R. 3200 , as ordered reported by the House Committees on Education and Labor, on Ways and Means, and on Energy and Commerce. Where the House committees' versions of a provision are the same, they are discussed as applying generally under H.R. 3200 ; where the bills ordered reported differ, the differences are noted. Although most of the provisions would be effective beginning in 2013, the table in the Appendix shows the timeline for implementing provisions effective prior to 2013.", "Although the description that follows segments the private health insurance provisions into various categories, these provisions are interrelated and interdependent. For example, H.R. 3200 includes a number of provisions to alter how current private health insurance markets function, primarily for individuals who purchase coverage directly from an insurer or through a small employer. H.R. 3200 would require that insurers not exclude potential enrollees or charge them premiums based on pre-existing health conditions. In a system where individuals voluntarily choose whether to obtain health insurance, however, individuals may choose to enroll only when they become sick. Enrolling in coverage only after developing a condition could result in coverage that excludes the pre-existing condition, unaffordable premiums, and even greater uninsurance. Thus, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the association that represents health insurers, has agreed to reform that does away with limitations of pre-existing condition exclusions, but only if individuals are required to purchase coverage, so that not just the sick enroll.", "However, some individuals currently forgo health insurance because they cannot afford the premiums. If individuals are required to obtain health insurance, one could argue that adequate premium subsidies must be provided by the government and/or employers to make practical the individual mandate to obtain health insurance, which is in turn arguably necessary to make the market reforms possible. In addition, premium subsidies without cost-sharing subsidies may provide individuals with health insurance that they cannot afford to use. So, while the descriptions below discuss various provisions separately, the removal of one from the bill could be deleterious to the implementation of the others.", "The private health insurance provisions are presented under the following topics within Division A of H.R. 3200 , with the primary CRS contact listed for each:", "Individual and employer mandate: the requirement on individuals to maintain health insurance and on employers to either provide health insurance or pay into the Exchange, with penalties and taxes for noncompliance.

People may get health coverage in the private sector or through a publicly funded program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance. Employers choosing to offer health coverage may either purchase insurance or choose to self-fund health benefits for their employees. Other individuals obtained coverage on their own in the nongroup market. However, there is no federal law that either requires individuals to have health insurance or requires employers to offer health insurance. Approximately 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured in 2008.", "Individuals and employers choosing to purchase health insurance in the private market fit into one of the three segments of the market, depending on their situation\u2014the large group (large employer) market, the small group market, and the nongroup market.", "More than 95% of large employers offer coverage. Large employers are generally able to obtain lower premiums for a given health insurance package than small employers and individuals seeking nongroup coverage. This is partly because larger employers enjoy economies of scale and a larger \"risk pool\" of enrollees that makes the expected costs of care more predictable. Employers generally offer large subsidies toward health insurance, thus making it more attractive for both the healthier and the sicker workers to enter the pool. So, not only is the risk pool larger in size, but it is more diverse. States have experimented with ways to create a single site where individuals and small employers could compare different insurance plans, obtain coverage, and sometimes pool risk. Although most of these past experiments failed (e.g., California's PacAdvantage ), other states have learned from these experiences and have fashioned potentially more sustainable models (e.g., Massachusetts' Connector ). There are private-sector companies that also serve the role of making various health insurance plans easier to compare for individuals and small groups (e.g., eHealthInsurance), available in most, but not all, states because of variation in states' regulations.", "Less than half of all small employers (less than 50 employees) offer health insurance coverage, in part because they lack the economies of scale available to larger employers. These pools are generally considered to be less stable than larger pools, as one or two employees moving in or out of the pool (or developing an illness) would have a greater impact on the risk pool than they would in a larger pool. Allowing these firms to purchase insurance through a larger pool, such as an Association or an Exchange, could lower premiums for those with high-cost employees.", "Depending on the applicable state laws, individuals who purchase health insurance in the nongroup market may be rejected or face premiums based on their health status, which can make premiums lower for the healthy but higher for the sick. Even when these individuals obtain coverage, there may be exclusions for certain conditions. Reforms affecting premiums ratings would likely increase premiums for some, while lowering premiums for others, depending on their age, health, behaviors, and other factors.", "States are the primary regulators of the private health insurance market, though some federal regulation applies, mostly affecting employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI). The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that coverage sold to small groups (2-50 employees) must be sold on a guaranteed issue basis. That is, the issuer must accept every small employer that applies for coverage. All states require issuers to offer policies to firms with 2-50 workers on a guaranteed issue basis, in compliance with HIPAA. As of January 2009 in the small group market, 13 states also require issuers to offer policies on a guaranteed issue basis to the self-employed \"groups of one.\" And as of December 2008 in the individual market, 15 states require issuers to offer some or all of their insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals. ", "Most states currently impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in the small group and individual markets. The spectrum of existing state rating limitations ranges from pure community rating to adjusted (or modified) community rating, to rate bands, to no restrictions. Under pure community rating, all enrollees in a plan pay the same premium, regardless of their health, age or any other factor; only two states (New Jersey and New York) use pure community rating in their nongroup markets. Generally, adjusted community rating prohibits issuers from pricing health insurance policies based on health factors, but allows it for other factors such as age or gender. ", "All states require health issuers to reduce the period of time when coverage for pre-existing health conditions may be excluded. As of January 2009 in the small group market, 21 states had pre-existing condition exclusion rules that provided consumer protection above the federal standard. And as of December 2008 in the individual market, 42 states limit the period of time when coverage for pre-existing health conditions may be excluded for non-HIPAA eligible enrollees in that market. In fact, while there are a handful of federal benefit mandates for health insurance that apply to group coverage, there are more than 2,000 benefit mandates imposed by the states.", "One issue receiving congressional attention is whether a publicly sponsored health insurance plan should be offered as part of the insurance market reform. Some proponents of a public option see it as potentially less expensive than private alternatives, as it would not need to generate profits or pay brokers to enroll individuals and might have lower administrative costs. Some proponents argue that offering a public plan could provide additional choice and may increase competition, since the public plan might require lower provider payments and thus charge lower premiums. Some opponents question whether these advantages would make the plan a fair competitor, or rather provide the government with an unfair advantage in setting prices, in authorizing legislation, or in future amendments. Ultimately, they fear that these advantages might drive private plans from the market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individual and Employer Mandates", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Individual Mandate", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 3200 includes a mandate for most individuals to have health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance.

Individuals who did not maintain acceptable health insurance coverage for themselves and their children could be required to pay an additional tax, prorated for the time the individual (or family) does not have coverage, equal to the lesser of (1) 2.5% of the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over the amount of income required to file a tax return, or (2) the national average premium for applicable single or family coverage.", "Some individuals would be provided with subsidies to help pay for the costs of their premiums and cost-sharing.

Under the Education and Labor bill, an employer could apply to the Secretary for a waiver from health coverage participation requirements for any two-year period.", "For those employers that chose to offer health insurance, the following rules would apply:", "Employers could offer employment-based coverage or, for certain small businesses, they could offer coverage through an Exchange plan (see section on rules for the Exchange). Current employment-based health plans would be grandfathered for five years, at which time any plan offered by an employer would have to meet (but could exceed) the requirements of the essential benefits package. Employers would have to contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost qualified benefits plan they offered (65% for those electing family coverage) \u2014prorated for part-time employees. Salary reductions used to offset required employer contributions would not count as amounts paid by the employer. Employers would automatically enroll their employees into the plan for individual coverage with the lowest associated employee premium, unless the employee selected a different plan or opted out of employer coverage.", "As shown in Table 1 , under the Ways and Means and Education and Labor versions, employers with aggregate wages over $400,000 that chose not to offer coverage would be subject to a payroll assessment equal to 8% of the average wages paid by the employer. The table shows the required level of payroll assessments for smaller employers.", "Even if an employer offered employer sponsored health insurance, employees could decline or disenroll from this insurance and instead enroll in a plan through the Exchange. Beginning in the second year after enactment, employers with aggregate wages above $400,000 (for the Ways and Means and Education and Labor versions) would be assessed 8% of average wages paid by the employer to the Exchange for those employees, with similar adjustments for small employers as those described above. (This payroll assessment would not be required for an employee who was not the primary insured individual but was covered as a spouse or dependent in an Exchange plan.) The employer's payroll assessment for this group of individuals would go into the Exchange but would not apply toward the individual's premium. In addition, as discussed below, full-time employees who are offered their employer's qualifying coverage would generally not be eligible for any premium or cost-sharing credits (absent the limited instances ). Thus, in general, a full-time employee who opted for Exchange coverage rather than the employer's qualifying coverage would be responsible for 100% of the premium in the Exchange. ", "The Energy and Commerce Committee version included an amendment that changed these limits, but only for the purpose of applying the affordability credits (amending section 242). This section provides for the application of the affordability credit provisions in the same manner for employees of small employers based on an alternative table as if such alternative table had been substituted for the table in section 313\u2014the section of the bill that specifies the required employer payroll-assessment percentages for small businesses. However, the affordability credits section does not actually change the amounts or table for the employer mandate provisions specified in sections 313 and 412; changes in those sections would have been outside the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee and not in order in the Committee's consideration of the bill.

The Secretary would reimburse the plan for 80% of the portion of a claim above $15,000 and below $90,000 (adjusted annually for inflation).

Require coverage to be offered on both a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. (\"Guaranteed issue\" in health insurance is the requirement that an issuer accept every applicant for health coverage. \"Guaranteed renewal\" in health insurance is the requirement on an issuer to renew group coverage at the option of the plan sponsor [e.g., employer] or nongroup coverage at the option of the enrollee. Guaranteed issue and renewal alone would not guarantee that the insurance offered was affordable; this would be addressed in the rating rules.) Impose new non-discrimination standards building on existing non-discrimination rules in group coverage and adequacy standards for insurers' networks of providers, such as doctors.", "H.R. 3200 would also require QHBPs to cover certain broad categories of benefits, prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services, limit annual out-of-pocket spending, and meet the standards for the \"essential benefits package,\" described below.
