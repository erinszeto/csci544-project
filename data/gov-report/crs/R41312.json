Congress had 30 days of continuous session for consultations with the Administration, followed by an additional 60 days of continuous session to review the agreement. If not opposed by a joint resolution of disapproval or other legislation, then the agreement is considered approved at the end of this time period. Congress also has the option of adopting either a joint resolution of approval with (or without) conditions or standalone legislation that could approve or disapprove the agreement. On November 30, 2010, the House passed H.R. 6411 by voice vote. The bill would have approved the agreement even if the required congressional review period is not reached.

Sensitive nuclear technology may be transferred only if the agreement is amended. The agreement does not allow for enrichment of uranium transferred under the agreement to levels of 20% U-235 or greater unless mutually agreed. The previous agreement also did not allow for this. In accordance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act (NNPA) of 1978, the United States must approve of enrichment of any nuclear material exported from the United States to Australia.

Uranium enrichment technology holders have committed to a ban on the export of enrichment technology until the Nuclear Suppliers Group decides on criteria for future transfers. It appears that Australia would qualify for transfer under this criteria, but enrichment plants would be a black box or turnkey facility. This type of transfer would be consistent with current U.S. policy. Australian officials have also noted additional concerns, such as cost and finding a local government willing to host a commercial enrichment plant.

The United States and Australia conduct joint combined military training exercises, have exchange officers in each others' armed forces, and work to standardize equipment and operational doctrine. In recent years, Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty after the attacks on the United States in 2001, and Australian troops fought with U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Australia has the largest non-NATO military contingent in Afghanistan and fought alongside the United States in Vietnam, Korea, World War II, and World War I, as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan. Australia has also played a key role in promoting regional stability in places such as Timor Leste, the Solomon Islands, and Bougainville. The United States and Australia have a very close intelligence relationship. The United States and Australia also concluded a Free Trade Agreement, which came into force in 2005. The two nations signed a Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty in 2007 that would facilitate the trade of defense-related equipment and technology.

Australia has been a staunch supporter of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) since its adherence in 1973.

Australia is also a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), an export control coordination body.", "Australia has developed stricter standards for nuclear trade than the export control regimes currently call for; for example, requiring an Additional Protocol to be in force for any country importing uranium from Australia. Over the past four decades, Australia has developed a bilateral safeguards system for uranium exports. A bilateral safeguards agreement is required, and countries may only retransfer Australian uranium to other countries that also have a bilateral safeguards agreement with Australia. ", "In recent years, the international community has debated ways to foster the growth of nuclear energy while minimizing proliferation risks of the spread of sensitive nuclear technologies. Australia has supported development of multilateral fuel assurance mechanisms while stating that a well-functioning market provides the best assurance of supply. At the 2010 NPT Review Conference, an Australian representative said that \"Australia does not consider it necessary or desirable for each state with a nuclear program to develop national enrichment or reprocessing facilities \u2026 it would be a perverse outcome from the standpoint of international security to see a proliferation of national fuel cycle facilities.\" This is in line with current U.S. policy. The Nuclear Suppliers Group is currently debating criteria for future transfers of enrichment or reprocessing technologies. ", "Political division on nuclear power and to what extent Australia should pursue sensitive fuel cycle technologies was evident in earlier periods. Former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton sought to keep Australia's nuclear options open, though it did not eventuate. He reportedly signed a secret deal with France to construct a uranium enrichment facility in Australia. A plan to develop a nuclear reactor at Jervis Bay was also considered. These plans were reversed by the election of Labor Party candidate Gough Whitlam, who was elected in 1972. Australia subsequently ratified the NPT in 1973. The Labor perspective on nuclear weapons was further promoted by Australian support for the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty in 1985. Anti-nuclear sentiment in Australia was also influenced to an extent by the anti-nuclear movement in New Zealand, which led to New Zealand's de facto ouster from the ANZUS alliance in the mid-1980s and by the resumption of nuclear testing by France in French Polynesia in 1995. Today, Australia remains a strong advocate of nuclear disarmament in international foray.

As Rod Lyon has pointed out, Australia's posture on nuclear weapons has been to a large extent determined by Australia's perceived \"fit\" in the regional and global strategic context. As the strategic environment changed from World War II to the era of the cold war to the present, Australia shifted from being a \"possible nuclear proliferator, to a supporter of extended nuclear deterrence (which it benefits from under the ANZUS alliance) to an important advocate of global nuclear arms control.\" ", "During the post-World War II period through the 1950s, Australia worked closely with its traditional security partner, the United Kingdom, including allowing Britain to conduct nuclear tests at an island off its northwest coast and in the desert. Australian scientists worked in the British nuclear atomic bomb research program, and former Prime Minister Menzies reportedly saw such cooperation as an opportunity to gain knowledge of nuclear weapons development. Australia received a nuclear research reactor from Britain in 1958. It is apparently in the period after World War II and prior to closer Anglo-U.S. nuclear cooperation that Australia, as part of Britain's attempt to resurrect its empire, worked most closely with the United Kingdom in Britain's efforts to acquire its own nuclear deterrent to the Soviet Union. ", "Australia's security environment became more precarious in the 1960s, which may have led it to consider its strategic options. Key events influencing this included China conducting its first nuclear test in 1964, the British announcement of its strategic departure from East of Suez in 1967, and the United States articulating the Guam Doctrine limiting U.S. ground troop support in 1969 while the war in Vietnam continued. ", "Australia's involvement in joint intelligence, communications, and early warning facilities with the United States made it a potential nuclear target of the Soviet Union during the cold war. The Defense Support Program (DSP) facility at Nurrungar, South Australia, was part of a constellation of geosynchronous satellites and ground tracking stations designed to detect the launch of ballistic missiles. Early warning of missile attack strengthened America's nuclear missile second strike capability, thereby strengthening nuclear deterrence. DSP later played a role in detecting Iraqi Scud missile launches during Operation Desert Storm. The Very Low Frequency (VLF) station involved in communications with American submarine deployments in the region at Northwest Cape, West Australia, and the signals intelligence collection facility at Pine Gap, Northern Territory, also played a key role in helping to maintain the bi-polar strategic balance of the cold war.

Because naturally occurring uranium lacks sufficient fissile 235 U to make fuel for commercial light-water reactors, the concentration of 235 U must be increased several times above its natural level of 0.7% in a uranium enrichment plant. A nuclear power plant operator or utility typically purchases yellowcake and contracts for its conversion to uranium hexafluoride, then enrichment, and finally fabrication into fuel elements. Australia exports its uranium after the mining and milling stage. Commercial enrichment services are available in the United States, Europe, Russia, and Japan.

In 1996, the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC, Inc.) signed an agreement for the development and licensing of SILEX technology for uranium enrichment. In 1999, the United States and Australia signed an agreement that allowed for the transfer of SILEX technology to the United States.

Howard argued that since Australia possesses the largest uranium reserves in the world, it would make economic sense to enrich uranium before exporting it, thereby adding to its value. John Carlson, director-general of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office, responded to press speculation at the time: \"there are a number of uncertainties, including Australia's lack of an established enrichment technology and the license costs for imported technology, whether there would be investors prepared to outlay the substantial capital costs involved, and whether a State government would be willing to host an enrichment facility.\" The present Australian government under the Labor Party appears to oppose building a uranium enrichment facility in Australia."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Uranium Mining and Milling", "paragraphs": ["Australia has the world's largest reserves of uranium, with an estimated 23% or more of total reserves, and is the world's third-largest exporter of uranium.

While advocates of nuclear power remain within the Liberal-National Coalition, it appears that there was less support for the nuclear option within the coalition after Howard's defeat in 2007 than there was while he was prime minister. The unpopularity of his position on nuclear power in the lead-up to the 2007 elections apparently forced Howard to modify his position. ", "As Australia has become increasingly concerned about carbon emissions, a new consideration of nuclear power has emerged from some advocates. The low cost of Australian coal, relative to the cost of nuclear energy, appears to be a contributing factor as to why nuclear power has not been pursued. Dr. Switkowski has argued that a cost of carbon of $15 to $40 per ton would make nuclear power viable for Australia. Switkowski currently heads the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization. Australia has been considering a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), which in April 2010 the Rudd government shelved until at least 2013. While the emissions trading scheme has been set aside for the moment, Australia continues to seek to reduce its carbon emissions. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
