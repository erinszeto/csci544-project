There are, however, some limited conflict of interest regulations and standards which look also to previous employment and past associations of those entering federal service. Additionally, in 2009, by Executive Order, certain \"appointees\" of President Obama must, during the Obama Administration, file an \"ethics pledge\" agreeing to further limitations on participating in governmental matters affecting some former employers and/or clients.

Such regulatory recusals are limited in time and generally apply to particular matters involving specific parties when entities or organizations previously affiliated with the federal official are now parties to or represent parties in those matters. There are also recusal requirements in regulations concerning such particular matters when a party (or one representing a party) had made an \"extraordinary payment\" to the official prior to the official's entry into government.

One who has already entered federal service may not, therefore, accept a salary supplementation from a business or organization intended to \"make up the difference\" between private sector and federal government salaries, or to otherwise reward or compensate the new federal employee for his or her public service. This statutory restriction originated in 1917 from an initial legislative concern over private foundations paying the compensation of persons who were serving under a cooperative agreement in the Bureau of Education within the Department of the Interior, and the undue and, to some, \"noxious\" influence of such foundations on national educational policy. The law at \u00a7209 has been described as a conflict of interest statute \"in the strictest sense,\" that is, an \"employee does not have to do anything improper in his office to violate the statute,\" but rather his or her special status as a government employee \"makes an unexceptionable act wrongful\u2014wrongful because of the potential dangers in serving two paymasters.\" The law thus seeks to assure that a federal employee is compensated for his or her services to the government only by the government, is not placed in a position of \"serving two masters,\" and is not, nor appears to be, beholden or grateful to any outside group or private interest which \"could affect the independent judgment of the employee.\" ", "This provision of criminal law at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 209 might come into play, therefore, regarding certain \"severance\" payments, packages, or plans from a former private employer to an individual who has entered federal service if there is evidenced an \"intent to compensate\" an individual for that person's federal employment. The provision is not as broad in its application to severance payments as it may seem at first glance, however, since the language of the statute applies expressly only to \"an officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States Government,\" and has been interpreted by the courts as applying only to persons who at the time payments were received were federal employees. That is, the restriction does not apply to severance payments which are made at the time one leaves or is contemplating leaving private employment, but before the individual actually becomes an officer or employee of the government. Even if the payment is made to reward the employee for taking a public service job, or is intended to or has the effect of instilling in the about-to-become-official a sense of gratitude or goodwill towards the private employer, there is apparently no violation of this criminal conflict of interest provision for severance payments made before one is a federal official, since federal employment status is an express element of the statute.

Pensions generally involve current payments or vested interests from a fund controlled by an outside entity, but in recognition of or as compensation for past services. There are thus questions raised as to whether an employee's vested interest in a pension is a current financial interest or association with or in the entity making the payment, subject to all of the disqualification restrictions and limitations on current and existing financial interests, or whether pensions are excluded from being a disqualifying interest of an employee. The issue under the statutory recusal requirement is, as stated by the Office of Government Ethics, the concern \"about an employee's participation in a Government matter that could have an effect on the sponsoring organization that is responsible for funding or maintaining the Government employee's pension plan.\" ", "In interpreting the law at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208 and the regulations under it, the Office of Government Ethics has distinguished between two common types of pension plans, the \"defined benefit plan,\" and the \"defined contribution plan.\" In a \"defined benefit plan,\" the employer typically \"makes payments to an investment pool which it holds and invests for all participating employees\"; and such plans are the \"obligation of the employer\" which pays the former employee an amount generally based on some percentage of what the employee's compensation had been. A \"defined contribution plan,\" however, typically involves contributions by the employer and/or the employee to a specific, individual retirement account, and the payout of income or annuity is based on the amounts, earnings, gains or losses generated by such account.", "The conflict of interest concerns thus generally arise more typically with a \"defined benefit plan\" type of pension where the employer itself is obligated to make the pension payments, but not so in a \"defined contribution plan\" where the pension payments come out of an already established and funded retirement account. For purposes of the statutory disqualification requirement, therefore, the Office of Government Ethics would not consider a \"defined contribution plan\" as a \"disqualifying\" financial interest of the employee: \"For matters affecting the sponsor of a defined contribution plan, an employee's interest is not ordinarily a disqualifying financial interest under section 208 because the sponsor is not obligated to fund the employee's pension plan.\"", "If the employee's pension is based on a \"defined benefit plan,\" then the Office of Government Ethics would consider such a pension as a current, disqualifying interest under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208, in some circumstances. A defined benefit plan will be considered a disqualifying interest in governmental matters relating to the sponsor of the employee's pension if the governmental matter involved is so significant to the pension's sponsor that it could actually affect the employee's pension plan, that is, that \"the matter would have a direct and predictable effect on the sponsor's ability or willingness to pay the employee's pension benefit,\" such as if the matter could result in \"the dissolution of the sponsor organization.\" OGE notes that in a practical sense, it is unlikely that a governmental matter will have such an effect on a private pension sponsor, since even large contracts worth, for example, $500,000 to a firm, would not materially affect a sizable corporation's ability to pay its pension obligations to former employees.", "In most cases it is therefore unlikely that a current interest in or receipt of payment from a pension plan, either a defined benefit or defined contribution plan, would trigger the broad statutory, criminal recusal or disqualification requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7208, for a federal employee as to the sponsor of his or her private pension; and the Office of Government Ethics has advised agencies to no longer \"automatically presume that employees have a conflict of interest in matters affecting the sponsor of their defined benefit plans.\" The private sponsor of a defined benefit pension plan would, however, for purposes of the regulatory \"impartiality\" requirement, be one with whom the federal employee has a \"covered relationship.\" In such a case, absent a disclosure to and authorization from the agency, the employee should therefore disqualify himself or herself concerning any official governmental matter which involves the sponsor of the pension plan as a \"specific party.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Obama Administration Appointees", "paragraphs": ["On January 21, 2009, President Obama issued an Executive Order requiring the signing of an \"ethics pledge\" by all presidential and vice presidential appointees to full-time, non-career positions in the executive branch, including all non-career SES appointees, and appointees to positions excepted from competitive service because they are of a confidential or policymaking nature (such as Schedule C appointments) The \"ethics pledge\" places two additional restrictions on such appointees entering the executive branch, with respect to their former employers or clients.", "Initially, such \"appointees\" may not participate in, and must recuse themselves for two years after entering federal service from any particular governmental matter involving specific parties when a former client or former employer of the appointee is a party to or represents a party in that particular matter. This extends a similar regulatory recusal and disqualification requirement applicable to all executive branch officials from one year to two years for such \"appointees.\"", "Secondly, any such \"appointees\" who were registered \"lobbyists\" prior to entering the executive branch, are under additional and further restrictions. Such appointees/former lobbyists may not, for two years after entering the government: (1) participate in any particular matter on which the appointee had lobbied within the two years prior to his or her appointment; (2) participate in the specific issue area in which that particular matter falls; or (3) seek or accept employment with any agency that the appointee had lobbied within the two years prior to entering government service.", "In a similar fashion as other disqualification rules and laws, this disqualification and recusal requirement of the \"ethics pledge\" may be waived in certain circumstances. A waiver may be granted when the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Counsel to the President, provides a written waiver that the strict application of the provision is inconsistent with its purposes, or when such a waiver \"is in the public interest to grant.\"", "A further restriction on \"lobbyists\" serving in federal positions was announced by the Obama Administration in September of 2009, explaining the Administration's intention to prohibit federally registered lobbyists from serving on federal advisory boards and commissions used by federal executive agencies and officials. This position was made a formal policy of the Administration in a Presidential Memorandum to the heads of executive agencies and departments on June 18, 2010, in which the heads of agencies and departments were instructed not to reappoint or appoint federally registered lobbyists to \"advisory committees and other boards and commissions.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Divestiture", "paragraphs": ["There is no federal statute which expressly implements a general, over-all requirement for federal employees to divest particular private assets or holdings to resolve likely or potential conflicts of interest with employees' public duties. Occasionally, a statutory provision, often the organic act establishing an agency, bureau, or commission, will provide expressly that the directors or board members of such entities shall have no financial interests in the business or sector which the agency, bureau, or commission is to regulate or oversee. Furthermore, an agency may by regulation prohibit or restrict the ownership of certain financial assets or class of assets by its officers and employees where, because of the mission of the agency, such interests would \"cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality and objectivity with which agency programs are administered.\" In such instances, these statutory and regulatory provisions would, in their effect, require the divestiture of particular assets and holdings of certain individuals to be appointed to such positions or who are incumbents in such positions.", "Although there is no general statutory divestiture requirement, the divestiture of assets, properties, or holdings may be required as a conflict of interest avoidance mechanism by administrative provisions and oversight, as well as by a Senate committee or the Senate as a whole as a condition of favorable action on a presidential nominee requiring Senate confirmation. As noted earlier, the principal statutory method of conflict of interest avoidance, with respect to particular assets and holdings of a federal official, is to require the disqualification of that official from a governmental matter affecting those financial interests. However, under current regulations of the Office of Government Ethics, as part of the ethics review process, an agency may require the divestiture of certain assets of an individual employee where those interests would require the employee's disqualification from matters so central to his or her job that it would impair the employee's ability to perform his or her duties, or where it could adversely affect the agency's mission because another employee could not easily be substituted for the disqualified employee. When divestiture is required for ethics reasons, a current employee should be afforded a \"reasonable amount of time\" to effectuate the disposal of the asset; furthermore, it is possible to ameliorate potential unfair tax burdens that may arise because of such required sale of an asset by receiving a certificate of divestiture and postponing capital gains taxes.", "In some instances, a \"qualified blind trust\" may be used to avoid a conflict of interest as an alternative to \"divestiture.\" While the underlying assets in a trust in which one has a beneficial interest must normally be disclosed in annual public financial disclosure reports, and would generally be \"financial interests\" of the employee/beneficiary for disqualification purposes, federal officials may, as a conflict of interest avoidance measure, place certain assets with an independent trustee in what is called a \"qualified blind trust.\" The nature of a \"blind trust,\" generally, is such that the official will have no control over, will receive no communications about, and will (eventually as existing assets are sold and new ones obtained by the trustee) have no knowledge of the identity of the specific assets held in the trust. As such, an official will not need to identify and disclose the particular assets in the corpus of a \"blind trust\" in future financial disclosure reports, and such assets will not be \"financial interests\" of the employee for disqualification purposes. The conflict of interest theory under which the blind trust provisions operate is that since the official will not know the identity of the specific assets in the trust, those assets and financial interests could not influence the official decisions and governmental duties of the reporting official, thus avoiding potential conflict of interest problems or appearances. Assets originally placed into the trust by the official will be known to that official, and therefore will continue to be \"financial interests\" of the public official for conflict of interest purposes until the trustee notifies the official \"that such asset has been disposed of, or has a value of less than $1,000.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Note on General \"Impartiality,\" Alleged \"Bias,\" and Past Affiliations or Activities", "paragraphs": ["The standards of conduct regulations promulgated by the Office of Government Ethics and derived from Executive Orders, provide generally that an employee in the executive branch must \"act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any organization or individual.\" As to past associations, the Office of Government Ethics has noted that \"It has long been recognized that former employment with a private organization can raise impartiality concerns. Members of the public, the press, and even the Congress sometimes have questioned whether a particular public official might be subject to continuing influence by a former employer.\" The \"general principles\" in the OGE regulations regarding financial interests and connections, outside employment or activities, and \"impartiality,\" are fleshed out and covered in the more specific regulations promulgated by OGE. Although the basic impartiality language is fairly broad on its face, the \"impartiality\" actually required of a federal employee in a governmental matter by the specific conflict of interest and federal ethics standards, is a disinterestedness in the matter from the point of view of any financial impact that such a matter may have upon the employee personally, or upon certain entities, persons, or organizations which are closely associated with the employee, such that the financial interests of such entities or persons may be fairly \"imputed\" to the employee. As noted by the Office of Government Ethics,", "Questions regarding impartiality necessarily arise when an employee's official duties impact upon the employee's own financial interests or those of certain other persons, such as the employee's spouse or minor child.", "Thus, while past employment or other past professional affiliations or connections to private entities may suggest conflict of interest concerns and trigger certain restrictions under regulations, the current ethical standards of conduct and conflict of interest rules do not necessarily imply a prohibited \"favoritism\" or \"impartiality\" by the mere fact of past employments or past professional associations or positions beyond those past employment connections that are specifically covered and dealt with in the regulatory disqualification restrictions. That is, no matter how philosophically predisposed an administrative official may arguably seem towards an issue because of his or her professional or employment background, a specific \"bias\" or \"partiality\" in a decision cannot be gleaned, as a matter of federal law, merely by the past associations and /or past employment of a federal regulatory or administrative official beyond the specific regulatory restrictions.", "In general, the \"impartiality\" required of a federal employee in a matter does not mean that every federal employee must be completely \"neutral\" on an issue or matter before him or her, in the sense that the employee has no opinion, view, position, or predilection on a matter based either on past associations, or based upon current noneconomic factors such as the ethical, religious, ideological, or political beliefs in the background or in the current affiliations of the employee. In the specific regulations on \"impartiality\" and participation in outside organizations, in fact, the Office of Government Ethics notes, \"Nothing in this section shall be construed to suggest that an employee should not participate in a matter because of his political, religious or moral views.\"", "As to the issue of \"bias\" or \"impartiality\" generally in decision making of federal officials, federal cases dealing with the alleged bias of a federal official have arisen on occasion in a \"due process\" context with respect to rule making of an agency. In such cases there had been alleged a lack of due process or fairness in the agency proceeding because of some claimed \"bias\" of a federal agency official. The courts have found, however, that when a federal official is not acting in an adjudicatory capacity, that is, in a similar position as a judge, then judicial standards of impartiality need not apply. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has noted: \"We must not impose judicial roles upon administrators when they perform functions very different from those of judges.\" The disqualification requirement for those who are part of formal adjudications was \"never intended ... to apply in a rulemaking procedure,\" even a formal rulemaking procedure. In an earlier case in the District of Columbia Circuit, the court had explained,", "Agencies are required to consider in good faith, and to objectively evaluate, arguments presented to them; agency officials, however, need not be subjectively impartial.", "Going beyond specific statutory or regulatory restrictions on employees' economic interests and attempting to judicially apply very broad bias or impartiality standards upon regulators and administrators beyond those standards, noted one court, \"is to invite challenges to officials based not upon true conflicts of interest but upon their philosophical or ideological leanings.... \" Limiting \"conflict of interest\" regulation to current personal financial interests of employees\u2014and the financial interests of those imputed to the employee\u2014may also ameliorate some First Amendment issues regarding attempts to regulate the outside, private associations, memberships, or organizational activities of public employees. While there could be concerns raised about general notions of \"bias\" or partiality in a governmental function based on alleged associations, past or present, of particular employees involved in a particular matter, issues involving the ethics and conflict provisions in internal governmental standards of conduct regulations are generally not amenable to legal resolution by private litigants. That is, those regulations do not raise an actionable standard for litigation by outside private parties, but rather are generally considered internal, discretionary or disciplinary matters within the agency."], "subsections": []}]}}
