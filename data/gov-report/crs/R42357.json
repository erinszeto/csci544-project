The 112th Congress faces reauthorization of the current five-year farm bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246) because many of its provisions expire in 2012. The 2008 law contained 15 titles covering farm commodity support, horticulture, livestock, conservation, nutrition assistance, international food aid, trade, agricultural research, farm credit, rural development, bioenergy, and forestry, among others. The breadth of farm bills has steadily grown in recent decades to include new and expanding food and agricultural interests. The omnibus nature of the bill can create broad coalitions of support among sometimes conflicting interests for policies that individually might not survive the legislative process. This breadth also can stir fierce competition for available funds, particularly among producers of different commodities, or between those who have differing priorities for farm subsidies, conservation, nutrition, or other programs.", "One of the principal drivers of the farm bill debate will be the federal budget, which is more uncertain and difficult to predict than for past farm bills because of the congressional attention to deficit reduction. According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, if ongoing programs were to continue under current law, mandatory farm bill spending would be $994 billion over 10 years, with domestic nutrition assistance accounting for more than three-fourths of the total and the rest primarily for the farm safety net (commodity support and crop insurance) and conservation. How much of this baseline can be used to write a farm bill is unknown, given the uncertainty about deficit reduction that is beyond the control of the authorizing committees and may not be resolved for months. Several high-profile congressional and Administration proposals for deficit reduction are specifically targeting agricultural programs with mandatory funding, and the possibility of budget sequestration early next year further clouds the budget picture. Also, disaster assistance, most bioenergy programs, and some conservation programs expire without any baseline beyond their expiration date.", "Traditionally, the primary focus of omnibus farm bills has been farm commodity price and income support policy\u2014namely, the methods and levels of support that the federal government provides to agricultural producers. The 2008 farm bill combined counter-cyclical support with direct payments available primarily to growers of grains, cotton, and peanuts, regardless of farm commodity market prices. Proponents of the current approach to farm commodity support want a stronger safety net, with many focusing on enhancements to risk management tools such as crop insurance as a substitute for direct payments. Some opponents of the status quo cite the thriving farm economy as a reason for reducing federal support. Others point to competing policy priorities, including equitability concerns across the farm sector, and call for enhanced support for small and medium-sized farms, specialty crops, organic agriculture, local and regional food systems, healthy and nutritious foods, research, conservation, and rural development, among others.", "Leaders of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees anticipate having a new farm bill completed before the end of this session.

These policies can be, and sometimes are, modified or overhauled as freestanding authorizing legislation, or as part of other laws. However, periodic farm bills have provided Congress, the Administration, and interest groups with an opportunity to reexamine agriculture and food issues more carefully, and address them more comprehensively.", "The most recent omnibus farm bill is the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-246 , the 2008 farm bill), and many of its provisions expire in 2012. Without new legislation, notably in the area of farm commodity support programs, permanent statutes would take effect. Most of these statutes were enacted decades ago and are no longer compatible with current national economic objectives, global trading rules, and federal budgetary or regulatory policies. These largely outdated permanent laws have been kept on the books by Congress in part to compel increasingly urban and suburban future Congresses to pay attention to national agricultural policy. For most other topics addressed in the farm bill, the authority to appropriate funds would end, and in some cases all program authority could terminate.", "Traditionally, the primary focus of every omnibus farm bill has been farm commodity price and income support policy\u2014namely, the methods and levels of support that the federal government provides to agricultural producers. However, farm bills typically include titles on agricultural trade and foreign food aid, conservation and environment, forestry, domestic food assistance, agricultural credit, rural development, agricultural research and education, animal agriculture, and marketing-related programs, among others. In recent farm bills, titles have been added to address emerging issues such as agriculture-based biofuels, specialty crops (fruits and vegetables), and organic agriculture. (See the Appendix at the end of this report for a complete list of titles and subtitles of the 2008 farm bill.)", "The omnibus nature of the farm bill creates a broad coalition of support among sometimes conflicting interests for policies that, individually, might not survive the legislative process. Among the groups lobbying Congress are farm and commodity organizations; input suppliers; commodity handlers, processors, exporters, retailers, foreign customers, and competitors; universities and scientific organizations; domestic consumers and food assistance advocates; environmentalists; local and regional producers; and rural communities, to name a few. So, for example, farm state lawmakers may seek urban legislators' backing for commodity price supports in exchange for votes on domestic food aid\u2014and vice versa.", "Farm bill titles also are growing increasingly integrated. The conservation title, for example, includes provisions that affect commodity programs, and some of the commodity provisions likewise affect conservation. This integration means that one cannot simply look at a single title for all provisions that affect the topic of the title.", "As the 112 th Congress considers reauthorization of the next farm bill, it does so in an economic setting of high farm commodity prices and income and an austere federal budget that calls for deficit reduction. This combination of events has drawn into question whether the current farm safety net should be restructured or portions eliminated (e.g., direct payments), with the limited available financial resources possibly redirected to other initiatives.

Mandatory spending in the farm bill is primarily authorized for the farm commodity programs, crop insurance, nutrition assistance programs, and some conservation and trade programs. Discretionary spending (i.e., spending subject to annual appropriations) is authorized for essentially everything else, including other conservation programs, most rural development programs, research and education programs, and agricultural credit. Various smaller research, bioenergy, and rural development programs sometimes secure some mandatory funding, but most of their funding is discretionary.", "In addition to determining the policy direction for farm bill programs, the farm bill also \"pays\" for mandatory spending when it is used. This is done under the jurisdiction of authorizing committees, using resources available under budget rules. On the other hand, discretionary programs that are authorized in the farm bill are paid for separately in annual appropriations bills under the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) develops baseline projections for mandatory spending (direct spending) under the supervision of the House and Senate Budget Committees within a framework of various budget enforcement laws. This process sets the mandatory budget for the farm bill. The baseline projection is an estimate at a particular point in time of what federal spending on mandatory programs likely would be under current law. From a budget perspective, programs with a continuing baseline are assumed to go on under current law, and have their own funding if policymakers want them to continue. However, some programs may not be assumed to continue in the budget baseline beyond the end of a farm bill, and can continue only if their cost is offset. ", "The baseline thus serves as a benchmark or starting point for the farm bill budget. When new provisions are introduced that affect mandatory spending, their impact (or \"score\") is measured as a difference from the baseline. Increases in cost above the baseline may be subject to budget constraints such as pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements. Reductions from the baseline may be used to offset other provisions or to reduce the deficit.", "The January 2012 CBO baseline for continuing mandatory farm bill programs is about $994 billion for the 10-year period FY2013-FY2022 ( Figure 1 ). Most of this baseline ($772 billion, or 78%) is for domestic nutrition assistance programs, primarily the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The rest, about $222 billion, is divided among various agriculture-related programs, primarily crop insurance ($90 billion), farm commodity price and income supports ($62 billion), and conservation ($65 billion). These estimates do not include any reductions for sequestration (across-the-board cuts). CBO will issue an updated baseline in March 2012 that will become the official scoring baseline for a potential 2012 farm bill.", "The budget situation is more difficult and uncertain this year than for past farm bills because of the attention to the federal debt. How much of the above baseline can be used to write a farm bill and how much will remain for 2013 and beyond is unknown, given the uncertainty about deficit reduction that is beyond the control of the agriculture committees and may not be resolved for months. Several high-profile congressional and administration proposals for deficit reduction are specifically targeting agricultural programs with mandatory funding. To date, none of these plans has been enacted ( Table 2 ). Discretionary appropriations for agricultural programs also have fallen in recent years, further affecting farm bill opportunities. The discretionary agriculture appropriation decreased by 14% in FY2011 and another 2% in FY2012.", "More imminently, given the failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to enact budget reductions by January 15, 2012, budget sequestration is forthcoming in 2013 under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 , Sec. 302). The budget sequestration process under the BCA will reduce the future baseline for farm bill programs, even if legislation is not enacted to specifically change or reduce the programs. Certain farm bill programs, such as the nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program, are statutorily exempt from sequestration. Other programs, including prior obligations in crop insurance and marketing loan contracts, may be exempt; however, CBO does not determine the official sequestration amount or the scope of programs included. Those decisions rest with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) interpretation of the BCA and statutes, and are still forthcoming. No official estimate has been released, but many believe sequestration of mandatory farm bill programs may total about $16 billion over 10 years. This is consistent with CBO estimates of nearly 8% sequestration on nondefense mandatory programs on roughly $200 billion of nonexempt agriculture baseline.", "The budget picture is further clouded by other factors. While some programs (like most farm subsidies and nutrition assistance) have assumed future funding, other programs (mostly newer ones) do not. Thirty-seven programs that received mandatory funding throughout nearly all titles of the 2008 farm bill do not continue to have assured funding for the next farm bill. Three of these programs\u2014the agricultural disaster assistance program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, and the Biomass Crop Assistance Program\u2014account for about three-fourths of the affected amount. Continuing these programs could cost about $10 billion over five years, an additional cost that would need to be offset from other programs. This could be doubly difficult during a simultaneous contraction from sequestration or deficit reduction. Also, new pay-as-you-go budget rules enacted in 2010 ( P.L. 111-139 ) restrict some of the budget-related maneuvers that were used in past farm bills to offset new spending.", "Consequently, even a \"simple\" extension of the 2008 farm bill may be challenging given the current budgetary pressures. The desire by many to redesign farm policy and reallocate the remaining farm bill baseline\u2014in a post-sequestration and/or post-deficit reduction environment\u2014is driving much of the farm bill debate this year. Political dynamics regarding sequestration and achieving broader deficit reduction goals leave open difficult questions about how much and when the farm bill baseline may be reduced. Thus, in an era of deficit reduction, Congress faces difficult choices about how much total support to provide for agriculture, and how to allocate that support among competing constituencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Farm Economy and International Environment", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. agricultural sector has been thriving economically since the mid-2000s, as rising commodity prices and land values have pushed farm incomes to record levels and reduced debt and debt-to-asset ratios to historically low levels.

", "In contrast to the farm economy, the general U.S. economy slowed again in 2011, with considerable uncertainty heading into 2012. As a result, U.S. consumers have been very cautious in their spending behavior. The major drivers behind the robust farm income projections have been strong U.S. agricultural exports (including the outlook for a record $136.3 billion in 2011, up 18%), and continued growth in the U.S. corn ethanol industry (mandated by federal usage requirements and high petroleum prices). This demand-led surge, aided in part by a weak dollar, has drawn down stocks for major grains and oilseeds to historically low levels in both domestic and global markets, thus supporting higher commodity prices.", "International trade remains a bright spot for U.S. agriculture despite the lack of success in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations (conducted under the auspices of the World Trade Organization). U.S. trade officials hope to further expand export opportunities for U.S. agricultural products upon implementation of three free trade agreements (FTAs)\u2014with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia\u2014signed by the President on October 21, 2011.", "Robust economic growth in major global markets (particularly in China) is expected to continue to support strong demand for cotton, feed grains, oilseeds, and livestock products heading into 2012. Meanwhile, continued growth in U.S. corn-based ethanol production and strong livestock prices are expected to support corn and other crop prices near current high levels as they compete for a fixed amount of cropland. These high commodity prices have shut off government payments under price-contingent programs such as the marketing loan program and the counter-cyclical payments program.", "As a whole, the U.S. agricultural sector remains in a strong financial position relative to the rest of the U.S. economy. However, there is substantial regional variation. In general, increases in feed, fuel, and fertilizer expenses will affect livestock producers more harshly than crop producers. Although cash grain farmers in the Corn Belt and Northern Plains are experiencing record revenues, livestock and poultry feeders are experiencing record-high feed costs that have narrowed profit margins. In addition, a severe drought in the Southwest that extended into the Central Plains and the Southeast during the summer of 2011 limited grazing opportunities and hay production for cattle ranchers in the affected regions and led to substantial herd liquidation. As a result, even if weather returns to normal in the affected regions, the livestock sector will continue to feel the effects of the drought into 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Farm Safety Net Programs", "paragraphs": ["The federal government supports farm income and helps farmers manage risks associated with variability in crop yields and prices through a collection of programs.

Federal crop insurance has expanded over the decades, with expanded commodity coverage and increased producer subsidies.

For producers, land retirement programs are attractive because they receive rental payments at acceptable levels. However, with high commodity prices and incentives to plant crops, producer interest in land retirement may be declining. Some predict that high commodity price levels may continue for the foreseeable future, thus shrinking farmer interest in land retirement for some time. Also, increased commodity prices can lead to increased land rental rates, which in turn increases the cost of land retirement programs. These factors could signal a shift in farm bill conservation policy away from the traditional land retirement programs toward conservation working lands programs\u2014programs that keep land in production while encouraging conservation practices to address natural resource concerns.

There is some discussion that the next farm bill may raise the indirect cost limitation even further, potentially to 30%.

Some local producers also see this as a potential new market for their agricultural products. Secretary Tom Vilsack's recently announced Regional Innovation Initiative is built around five \"pillars\" for economic development: broadband, biofuels and biobased economic development, linkages between local and regional food production, ecosystem markets development, and forest restoration and land conservation.

For example, regularly tweaking the definition of \"rural\" to determine eligibility for certain programs seems unlikely to produce significantly improved economic development outcomes. A greater emphasis on the socioeconomic relations between rural communities and urban areas within a regional context could lay the foundation for more successful rural (and regional) development outcomes.

", "Application processes for program loans and grants can be a barrier for many rural projects, especially those in smaller, poorer rural areas. The way assistance is currently provided (mostly through direct and guaranteed loans) has limitations because it is too often driven by individual projects, rather than integrated into an overall development strategy. Very limited funding for rural and regional planning efforts can weaken the development outcomes of projects. Many rural communities may benefit from technical assistance support for strategic planning. Interagency coordination among federal agencies that target rural areas (e.g., Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Health and Human Services) is haphazard at best and could be significantly improved.
