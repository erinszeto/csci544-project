On November 23, 2010, the federal government released a peer-reviewed \"Technical Document\" that further explained how the estimates were derived, and in some cases, modified the initial estimates. The oil budget estimates divide the released oil into seven categories, accounting for the following percentages of the total oil released. These categories generally fall into three groups:", "1. Human intervention: direct recovery from the well (17%), in situ burning (5%), skimmed (3%), chemically dispersed (16%). 2. Natural Processes: naturally dispersed (13%), evaporated or dissolved (24%). 3. Other (22%): refers to the oil remaining after subtracting the above estimates from the total estimated release; possible fates include remaining in the water column, settling to the sea floor, mixing with sediment, ingested by microbes, or collected during shore cleanup activities.", "Direct observation and measurement of the fate of the vast majority of the estimated 200 million gallons of oil presents a considerable challenge. In some cases, the estimates used to calculate these percentages contain considerable uncertainty.

The incident produced the largest oil spill that has occurred in U.S. waters, eclipsing the magnitude of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill after four to five days. The spill spanned approximately 84 days, and following several attempts, responders gained control of the oil discharge on July 15, 2010. Based on the most recent estimate from the federal government's Flow Rate Technical Group, the deepwater well ultimately released more than 200 million gallons (or 4.9 million barrels) of crude oil (see \"Well Flow Rate Estimates\" below). The uncertainty range of this estimate (+/-10%) is equivalent to two Exxon Valdez -size spills in either direction.", "Following the well's containment, satellite data began to reveal decreasing daily quantities of oil on the ocean's surface. (See Appendix for a snapshot of satellite analyses from selected days during the spill.) According to the federal government's GeoPlatform database, August 20, 2010, was the first day since the spill's start in which no oil was observed on the ocean's surface.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Composition of the Oil", "paragraphs": ["The chemical composition of oil plays a critical role in how it reacts in an environment. The 2010 Gulf spill involved crude oil, which is not a homogenous material, but contains a mixture of chemical compounds that interact differently when exposed to the environment. According to a 2003 National Research Council report, evaporation can remove about one-third of the volume of a medium crude oil slick within the first day of a release. However, other components of the crude oil may persist for much longer. For instance, the fraction of crude oil that is water soluble can persist for weeks to years. Other portions of spilled crude oil often form into tar balls, which are persistent and may be transported great distances from the release site. The crude oil released during the 2010 spill is relatively lighter than other crude oil, and thus may evaporate more readily. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Natural Processes", "paragraphs": ["When oil enters a marine environment it encounters an array of natural processes that transport the oil from its point of origin and alter its physical and chemical makeup. These combined physical and chemical changes are often described as \"weathering.\" The altered materials will be incorporated into the planet's various natural systems: water, soil, air, or living organisms. The time involved in these changes can range from a matter of minutes and hours for some crude oil components to years (possibly decades) for other components. Figure 2 illustrates the processes and pathways involved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Location of Spill", "paragraphs": ["The location of an oil release plays a significant role in determining the oil's fate. Various attributes of an affected marine environment will influence the degree to which natural processes (identified above) interact with the introduced oil. For example, warmer water temperatures will generally expedite some natural processes, such as evaporation, biodegradation, and dissolution. ", "Severe weather events, which are common during the Gulf's hurricane season, could also influence an oil spill's fate. For example, a storm event may transport oil to sensitive locations or cause settled oil to become resuspended in the water column. Moreover, in the Deepwater Horizon incident, severe weather events can impede human response activities or allow oil to breach manmade barriers (e.g., booms).", "The 2010 Gulf spill presented a unique combination of location factors that likely played a part in the oil's fate. First, the origin of the release occurred at a water depth of approximately 5,000 feet. According to the 2003 National Research Council report, this type of scenario introduces a number of complications compared to oil released at the surface (e.g., from a tanker spill). Although some research has found that the majority of oil from a deepwater release will reach the surface in several hours, the resulting surface slick may be thinner (compared to a typical surface spill), because some of the oil will be naturally diffused and dispersed as it rises to the surface. Second, the oil well blowout was a multi-day event, discharging the oil into the Gulf waters at a rapid rate. Some have surmised that this high-speed discharge increased the rate at which the oil naturally dispersed. Third, some initial scientific studies have suggested that microbial organisms, which essentially eat certain oil components, may play a part in controlling the oil's ultimate fate (discussed below). "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Intervention", "paragraphs": ["In the 2010 Gulf spill, responders employed a combination of mechanical removal (e.g., booming and skimming), in situ burning, and surface and sub-surface chemical dispersant application to remove the oil from the open waters of the Gulf. These applications yield different consequences for the oil's fate. Mechanical removal essentially takes a portion of the surface oil out of the environment. In situ burning removes the oil from the marine environment, but may transfer some of the pollution risk to the air. Particulate matter (PM) from in situ burning is \"considered by most health professionals to be the main combustion product to investigate and monitor.\" During the oil spill, EPA monitored for PM at the shoreline and found the levels to be consistent with Gulf Coast summertime levels.", "Use of chemical dispersants in response to the Gulf spill has received considerable attention. Dispersants are chemical agents that enhance the breakup of an oil slick into small oil droplets that mix with the water column. Dispersant application does not reduce the amount of oil entering the environment; instead, dispersants alter the physical properties of oil, changing its transport, fate, and potential effects. In general, a decision to use dispersants poses trade-offs for oil spill responders. The objective of dispersant use is to minimize the amount of surface oil that reaches shoreline habitats, where it threatens a wide range of animals and plants. The downside is that dispersants increase water column organisms' exposure to oil. As stated in a 2005 National Research Council study, \"[d]ispersant application thus represents a conscious decision to increase the hydrocarbon load (resulting from a spill) on one component of the ecosystem (e.g., water column) while reducing the load on another (e.g., coastal wetland).\"", "Federal responders authorized the use of approximately 1.8 million gallons of dispersants in the Gulf. Approximately 42% of this dispersant volume was applied at the point where oil was escaping the wellhead, an unprecedented sub-surface application. Excepting a relatively minor application on July 19, dispersant use halted when the well was sealed on July 15. While dispersants have proven effective in breaking up the oil, impacts from the chemically dispersed oil (and the chemical dispersants) are unknown.

On November 23, 2010, the federal government released a peer-reviewed \"Technical Document\" that further explained how the estimates were derived; in some cases, the November document modified the August estimates. The Technical Document explained that the oil budget estimates were and will continue to be used for operational and response purposes, not to track the final fate of the spilled oil. Although the November Technical Document stresses this point in its text, the August oil budget estimates appear to have been used exactly for this latter purpose."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Oil Budget Categories", "paragraphs": ["The August and November oil budget estimates describe the oil as being in one of seven categories, which can be placed into three groups: human intervention, natural processes, and other.

Of the seven categories, this quantity\u2014820,000 barrels (~34 million gallons)\u2014is the only category based on direct measurement and is thus the most precise figure, accounting for 17% of the total estimated release. Burned: The Oil Budget estimates that responders burned 260,000 barrels (~11 million gallons) of oil in situ \u20145% of the total estimated release. The Oil Budget states that the authors used American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) burn rate standards in their calculations, with different rates for non-emulsified and emulsified oil. Skimmed: Although the estimate of skimmed oil is based on an actual measurement\u2014barrels of oil/water mixtures collected\u2014the estimate is a \"rough calculation\" due to the uncertainty of net oil in the oily water. Measurements of oil-water ratios were not available, so the oil budget authors based skimmer performance on sea conditions, nature of the oil, and past experience. The oil budget estimate is 160,000 barrels (~6.7 million gallons)\u20143% of the total estimated release.

This estimate represents a near doubling (88%) compared to the August document, by far the most the most significant modification. The authors note that the original estimate was conservative, and now represents the low end of the estimate range. The range of uncertainty for chemically dispersed oil dwarfs the uncertainties for other categories ( Figure 5 ). The Technical Document states: \"Estimating effectiveness of these dispersant operations was the most difficult challenge in constructing the Budget Calculator, given the present state of oil response technology.\" In particular, experts could not reach an agreement on the underlying assumption for subsurface application.

The authors define dispersed oil as droplets smaller than 100 micron (approximately the diameter of a human hair). The Technical Document's discussion of the natural dispersion calculation suggests this estimate is based on several assumptions. Although the Technical Document data used to generate the uncertainty ranges in Figure 5 showed no uncertainty range for the \"naturally dispersed\" category, the text of the Technical document discusses an uncertainty factor for both natural subsurface and natural surface dispersion. The reason for this apparent omission is not specified.

The authors state that they achieved this estimate by applying an evaporation rate specific to the type of oil released to the amount of oil estimated to have reached the surface (and not removed through in situ burning). Although the evaporation and dissolution processes are lumped together, the evaporation process likely dominates this grouping. According to a 2003 National Research Council report, medium crude oil can lose up to 40% of its volume within a few days. By contrast, \"dissolution accounts for only a small portion of oil loss.\" However, the Oil Budget Technical Document indicates that dissolution likely played a larger role in the Gulf spill than typical surface spills: \"because of the nature and depth of the release, dissolution of oil into the water column was a significant weathering factor.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other", "paragraphs": ["The \"other\" category is essentially the portion that remains after subtracting the above category measurements/estimates from the total amount of oil estimated to have released.

Although some of the data indicate concentrations of oil in the water column before the oil spill occurred (thus providing some background information), more extensive pre-spill data are needed to indicate the degree to which samples with detectable PAH levels are typically found in the Gulf.
