On December 19, 2007, Congress completed action on the act, and it was signed into law by President Bush on December 26, 2007. Previously, action had been completed on only one of the regular appropriations acts, the Defense Appropriations Act, FY2008 (P.L. 110-116) which was signed into law by President Bush on November 13, 2007. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 provides appropriations covered in the eleven outstanding appropriations acts. To ensure continuity of government operations, Congress had passed four continuing resolutions (P.L. 110-92, P.L. 110-116 Division B, P.L. 110-137, and P.L. 110-149) that provided funding for all agencies that had not received appropriations from the beginning of FY2008 through passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act.", "The Bush Administration requested $142.7 billion in federal research and development (R&D) funding for FY2008.

It also falls short of the authorization levels set by Congress that put R&D funding for these agencies on a seven-year doubling pace. Funding for DOE's Office of Science increased by 5.8% in FY2008 to $4.0 billion. NIST's core laboratory programs increased 1.4% in FY2008 to $441 million. Total FY2008 funding for NSF was increased by 2.5%.

Total funding for NIST increased by 11.7% in FY2008 to $755.8 million due in large measure to increases in its construction budget. NASA's FY2008 R&D budget increased to $12.8 billion, a 7.5% increase over FY2007, due primarily to increases in two initiatives: the international space station and the crew launch vehicle/crew exploration vehicle combination. FY2008 research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) funding for the Department of Defense increased by 1.1%. DOD's science and technology research programs received $12.8 billion for FY2008, though DOD had requested $10.8 billion.

The federal government has played an important role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies, from jet aircraft and the Internet to defenses against disease and communications satellites. Most of the research funded by the federal government is in support of specific activities of the federal government as reflected in the unique missions of the funding agencies. The federal government has become the largest supporter of long term fundamental basic research, primarily because the private sector asserts it cannot capture an adequate return on long-term fundamental research investments. Some of the major agencies funding basic research include the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Department of Defense (DOD).", "The Bush Administration requested $142.7 billion in federal R&D funding for FY2008. Total R&D funding for FY2008 is approximately $142.7 billion, a 1.2% increase over the enacted FY2007 total of $141.1 billion. Funding for FY2008 is provided for in the Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-116 ), signed into law by President Bush on November 13, 2007, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ), signed into law on December 26, 2007. P.L. 110-161 provides funding covered in the eleven appropriations acts on which action had not been completed.", "The President's FY2008 proposed R&D increase over the FY2007 funding level was due primarily to requested increases for NASA's space vehicles development program, the Department of Defense, and continuation of the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI). While NASA received increased funding for the International Space Station ($2.2 billion, up 24.6%) and the Constellation program (3.0 billion, up 17.3%), DOD and the ACI did not receive the increases requested by the President. The President's proposed FY2008 increase for DOD RDT&E funding resulted almost entirely from its request for $3.9 billion for RDT&E in support of its Global War on Terror (GWOT) initiative. Congress chose not to address the GWOT request in P.L. 110-116 or P.L. 110-161 , and has not completed action on separate legislation.", "The ACI was proposed by President Bush in response to growing concerns about America's ability to compete in the global market place. The $136 billion ACI funding request included $50 billion for additional research, science education, and the modernization of research infrastructure from FY2007 through FY2016. These funds were intended to double physical sciences and engineering research in three agencies\u2014NSF, DOE's Office of Science, and NIST\u2014over ten years. Congress established authorization levels for FY2008-2010 that would put funding for R&D at these agencies on track to double in approximately seven years. However, FY2008 R&D funding provided in P.L. 110-161 for these agencies falls below these doubling targets. Total FY2008 funding for NSF was increased by 2.5%, though NSF's research and related activities increased by only 1.1%. The DOE Office of Science received a 5.8% increase for FY2008. NIST's FY2008 core laboratory R&D increased by 1.4%. The NIST construction and research facilities account increased 173.4% to $160.5 million in FY2008. In addition, the ACI proposed $86 billion to finance a revised and permanent Research and Experimentation (R&E) tax credit over the 10-year period. Action to make the R&E tax credit permanent was not completed in 2007, nor was the credit extended. As a result, the R&E tax credit expired at the end of calendar year 2007.", "Funding levels for three federal multiagency research initiatives varied in the President's FY2008 request.

The final appropriation was $4.018 billion, $380 million less than the request but an increase of 6% from FY2007.", "Within the Office of Science, the final amounts for several major programs were significantly different from either the request or the House and Senate amounts. In basic energy sciences, the request was a $248 million increase, mostly to expand facility operating time. The House provided the requested amount, and the Senate committee recommended an additional $12 million increase, but in the final appropriation, basic energy sciences received only $20 million more than in FY2007. The request for fusion energy sciences was a $109 million increase, almost entirely for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The House and the Senate committee both provided approximately the requested amount, but the final appropriation was $141 million less than requested, with zero funding for the U.S. contribution to ITER. For high energy physics, the House and the Senate committee both provided the requested amount, but the final appropriation was $94 million less, which led to announcements of layoffs at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).", "The requested funding for DOE national security R&D was $3.132 billion, a 3% decrease. Most of the reduction resulted from the scheduled completion of construction projects, most notably the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The request included $89 million for the reliable replacement warhead (RRW) program. The House provided $3.245 billion, including increases for nonproliferation and verification R&D, environmental cleanup technology development, and inertial confinement fusion, but no funding for the RRW. The Senate committee recommended $3.285 billion, including increases in the same areas and partial funding for the RRW. The Senate report noted that the committee was divided on the RRW and called for a bipartisan congressional commission \"to evaluate and make recommendations on the role of nuclear weapons in our future strategic posture.\" The final appropriation was $3.199 billion, with increases for nonproliferation and verification R&D and inertial confinement fusion that were between the House and Senate amounts, no increase for environmental cleanup technology development, and no funds for the RRW.", "The request for DOE energy R&D was $2.252 billion, up 3% from FY2007. Within this total, R&D on nuclear, hydrogen, biomass, and solar energy were to increase, while geothermal and natural gas and oil technology programs were to be terminated. The requested $249 million increase for nuclear energy R&D was mostly for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. For energy R&D overall, the House provided $437 million more than the request, and the Senate committee recommended $533 million more than the request. Both included additional funds for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and fossil energy, and both included smaller increases than requested in nuclear energy, with less emphasis on the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative.

The appropriation primarily supports the development of the nation's future military hardware and software and the technology base upon which those products rely.", "Nearly all of what DOD spends on RDT&E is appropriated in Title IV of the defense appropriation bill (see Table 2 ). However, RDT&E funds are also requested as part of the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. The Defense Health Program supports the delivery of health care to DOD personnel and family. Program funds are requested through the Operations and Maintenance appropriation. The program's RDT&E funds support Congressionally directed research in such areas as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer and other medical conditions. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program supports activities to destroy the U.S. inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to avoid future risks and costs associated with storage. Funds for this program are requested through the Army Procurement appropriation. Typically, Congress has funded both of these programs in Title VI (Other Department of Defense Programs) of the defense appropriations bill. More recently, RDT&E funds have also been requested and appropriated as part of DOD's separate funding to support the Global War on Terror (GWOT). These appropriations have been located in Title IX of the defense appropriations bill. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund also contains additional RDT&E monies. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office, which now administers the Fund, tracks, but does not report, the amount of funding allocated to RDT&E.", "For FY2008, the Bush Administration requested $75.1 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E, roughly $800 million less than the total obligational authority available for Title IV in FY2007. The FY2008 requests for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program were $134 million and $221 million, respectively. This year's request for the Global War on Terror included both a FY2008 Title IX request and a FY2007 Title IX Supplemental request, with $2.9 billion and $1.4 billion being requested for RDT&E, respectively.", "Since FY2001, funding for RDT&E in Title IV has increased from $42 billion to $76 billion in FY2007. In constant FY2008 dollars, the increase is roughly 58%. Historically, RDT&E funding has reached its highest levels in constant dollars, dating back to 1948. Congress has appropriated more for RDT&E than has been requested, every year, since FY1996.", "RDT&E funding can be broken out in a couple of ways. Each of the military services request and receive their own RDT&E funding. So, too, do various DOD agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), collectively aggregated within the Defensewide account. RDT&E funding also can be characterized by budget activity (i.e. the type of RDT&E supported).Those budget activities designated as 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 (basic research, applied research, and advanced development) constitute what is called DOD's Science and Technology Program (S&T) and represents the more research-oriented part of the RDT&E program. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components (e.g. the Joint Strike Fighter or missile defense systems), for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established. Budget activity 6.7 supports system improvements in existing operational systems. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support, including support for test and evaluation facilities.", "S&T funding is of particular interest to Congress since these funds support the development of new technologies and the underlying science. Assuring adequate support for S&T activities is seen by some in the defense community as imperative to maintaining U.S. military superiority. This was of particular concern at a time when defense budgets and RDT&E funding were falling at the end of the Cold War. As part of its 2001 Quadrennial Review, DOD established a goal of stabilizing its base S&T funding (i.e., Title IV) at 3% of DOD's overall funding. Congress has embraced this goal. The FY2008 S&T funding request in Title IV is $10.8 billion, about $2.5 billion less than what was available for S&T in Title IV in FY2007 (not counting S&T funding requested as part of the GWOT request). Furthermore, the S&T request for Title IV is approximately 2.2% of the overall baseline DOD budget request (not counting funds for the Global War on Terror), short of the 3% goal. The ability for the Administration to meet its 3% goal has been strained in recent years as the overall Defense budget continues to rise. In the FY2007 defense authorization bill ( P.L. 109-364 , Sec. 217), Congress reiterated its support for the 3% goal, extended it to FY2012, and stipulated that, if the S&T budget request does not meet this goal, DOD submit a prioritized list of S&T projects that were not funded solely due to insufficient resources.", "Within the S&T program, basic research (6.1) receives special attention, particularly by the nation's universities. DOD is not a large supporter of basic research, when compared to the National Institute of Health or the National Science Foundation. However, over half of DOD's basic research budget is spent at universities and represents the major contribution of funds in some areas of science and technology (such as electrical engineering and material science). The FY2008 request for basic research ($1.4 billion) is roughly $140 million less than what was available for Title IV basic research in FY2007.", "In Congressional action to date, Congress approved, and the President signed, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans ' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 ( P.L. 110-28 ). The bill contained emergency supplemental funds, including additional FY2007 RDT&E funds in support of the Global War on Terror. As noted above, the RDT&E-related FY2007 GWOT supplemental request was $1.4 billion. Congress provided $1.1 billion. In addition, the act provided supplemental FY2007 RDT&E funds for the Defense Health Program to support additional trauma-related research. See Table 3 below.", "The House passed H.R. 3222 , the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 , on August 5. The bill provided $1.1 billion more in Title IV RDT&E funding than requested. The bill provided $12.2 billion in S&T funding (2.7% of the total funds appropriated for the Department), $1.4 billion more than requested. The House chose not to address the FY2008 GWOT request in this bill. It is not possible to compare directly the House figures with FY2007 numbers in Table 2 , since the latter include GWOT (Title IX) funds from the FY2007 appropriations bill and the House figures do not yet include any FY2008 GWOT funds. In addition to the general increases in the S&T accounts, the House made some notable changes in the President's systems development requests, providing less funds for the Army's Future Combat System ($406 million less) and providing more funds for the Joint Strike Fighter (a total of $705 million more split between the Navy and the Air Force). The House provided $319 million more in RDT&E-related funds for the Defense Health Program, including $127 million for breast cancer and $80 million for prostate cancer research. Also, Section 8105 of the bill includes a provision limiting the use of appropriations to pay negotiated indirect cost rates on basic research grants, contracts or other agreements to 20% of the direct costs. This may have an impact on university grants.", "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of H.R. 3222 (see S.Rept. 110-155 ) on September 14, 2007. The net effect of the Committee's recommendations was to reduce Title IV RDT&E by approximately $102 million. While increasing Title IV RDT&E by $265 million in the body of the bill, it reduced Title IV funds by $367 million in the General Provisions part of the bill, as part of a general reduction to account for revised economic assumptions. Similar to the House, the Senate Appropriations Committee did not include the FY2008 GWOT request in the bill. The Committee recommended $11.6 billion for the S&T portion of the program (before allocating the general reduction). This is roughly 2.6% of the total amount recommended for the Department (before accounting for the reduction). The Committee recommended roughly $196 million more than requested for the Joint Strike Fighter programs of the Navy and Air Force (reducing program funds in some areas, but increasing funding for a competitive engine development by $480 million). The Committee did not recommend cuts to the Army's Future Combat System programs. The Committee recommended $477 million for the RDT&E portion of the Defense Health Program, including $150 million for peer-reviewed breast cancer and $80 million for peer-reviewed prostate cancer research. It also included $50 million for additional unspecified peer-reviewed medical research. The Committee also increased funding for the RDT&E portion of the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program.", "The conference committee filed its report ( H.Rept. 110-434 ) on November 6, 2007. The conferees recommended $76.9 billion for Title IV RDT&E (this includes the $367 million general reduction to Title IV related to improved economic assumptions). The conferees recommended $12.8 billion for S&T (including $1.6 billion for basic research). The S&T appropriation represents approximately 2.8% of the total amount appropriated for the department (before considering the general reductions). The conferees approximately split their differences on the Future Combat System and the Joint Strike Fighter programs. The conferees recommended $536 million for RDT&E within the Defense Health Program (including peer reviewed research for breast cancer ($138 million), ovarian cancer ($10 million), prostate cancer ($80 million), and other medical research ($80 million). The conferees recommended $313 million for RDT&E within the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. On the issue of indirect costs on government contracts, grants and cooperative agreements for basic research, the conferees accepted the House proposal, but raised the ceiling to 35% and grandfathered those awards entered into before enactment of this act. The conferees also provided $11.6 billion to help accelerate the development and deployment of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, to help protect against the improvised explosive devices being use in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is in addition to $5.2 billion provided earlier for the same purpose in H.J.Res. 52 ( P.L. 110-92 ), which made continuing appropriations for FY2008. In both cases, Congress instructed the Secretary of Defense to transfer these funds to appropriate accounts, including the RDT&E account.

The President signed the bill ( P.L. 110-116 ) on November 13, 2007.", "To address the FY2008 GWOT funding request, the House passed H.R. 4156 on November 14, 2007. It only considered about $50 million of the total request, those activities considered by the House to be in most immediate need of additional funds. The bill did not include any of the funding for RDT&E, although some of those projects could be supported with the MRAP funds appropriated above. H.R. 4156 also allowed the Secretary to transfer certain funds (e.g. those allocated to the Iraqi Security Forces Fund, and others) to RDT&E accounts, or other accounts, to accomplish the purposes of those funds.

Meanwhile, among programs not focused on space exploration, the request for Science was an increase of $145 million or 2.7%, and the request for Aeronautics Research was a decrease of $163 million or 22.7%. In the final appropriation, Congress provided smaller increases than requested for Constellation Systems and the International Space Station, a larger increase for Science, and a smaller decrease for Aeronautics Research.", "The effect of the Vision on science funding is of particular congressional interest. For example, the House report said that the requested budget would \"sacrifice future missions of discovery to pay for present efforts,\" while the Senate report expressed concern that NASA science \"is being left behind rather than being nurtured and sustained.\" Support for Earth Science has been a particular concern in both Congress and the scientific community. Although the FY2008 request included increased funding for Earth Science and projected further increases in FY2009 and FY2010 relative to previous plans, most of the increases were to cover cost growth and schedule delays in existing missions.

The research advocacy community had originally urged that the NIH budget grow by about 10% per year in the post-doubling years. For FY2004 and FY2005, however, Congress gave NIH increases of between 2% and 3%, levels which were below the biomedical inflation index for those two years. The advocates modified their recommendation to 6% for FY2006 and to 5% for FY2007, maintaining that such increases would be needed to keep up the momentum of scientific discovery made possible by the increased resources of the doubling years. Instead, the NIH appropriation for FY2006 declined 0.3%, marking the first decrease in the agency's budget since 1970. The FY2007 final level was a 2.0% increase over FY2006, compared to a projected biomedical inflation index of 3.7% for the year. For FY2008, the final funding level is 0.45% above FY2007, whereas the advocacy community had urged a 6.7% increase in the appropriation as a step towards reversing the decline in NIH's purchasing power that has occurred since FY2003. The FY2008 funding represents an estimated 11% decrease from FY2003 in inflation-adjusted terms.", "The agency's organization consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers. The Office of the Director (OD) sets overall policy for NIH and coordinates the programs and activities of all NIH components, particularly in areas of research that involve multiple institutes. The individual institutes and centers (ICs), each having a focus on particular diseases, areas of human health and development, or aspects of research support, plan and manage their own research programs in coordination with the Office of the Director. As shown in Table 5 , Congress provides a separate appropriation to 24 of the 27 ICs, to OD, and to a buildings and facilities account. (The other three centers, not included in the table, are funded through the NIH Management Fund, financed by taps on other NIH appropriations.)", "The FY2008 President's request was developed prior to congressional completion of the FY2007 appropriation, and most of the institutes and centers wound up approximately level-funded from their FY2007 amounts. Several of the ICs that received increases from Congress in the FY2007 CR were dropped back in the FY2008 request to levels closer to their FY2006 funding. For example, the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) was given $34 million extra in FY2007 for one-year Shared Instrumentation Grants; the FY2008 request decreased the NCRR budget by $19 million. The biggest institute, the National Cancer Institute, would have been cut by over $10 million (0.2%) in the request. The second largest, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), would have been increased by $229 million (5.3%) over FY2007, but only $28 million of that amount was for NIAID programs. The other $201 million of the increase was for transfer to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, mentioned earlier.", "The House and Senate Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bills, in contrast, would have increased funding for most of the institutes and centers over their FY2007 levels by between 1.4% and 1.7% for the House and between 2.2% and 2.5% for the Senate. Somewhat larger increases would have gone to several ICs in both bills, including NCRR and NIAID. In the FY2008 final appropriation, increases for most of the ICs were considerably below 1%, and three ICs were decreased.", "The two biggest changes in the request and in the appropriation were in the Buildings and Facilities account and in the Office of the Director. Many of the laboratories, animal facilities, and office buildings on the NIH campus are aging, and are in need of upgrading to stay compliant with health and safety guidelines and to provide the proper infrastructure for the Intramural Research program. The budget requested $136 million for Buildings and Facilities (B&F), an increase of $52 million (63%). The final appropriation included $119 million for B&F, an increase of $35 million (42%).", "For the Office of the Director, the President and Congress handled the funding in two different ways, with the President requesting a $530 million (51%) drop in the account, and the appropriation giving a $62 million (5.9%) increase. The difference reflects a change in the way Congress funds the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research, which is a set of trans-NIH research activities designed to support high-risk/high-impact research in emerging areas of science or public health priorities. The initiatives are funded through a Common Fund that until FY2007 was supported partially in the OD appropriation and partially by contributions from each IC at a fixed percentage. The original FY2007 Roadmap total of $443 million required $332 million from the institutes and centers (a 1.2% tap on their budgets) and $111 million from the Director's Discretionary Fund. The final FY2007 CR, however, appropriated $483 million and placed the entire sum in OD, boosting that appropriation and allowing the ICs to use all of their funding for their own programs without the Roadmap tap for trans-NIH research. For FY2008, the request divided a planned total of $486 million for the Roadmap/Common Fund between the IC budgets ($364 million, a 1.3% tap) and OD ($122 million). The House and Senate bills supported the Common Fund entirely in OD, with the House bill providing a 2.5% increase to $495 million, and the Senate providing a 10% increase to $531 million. The final amount in P.L. 110-161 was $496 million.", "Also in the OD account for the first time in FY2007 was $69 million for the National Children's Study. This long-term (25+ year) environmental health study was proposed for cancellation in the FY2007 request. The multi-agency study, mandated by the Children's Health Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-310 ), plans to examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of more than 100,000 children across the United States, following them from before birth until age 21. The overall projected cost for the whole study is about $2.7 billion. For FY2007, both appropriations committees directed NIH to continue with the study, and the CR provided the $69 million. The FY2008 request again included no funding for the study, but the final appropriation provided $110.9 million to OD for its continued support.", "The NIH's two major concerns in the face of tight budgets are maintaining support of investigator-initiated research through research project grants (RPGs), and continuing to nourish the pipeline of new investigators. The FY2008 request concentrated resources on supporting research grants, planning to fund 10,188 competing RPGs, one of the highest numbers ever. However, the expected \"success rate\" of applications receiving funding would have remained at about 20%, and scientists with non-competing (continuation) grants would not have received inflationary increases for their costs. Both committee reports indicated that their funding would have supported a larger number of grants than the request and would have funded some increases in the average costs of grants. The explanatory statement for P.L. 100-161 says that it \"provides funding for a low percent increase in the average cost of new as well as non-competing grants.\"", "Several efforts were focused on supporting new investigators, to encourage young scientists to undertake careers in research despite the discouraging financial climate, and to help them speed their transition from training to independent research. The request and the bills included increases for new types of awards such as the Pathway to Independence, the Directors' Bridge awards, and New Innovator awards in the Common Fund. The Director's Pioneer Awards to encourage high risk research were also supported, as were clinical research training and the new Clinical and Translational Science Awards. In the final appropriation, the explanatory statement indicates that the Pioneer, New Innovator, and Bridge awards were funded at FY2007 levels, and that the Pathways to Independence program received funding at the level of the President's request.", "The biodefense research portfolio was slated in the request to increase slightly by cycling one-time extramural construction costs into other research areas. The Senate bill as reported included legislative language on human embryonic stem cell research, expanding access to stem cell lines and tightening ethical guidelines for their use. To avoid controversy, however, the provisions were dropped before the bill went to the floor.", "NIH and other Public Health Service agencies within HHS are subject to a budget \"tap\" called the PHS Program Evaluation Transfer (Section 241 of the PHS Act), which has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds among PHS agencies. The FY2008 appropriation kept the tap at 2.4%, the same as in FY2007. NIH, with the largest budget among the PHS agencies, becomes the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds, and is a relatively minor recipient.", "At the end of the 109 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed on the first NIH reauthorization statute enacted since 1993, the NIH Reform Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-482 ). The law made managerial and organizational changes in NIH, focusing on enhancing the authority and tools for the NIH Director to do strategic planning, especially to facilitate and fund cross-institute research initiatives. It required detailed tracking and reporting on the research portfolio and periodic review of NIH's organizational structure. The measure authorized, for the first time, overall funding levels for NIH, although not for the individual ICs, and established a \"common fund\" for trans-NIH research.

The act funds the Research and Related Activities (R&RA) account at $4.822 billion in FY2008, $53.5 million (1.1%) above the FY2007 level, and $310.2 million below the Administration's request. Appropriators agreed with the Administration's request to transfer the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) from the Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) to the R&RA. Report language from conferees directs NSF to review its polices concerning transformative research, research that is described as \"cutting edge\" and revolutionary. Several reports have been released recommending that NSF allocate funds specifically for this type of research. Appropriators have directed the agency to issue a report suggesting how transformative research can be included in NSF's portfolio of research activities. Additional report language in the report directs NSF to increase its support for physical infrastructure improvements of its academic research fleet and for aging facilities. P.L. 110-161 funds the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) at $220.7 million and the Education and Human Resources (EHR) Directorate at $725.6 million in FY2008.", "The FY2008 request for the NSF was $6.429 billion, an 8.6% increase ($511.8 million) over the FY2007 estimate of $5.917 billion. (See Table 6 .) President Bush's ACI has proposed to double the NSF budget over the next 10 years. The FY2008 request will be another installment toward that doubling effort. The FY2008 request for NSF was designed to support several interdependent priority areas: discovery research for innovation, preparing the workforce of the 21 st century, transformational facilities and infrastructure, international polar year leadership, and stewardship. These particular areas of investments, similar to the goals contained in the President's proposed ACI, are designed to promote research that will drive innovation and support the design and development of world-class facilities, instrumentation, and infrastructure at the frontiers of discovery. The priorities will support also a portfolio of programs directed at strengthening and expanding the participation of underrepresented groups and diverse institutions in the scientific and engineering enterprise.", "The NSF asserts that international research partnerships are critical to the nation in maintaining a competitive edge, addressing global issues, and capitalizing on global economic opportunities. To address these particular needs, the Administration had requested $45.0 million for the Office of International Science and Engineering. Also, in FY2008, NSF continued in its leadership role in planning U.S. participation in observance of the International Polar Year, which spans 2007 and 2008. The FY2008 request for addressing the challenges in polar research was $464.9 million. A major focus of planned polar research would be in climate change and environmental observations. Other proposed FY2008 highlights included funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative ($389.9 million), investments in Climate Change Science Program ($208.3 million), continued support for homeland security ($375.4 million), and funding for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development ($993.7 million).", "Included in the FY2008 request was $5.131 billion for R&RA, a 7.6% increase ($363.0 million) above the FY2007 estimate of $4.768 billion. R&RA funds research projects, research facilities, and education and training activities. Partly in response to concerns in the scientific community about the imbalance between support for the life sciences and the physical sciences, the FY2008 request provided increased funding for the physical sciences. Research is multidisciplinary and transformational in nature, and very often, discoveries in the physical sciences often lead to advances in other disciplines. R&RA includes Integrative Activities (IA) and is a source of funding for the acquisition and development of research instrumentation at U.S. colleges and universities. IA also funds Partnerships for Innovation, disaster research teams, and the Science and Technology Policy Institute. The FY2008 request transferred support for EPSCoR from the EHR to IA. It was determined that placement in IA would allow the research focus and cross-directorate activities of EPSCoR to be more fully integrated in the agency and give it more leverage for improving and planning its research agendas. The FY2008 request provided $263 million for IA. Included in that amount was $107 million for EPSCoR. The EPSCoR request would support a portfolio of four investment strategies. Approximately 62.6% of the funding for EPSCoR would be for a combination of new and continuing awards.", "The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is funded in the R&RA. In FY2006, responsibility for funding the costs of icebreakers that support scientific research in polar regions was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard to the NSF. While the NSF does not own the ships, it is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and staffing of the vessels. The OPP was to be funded at $464.9 million in the FY2008 request. Increases in OPP for FY2008 were directed at research programs for arctic and antarctic sciences\u2014glacial and sea ice, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, the ocean, and the atmosphere, and biology of life in the cold and dark. The NSF also serves in a leadership capacity for several international research partnerships in polar regions.", "The NSF supports a variety of individual centers and center programs. The FY2008 request provided $66.2 million for Science and Technology Centers, $59.2 million for Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers, $52.9 million for Engineering Research Centers, $42.4 million for Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, $27.0 million for Science of Learning Centers, and $11.5 million for Centers for Analysis and Synthesis.", "Additional priority areas in the FY2008 request included those of strengthening core disciplinary research, and sustaining organizational excellence in NSF management practices. NSF maintains that researchers need not only access to cutting-edge tools to pursue the increasing complexity of research, but funding to develop and design the tools critical to 21 st century research and education. An investment of $200.0 million in cyberinfrastructure would allow for funding of modeling, simulation, visualization, and data storage and other communications breakthroughs. NSF anticipated that this level of funding will make cyberinfrastructure more powerful, stable, and accessible to researchers and educators through widely shared research facilities. Increasing grant size and duration has been a long-term priority for NSF. The funding rate for research grant applications was 21% in FY2006 and 20% in FY2007. NSF planned to return to the 21% funding rate in FY2008. In addition, the average duration would be lengthened and the average award size increased.", "The FY2008 request for the EHR Directorate was $750.6 million, $55.9 million (8%) below the FY2007 estimate. The EHR portfolio is focused on, among other things, increasing the technological literacy of all citizens, preparing the next generation of science, engineering, and mathematics professionals, and closing the achievement gap in all scientific fields. Support at the various educational levels in the FY2008 request was as follows: research on learning in formal and informal settings (includes precollege), $222.5 million; undergraduate, $210.2 million; and graduate, $169.5 million. Priorities at the precollege level include research and evaluation on education in science and engineering ($42.0 million), informal science education ($66.0 million), and Discovery Research K-12 ($107.0 million). Discovery Research is structured to combine the strengths of three existing programs and encourage innovative thinking in K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education.", "Programs at the undergraduate level are designed to \"create leverage for institutional change.\" Priorities at the undergraduate level included the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program ($10.0 million), Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement ($37.5 million), STEM Talent Expansion Program ($29.7 million), Advanced Technological Education ($51.6 million), and Scholarship for Service ($12.1 million). The Math and Science Partnership Program (MSP), a crosscutting program, was proposed at $46 million in the FY2008 request. The MSP in NSF coordinates activities with the Department of Education and its state-funded MSP sites. The MSP in NSF has made approximately 80 awards, with an overall funding rate of about 9%. At the graduate level, priorities were those of Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship ($25.0 million), Graduate Research Fellowships ($97.5 million), and the Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education ($47.0 million). Added support was given to several programs directed at increasing the number of underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, and engineering. Among these targeted programs in the FY2008 request were the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program ($30.0 million), Tribal Colleges and Universities Program ($12.9 million), Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation ($40.0 million), and Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology ($29.5 million).", "The MREFC account was funded at $244.7 million in the FY2008 request, a 28.1% increase ($53.8 million) over the FY2007 estimate. The MREFC supported the acquisition and construction of major research facilities and equipment that extend the boundaries of science, engineering, and technology. Of all federal agencies, NSF is the primary supporter of \"forefront instrumentation and facilities for the academic research and education communities.\" First priority for funding was directed to ongoing projects. Second priority was directed at projects that have been approved by the National Science Board for new starts. NSF required that in order for a project to receive support, it must have \"the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding and/or infrastructure technology.\" NSF stated that the projects scheduled for support in the FY2008 request met that qualification. Six ongoing projects and one new start were proposed for funding in the FY2008 request: Atacama Large Millimeter Array Construction ($102.1 million), Ice Cube Neutrino Observatory ($22.4 million), National Ecological Observatory Network ($8.0 million), South Pole Station Modernization project ($6.6 million), Alaskan Region Research Vessel ($42.0 million), Ocean Observatories Initiative ($31.0 million), and Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ($32.8 million).", "On May 2, 2007, the House Committee on Science and Technology passed H.R. 1867 ( H.Rept. 110-114 ), the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007.

The Senate report criticized NOAA for requesting steep cuts in key ocean programs in the past and for requesting only modest increases in ocean programs for FY2008 at the expense of steep cuts in other research program areas. The Senate report cited the Joint Ocean Commission (JOCI)s' January 2007 findings about the Administration's progress in developing a U.S. ocean policy which, they indicated may have influenced the Administration to request modest increases for some ocean research and ocean-related NOAA R&D programs. The Senate committee introduced $32 million for competitively-awarded research grants programs in OAR. Overall, the recommendation for OAR R&D was almost 32% percent more than the estimated FY2007 level and would have increased the OAR total to $371 million.
