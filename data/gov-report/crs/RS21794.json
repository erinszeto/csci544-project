Overall, polls over the past year show that Spain was no anomaly in terms of strongpublic opposition to military involvement in Iraq.

The Bush Administration contends that thewar in Iraq has reduced the danger of global terrorism. However, a majority in public opinion surveys throughoutEurope contend that the war in Iraq has increased rather than diminished that threat. At the same time, some opinionsurveys show that public support across Europe for military operations in Iraq would increase substantially if theUnited Nations were to authorize or lead peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts.
