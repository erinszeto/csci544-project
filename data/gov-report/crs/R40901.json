In July 2005, two undercover police officers noticed two men acting suspiciously near a gas station in Torrance, CA. After the men robbed the gas station, they were arrested by the undercover officers. A search of the arrested men's apartment revealed that they were members of the terrorist group Jamiyyat Ul-Islan Is-Saheeh. They were planning to bomb synagogues in Los Angeles and were financing their operation through armed robberies.

Data mining entails the search of numerous commercial or government data sets that contain data\u2014the vast majority of which documents legal activity. Mathematical algorithms are then used to identify data trends that can be examined as predictors of criminal activity. The NSI establishes a federated search capability that requires the articulation of some type of criminal or law enforcement predicate before permitting a search of repositories consisting of documented events that are themselves considered reasonably indicative of criminal activity. Given the controversies surrounding various data mining programs, this difference may be a salient issue in terms of public acceptance of the NSI program.

Consider the following behaviors derived from the LAPD list of SAR \"suspect actions\":", "Uses binoculars or cameras. Takes measurements. Takes pictures or video footage. Draws diagrams or takes notes. Pursues specific training or education that indicate suspicious motives (flight training, weapons training, etc). Espouses extremist views.", "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argues that \"[m]ost people engage in one or more of these activities on a routine, if not daily, basis.\" They fear that \"overbroad reporting authority gives law enforcement officers justification to harass practically anyone they choose, to collect personal information, and to pass such information along to the intelligence community.\" The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) is concerned that \"there is a trend toward the collection of huge quantities of information with little or no predicate through SARs. There seems to us a high risk that this information will be misinterpreted and used to the detriment of innocent persons.\"", "In support of this contention, both the ACLU and CDT cite a case reported by the Baltimore Sun in July 2008: \"Undercover Maryland State Police officers [in 2005 and 2006] ... sent covert agents to infiltrate the Baltimore Pledge of Resistance, a peace group; the Baltimore Coalition Against the Death Penalty; and the Committee to Save Vernon Evans, a death row inmate.\" The police \"also entered the names of some in a law-enforcement database of people thought to be terrorists or drug traffickers.\" According to files obtained by the ACLU through a Maryland Information Act lawsuit, \"none of the 43 pages of summaries and computer logs\u2014some with agents' names and whole paragraphs blacked out\u2014mention criminal or even potentially criminal acts, the legal standard for initiating such surveillance.\"", "A challenge for the NSI is how to achieve law enforcement and intelligence objectives while ensuring privacy and civil liberties protections for American citizens. For example, all of the behaviors listed by the LAPD could be potential indicators of terrorist planning and preparation. But such behaviors could also be innocent and legal activities. Carefully articulating what activity crosses the threshold into reportable suspicious activity is seen as a necessary step to ensuring the protection of privacy and civil liberties.", "The NSI has endeavored to address these issues. Agencies participating in the NSI are required to implement a privacy policy that is at least as comprehensive as the policy elaborated within the ISE Privacy Guidelines and that includes a SAR provision.

Refines the guidance to distinguish between Defined Criminal Activity and Potentially Criminal or Non-Criminal Activity requiring additional factual information before investigation. Clarifies those activities that are generally First Amendment-protected and should not be reported in a SAR absent articulable facts and circumstances that support the source agency's suspicion that the behavior observed is reasonably indicative of criminal activity associated with terrorism.", "In a press release following publication of Version 1.5, the ACLU National Security Policy Counsel noted that", "[t]he revised guidelines for suspicious activity reporting establish that a reasonable connection to terrorism or other criminal activity is required before law enforcement may collect Americans' personal information and share it within the ISE.

RISS operates a secure intranet, known as RISSNET\u2122, to facilitate law enforcement communications and information sharing nationwide. ", "Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN)", "After the 9/11 attacks, DHS established the HSIN, a secured, Web-based platform for sensitive but unclassified information sharing and collaboration between federal, state, local, tribal, private sector, and international partners. The HSIN platform was created to interface with existing information-sharing networks to support the diverse communities of interest engaged in preventing, protecting from, responding to, and recovering from all threats, hazards, and incidents under the jurisdiction of DHS. There are five community of interest portals on HSIN: Emergency Management, Critical Sectors, Law Enforcement, Multi-Mission Agencies, and Intelligence and Analysis. HSIN provides real-time, interactive connectivity between states and major urban areas and the 24/7 DHS operations center\u2014the National Operations Center (NOC).", "The HSIN-Intelligence portal provides state, local, and tribal officials with access to unclassified intelligence products. Classified intelligence products are provided to state and local fusion centers that have the appropriate security infrastructure through the Homeland Security Data Network (HSDN). Through HSDN, users can access collateral Secret-level terrorism-related information including products from the National Counterterrorism Center's (NCTC) NCTC Online .", "Law Enforcement Information Sharing Program (LEISP) ", "After 9/11, DOJ initiated the LEISP to foster the sharing of information across jurisdictional boundaries to prevent terrorism and to systematically improve the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity. Two significant systems under the LEISP are described below:", "OneDOJ System ", "This system is a repository of data from DOJ law enforcement components (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; Bureau of Prisons; Drug Enforcement Administration; FBI; and the U.S. Marshals Service) that enables the sharing of investigative information within the department. It is hosted at the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) data center. External sharing is accomplished through bilateral partnerships with designated regional, state, or federal sharing initiatives. These partnerships allow non-DOJ users to access OneDOJ data from within their own systems and vice-versa. However, data are not contributed by external partners to the OneDOJ system.", "Law Enforcement National Data Exchange (N-DEx) ", "N-DEx is intended to facilitate the sharing of information across jurisdictional boundaries and to provide new investigative tools that enhance the nation's ability to fight crime and terrorism. Its proposed services and capabilities would allow participating agencies to detect relationships between people, places, things, and crime characteristics; to link information across jurisdictions; and to \"connect the dots\" between apparently unrelated data without causing information overload. ", "FBI Terrorist Threat Information Tracking Systems", "After 9/11, the FBI established two programs for the tracking, analysis, and sharing of information about terrorism threats:", "Guardian", "Guardian is described as a classified information technology system that allows the FBI to collect and review reports of suspicious activity in an organized way to determine which ones warrant additional investigative follow-up. The primary purpose is not to manage cases, but to facilitate the reporting, tracking, and management of threats to determine within a short time span whether a particular matter should be closed or referred for an investigation. Guardian's database can be searched by FBI employees and certain other government agency partners thus providing a capability to analyze threat information for trends and patterns.", "eGuardian ", "A companion system to Guardian is eGuardian . It is an unclassified system designed to enable near real-time sharing and tracking of terrorist information and suspicious activity with federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. Unclassified information from the Guardian system that appears to have a potential nexus to terrorism is to be passed down to eGuardian , where it will be available for viewing by those members of state, local, and tribal law enforcement and representatives of other federal law enforcement agencies that have been given permission to access the system. It is also intended to serve as the mechanism for the electronic transmittal of leads by state, local, and tribal agencies to the JTTF's. FBI has made eGuardian available on its secure LEO Internet portal, allowing more than 18,000 agencies to run searches and input their own reports.", "Appendix B.
