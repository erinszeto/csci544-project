The program seeks to promote school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services. Head Start is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Federal Head Start funds are provided directly to local grantees rather than through states. Programs are locally designed and are administered by a network of roughly 1,600 public and private nonprofit and for-profit agencies. Most children served in Head Start programs are three- and four-year olds, but in 1994 Head Start was expanded to include an Early Head Start program, which serves children from birth to three years of age. Except as noted, the term Head Start in this report typically refers to both of these programs.", "The FY2013 operating level for Head Start was $7.573 billion. This amount is $395 million (-5%) less than Head Start's FY2012 funding level of $7.969 billion. The FY2013 operating level includes amounts provided in the final FY2013 appropriations law (P.L. 113-6), an across-the-board rescission of 0.2% (per Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6), and reductions required by the sequester ordered on March 1, 2013. Sequestration is an automatic spending reduction process in which budgetary resources are canceled to enforce budget policy goals. The FY2013 sequester was ordered by the President as a result of provisions in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25), as amended. According to HHS, roughly 57,000 children were cut from Head Start programs as a result of this sequester. In FY2013, Head Start also received roughly $95 million (post-sequester) from P.L. 113-2 for disaster relief costs related to Hurricane Sandy. These funds were appropriated in addition to funds provided in the final FY2013 appropriations law.", "Congress did not enact FY2014 appropriations prior to the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. This resulted in a funding gap and partial government shutdown that lasted until a short-term continuing resolution (CR) was signed into law on October 17, 2013. That CR (P.L. 113-46) funds Head Start at its annualized FY2013 post-sequester levels through January 15, 2014. Prior to the start of the fiscal year, in July 2013, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved an appropriations bill (S. 1284, S.Rept. 113-71) that would have provided Head Start with $9.621 billion in FY2014. This is the full amount requested in the FY2014 President's Budget and is roughly $2 billion (+27%) more than the program's post-sequester FY2013 operating level. The President's request included $1.4 billion for a newly proposed Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership Program.

This law authorized the program through the end of FY2012, meaning that Head Start is currently due for reauthorization. The 2007 reauthorization law included provisions to increase the program's authorized funding levels; revise the allocation formula; limit grantee designation periods to five years (at which point the grant may be re-competed); expand eligibility to allow grantees to fill up to 35% of their slots with children from families with income between 100% and 130% of the poverty line (in certain circumstances); increase qualifications and training requirements for Head Start staff; delineate roles and responsibilities of a grantee's governing body and policy council; and terminate the National Reporting System.

For FY1998, Congress earmarked more than was required by law for EHS, and the statutory set-aside was increased in the 1998 amendments to Head Start. One of the few legislative changes sought by the Clinton Administration during the 1998 debate on Head Start was an increase in the EHS program.

By contrast, EHS programs are authorized to serve children under age three and pregnant women. ", "Head Start (and EHS) programs are targeted to low-income children and families. The Head Start Act and accompanying regulations typically require at least 90% of children enrolled by each Head Start grantee to come from families with income at or below the official federal poverty guideline (e.g., $19,530 for a family of three in 2012) and/or to be categorically eligible. Children are categorically eligible if they are (1) from a family that is receiving public assistance (specifically, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI)), (2) in foster care, or (3) homeless. The statute and regulations further specify that up to 10% of the children served by each grantee may be from families whose incomes exceed the poverty guidelines (and are not categorically eligible).", "In addition, when Head Start was reauthorized in 2007, programs were given the authority to fill up to 35% of their slots with children from families with income between 100% and 130% of the poverty line, provided that these children are not given higher priority than children who are homeless or living below poverty. In other words, the income eligibility has not been raised to 130% across-the-board, but rather for only a percentage (a maximum of 35%) of available slots and only in cases where priority populations have been served first.", " Figure 1 shows the percentage of children enrolled in FY2012 by primary type of eligibility. (While some children may meet multiple eligibility criteria, they are reported here only once\u2014by primary eligibility type.) As the figure demonstrates, roughly 3% of children enrolled in Head Start in FY2012 were deemed eligible using the authority to serve families with income between 100% and 130% of poverty. An additional 5% of children were enrolled using the rule allowing 10% of children to be from families whose income exceeds poverty. All remaining children\u2014roughly 93% of all children enrolled in FY2013\u2014were deemed eligible because their family income fell below poverty or because they were categorically eligible (e.g., received public assistance, were foster children, or were homeless).", "A child who has been determined to be low income and who is participating in Head Start may continue to be considered low income for another program year. Grantees are provided some flexibility in determining family income and, therefore, eligibility for participation. Specifically, the 1998 reauthorization amendments authorized grantees to consider family income during the 12 months before the month in which an application is submitted or during the calendar year before the calendar year in which an application is submitted.", "Separate from eligibility requirements, Head Start regulations also require grantees to reserve at least 10% of their slots for children with disabilities.

Head Start programs are required to maintain waiting lists in an effort to ensure that vacant positions can be filled quickly. However, there are a number of reasons why it can be difficult to fill vacancies quickly. For instance, families on the waiting list may have moved outside of the Head Start service area or may have already enrolled their child in a local preschool program. ", "To ensure that Head Start programs are serving the full number of children for which Congress has appropriated funds, the 2007 reauthorization law included a provision requiring that Head Start agencies report their enrollment each month. In cases where underenrollment is persistent (i.e., actual enrollment fails to meet funded enrollment for more than four consecutive months), HHS is expected to provide technical assistance to help the grantee rectify the problem. If underenrollment persists despite 12 months of technical assistance, HHS may designate the agency as \"chronically underenrolled\" and reduce the agency's grant award accordingly.", "HHS has undertaken a number of efforts to improve and standardize how grantees report enrollment. To implement the new requirements from the 2007 reauthorization, HHS started collecting online enrollment data from all Head Start grantees on a monthly basis. These data are reviewed on a semi-annual basis. According to the most recent data available, Head Start grantees failed to fill, on average, 0.8% of their funded slots for Head Start children during the 2011-2012 program year (FY2012).

The law states that additional members of the governing board should be reflective of the community and include parents of children who are currently, or were formerly, enrolled in Head Start programs.", "By contrast, the policy councils hold program design and operation responsibilities.

The secondary membership of the council is to be composed of members of the community served by the Head Start agency and may include parents of children who were formerly enrolled in the agency's Head Start program.", "Governing bodies and policy councils are expected to make shared decisions for their Head Start agencies. However, the shared governance structure can lead to internal disputes (or deadlocks) when an agency's governing body and policy council cannot reach agreement on a proposed action (e.g., if a governing body was to disagree with the recommendations from its policy council).

For instance, in April 2008, HHS gave grantees the opportunity to apply for $5 million in Head Start training and technical assistance funding related to meeting new staff qualifications requirements. This funding was intended to assist staff with costs of acquiring a college degree or a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential. In September 2008, HHS issued new competitive grant awards to increase career development opportunities for Head Start teachers seeking associate and baccalaureate degrees in ECE. Ten five-year grant awards, totaling $3 million per year, were made to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and Tribally Controlled Land Grant Colleges and Universities. In June 2009, all Head Start programs were invited to apply for one-time technical assistance funds (from the ARRA) to support efforts to meet qualification requirements for teachers and teaching assistants.

These activities are expected to be \"high-quality, sustained, intensive, and classroom-focused in order to have a positive and lasting impact on classroom instruction and the teacher's performance in the classroom.\" In addition, the law now requires each Head Start agency to develop a professional development plan for all full-time employees providing direct services to children.

The Miller amendment failed by a vote of 200-229.", "Major features of the bill's Title I (\"Program Improvements\") included increased credentials for Head Start teachers; a 2% cap on the percentage of funds to be reserved for training and technical assistance (1998 law set the floor at 2%); increased requirements to promote collaboration and coordination among early childhood programs; a 60% set-aside of excess appropriation funds for quality improvement; a requirement that at least 10% of the total Head Start appropriation be reserved for Early Head Start; and new language that would explicitly allow faith-based Head Start programs to discriminate in hiring, based on religion (\u00a7116).", "Title II (\"State Demonstration Program\") of the bill contained provisions that would have allowed up to eight qualifying states to participate in \"state demonstration programs\" in which their allocation of federal Head Start funding would be administered by the state. To qualify, a state would have had to have an existing state-supported system of public-pre-kindergarten; standards for school readiness that are aligned with state kindergarten through grade 12; prior-year state and local spending at a level of at least 50% of the federal Head Start funds to be allocated to the state; and an established \"means\" for interagency coordination and collaboration. States would have been required to demonstrate that their standards \"generally meet or exceed the standards that ensure the quality and effectiveness of programs operated by Head Start agencies.\"", "State Pilot Program Resembled Administration Proposal", "The House proposal to allow up to eight states to administer their Head Start programs closely resembled an Administration proposal advanced in President George W. Bush's FY2005 Budget Request, which would have allowed up to nine states to serve in this capacity.", "President George W. Bush's nine-state pilot project proposal, first introduced in the FY2005 budget, was preceded by his more expansive proposal for FY2004, which would have allowed all states the option to administer Head Start, provided they fulfilled certain criteria. That initial proposal, issued on February 3, 2003, alongside release of the President's FY2004 Budget, was included in a press release announcing the President's proposal to make changes to the Head Start program. This was followed by a White House document outlining the Administration's assessment of the status of the Head Start program and its plans for the program in the future. The Administration stated that the top goal of the Head Start reauthorization should be to improve both Head Start and other preschool programs to ensure that children are prepared to enter kindergarten. The President asserted that states should have the opportunity to administer the program, provided they demonstrate how Head Start will be coordinated with other preschool programs and services to emphasize developing skills and behaviors including language development, pre-reading skills, numeracy, and social and emotional competence, while meeting state-established accountability standards.", "Under the President's proposal, interested states would have submitted a plan for the approval of both HHS and the Department of Education, in which they would outline state preschool goals and activities; a state accountability program; an explanation of how the current level of enrollment of Head Start-eligible three- and four-year-olds would be maintained (if not exceeded); information regarding the most recent year's spending on Head Start and state preschool programs, and assurances that this level would be at a minimum maintained; plans for assuring professional development for staff; and the plans for coordination of programs and funding (state and federal) for the purpose of promoting school readiness. Programs specifically mentioned were Head Start, Early Head Start, Title I preschool, the special education preschool program (IDEA), state-funded preschool, and the Child Care and Development Block Grant.", "In his FY2006 budget, the President requested $45 million to support his initiative to improve Head Start by funding a nine-state pilot project to coordinate Head Start, state preschool programs, and federal child care grants into a comprehensive system of early childhood programs. According to the Administration's budget documents, coordination is a means of improving preschool programs in general, to help ensure that children enter school prepared to succeed. The nine-state pilot project was intended to assist states with implementing reforms that promote better coordination, and in turn, school readiness.", "Head Start Improvements for School Readiness Act ( S. 1940 )", "This bill to reauthorize Head Start was introduced and reported by Chairman Gregg of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on November 24, 2003. There were significant differences between the House bill ( H.R. 2210 ) and the bill reported by the HELP committee. Most notably, S. 1940 (S.Rept. 108-208), unlike the House-passed H.R. 2210 , would not have provided any state the option to administer the Head Start program (nor would it have changed the law with respect to the non-discrimination in hiring provision). A summary of many of the bill's provisions follows.", "The bill would have changed the way in which Head Start funds are allocated, allowing not less than 4% to American Indian and Alaskan Native Head Start programs and not less than 5% to Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs (provided this could be done without reducing the total number of children funded by Head Start). The bill would also have changed the way in which remaining funds (after the set-asides included in the 1998 law, including exactly 2% for training and technical assistance) would be allocated, giving priority to grantees in states serving the smallest percentages of eligible children, and distributing a portion of the funds on a competitive basis. The bill would have provided a 60% set-aside of excess appropriation funds for quality improvement.", "The percentage of funds allotted for the Early Head Start program would have been maintained at 10% in FY2004 and would have gradually increased to 18% in FY2009. Collaboration grants would have been awarded to each state by the Secretary, and each state's governor would have designated a State Advisory Council to advise states on collaboration between Head Start and other entities involved with early child care and education.", "The bill would have authorized $90 million for the Secretary to make a maximum of 200 grants (of at least $100,000 per year for five years) to Head Start agencies nominated by governors as \"Centers of Excellence\" in early childhood. Grants could have been used for purposes such as furthering best practices, serving more children, and providing additional training for staff.", "The bill would have also addressed the population of children eligible for Head Start services by increasing the eligibility level to 130% of the poverty line. Programs would also have been required to keep an active waiting list at all times. S. 1940 would have required monthly enrollment reporting to the Secretary, and if actual enrollment were found to be lower than 95% of funded enrollment for a period of a year, technical assistance would have been required to be provided to alleviate chronic underenrollment. If the underenrollment were to persist after 18 months of technical assistance, the bill would have allowed for the grantee's base grant to be reduced by a percentage reflecting the underenrollment.", "The bill would have provided for the Secretary to make training and technical assistance funds available to support a regional or state system of early childhood education and training and technical assistance. The bill also outlined a variety of uses for those funds.", "Other provisions in the bill included increasing Head Start staff qualifications and requirements; requiring that school readiness-related goals be established by a Head Start agency before designating it as such; commissioning a National Academy of Sciences panel to review a range of issues related to early childhood care and education (including assessments); and authorizing $10 million for FY2004 to award grants for tribal college (or university) Head Start partnerships.", "Reauthorization Efforts During the 109 th Congress", "As was the case in the 108 th Congress, the Head Start program was not reauthorized by the 109 th Congress, despite legislative efforts. In the House, a bill ( H.R. 2123 ) was introduced, amended, and approved by the full House. One of the amendments offered and accepted on the House floor (220-196) was the hotly debated provision to allow faith-based Head Start providers to discriminate in hiring, based on religion. On the Senate side, another bill ( S. 1107 ) was approved (by voice vote) by the full Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, but did not reach the floor.", "The House bill would have designated that specified percentages of the total appropriation be reserved for American Indian and Alaskan Native Head Start programs, as well as Migrant and Seasonal programs, and the set-aside for training and technical assistance would be changed from at least 2% to \"equal to 2%.\" Funding for Early Head Start would have been maintained at 10% for each of FY2006-FY2011.", "This House bill would have increased competition for Head Start grants, requiring recompetition every five years for grantees shown to have a deficiency. Grantees without deficiencies would have been designated as priority grantees and would not have been subject to recompetition (in that five-year cycle). Priority grantees would have earned that designation in part by demonstrating active partnerships and collaboration with local educational agencies. The bill would also have required that to be designated as a Head Start grantee, the Head Start agency must establish an independent board of directors, which would have oversight responsibility for all program activities and finances. Although the board would have been required to consult with its policy council (of whom a majority of members must be parents of enrolled or recently enrolled children), policy councils would not have retained their regulatory authority to jointly approve or disapprove of many budget, program, and hiring policies. They would have instead served in an advisory capacity. (On the House floor, Representative Souder offered an amendment that would have maintained the policy councils' decision-making authority, but it failed by a vote of 153-266.)", "H.R. 2123 would have put into law the requirement that each Head Start agency establish procedures for evaluating its delegate agencies, and procedures for, when necessary, defunding them. The bill also would have added to law new provisions regarding reduction of funding for grantees that exhibit chronic underenrollment. Reduction and redistribution of funds would occur only if actual enrollment still failed to reach 95% of funded enrollment after receiving technical assistance attempting to remedy the situation. The House bill also would have made changes to a grantee's rights with respect to appealing any suspension or termination. Under H.R. 2123 , a grantee would have no longer received reimbursement (with federal Head Start funds) for legal fees and other costs associated with waging an appeal.", "As a means of improving coordination among Head Start and other state and local early childhood education programs, H.R. 2123 would have required that Head Start agencies enter into a memorandum of understanding with those state and local entities, and align all program activities, curricula, and instruction with state-developed K-12 academic standards.", "New standards with respect to staff qualifications and degree requirements were also included in H.R. 2123 . This bill would have required that by the end of FY2011, at least 50% of all Head Start teachers in center-based programs have a bachelor of arts or advanced degree in early childhood education; or a B.A. or advanced degree in a related field, with preschool teaching experience.", "The bill also adopted the provision to commission a National Academy of Sciences panel to review a range of issues related to early childhood care and education. The panel would have been required to complete its recommendations within 18 months of convening.", "The Head Start Improvements for School Readiness Act ( S. 1107 )", "This bill to reauthorize the Head Start Act was introduced by HELP Committee Chairman Enzi on May 23, 2005, and approved by voice vote with no amendments two days later by the HELP Committee.", "Under S. 1107 , changes would have been made to the way funds are allotted among programs: tribal programs would receive 4% of the entire Head Start appropriation, and Migrant and Seasonal programs 5% (provided that doing so would not reduce the total number of children served by Head Start programs); exactly 2% of funds would be reserved for training and technical assistance; and state allotments would be based on amounts received in FY2005 (updating the \"hold harmless\" from FY1998) with any remaining funds distributed not by the share of poor children under age five, but instead by apportioning 65% of the remainder among states giving priority to those whose programs serve the lowest percentage of eligible children, and awarding 35% of the remainder on a competitive basis. The percentage of funding reserved for Early Head Start programs would have been increased.", "Like the House bill, S. 1107 would have increased competition for grant funds, by requiring grantees to recompete for funding every five years. The bill would have required agencies designated as Head Start grantees to assemble a governing body, which would have been required to receive regular and accurate information about program planning, finances, and performance data, and to work with the grantee's policy council and committee.", "Like the House bill, S. 1107 would have put into law the requirement that each Head Start agency establish procedures for evaluating its delegate agencies and procedures for, when necessary, defunding them. The bill also would have added to law new provisions regarding reduction of funding for grantees that exhibit chronic underenrollment. Reduction and redistribution of funds would occur only if actual enrollment still fails to reach 95% of funded enrollment after receiving technical assistance attempting to remedy the situation.", "Similar to the bill introduced in the Senate during the 108 th Congress, S. 1107 would have authorized $90 million for the Secretary to make a maximum of 200 grants to Head Start agencies nominated by governors as \"Centers of Excellence\" in early childhood.", "Staff qualifications and degree requirements for Head Start teachers were also addressed by S. 1107 . Among other provisions to increase staff qualifications, the bill would have required (except in cases where a waiver could be granted) that by the end of FY2010, all Head Start teachers in center-based programs have at least an associate degree relating to early childhood (or a related educational area, with coursework relating to early childhood). In states that have established state teacher requirements for their pre-K programs, all Head Start teachers would have been required (by the end of FY2011) to meet those requirements (provided they are not lower than Head Start requirements). For states without established pre-K staff requirements, 50% of Head Start teachers in those states' programs would have been required to have a B.A. degree relating to early childhood by the end of FY2011. All Head Start teachers would have been required to attend an average of at least 15 hours of professional development a year.", "Also adopted from the 108 th Congress' Senate committee bill was the provision increasing income eligibility for Head Start from the poverty line up to 130% of the poverty guideline. Moreover, any homeless child would have been deemed eligible for the program. The bill also adopted the provision to commission a National Academy of Sciences panel to review a range of issues related to early childhood care and education\u2014including assessments. (During the brief discussion of S. 1107 prior to a voice vote passage, a few Democratic members of the committee did express concern regarding use of the National Reporting System, noting that a May 17, 2005, GAO report called the effectiveness of the assessment system into question.)", "Reauthorization Achieved in the 110 th Congress", "Following the unsuccessful efforts by the 108 th and 109 th Congresses to pass Head Start reauthorization, the 110 th Congress embarked on the task. On December 12, 2007, these efforts reached fruition when President George W. Bush signed H.R. 1429 into law as P.L. 110-134 .", "The original version of H.R. 1429 was introduced in the House by Representative Kildee on March 9, 2007. It was amended in committee (Education and Labor Committee) on March 14, 2007. Amendments rejected by the committee included two controversial (yet familiar) provisions from previous Congresses' reauthorization debates. Representative Fortu\u00f1o offered the amendment proposing to allow faith-based Head Start agencies to discriminate in hiring based on religion, and after vigorous debate, it failed by a vote of 19-26. Representative Price offered the amendment proposing state pilot projects for up to eight states, and it too failed, by a vote of 18-27. The bill passed the House on May 2, 2007, by a vote of 365-48. Twelve amendments to the committee-reported version of the bill were offered on the House floor, and nine were accepted. The proposal to establish a demonstration program allowing eight states to administer the Head Start program was again offered as an amendment (by Representative Price) but failed 165-254.", "One amendment that was frequently referenced during consideration of H.R. 1429 , but that had been rejected by the Rules Committee for floor consideration, was the amendment pertaining to faith-based providers' ability to discriminate in hiring. The amendment, submitted by Representative Fortu\u00f1o, would have allowed faith-based Head Start providers to discriminate in their hiring of Head Start employees, based on religion\u2014overriding a provision in Head Start law that bars this. It also would have stipulated that (1) religious organizations be considered as Head Start providers on the same basis as other nongovernmental organizations and not be discriminated against because of their religious character, (2) faith-based providers can retain their religious character and control of their internal governance, (3) religious providers cannot be required to remove religious symbols and art, (4) federal Head Start funds cannot be used for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization, and (5) federal audits of faith-based Head Start providers be limited to federal funds they receive. Although Representative Fortu\u00f1o's amendment was not approved for floor consideration, a motion was made (by Representative McKeon) during floor debate to return H.R. 1429 to the Education and Labor Committee for further consideration of the provisions in this amendment. The motion failed by a vote of 195-222. The reauthorization measure, H.R. 1429 as amended, subsequently passed the House by a vote of 365-48.", "On the Senate side, a Head Start reauthorization bill ( S. 556 ) was originally introduced by Senator Kennedy in February 2007 and was approved and reported by the Senate HELP Committee ( S.Rept. 110-49 ). On June 19, 2007, the full Senate passed this bill (with technical changes) under the House bill's number, H.R. 1429 , by voice vote (under unanimous consent).", "On November 9, 2007, House and Senate conferees filed a conference report accompanying H.R. 1429 ( H.Rept. 110-439 ) resolving differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions of a reauthorization measure. The conference report was agreed to on November 14, 2007, and was later signed by the President on December 12, 2007.", "Appendix B. ARRA Implementation", "Of the $2.1 billion in Head Start funding appropriated by the ARRA, $1.1 billion was explicitly directed toward the expansion of Early Head Start programs. The remainder of the appropriation ($1.0 billion) was to be distributed through the regular Head Start formula. Table B-1 displays how these funds were allocated, by category. Because the FY2009 Omnibus also provided an increase over FY2009 funding levels, this table displays categorical increases in FY2009 funding by specific appropriation source (e.g., ARRA and Omnibus).", "The ARRA gave HHS until the end of FY2010 to obligate these funds and HHS reported obligating roughly $2.1 billion by that deadline ($577 million in FY2009 and $1.523 billion in FY2010). According to HHS data, ARRA funds supported 61,078 new enrollment slots for Head Start children (including 48,041 in Early Head Start programs) in 3,516 new classrooms over the course of FY2010. ARRA expansion funds were not awarded to applicants until the end of FY2009 (at the earliest), so ARRA-funded slots were not filled until FY2010.", "Allocations", " Table B-2 shows allocation amounts available for Head Start grantees in each state, as well as the allocation for AIAN and MSHS programs. Allocations are displayed based on funding made available by the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-8 ), the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-117 ), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). ARRA funds were made available for obligation by HHS through the end of FY2010; HHS obligated only a portion of those funds in FY2009."], "subsections": []}]}}
