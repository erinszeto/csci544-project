Many past efforts have failed for a variety of reasons and not all failures were attributed to scientific or technological challenges associated with weaponizing DE. At present, a number of U.S. military DE weapons-related programs are beginning to show promise, such as the Navy's Laser Weapon System (LaWs), the first ever Department of Defense (DOD) laser weapon to be deployed and approved for operational use, according to the Navy. With a number of U.S. Army weapons-related DE programs showing promise during concept demonstrations and their potential relevance in addressing a number of current and emerging threats to U.S. ground forces, some believe the Army is making progress to field viable DE weapon systems designed to counter rockets, artillery, and mortars (C-RAM) and address certain types of short-range air defense (SHORAD) threats.", "While DE weapons offer a variety of advantages over conventional kinetic weapons including precision, low cost per shot, and scalable effects, there are also some basic constraints, such as beam attenuation, limited range, and an inability to be employed against non-line-of-sight targets, that will need to be addressed in order to make these weapons effective across the entire spectrum of combat operations.", "DE weapon system development raises a number of national security and international relations implications associated with DE weapons as well as international law concerns that must also be taken into account.

A DE weapon is a system using DE primarily as a means to incapacitate, damage, disable, or destroy enemy equipment, facilities, and/or personnel. Directed-energy warfare (DEW) is military action involving the use of DE weapons, devices, and countermeasures to incapacitate, cause direct damage or destruction of adversary equipment, facilities, and/or personnel, or to determine, exploit, reduce, or prevent hostile use of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) (see Figure 1) through damage, destruction, and disruption. It also includes actions taken to protect friendly equipment, facilities, and personnel and retain friendly use of the EMS. With the maturation of DE technology, weaponized DE systems are becoming more prolific, powerful, and a significant subset of the electronic warfare (EW) mission area. DE examples include active denial technology, lasers, radio frequency (RF) weapons, and DE anti-satellite and high-powered microwave (HPM) weapon systems.", "This report examines the two most prevalent types of DE weapons: High Energy Lasers (HELs) and High Powered Microwaves (HPMs)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Security Implications of DE Weapons3", "paragraphs": ["DE weapons have the potential to change the very nature of warfare and could have implications for U.S. national security. Some of these potential implications are as follows:", "DE could be used as both a sensor and a weapon, thereby shortening the sensor-to-shooter timeline to seconds. This means that U.S. weapon systems could conduct multiple engagements against a target before an adversary could respond. Airborne HELs could change the nature of air combat. Aircraft with HELs could engage ballistic missiles, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and other airborne platforms. HELs could also be employed on stealthy unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), enabling precision strikes against a wide variety of highly defended enemy targets. HPMs could also be used to defend U.S. aircraft against SAMs. DE could also significantly improve U.S. suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) operations, permitting, under certain circumstances, the United States to achieve air dominance over an adversary in a few days or a couple of weeks. DE weapons could rapidly locate and attack mobile SAM systems. HPM weapons could significantly improve antiradiation attack capabilities and defeat efforts by enemy air defense systems to evade detection and attack by turning off their systems. DE weapons could prove an important advancement in missile defense. DE weapons could be highly effective as part of a boost-phase defense and could, if successfully developed, serve as a cost-effective counter to enemy ballistic missiles as well as associated countermeasures such as decoys and maneuverable warheads. DE weapons could have the potential to preempt enemy use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). HPM weapons, in particular, could be used to attack WMD facilities that are buried, hardened, or co-located with civilian populations or infrastructure. DE weapons, particularly HPM weapons, could enhance the ability of the United States to conduct precise, effects-based operations. DE weapons could address one of the most problematic asymmetric strategies employed by adversaries: use of civilians as shields. Although HELs offer a precision strike capability to help reduce civilian casualties, HPMs could attack virtually any electronic system without doing direct harm to nearby civilians. DE weapons could facilitate new strategic operations such as disrupting power generation and distribution. DE weapons could be used in selected strategic strikes against industrial systems and military infrastructure dependent on electric power and electronic systems. Effects could range from short-term disruption of service to subsystem destruction. DE weapons could also provide a means by which the U.S. military could achieve limited space control. Defensively, DE weapons could provide protection of U.S. and allied space-based assets. Employed offensively, DE weapons could temporarily deny the use of space assets by adversaries and damage or destroy enemy satellites. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Relations Implications of DE Weapons4", "paragraphs": ["Although it is difficult to predict how DE weapons could affect international relations\u2014primarily because many of these technologies are in development\u2014there are some general observations that may be useful for policymakers. These observations, however, are predicated on the assumption that DE programs presently being developed will eventually overcome any technological challenges that are preventing them from being fielded as viable weapon systems.", "Early DE weapon applications will likely be both tactical and defensive in nature, whether for missile defense or for counter rocket, artillery, and mortars (C-RAM) applications, for example. These weapons will likely have little effect on the international environment for that very reason. Some argue these weapons could exert a stabilizing influence on international affairs \"by offering non-offensive means of responding to threats posed by theater ballistic missiles, short-range rockets and even long-ranged artillery fire.\" ", "However, if DE weapons become more common and effective and possibly take on a more offensive role, their effect on military operations and international relations could grow. As previously noted, DE weapons represent a transformative capability in a number of military domains, perhaps fundamentally altering the nature of combat and putting other nations at a severe military disadvantage. In the case of air combat, incorporating DE weapons on U.S. aircraft, from an adversary's perspective, \"could negate billions of dollars of investment in both tactical fighters and SAMs,\" suggesting that \"nations that wish to deploy credible, effective air power will have to consider how they can acquire DE capabilities.\" In a sense, if DE weapons become more commonplace, a DE \"arms race\" could ensue.", "One particular realm where DE weapons could have a profound international relations affect as well as shape U.S. foreign policy is in the area of space control. In a space role, DE could potentially be used defensively to attack enemy antisatellite systems targeted against U.S. space systems and offensively could potentially be used to interfere with or destroy enemy satellites. Such an unchallenged ability to exert space control \"could dramatically impact military balances and the course of future conflicts.\" The possibility, however, of such \"conflict in space\" is not without significant controversy, as many here and abroad oppose the \"weaponization of space\"\u2014a domain many view as a shared common environment where all nations should have unfettered access. As the most extensive user of space for national security purposes, the United States is particularly vulnerable to attacks against its space-based assets, making this domain of critical concern to both defense officials and policymakers.

Nevertheless, there are a number of legal regimes which would apply to DEW. These range from national civilian use regulations and guidelines to international humanitarian law (IHL) and human rights law that would constrain or preclude their use under certain circumstances.", "Selected international regimes that apply to DE weapons include the following:"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW)10", "paragraphs": ["Protocol IV of the CCW \"Protocol on Blinding Lasers\" states the following:", "It is prohibited to employ laser weapons specifically designed, as their sole combat function or as one of their combat functions, to cause permanent blindness to unenhanced vision that is to the naked eye or to the eye with corrective eyesight devices. ", "In this regard, lasers that do not fall under Protocol IV are considered legitimate weapons of war. However, it can be argued that as new applications for DE weapons are developed, they could conceivably inflict casualties considered by some to be \"excessively injurious\" as described by the CCW and, thereby, possibly viewed as illegal. A counterargument to DE weapons being categorized as \"excessively injurious\" is that they could be considered more humane than conventional weapons since they can strike targets with pinpoint accuracy, thereby causing less collateral damage. Furthermore, lower-power nonlethal uses for HELs and HPMs merit consideration as well. Under these circumstances, both DOD and the Army could find it beneficial to ensure new DE weapons programs are in accordance with the provisions of Protocol IV of the CCW and avoid effects that could be deemed as \"excessively injurious.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outer Space Treaty15", "paragraphs": ["The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the testing and deployment of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in space and is widely viewed as signifying international opposition to the \"militarization of space.\" While not likely an Army program, some believe ballistic missile defense could be more effective if directed energy-armed satellites were employed instead of current ground and sea-based kinetic ballistic missile defense interceptors. U.S. military reliance on space has a direct effect on a wide variety of Army equities and, therefore, the Army would have a vested interest not only in missile defense but in DE protection of U.S. space-based assets as well.

Under Secretary of Defense Kendall noted the following:", "There are serious limitations that could make it unlikely that a directed-energy weapon is ever truly effective enough to be used in combat. Those limitations go beyond the long-standing question of how much power such a system would require to be effective, and the hurdles of employing it outside controlled laboratory conditions. There are limitations with lasers because of weather. There are limitations of lasers because of behavior, beams of light in the atmosphere, and the possibility that [an enemy] could harden against them.", "Advances made in recent years in solid-state laser technology may challenge this belief. Solid-state lasers are more compact than chemical lasers, which require a significant logistics footprint and employ hazardous chemicals.

These narrow beams can focus energy precisely on a designated point. There are three primary types of HELs: chemical lasers ; solid-state lasers ; and free electron lasers . Beyond differences in the lasing media, each type has fundamental attributes that affect their ability to mature into operational weapon systems. In addition to the actual lasers, target tracking, laser pointing, thermal management, and beam control systems are required to place as much laser energy as possible on a target over operationally relevant distances.", "Chemical Lasers", "From CSBA:", "Chemical lasers are the only current DE systems able to achieve the power needed to interdict targets such as ballistic missiles over hundreds of kilometers. As a result, chemical lasers have until recently been the basis for DOD's most mature HEL concepts. Chemical lasers use exothermic (energy-liberating) reactions of various chemicals in the gas phase to create atoms or ions in excited states within a lasing medium. Since these reactions must occur at very low pressures\u2014typically only a couple percent of atmospheric pressure\u2014chemical lasers are large devices requiring vacuum pumps, complex chemical management systems, and low-pressure reaction chambers contained inside a laser resonator.", "Solid-State Lasers (SSLs)", "From CSBA:", "The first laser invented in 1960 was an SSL. Today, low-power SSLs with outputs of milliwatts are used in a wide variety of consumer products, such as DVD players and laser jet printers. Watt-class SSLs are used in numerous military applications, including target range finders (laser radars, also known as ladars), imagers, target designators, and DOD's Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) defensive system. SSLs use ceramic or glass-like solids, rather than a gas, as their lasing media.", "Free Electron Lasers (FELs)", "From CSBA:", "Free electron laser (FEL) systems accelerate beams of electrons to nearly the speed of light in racetrack-like accelerator rings and use powerful magnets to \"wiggle\" the electron beams to generate high-energy beams of laser photons. FELs are of interest to the Navy due to their potential to achieve the high power outputs needed to interdict hardened targets such as incoming ballistic missile reentry vehicles, and their unique ability to \"tune\" their beams to different wavelengths to different wavelengths so they can better transmit through the dense, humid atmospheres of maritime environments. Current developmental FELs are extremely large and inefficient.", "High Powered Microwaves (HPMs)", "From CSBA:", "A high-power microwave weapon uses electricity to power a microwave generator that emits very short pulses\u2014typically nanoseconds to microseconds in duration\u2014of microwave radiation at megawatt to gigawatt output levels. Future HPM weapons could emit beams of radiation that are a few degrees wide to attack targets in specific locations or emit radiation multi-directionally to degrade electronic components over wider areas. The effects created by HPM applications could range from temporarily disrupting electronic systems such as computers to physically burning out systems that are not shielded against the high electromagnetic fields generated by an HPM pulse. Since HPM beams cannot be as tightly focused as lasers, the energy per unit area in HPM beams decreases significantly over distance. This could impose significant operational limitations compared to longer-range laser weapons. Since HPM weapons would affect all unshielded electronic systems within their beam spots, care must be taken when employing them to avoid collateral damage to nearby friendly systems.", "It can be argued that HPM weapons are not \"true\" DE weapons but they are treated as such by DOD.", "Radio-frequency weapons propagate intense bursts of energy at microwave or lower frequencies that disable or destroy electronics. Such bursts can be generated by both nuclear and conventional explosives, but since these mechanisms result in omnidirectional, wideband releases of energy, they cannot properly be called \"directed\" energy. Radio-frequency devices producing directed energy would typically resemble radar transmitters, with steerable antennas for aiming their beams. It could be argued that radio-frequency weapons transmitting omnidirectionally but on tightly restricted frequencies are a form of directed energy.", "Some, however, question the viability of HPM weapons. Moisture in the air absorbs microwaves, and uncertainty on how electromagnetic energy flows through structures makes it difficult to predict what kind of damage an HPM weapon could do. In addition, countermeasures to HPM weapons could be as simple as surrounding sensitive electronics with a Faraday cage. Further compounding this is the classified nature of most of DOD's HPM programs, which makes public and academic examination of these programs problematic.", "Appendix B. Background", "How They Work", "HELs", "From the Lexington Institute:", "Although there are several different methods by which high-energy lasing can be accomplished, the generic components of a laser weapon are always the same. There must be a power source with adequate fuel; there must be a chamber in which coherent light is generated; there must be optical mechanisms for forming and focusing a beam; there must be sensors for tracking intended targets and characterizing the space between the laser and the targets; there must be beam-control techniques for shaping the beam and directing it so it traverses the intervening space with maximum efficiency; and there must be some method of assessing whether the energy deposited on the target has had the desired effect.", "Assuming a specific degree of pointing accuracy, the lethality of the laser against any class of targets will be determined by power level, wavelength and optical dimensions. These factors are typically traded off in designing an integrated system. Shorter wavelength enables designers to use less power or smaller optical dimensions and still achieve desired lethality, although the effects of atmospheric turbulence are more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. Higher power or larger optics enables the same effect to be achieved at longer wavelengths with less degradation from turbulence. However, there are limits on each of these parameters dictated by physical laws. For example, a laser operating at any given wavelength in the atmosphere will have a \"critical power level\" that defines its maximum lethality; at higher power levels, beam degradation resulting from interaction with the atmosphere will actually diminish energy deposited on the target. High power output can also exceed the tolerances of optical systems, leading to system failure.", "HPMs", "From the Lexington Institute:", "The one significant offensive application of directed energy likely to be available in the near-term is the high-power microwave \"bomb\" (HPM). Such a weapon, in which detonation of an explosive charge creates a pulsed-power source to drive the HPM generator, could play a role in the disruption and even destruction of a wide range of electronic systems. HPM weapons have very interesting operational characteristics. First, an HPM weapon is an area weapon, whose area of effect is determined by the frequency generated, the area of view of the antenna and the power of the pulse generator. Second, all targets within the area of effect will be attacked simultaneously (because HPMs can generate an electrical pulse over a wide area they can be used effectively against imprecisely located targets). Third, they can achieve a \"system kill\" by damage inflicted upon electronic circuits, components, and subsystems. Fourth, HPM's are effective against electronics even when those systems are turned off. Fifth, the only effective defense is to completely isolate the target from means of conducting energy\u2014a step that would in all likelihood produce a mission kill. Sixth, because they use an electromagnetic pulse that can affect electronic systems from a distance, HPM weapons offer the prospect of reduced collateral damage. Finally, HPM weapons are inherently tunable, allowing the user to graduate the effects imposed on the target.", "Types of Army Weapons\u2014Related Applications", "Common military uses for DE include detection, targeting, range-finding, medical treatment, and communications.

For purposes of terrestrial-based weapons and targets, HEL beams are not affected by gravity or atmospheric drag. This lack of mass frees them from kinematic and aerodynamic constraints and also means that complex calculations required to determine ballistic trajectories and other flight characteristics of conventional munitions are not required. HEL weapons effects are extremely precise. This precision potentially makes it possible to undertake surgical strikes with little to no collateral damage or friendly fire casualties. HEL weapons can be customized to achieve a range of results\u2014lethal or nonlethal, destructive or disruptive. This is achieved by regulating the amount of energy and time focused on targets. HEL weapons cost relatively little to intercept targets compared with conventional munitions. For example, U.S. aircraft and missile defense missiles\u2014the $3.3 million Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile; the $9 million Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile; and the $10-15 million Standard Missile-3s (SM-3)\u2014are employed against threat systems costing a fraction of these missiles' price tags. By contrast, HEL weapons reportedly can cost as little as $30 a shot while achieving an equivalent or superior probability of kill. HEL weapons are less constrained by ammunition availability than conventional systems and have a much deeper \"magazine\" than conventional weapons. HEL weapons can conduct repetitive engagements over a protracted period of time constrained only by the availability of power and requirements to vent beam generation by-products such as heat and chemicals. HEL weapons can also serve as sensors\u2014not only attacking targets but detecting, imaging, tracking, and illuminating them as well. ", "HEL Constraints", "Some basic HEL constraints include the following:", "HEL power dissipates with water vapor, dust, obscurants, and atmospheric turbulence, making them susceptible to terrain and adverse weather conditions. HEL beams travel in straight lines, meaning they are incapable of indirect fire over terrain and obstacles and cannot shoot beyond their visual horizon. Depending on the HEL type, power requirements and beam generation by-products such as heat can significantly constrain the type of platform needed to accommodate the HEL weapon. For the Army, a challenge is mounting HELs on already size- and power-constrained ground combat and tactical wheeled vehicles. Developing a hand-held laser weapon to replace the current assault rifle, for example, could also prove particularly daunting when power generation and cooling requirements are factored into development.", "HPM Features", "Some basic HPM features include the following:", "HPM weapons can generate waves at different frequencies and power levels to temporarily or permanently disrupt certain types of electronic devices while leaving others unaffected. HPM weapons can also destroy a wide array of electronic targets both military and commercial. HPM weapons can also cause discomfort to humans and can serve as nonlethal weapons. HPM weapons can also potentially limit collateral damage to property and friendly fire casualties, making them attractive weapons in situations \"short of war.\" ", "HPM Constraints", "Some basic HPM constraints include the following:", "HPM beams cannot be as tightly focused as lasers and energy per unit area for HPM beams decreases significantly over distance, potentially imposing significant operational limitations. Because HPM weapons could affect all unshielded electronic systems within range, measures must be taken to insure that friendly systems are properly shielded to avoid collateral damage.
