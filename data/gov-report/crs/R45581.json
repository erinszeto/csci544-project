The DC OSP provides scholarships to eligible students to attend participating private elementary or secondary schools, and is administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED).", "The FY2004 appropriations act provided funding for the DC OSP for the first time and also, for the first time, provided funding for District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) for the improvement of public education, and funding for the District of Columbia State Education Office for public charter schools. Funding for DCPS and public charter schools was not addressed in the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003. However, for every year that Congress has provided funding for the DC OSP, it has also provided funding for the DC public schools and DC public charter schools.

The SOAR Act authorized appropriations from FY2012 through FY2016 for the DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools. The DC OSP was subsequently reauthorized by the SOAR Reauthorization Act (P.L. 115-31), which amended the SOAR Act and extended the authorization of appropriations for the DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools through FY2019. Changes to the DC OSP have also been made primarily through appropriations acts in the intervening fiscal years.

For the 2017-2018 school year, over 3,900 applications for scholarships were received from new applicants and returning students. Over 1,650 students received and used a scholarship at 44 of 48 participating private schools that school year. While the value of the scholarship has changed over time, for the 2018-2019 school year students may receive up to $8,857 to attend a participating private elementary or middle school and up to $13,287 to attend a participating private high school.", "Evaluation", "The DC OSP has been evaluated by two federal agencies: the Department of Education (ED) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The evaluations conducted by these two agencies differed considerably in terms of purpose and scope. ED evaluated the participation of schools, parents, and students in the DC OSP, as well as the effectiveness of the program on student achievement and other outcome measures. GAO evaluated certain accountability mechanisms and whether they were operating as intended, such as the program's use of funds and general adherence to statutory requirements. GAO also evaluated how ED and the District of Columbia fulfilled their roles and responsibilities for the DC OSP. The impact evaluations conducted by ED found mixed results. These evaluations focused on four outcome measures: (1) reading and mathematics achievement, (2) parent and student satisfaction, (3) parent and student perceptions of school safety, and (4) parental involvement. The GAO evaluations revealed issues with the way the DC OSP was being administered by the first two local program administrators, as well as concerns about ED's oversight of the program."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Many of the disputes involving public education and school choice stem from a fundamental question of whether education is a public or private good. While education has historically been considered a public good, it has characteristics of both a public and a private good. That is, the benefits of education are both private, in that they accrue to individuals, and public, in that they promote a stable and democratic society and a prepared workforce. However, the distinction between education as a private good and a public good may be blurred, as others benefit from the work produced by an individual and an individual benefits from living in a stable and democratic society. As some researchers have argued, \"schooling takes place at the intersection of two sets of rights, those of the family and those of the society.\" Parents have the right to raise their children in the manner they deem most suitable, including making decisions about their education, while a democratic society uses education \"as a means to reproduce its most essential political, economic, and social institutions through a common schooling experience.\" ", "There are many forms of school choice and mechanisms used to facilitate choice, including intradistrict and interdistrict public school choice, public charter schools, magnet schools, vouchers, tax credits/deductions, education savings accounts (ESAs), and homeschooling. School choice efforts in some of these areas are supported by federal programs, such as the programs to support public charter schools and magnet schools that are authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The most controversial issues regarding publicly funded school choice have involved the provision of direct or indirect support to enable students to attend private schools, especially religiously affiliated private schools. Numerous bills related to the public funding of private school choice have been introduced over the past several Congresses, but most proposals have failed to be enacted. An exception to this has been the District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program (DC OSP). The DC OSP provides scholarships (also known as vouchers) to students in the District of Columbia to attend participating private elementary and secondary schools, including religiously affiliated private schools. It is the only federally funded voucher program in the United States.

This approach, commonly known as the \"three-pronged approach\" to funding elementary and secondary education in the District of Columbia, was initially suggested by Mayor Anthony Williams when he asked for federal assistance for public education in the District of Columbia. The proposal was supported by the George W. Bush Administration and many Members of Congress. While concerns were raised during consideration of the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 that only the DC OSP\u2014not school improvement funding for DCPS or public charter schools\u2014was authorized for five years, the federal government has also provided funds to support school improvement in DC public schools and DC public charter schools for each year that the DC OSP has been funded.", "The DC OSP has been reauthorized twice.

Over four years of evaluation under P.L. 108-199 , there was a natural attrition of students who could no longer be part of the study because they \"graded-out\" or left the K-12 education system. By the final year of the evaluation, 13% of the treatment group could no longer be tracked because they \"graded-out\" or left. When the sample size of an evaluation is reduced due to attrition, it becomes harder to find an effect of the treatment. That is, an effect of a certain size may be significant in one year, but as the sample size is reduced, that same size of effect may become insignificant in the next year because of a lack of power in the study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity of Outcome Measures", "paragraphs": ["The likelihood of finding an effect in an impact evaluation is dependent on the sensitivity of outcome measures. To evaluate reading and mathematics achievement in the DC OSP evaluation, IES used both the Stanford Achievement Test, version 9 (evaluations conducted under the requirements of P.L. 108-199 ) and the TerraNova, Third Edition (evaluations conducted under the requirements of P.L. 112-10 ). These assessments were selected because they were considered a grade-appropriate, nationally norm-referenced standardized test for students in grades K-12 with a relatively short administration (90 minutes for the reading and mathematics subtests). These assessments, however, are not aligned with standards and curricula in place at DC private schools, public schools, or public charter schools. It is possible, therefore, that the assessments used in the evaluations were not sensitive to the potential academic gains made by students participating in the evaluation.

DC public schools currently administer assessments developed by the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC). PARCC assessments are aligned with academic standards used by the DC public schools. These assessments, however, may not be aligned with the standards in place in DC private schools. The PARCC assessments, therefore, may be more sensitive to changes in achievement for students who attend DC public schools than students who attend DC private schools. It is possible that future evaluations will have a positive bias toward DC public school students since the assessment theoretically measures what they are learning in the classroom. The extent to which the assessments measure what DC private school students are learning in the classroom is unknown.", "In evaluation terms, therefore, there may be a positive bias toward the control group.

It is difficult to interpret the results of the DC OSP impact evaluations within the context of other school choice programs.

Legislative History of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program ", "This appendix traces the DC OSP from the efforts associated with its initial enactment through its current authorization. With the exception of the SOAR Technical Corrections Act ( P.L. 112-92 ), the enacting legislation and all subsequent amendments related to the DC OSP have been included in appropriations bills. Funding for the DC OSP is provided under the Federal Payment for School Improvement account under the District of Columbia title, which is included in the Financial Services appropriations act. This account was established with the enactment of the DC OSP in FY2004. Other changes to the DC OSP, such as program reauthorizations, have also been included in annual appropriations bills but have been detailed elsewhere in the appropriations bills. This discussion includes each relevant bill that has been enacted since the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003. While the discussion includes some information about provisions specifically affecting DC public schools and DC public charter schools, the focus of the discussion is on the DC OSP. ", "Enactment of the Opportunity Scholarship Program", "In the Bush Administration's FY2004 budget submission, the Administration requested $75 million for a Choice Incentive Fund that would have provided competitive grants to states, local educational agencies (LEAs), and community-based organizations that expanded opportunities for parents of children who attend low-performing schools to attend higher-performing schools, including charter schools and private schools. Under the Administration's proposal, a portion of the funds would have been reserved for school choice programs in the District of Columbia. Both the Mayor of the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as the Mayor), Anthony Williams, and the President of the District of Columbia Board of Education, Peggy Cooper Cafritz, endorsed the concept of private school vouchers as a means of improving education options for DC public school students and as a means for transforming the city's faltering public school system. Local supporters of a voucher program insisted that the program had to be federally funded and could not result in a reduction of funds to the city's traditional public schools and public charter schools. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's Delegate to Congress, subsequently criticized the Mayor's support for a federally funded voucher program, noting that the proposal was an affront to home rule. Other opponents of the voucher program argued that the program would reduce needed funding for public education and be of minimal benefit to most of the city's students.", "The establishment of a federally supported voucher program met with both support and resistance in Congress. In July 2003, the House Committee on Government Reform passed H.R. 2556 , the DC Parental Choice Incentive Act of 2003, by a vote of 22 to 21. The act would have created a federally funded scholarship program to serve low-income students in the District of Columbia. The program would have established a competitive grant program under which the Secretary of Education would award grants to eligible entities for the operation of one or more scholarship programs. Grantees would have awarded scholarships of up to $7,500 per academic year to students who are residents of the District of Columbia and whose family income did not exceed 185% of the poverty level to enable them to attend private elementary and secondary schools located in the District of Columbia. The program would have been authorized at $15 million for FY2004 and at such sums as may be necessary through FY2008.", "Later that month, the House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 2765 , which would have provided $10 million for a school choice program in the District of Columbia in the FY2004 appropriations bill for the District of Columbia. The program was substantively similar to the program proposed under H.R. 2556 . During floor debate on H.R. 2765 two voucher-related amendments were offered. The first, offered by Delegate Norton, would have eliminated the proposed voucher program. The amendment failed to pass by a vote of 203 to 203. A second amendment was offered by Representative Tom Davis that would have established eligibility criteria for students to receive a voucher and cap the maximum amount of funding a voucher could provide for any given school year. The amendment passed by a vote of 209 to 206. ", "The Senate's version of the FY2004 District of Columbia appropriations bill ( S. 1583 ) included the DC Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 2003. This bill was substantively similar to H.R. 2556 , and contained the framework on which the final provisions for the DC School Choice Incentive Act were based. It was placed on the Senate calendar but was never considered on the Senate floor. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2765 , however, did not include funding to establish a scholarship program for low-income students. It did include funding for school improvement for public schools and public charter schools in the District of Columbia. The House-passed version of H.R. 2765 did not include funding for these specific purposes.", "The DC School Choice Incentive Act, which created the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, was authorized and funded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 ( H.R. 2673 ; P.L. 108-199 ), which included the FY2004 District of Columbia appropriations bill. Specific funding for the DC OSP was provided under the header \"Federal Payment for School Improvement,\" which also included funding for DCPS for the improvement of public education and the SEO for the expansion of public charter schools. This approach, commonly known as the three-pronged approach to funding elementary and secondary education in the District of Columbia, was initially suggested by Mayor Williams when he asked for federal assistance for public education in the District of Columbia. The proposal was supported by the Administration and many Members of Congress. While concerns were raised during consideration of the bill that only the DC OSP\u2014not school improvement funding for DCPS or public charter schools\u2014was authorized for five years, each year the DC OSP has been funded, the federal government has also provided funds to support school improvement in DC public schools and DC public charter schools.", "DC School Choice Incentive Act (FY2004 Appropriations)", "The DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-199 , Title III) authorized the DC OSP to provide the families of low-income students, particularly students attending elementary or secondary schools identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under the ESEA, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; P.L. 107-110 ), with expanded opportunities to enroll their children in schools of choice located in the District of Columbia. The program was authorized for FY2004 through FY2008 as a five-year demonstration program. An appropriation of $14 million was specified for FY2004; appropriations for the subsequent fiscal years were for \"such sums as may be necessary.\"", "Under the DC OSP, the Secretary was permitted to award grants to eligible entities for a period of not more than five years to make scholarships to eligible students. Thus, the eligible entity functions as the local program administrator in practice. An eligible entity was defined as an educational entity of the DC government, a nonprofit organization, or a consortium of nonprofit organizations. In selecting one or more eligible entities to operate the program, the Department of Education (ED) was required to give priority to eligible entities who would most effectively give priority to eligible students who, in the school year preceding the school year for which the student is seeking a scholarship, were attending a school that was identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under the ESEA. In addition, ED was required to give priority to eligible applicants that would target available resources to students and families who lacked the financial resources to take advantage of school choice options and that would provide students and families with the widest range of school options. The eligible entity was permitted to use up to 3% of the funds it receives for administrative expenses.", "Student eligibility for the program was open to children from families with incomes not exceeding 185% of the poverty line who were entering kindergarten through 12 th grade or who turned five years old by September 30 of the school year for which scholarships are awarded. Eligible students could apply to receive a scholarship valued at up to $7,500 to cover the costs of tuition, fees, and transportation expenses associated with attending participating private elementary and secondary schools located in the District of Columbia. Scholarships provided to students were considered assistance to the student (as opposed to the school) but were not treated as income of the parents for federal tax purposes or for determining eligibility for other federal programs. Students were required to reapply each year to participate in the program. Scholarship recipients remained eligible to continue to participate in the scholarship program, as long as their family income did not exceed 200% of the poverty level. Students enrolled in public schools identified for school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under Title I-A of the ESEA were given priority in receiving scholarships; however, all students meeting program eligibility criteria were eligible for scholarships regardless of whether they were previously enrolled in a public or private school.", "In general, private schools participating in the DC OSP were prohibited from discriminating against program participants or applicants on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, or gender. The latter prohibition did not apply, however, to single sex schools that were operated by, supervised by, controlled by, or connected to a religious organization to the extent that nondiscrimination based on gender would be inconsistent with the religious tenets or beliefs of the school. In addition, nothing in the DC School Choice Incentive Act allowed participating schools to alter or modify the provisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. With respect to sectarian private schools that accepted scholarship students, nothing in the School Choice Incentive Act prohibited the school from hiring in a manner consistent with the school's religious beliefs or required the school to alter its mission or remove religious symbols from its building. All participating private schools were required to comply with requests for data and information with respect to program evaluations required by the DC School Choice Incentive Act.", "The DC School Choice Incentive Act required the DC OSP to be evaluated annually. The Secretary and Mayor were required to jointly select an independent entity to conduct these evaluations. The independent entity evaluating the program was required to measure the academic achievement of participating students, use the same measurement to assess participating students as is used to assess students in DC public schools, and work with the eligible entity to ensure that the parents of all students who apply for a scholarship, regardless of whether a scholarship is received, agree that the student will participate in measurements conducted by the independent evaluator for the period for which the student applied for or received a scholarship. The evaluation was required to compare the academic achievement of scholarship recipients with students in the same grades attending DC public schools and the eligible students who applied for but did not receive a scholarship. The evaluation also had to examine the extent to which the program expanded choice options for parents; the reasons parents chose to participate in the program; retention rates, dropout rates, graduation rates, and college admissions rates for participating students with students of similar backgrounds who did not participate in the scholarship program; the impact of the program on students and public elementary and secondary schools in DC; the safety of the participating private schools attended by scholarship recipients compared with schools attended by students who were not participating in the DC OSP; and other issues as designated by the Secretary.", "FY2004 Appropriations", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 ( P.L. 108-199 ), which authorized the DC School Choice Incentive Act, also appropriated funds for the DC OSP as well as funds for DCPS and the SEO for DC public charter schools.

With respect to the DC OSP, it added additional requirements for schools to be eligible to participate in the program and included language limiting the appropriation of funds for the program beyond FY2010. P.L. 111-8 added two requirements for participating private schools. First, participating private schools were required to have and maintain a valid certificate of occupancy issued by the District of Columbia. Second, a core subject matter teacher of scholarship recipients was required to hold a four-year bachelor's degree. Statutory language did not require that the bachelor's degree be held in the subject area of instruction. That is, it was not required, for example, that only a teacher with a four-year bachelor's degree in English can teach English classes for scholarship recipients.

Senator Ensign (NV) offered an amendment ( S.Amdt. 615 ) to strike the requirement that additional funding could only be provided to the program if the program was reauthorized by Congress and subsequently approved by the District of Columbia. He noted that other federal education programs, including the Higher Education Act, continued to receive federal funding despite having expired authorizations. Further, he argued that the final program evaluation had not been completed and ending the program after the 2009-2010 school year would force students, including those who had been scholarship recipients for several years, to find new schools.

", "P.L. 111-117 also added additional requirements for participating private schools. Participating private schools were required to be in compliance with accreditation and other standards under the District of Columbia compulsory school attendance laws that applied to educational institutions that are not affiliated with DCPS. In addition, the Secretary was required to submit a report to Congress by June 15, 2010, that provided information on the academic rigor and quality of each participating school. To obtain comparable data for the report, the Secretary was required to ensure that all eligible scholarship recipients participated in the same academic performance assessments as students enrolled in DCPS during the 2009-2010 school year.

Second, the SOAR TCA added requirements to Section 3008 regarding the administration of nationally norm-referenced standardized tests. The act required IES to administer the relevant assessment to students participating in the evaluation, unless the student is attending a participating private school that is administering the same assessment. If the participating private school is administering the assessment to an eligible student, it must make the assessment results available to the Secretary as necessary for the evaluation of the DC OSP. Finally, the SOAR TCA amended the DC OSP evaluation requirements included in Section 3009. With respect to the responsibilities of the Institute of Education Sciences, requirements were added to align the use of a grade appropriate, nationally norm-referenced standardized test with the new provisions added to Section 3008 of the SOAR Act by the SOAR TCA. The SOAR TCA also added language to the provision that IES was required to work with the eligible entity to ensure that each student who applied for a scholarship, regardless of whether a scholarship was received, and the parents of such student agree to participate in the measurements given by the IES to specify that the provision applied only to students asked to participate in the measurements by IES.", "FY2013 Appropriations", "The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ) provided FY2013 appropriations for the three parts of the SOAR Act.

A participating private school was required to be provisionally or fully accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency that is recognized in the DC School Reform Act of 1995 or any other body deemed appropriate by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education for the purpose of accrediting an elementary or secondary school. However, if the private school was participating in the DC OSP as of the day prior to the enactment of the DC OSP School Certification Requirements Act and did not meet the aforementioned accreditation requirement, the school could remain eligible to participate in the DC OSP if not later than one year after such date of enactment, the school had to pursue accreditation from one of the aforementioned accrediting agencies and not later than five years after such date of enactment be provisionally or fully accredited by such accrediting agency.

First, the eligible entity was required to use at least 95% of these funds to provide additional scholarships or to increase the amount of the scholarships during such year. Second, the eligible entity was permitted to use not more than 5% of such funds for administrative expenses, parental assistance, or tutoring.

The SOAR Reauthorization Act included requirements related to provisions that participating private schools must meet to participate in the DC OSP, including provisions related to accreditation, background checks, and complying with data and information requests.", "The law added prohibitions on the imposition of limits on eligible students participating in the DC OSP. For example, the Secretary was prohibited from preventing an otherwise eligible student from participating in the DC OSP based on the type of school the student previously attended; whether a student previously received a scholarship or participated in the program, regardless of how many years a student received but did not use a scholarship; and whether a student previously participated in a DC OSP evaluation control group. The law limited the number of site visits at each participating school to one visit. The law required the eligible entity to ensure the financial viability of participating public schools in which 85% or more of the enrolled students were using a scholarship to attend. The law added new requirements related to internal fiscal and quality controls and financial reporting for the eligible entity serving as the local program administrator. The law updated references to the District of Columbia's accountability system used to comply with the requirements of Title I-A of the ESEA and clarified that eligible students who had previously attended a private school could still receive a scholarship. The law also added a definition of \"core subject matter\" and dropped the reference to \"core academic subjects,\" as the definition was no longer included in the ESEA. The law included accreditation requirements for participating private schools. The law specified that the eligible entity must treat a participating eligible student who received, but did not use, a scholarship in a previous year as a renewal student and not as a new applicant. The law made some changes to administrative expenses and uses of funds. For example, the law changed the requirement that not more than 3% of the funds available for the DC OSP could be reserved for administrative expenses to requiring $2 million to be made available each fiscal year for administrative expenses and parental assistance. The law made numerous changes to the DC OSP program evaluation requirements, including with respect to the duties of the Secretary and Mayor, the duties of IES, and the issues to be evaluated. For example, the law amended the requirement that the Secretary ensure that the DC OSP evaluation was conducted \"using the strongest possible research design\" to require that an \"acceptable quasi-experimental research design\" be used. The law included provisions prohibiting the disclosure of personal information. It also included transition provisions requiring the termination of previous evaluations and provisions regarding new evaluations. A provision was also added requiring the Mayor to ensure IES has all the information needed to carry out the evaluation. The law gave the Secretary the authority to withhold funds from DC public schools or DC public charter schools under certain circumstances and included new requirements regarding the distribution of funds to public charter schools. The law required the Secretary and the Mayor to review their MOU in specific ways.", "FY2018 Appropriations", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ) provided FY2018 appropriations for the DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools.
