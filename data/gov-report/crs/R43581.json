From one perspective, the absence of Ex-Im Bank financing could adversely affect particular U.S. firms or their employees that use Ex-Im Bank support in cases where they face difficulty accessing financing from the private sector at competitive terms. From another perspective, there are doubts over whether the absence of Ex-Im Bank support would affect the overall level of exports and employment in the United States.

However, Ex-Im Bank recognizes that U.S. export contracts may contain goods and services that are foreign-originated and allows financing support for such contracts, subject to certain restrictions and limitations. Under its content policy, for all medium- and long-term transactions, Ex-Im Bank limits its support to the lesser of (1) 85% of the value of all goods and services contained within a U.S. supply contract; or (2) 100% of the U.S. content of an export contract. Thus, if the foreign content exceeds 15%, the Bank's support would be reduced proportionally. For short-term export contracts, the U.S. content requirement for full Ex-Im Bank financing is generally 50%. In contrast to Ex-Im Bank, foreign ECAs generally have lower domestic content requirements, and some even have no domestic content requirements. ECAs of other countries have revised their content policies to reflect the changing nature of manufacturing, including the rise of global supply chains and the sourcing of inputs from multiple countries (see Table 6 ).", "In the 2012 reauthorization legislation, Congress required Ex-Im Bank to review its domestic content policy for medium- and long-term transactions to \"examine and evaluate the effectiveness of the Bank's policy in maintaining and creating jobs in the [United States]; and in contributing to a stronger national economy through the export of goods and services\" by taking into account various factors, including U.S. employment considerations and competitiveness to foreign ECAs. Following the review, Ex-Im Bank announced certain policy updates. For example, in an effort to increase U.S. services exporters' access to its financing, Ex-Im Bank provided clarification on how its content policy determines the eligibility of a U.S. services provider and a U.S. services contract, as well as how foreign-developed technology and the tools or equipment used to execute a services contract are treated on a content basis. According to Ex-Im Bank, it made no changes to its underlying content policy with these clarifications.", "In the past, some stakeholders have argued that the Bank's definition of national content does not take into account \"the high value U.S. jobs in R&D [research and development], supply chain management, software design engineering, business development, and marketing, IP [intellectual property] support, branding, and profit,\" which have been considered as limitations to U.S. service providers' ability to use Ex-Im Bank financing. On the one hand, given the proliferation of global supply chains and foreign ECA policies, U.S. exporters have called for greater flexibility in Ex-Im Bank's content policy. For example, industry proposals have included recommendations that Ex-Im Bank lower its domestic content requirement, such as to 50% (the policy for short-term financing); match the average among OECD countries; adopt a policy similar to the European Union ECAs and \"automatically cover non-U.S. content for U.S. FTA [free trade agreement] partners who offer reciprocity for U.S. content under their export credit agencies\"; or expand the definition of domestic content to include, for instance, R&D or other elements that support high-value additions to the U.S. economy. On the other hand, labor groups tend to be concerned about the impact that lowering domestic content requirements may have on employment in the home country.

On the other hand, such targeted forms of export assistance may be viewed as a mechanism whereby the federal government determines \"winners and losers\" in the market, and, from this standpoint, may lead to economic distortions and harm other productive U.S. firms. Although such requirements give Congress a greater role in guiding Ex-Im Bank's activities, under this view, they may obscure the Bank's core mandate to support U.S. exports and employment. ", "To what extent has Ex-Im Bank fulfilled congressional mandates? Given the demand-driven nature of Ex-Im Bank activities, congressional mandates for Ex-Im Bank to support particular types of U.S. exports can be viewed as statutory \"targets.\" Ex-Im Bank can make financing available for certain purposes, but the actual composition of its financing portfolio depends on commercial interest and demand. Ex-Im Bank has met its 20% small business target from Congress in some years, but fallen short in other years. The Bank's support for renewable energy exports has been below the 10% target, possibly due, in part, to market limitations.

Some stakeholders argue that rules under the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA) may understate the cost of loan programs managed by federal credit agencies, and express interest in moving to a fair value system of accounting. As previously noted, under FCRA's rules, budget estimates are calculated by discounting them using the rates on U.S. Treasury securities with similar terms to maturity\u2014which traditionally have been considered risk-free\u2014and are below rates on commercial loans. In contrast, fair value accounting would factor in the market risk, which the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says \"provides a more comprehensive measure of federal costs.\" CBO estimated that between FY2015 and FY2024, Ex-Im Bank's activities would generate a negative subsidy of $14 billion under FCRA (i.e., budgetary savings), but would generate $2 billion in positive subsidy during this period on a fair value basis (i.e., budgetary costs). However, some stakeholders question CBO's assumptions, including for risk, and assert that CBO's assumptions overlook Ex-Im Bank's actual record, for example, in terms of its contributions to the U.S. Treasury and low default rate.

According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the OECD Arrangement has saved U.S. taxpayers about $800 million annually, with its minimum interest rate rules limiting subsidized export financing and reducing competition based on below-cost interest rates and long repayment terms by ECAs, and its minimum exposure fees for country risks also reducing costs. The USTR also states that the further leveling of the playing field created by the OECD tied aid disciplines has boosted U.S. exports by $1 billion a year.", "At the same time, questions about the OECD Arrangement's effectiveness are growing, particularly with the increasing official export credit activity of non-OECD members such as China, Brazil, and India. To the extent that the ECAs of these non-OECD countries provide financing on terms that are more advantageous than those under the OECD Arrangement, Ex-Im Bank and other OECD export credit agencies may find it difficult to compete with such export credit programs. Concerns about the effectiveness of the OECD Arrangement are further heightened due to unregulated financing being conducted by OECD member countries, such as through market windows, which are not subject to the Arrangement.", "To address concerns about the OECD Arrangement, one possible approach is to focus on strengthening the international disciplines guiding ECA activity. For example, Congress could direct the United States to encourage greater engagement by the OECD with non-OECD emerging market economies on official export credit activity; negotiate rules in the OECD that limit government-backed export credit financing in other developed countries; or pursue a greater role for the World Trade Organization (WTO) in disciplining international ECA activity. On one hand, such efforts may help to level the playing field for U.S. exporters by reducing trade-distorting export credit competition and associated economic losses. On the other hand, changes to the international export credit rules, if achieved, may be slow to materialize, given the complex nature of multilateral and plurilateral negotiations. In addition, developing high-standard, comprehensive rules that cover both developed and developing countries may be a challenge.", "Rather than strengthening international rules, another possible approach is to renew efforts by the U.S. Treasury to negotiate to eliminate all government-backed export financing internationally. This perspective often is found with critics of Ex-Im Bank, while supporters of the Bank contend that even if all countries agree to eliminate government-backed export credit activity, there would still be a need for Ex-Im Bank to fill in gaps in private sector financing due to market failures.

The changing export finance landscape, including the 2008-2009 international financial crisis and the growth of government-backed export financing being conducted by emerging markets, as well as increased questions about Ex-Im Bank's financial soundness and risk management, have intensified congressional interest in Ex-Im Bank.
