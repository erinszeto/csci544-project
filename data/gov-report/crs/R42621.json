After a period of reductions in the late 1980s and 1990s, funding for State Department operations, international broadcasting, and foreign aid rose steadily from FY2002 to FY2010, largely because of ongoing assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan, new global health programs, and increasing assistance to Pakistan.

Recent congressional debate centers around two key issues: (1) implementation of the \"Mexico City policy\" and (2) U.S. funding of the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA). The Mexico City policy, issued by President Reagan in 1984, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S. funds. The policy has been rescinded and reissued by past and current Administrations. It was most recently rescinded by President Obama in January 2009. The proposed FY2013 House legislation included language that would codify the Mexico City Policy. The Senate bill did not include such language. ", "Previous Administrations have also suspended grants to UNFPA due to evidence of coercive family planning practices in China, citing violations of the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment, which bans U.S. assistance to organizations that support or participate in the management of coercive family planning programs. Past and current Administrations have disagreed as to whether UNFPA engages in such activities. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following a State Department investigation of family planning programs in China. President Obama resumed U.S. contributions to the organization in 2009, and requested $39 million for UNFPA for FY2013. The proposed FY2013 House legislation included $461 million for family planning and reproductive health activities and prohibited funding for UNFPA, while the Senate legislation included $700 million for family planning and reproductive health, including $44.5 million for UNFPA.

During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs had a primarily anti-communist focus, while concurrently pursuing other U.S. policy interests, such as promoting economic development, advancing U.S. trade, expanding access to basic education and health care, promoting human rights, and protecting the environment. After the early 1990s, with the Cold War ended, distinct policy objectives\u2014including stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, curbing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs, expanding peace efforts in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting religious freedom, and countering trafficking in persons\u2014replaced the Cold War-influenced foreign policy objectives.", "A defining change in focus came following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Since then, many U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have emphasized national security objectives, frequently cast in terms of contributing to efforts to counter terrorism. In 2002, President Bush released a National Security Strategy that for the first time established global development as the third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy. Development was again underscored in the Administration's 2006 and 2010 National Security Strategy.", "Also in 2002, foreign assistance budget justifications began to highlight the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority, emphasizing U.S. assistance to 28 \"front-line\" states\u2014countries that cooperated with the United States in the war on terrorism or faced terrorist threats themselves. Large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq began to dominate the foreign aid budget and exemplified the emphasis on using foreign aid as a tool of national security. State Department efforts focused extensively on diplomatic security and finding more effective ways of presenting American views and culture through public diplomacy, particularly in Muslim communities. At the same time, the Bush Administration vastly increased aid to combat HIV/AIDS globally, with the creation of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and explored a new approach to development assistance with creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), which supports the development strategies of countries that have demonstrated good governance.", "The Obama Administration has carried forward many Bush foreign aid initiatives, including the MCC, massive global health funding (though the Obama Administration's Global Health Initiative is broader in scope than PEPFAR), and robust assistance to the frontline states of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Funding for these, rather than being in supplemental appropriations requests, however, has been requested within Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) in regular appropriations bills.

", "The OCO designation gained increased significance in August 2011 with enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), as previously discussed, specifying that funds designated as OCO do not count toward the budget caps established by the act. OCO designation makes it possible to keep war-related funding from crowding out core international affairs activities within the budget allocation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently determined, however, that OCO funds are not exempt from the BCA automatic across-the-board reductions that are to occur January 2, 2013.", "The OCO approach is reminiscent of the use of supplemental international affairs appropriations for much of the past decade. Significant emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations were appropriated in FY2002-FY2010 for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, and were not counted toward subcommittee budget allocations. (See Figure 2 below.) The Obama Administration criticized this practice, asserting that after several years such activities should no longer be considered emergencies, and pledged to request funds for these activities through the regular budget process starting in FY2010. This resulted in a sharp increase in base funding in FY2010, yet supplemental international affairs funds were still requested and enacted for that year, largely in response to the earthquake in Haiti, but also for activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The FY2011 funding cycle was the only one in the last decade in which all international affairs funding was appropriated as part of the base budget, before the OCO approach was adopted for FY2012. Unlike supplementals that often have been submitted to Congress separate from regular funding requests, OCO allows all the funding to be considered simultaneously in the regular appropriations process.", "For FY2013, the Administration again used this approach, requesting that $8.24 billion, or about 15% of the international affairs request, be designated as OCO. This amount was 5% less than was requested for OCO in FY2012, and about 26% less than the $11.2 billion that Congress enacted for that year. The House legislation designated $8.3 billion as OCO, similar to the Administration request, but designated proportionately more of the funds within foreign operations accounts and less within State operations accounts.

The FY2012 estimate and FY2013 request in current dollars leveled off largely due to congressional efforts to reduce deficit spending, and after adjusting for inflation, both in constant dollars were below the FY2009 overall funding level.
