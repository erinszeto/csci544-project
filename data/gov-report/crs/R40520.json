Advisory bodies have been created to address a host of issues and can help the government manage and solve complex or divisive issues. Congress, the President, or an agency head may create a federal advisory committee to render independent advice or make policy recommendations to various federal agencies or departments.", "In 1972, Congress enacted the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA; 5 U.S.C. Appendix\u2014Federal Advisory Committee Act; 86 Stat.770, as amended). Enactment of FACA was prompted by the perception that advisory committees were duplicative, inefficient, and lacked adequate control or oversight. FACA mandates certain formal structural and operational requirements, including formal reporting and oversight procedures. Additionally, FACA requires committee meetings be open to the public, unless they meet certain requirements. Also, FACA committee records are to be accessible to the public. Pursuant to statute, the General Services Administration (GSA) maintains and administers management guidelines for federal advisory committees. During FY2011, 1,029 active committees reported a total of 69,750 members. Operating costs for those committees reportedly was $395,179,373, of which $188,342,083 was reportedly spent on federal staff to support the committees' operations.", "FACA was originally enacted to make executive branch advisory committee operations more accessible and transparent. Congress can decide, however, to apply FACA's requirements to a legislative branch advisory committee. Existing statutes are sometimes unclear as to whether a congressionally created committee would have to comply with FACA's requirements\u2014except in cases when the statute includes language that indicates whether the act is to apply.", "In the 112th Congress, one bill has been introduced that would modify FACA's implementation and administration. On October 6, 2011, Representative William Lacy Clay introduced H.R. 3124, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2011. Among other changes, the bill would require the selection of advisory committee members without regard to their partisan affiliation. In addition, H.R. 3124 would create a formal process for the public to recommend potential advisory committee members. The bill seeks to clarify the ethics requirements placed on committee members, and the bill increases records access requirements. On October 6, 2011, the bill was concurrently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Committee on Ways and Means.

Federal advisory committees are one of only a few formalized mechanisms for private-sector citizens to participate in the federal policymaking process.", "Congress, the President, and executive branch agency heads may create advisory bodies. In 1972, the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was enacted to govern advisory committees established or utilized by the President or executive branch agency heads. FACA itself provides a detailed definition of a federal advisory committee. FACA-governed entities are statutorily defined as", "any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as \"committee\"), which is - (A) established by statute or reorganization plan, or (B) established or utilized by the President, or (C) established or utilized by one or more agencies, in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government, except that such term excludes (i) any committee that is composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or employees of the Federal Government, and (ii) any committee that is created by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration.

Otherwise, FACA's application can be determined by examining which branch of the federal government appoints committee members and to which branch of the federal government the committee reports its findings. Whether called commissions, committees, councils, task forces, or boards, these entities have addressed a gamut of public policy issues, offering policy recommendations on topics ranging from organ transplant practices to improving operations at the Department of Homeland Security.

Since the 1840s, Congress has legislated control over federal advisory bodies\u2014mostly by limiting funding and committee member pay. In 1842, for example, a law was enacted that prohibited payment to \"any commission or inquiry, except courts martial or courts of inquiry in the military or naval service\" without explicit \"special appropriations.\" Similarly, in 1909, another law was enacted that prohibited appropriation to \"any commission, council, board, or other similar body ... unless the creation of the same shall be or shall have been authorized by law.\" The law also prohibited the detailing of any federal employee to work on an unauthorized commission.", "By the 20 th century, some Members of Congress believed the executive branch's advisory bodies were inefficient and not accessible to the public. Some Members believed that the public harbored concerns that a proliferation of federal advisory committees had created inefficient duplication of federal efforts. Moreover, some citizens argued that the advisory entities did not reflect the public will, a point that was punctuated by many committees' policies of closed-door meetings. Congress was called on to increase committee oversight and gain some control over the proliferating advisory boards. Subsequently, Congress enacted the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA; 5 U.S.C. Appendix; 86 Stat. 770, as amended). The legislation was enacted in 1972 and requires advisory bodies that fit certain criteria to report annually a variety of information, including membership status and progress, to the General Services Administration (GSA).

The law established the first statutory requirements for management of, access to, and oversight of federal committees. The act requires all advisory committees \"be advisory only,\" and the issues on which they offered determinations are to be \"determined, in accordance with law, by the official, agency, or officer involved.\" FACA allocates a variety of oversight and management responsibilities to the standing committees of Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agency heads, and the President.", "FACA requires congressional committees to review continuously whether existing federal advisory committees that fall under their legislative jurisdiction are necessary or redundant. Congress is also to determine if the committees are \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed.\" FACA committees are to be created with enough autonomy from the appointing power (Congress, the President, or an agency head) as to not be unduly influenced by it. Reporting requirements are to be clearly stipulated, and proper funding and staffing are to be provided. The 1972 statute charted OMB to oversee the management of advisory committees. The OMB director's first mandated task was to review, concurrently with Congress, existing advisory entities to determine whether they should be abolished. The director was to create operating policies for advisory committees, and provide \"advice, assistance, and guidance\" to entities \"to improve their performance.\" The guidelines were to include pay rates for members, staff, and consultants\u2014and catalog overall costs for the committees that were to be used for budget recommendations to Congress. Agencies' heads were to ensure proper implementation of OMB's guidelines, and to \"maintain systematic information on the nature, functions, and operations of each advisory committee within its jurisdiction.\" In December 1977, the duties charged to OMB were reassigned to the General Services Administration (GSA) by E.O. 12024.

", "Data from the FACA Database demonstrate that the increase in the number of committees is prompted by the statutory creation of new committees. The impetus for the decrease in members, however, is more difficult to determine. At a June 21, 2011, meeting with GSA officials who administer the FACA database, the officials said that the increase in FACA committee membership in FY2009 was prompted largely by an increase in the membership on committees that made recommendations about where and how to distribute appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ). ", "FACA requires that advisory committees make their recommendations accessible to the public. All committee meetings that are bound by FACA are presumed to be open to the public, with certain specified exceptions. Adequate notice of meetings must be published in advance in the Federal Register . Subject to certain records protections provided in the Freedom of Information Act, all papers, records, and minutes of meetings must be made available for public inspection. Membership must be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed,\" and the committee should \"not be inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest.\"", "All advisory committees that are subject to FACA must file a charter every two years. The charter must be sent to the appropriate Senate and House committee of jurisdiction, the agency head of the agency in which the committee is located, and the Committee Management Secretariat in GSA. It must include the advisory committee's mandate and duties, frequency of meetings, and membership requirements. GSA is required annually to review advisory committee accomplishments, respond to inquires from agencies that seek to create new advisory bodies, and maintain an online, publicly accessible database of FACA bodies that includes a variety of information about each entity.", "Pursuant to FACA, advisory entities that have at least one member who is not a federal employee are subject to the act. The act requires each agency with an advisory committee to have a committee management officer (CMO) who supervises \"the establishment, procedures, and accomplishments of advisory committees established by that agency.\" Moreover, the CMO is required to maintain advisory committee \"reports, records, and other papers\" related to the entity's proceedings and ensure that the body adheres to the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7552). Also pursuant to FACA, a \"designated federal official\" (DFO) must be present at committee meetings to call and adjourn meetings. According to OMB Circular No. A-135, FACA committees must be \"essential to the performance of a duty or responsibility conveyed upon the executive branch by law.\" The circular then states the following:", "Advisory committees should get down to the public's business, complete it and then go out of business. Agencies should review and eliminate advisory committees that are obsolete, duplicative, low priority or serve a special, rather than national interest.", "All committees created since FACA's enactment are required to sunset after two years, unless legislation creating the entity specifies otherwise or the entity is renewed by the power that created it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies on Federal Advisory Committees", "paragraphs": ["Scholarship on the creation, operations, and effects of federal advisory committees is limited. One study examined ways Congress can design more effective committees and another explored whether advisory committees serve presidential interests. In addition to competing theories on which branch of the federal government advisory committees serve, scholars have not agreed on a single definition for the committees. Although the definition of an advisory committee can vary across the federal government, FACA-governed entities are defined specifically within the act as", "any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as \"committee\"), which is \u2013 established by statute or reorganization plan, or established or utilized by the President, or established or utilized by one or more agencies, in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government, except that such term excludes any committee that is composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or employees of the Federal Government, and (ii) any committee that is created by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration.", "Also pursuant to statute, FACA committees are prohibited from creating policy or issuing regulations. Their role is to remain strictly advisory.", "One researcher stated that advisory committees have traditionally allowed a President to ", "deflect blame, buy time, and give the appearance of action on issues that are too politically charged, too difficult, to solve. In addition, however, various scholars have noted that commissions are used by presidents to garner greater public support for a policy to which the president is already committed; show symbolic concern over a situation at the highest level of government; establish a fact base for others to use; respond to crises; deflect political heat from the president and allow passions to cool when issues become explosive; overcome the \"stovepipes\" and parochial thinking of the permanent bureaucracy; gather more information about a problem and its policy alternatives; forge consensus among the interests represented on the commission itself; and change the hearts and minds of men.", "That same researcher attempted to group commissions into three categories: agenda commissions, which aim to attract support and attention to presidential policy initiatives; information commissions, which are designed to give \"new ideas, new facts, and new analysis to policymakers\"; and political constellation commissions, which seek to \"foster consensus, compromise, and cooperation in a policy domain.\" ", "Another researcher who examined the impetus for committee creation found that some committees are created to acquire new ideas from outside experts. He added, however, that committees may be created to allow politicians to avoid blame for issues that are too cumbersome or too politically charged. Moreover, he stated that Members of Congress may create committees because of the immense workload of legislators. Creating an advisory committee can \"pare down Congress's workload to more manageable dimensions or to handle and manage a problem in a timely manner.\"", "Another FACA study focused on how the structure and composition of a federal advisory committee may affect its deliberative process, and, therefore, its contribution to public policy. Researcher Mark B. Brown studied the requirement that FACA committee membership be \"fairly balanced.\" He argued that the distinction between experts and laypeople in advisory committee membership is arbitrary, na\u00efve, and artificial. Mr. Brown wrote: \"\u2026 most current advisory committee guidelines rest on an untenable double-standard that directs agencies to evaluate potential expert members of advisory committees solely in terms of their professional qualifications and nonexpert members in terms of the political interests.\" It is not true, however, that \"expert\" members of advisory bodies are always treated as not having personal biases. Instead, the federal ethics requirements placed on certain \"expert\" members mandate that they make public certain biases. An expert member who is categorized as a special government employee, for example, is required by federal ethics codes to divulge any potential conflicts of interest and recues him or herself from any actions in which he or she would financially benefit.", "Since FACA's enactment, scholars and practitioners of government have debated whether advisory bodies, in fact, increase public interaction with the federal government. Other debates continue over whether advisory committees have a positive effect on the federal government, or if they are a symptom of a federal government that is not performing properly.", "In March 2012, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that examined FACA and non-FACA federal advisory committees within the Departments of Transportation and Education. GAO used FACA Database documentation and agency official interviews to examine whether the committees were duplicative and whether they were useful. GAO found that while advisory committees are \"generally considered useful and cost efficient mechanisms for federal agencies to obtain advice and input from a range of stakeholders and experts,\" \"the advisory group environment is fluid, and the potential for duplication exists both within and outside the agency.\" GAO made one recommendation to the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Energy: ", "Identify and document specific steps that should be taken in periodically assessing potential duplication and the ongoing need for both FACA and non-FACA groups.", "In addition to the recommendation, GAO noted four practices that it stated can influence the usefulness of an advisory body. The four practices are", "securing clear agency commitment; finding a balance between responsiveness to the agency and independence; leveraging resources through collaboration with similar groups; and evaluating the group's usefulness to indentify future directions for the group or action to improve its usefulness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "When FACA Applies", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, FACA defines an \"advisory committee\" as \"any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof\" that is \"established by statute or reorganization plan,\" \"established or utilized by the President,\" or \"established or utilized by one or more agencies.\" All advisory bodies that fit this definition, however, are not necessarily entities that must adhere to FACA. The Code of Federal Regulations defines an advisory committee nearly identically to FACA's definition, but adds that the body must be created \"for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or on issues or policies within the scope of an agency official's responsibilities.\" In short, FACA applies when an advisory committee is \"either 'established' or 'utilized' by an agency.\" Pursuant to FACA, any advisory body that performs a regulatory or policy-making function cannot be a FACA entity.", "Although both FACA and the Code of Federal Regulations define advisory committees, it may sometimes be unclear whether some advisory committees\u2014especially those created by statute\u2014must adhere to FACA requirements. Advisory committees created by the executive branch that fit FACA criteria are governed by FACA. Advisory committees that are created by statute, however, may or may not be obligated to follow FACA requirements\u2014often depending on which branch of the federal government appoints committee members and to which branch of the federal government the committee must report its findings. If, for example, a statutorily created advisory committee reported only to Congress and to no one within the executive branch, FACA guidelines likely would not apply. If, however, the same committee reported to both Congress and the President, it is unclear whether FACA guidelines would apply. According to GSA, it is generally up to the agency that hosts the advisory body to determine whether FACA statutes are applicable. To avoid confusion over whether a committee is governed by FACA, Members of Congress can include a clause within committee-creating legislation to explicitly clarify whether a committee is to be subject to FACA. ", "While FACA may improve both the reality and perception of transparent governmental operation and accessibility, its requirements may also place a number of additional chartering, record-keeping, notification, and oversight requirements on the entity. In particular, agencies have claimed that compliance with the various FACA requirements are cumbersome and resource intensive, thereby reducing the ability of committees to focus on substantive issues in a spontaneous and timely fashion. Moreover, other scholars have argued that the scope of the openness requirements could have the practical effect of stifling candid advice and discussion within a committee. Congress may choose to exempt a congressionally-created advisory committee from FACA to allow it to operate more quickly than FACA would permit. For example, the requirement that all meetings be posted \"with timely notice\" in the Federal Register can slow down the daily operations of an advisory committee, which will typically not hold meetings until 15 days after the notice is published.", "Committees that consist entirely of part- or full-time federal employees are explicitly exempted from FACA, as are committees created by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration. Committees created by or operating within the Central Intelligence Agency or the Federal Reserve System are also FACA exempt.

Additionally, the Administrative Conference of the United States recommended that agencies \"invite public nominations for potential committee members.\" Congress may consider requiring public comment on membership appointments to advisory committees. Such action may inject FACA committees with the ideas and opinions of new and creative members. Such a requirement, though, could slow down the process of standing up a federal advisory committee.

The charter must identify the authority for the establishment of the committee, including any statutes or other executive branch documents that authorized or required its creation. Advisory committees can be authorized by statute, required by statute, created by executive order, or created by agency authority. The President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, for example, was originally authorized by E.O. 13256 of February 12, 2002. Most recently, on February 26, 2010, Executive Order 13532 renewed the board through December 31, 2012. E.O. 13532 also explicitly rescinded E.O. 13256.

Charters should authorize enough autonomy to ensure that the advisory body operates independently of its host agency as well as the authority that created it. The assigned objectives should be realistically achieved within the time constraints placed on the committee. The committee will also need time to acquire staff, find suitable office space, and address other logistical concerns. Upon completion of these objectives, the committee will need additional time to create a final report, file any required records, and vacate the office space."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Membership", "paragraphs": ["There are few restrictions on the membership of FACA committees.

The size of the committee should be small enough to allow all members a chance to communicate their expertise and opinion, but large enough to maintain a quorum even when members are absent. Size and member appointment, therefore, will largely depend on the committee's functions and mandate. Members are often appointed on a staggered schedule to ensure that there are always a few continuing committee members serving at any given time. Some committees are designed to include specific members of the federal government or their designees. For example, the 15 committee members written into the charter of the U.S. Military Academy Board of Visitors are", "the chairperson of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, or designee; three other members of the Senate designated by the Vice President or the President pro tempore of the Senate, two of whom are members of the Senate Committee on Appropriations; the chairperson of the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, or designee; four other members of the House of Representatives designated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, two of whom are members of the House Committee on Appropriations; and six persons designated by the President.", "Other committee charters contain specific language in their charters that describe certain qualifications or expertise required for membership.
