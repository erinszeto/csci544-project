The pipeline would consist of 875 miles of 36-inch pipe with the capacity to transport 830,000 barrels per day. Because it would cross the Canadian-U.S. border, Keystone XL requires a Presidential Permit from the State Department based on a determination that the pipeline would \"serve the national interest.\" To make its national interest determination (NID), the department considers potential effects on energy security; environmental and cultural resources; the economy; foreign policy, and other factors. Effects on environmental and cultural resources are determined by preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The NID process also provides for public comment and requires the State Department to consult with specific federal agencies.", "TransCanada originally applied for a Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline in 2008. Since then various issues have affected the completion of both the NEPA and NID processes for the project. In particular, during the NID process for the 2008 application, concerns over environmental impacts in the Sand Hills of Nebraska led the state to enact new requirements that would change the pipeline route. Facing a 60-day decision deadline imposed by Congress, the State Department denied the 2008 permit application on the grounds that it lacked information about the new Nebraska route. In May 2012, TransCanada submitted a new application with a modified route through Nebraska, thus beginning a new NEPA and NID process.", "With the release of the final EIS for the new pipeline route in January 2014, the State Department began the current NID process. Public comment on the project, allowed under the Executive Order, ended on March 2014. Federal agency comment on the project was interrupted by state court action in Nebraska, but this litigation was resolved. The department subsequently told federal agencies to provide their input by February 2, 2015. The State Department has not committed to a deadline for issuing its final NID or making a Presidential Permit decision.", "Development of Keystone XL has been controversial. Proponents base their arguments primarily on increasing the diversity of the U.S. petroleum supply and economic benefits, especially jobs. Pipeline opposition stems in part from concern regarding the greenhouse gas emissions from the development of Canadian oil sands, continued U.S. dependency on fossil fuels, and the risk of a potential release of heavy crude. There is also debate about how much Keystone XL crude oil, or petroleum products refined from it, would be exported overseas. Relations between the U.S. and Canadian governments have also been an issue. With the fate of Keystone XL uncertain, Canadian oil producers have pursued other shipment options, including other pipelines and rail.", "In light of what some consider excessive delays in the State Department's permit review, Congress has sought other means to support development of the pipeline. In the 114th Congress, the most significant legislative proposal has been the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act (S. 1), which would have directly approved Keystone XL and put an end to any further review under federal environmental statutes. On January 29, 2015, the Senate passed S. 1 by a vote of 62 to 36. On February 11, the House passed S. 1 by a vote of 270 to 152. The bill was sent to President Obama on February 24th and vetoed the same day.

Up to 12% of the Keystone XL Pipeline's capacity has been set aside to transport Bakken crude. The Bakken transportation contracts improve the economics for the Keystone XL Pipeline, raising the amount of oil slated to flow through the pipeline.

Keystone XL would bring Canada's total petroleum export capacity to the United States via pipeline to over 4.1 Mbpd, enough capacity to carry more than 45% of U.S. crude petroleum imports in 2014. Given that Canada actually supplied the United States with 3.4 Mbpd in 2014, large increases in Canadian supply via pipeline could ultimately be possible, although much of the increased crude supply, while refined domestically, could be destined for foreign markets in the form of refined petroleum products such as diesel fuel.", "Increased energy trade between the United States and Canada is viewed by some pipeline proponents as a major contributor to U.S. energy security.

It is difficult to predict precisely how this competition would play out, but it could take place through shifting discounts or premiums on crude oils from various sources. Thus, it could be possible for Canadian oil supplies to effectively \"push out\" waterborne shipments from other countries, although this would depend on a wide range of market conditions. If Keystone XL is not permitted, the absence of the pipeline may encourage Alberta producers to increase shipments by rail and to find an alternate pipeline export route through either the Canadian East or West Coast. Thus, Canadian supplies may displace heavy oil supplies in overseas markets and potentially lead to relatively more overseas imports coming into the U.S. Gulf Coast.

It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else.\" However the Keystone XL Pipeline's developer, and a number of industry analysts disagree with the President's assertion.

For example, one prominent industry analysis has concluded that \"about 70 percent\" of products refined from Keystone XL crude oil would be consumed in the United States. Pipeline opponents have disputed such conclusions, arguing that recent market data from Gulf Coast refineries suggest much higher exports of refined products from crude carried on Keystone XL. The volume of Keystone XL crude oil\u2014or derived refined products\u2014that may ultimately be exported is dependent upon many constantly changing economic and operational factors.

It is worth noting that even if Keystone XL is built, prices for the oil it carries as well as for domestically produced oil will continue to be affected by international events. Furthermore, as refineries continue to upgrade for the processing of heavy crude, additional heavy crude supplies from Canada may serve to augment, rather than displace, historic crude supplies from countries like Venezuela.

The Final EIS finds:", "the GHG emissions released during the construction period for the project would be approximately 0.24 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MMTCO 2 e) due to land use changes, electricity use, and fuels for construction vehicles (equivalent to 0.004% of U.S. annual GHG emissions) ; the GHG emissions released during normal operations would be approximately 1.44 MMTCO 2 e/year due to electricity use for pumping stations, fuels for maintenance and inspection vehicles, and fugitive emissions (equivalent to 0.2% of U.S. annual GHG emissions); the total, or gross, life-cycle GHG emissions (i.e., the aggregate GHG emissions released by all activities from the extraction of the resource to the refining, transportation, and end-use combustion of refined fuels) attributable to the oil sands crude transported through the proposed pipeline would be approximately 147 to 168 MMTCO 2 e per year (equivalent to 2.2% to 2.6% of U.S. annual GHG emissions); the incremental, or net, life-cycle GHG emissions (i.e., GHG emissions over-and-above those from the crude oils expected to be displaced in U.S. refineries) is estimated to be 1.3 to 27.4 MMTCO 2 e per year (equivalent to 0.02% to 0.4% of U.S. annual GHG emissions); but according to the State Department's market analysis, \"approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including the proposed project, is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United States based on expected oil prices, oil-sands supply costs, transport costs, and supply-demand scenarios.\"", "The crude oil market analysis in the Final EIS is presented separately from the GHG emissions assessment. By determining that the most likely scenario is one in which oil sands production would be unaffected by expected market conditions, the Final EIS implies that the \"incremental\" life-cycle GHG emissions attributable to the oil sands crudes transported through the proposed pipeline are negligible. With this determination, the only difference in estimates between competing scenarios would be attributable to the operational GHG emissions of the alternative modes of transportation (e.g., GHG emissions from rail cars, trucks, or tankers). The Final EIS reports that the annual operational emissions attributed to the \"no action\" alternatives range from 4.0 to 4.4 MMTCO 2 e per year (an increase of 29%-42% over the 3.1 MMTCO 2 e per year in operational emissions for the proposed project inclusive of the existing southern leg)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Debate About the Final EIS", "paragraphs": ["Some stakeholders have questioned many of the conclusions in the Final EIS and argue that the project may have greater climate change impacts than projected by the State Department. They contend that there is nothing presumed or inevitable about the rate of expansion for the Canadian oil sands. Current oil sands projects face a challenging financial environment, and up-front production costs and price differentials are comparatively higher for oil sands crudes, making new investment sensitive to changes in supply costs and global prices. Opponents stress that oil market projections and transportation options are rife with uncertainty, and that the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline could have a much more significant impact on oil sands expansion if a number of key variables differ from the State Department's assumptions. Proponents of the proposed pipeline support a market analysis as outlined in the Final EIS. They argue that as long as there is strong global demand for petroleum products, resources such as the Canadian oil sands will be produced and shipped to markets using whatever route necessary. Furthermore, they estimate that GHG emissions intensities for the Canadian oil sands are currently within the range of many other heavy crude oils, and that in the future Canadian oil sands emissions intensities will only decrease (due to efficiency improvement and technological advances), while those of other crudes around the world will likely increase (due to a heavier resource base). "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oil Spill Concerns and Potential Trade-Offs", "paragraphs": ["Each mode of oil transportation involves some risk, and each has historically resulted in oil spills. Although pipelines and oil tankers transport the vast majority of oil within the United States, other modes of transportation have increased in recent years. In particular, the volume of crude oil carried by rail increased from approximately 4 million barrels in 2010 to approximately 87 million barrels in 2013, a 20-fold increase. Some portion of the recent increase is related to the increase in Canadian oil sands crude production and pending status of the Keystone XL pipeline.", "In its Final EIS for Keystone XL, the State Department used Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration as well as Coast Guard data to compare oil spill frequency and volume by mode of transportation. Between 2002 and 2009, the State Department found:", "pipeline transport has the highest number of barrels released per ton-mile compared to rail and marine transport; and rail transport has the highest number of reported releases per ton-mile compared to pipeline and marine transport.", "Although the capacity of an individual rail car is relatively small, around 700 barrels (29,400 gallons), a major derailment could involve releases from multiple tank cars, resulting in a substantial spill. For example, in 2013, train derailments in Aliceville, AL, and Casselton, ND, each spilled over 10,000 barrels (420,000 gallons) of crude oil. By comparison, the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker in Prince William Sound, Alaska released 260,000 barrels (10.9 million gallons) of crude oil. The largest U.S. pipeline oil spill (that CRS can document) discharged approximately 40,000 barrels (1.7 million gallons) in 1991 near Grand Rapids, MN. Nonetheless, spill volume is arguably a relatively unimportant factor in terms of impacts and cleanup costs. Location matters more: a major spill away from shore will likely cost considerably less to abate than a minor spill in a populated location or sensitive ecosystem. Depending on timing and location, even a small spill can cause significant harm to individual organisms and entire populations.", "Although some might equate rejection of the Keystone XL permit with avoiding oil spills, a more accurate tradeoff would be the risk of spills from this particular pipeline compared to spills from other modes of oil transportation which may be used as alternatives. Keystone XL Pipeline proponents and opponents, including those in the rail industry, have cited their own interpretations of spill data to argue that one transportation mode is significantly riskier than others. However, any such conclusion is open to debate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spill Concerns Specific to Oil Sands Crude", "paragraphs": ["During the first Keystone XL permit and EIS process, a primary topic of debate among stakeholders was whether particular properties of oil sands crude would impose a greater risk of a pipeline oil spill than other crude oil pipelines. To examine these issues, Congress enacted P.L. 112-90 , which ultimately resulted in a 2013 report from the National Research Council (NRC). The central findings of the report included the following:", "The committee does not find any causes of pipeline failure unique to the transportation of diluted bitumen [oil sands crude]. Furthermore, the committee does not find evidence of chemical or physical properties of diluted bitumen that are outside the range of other crude oils or any other aspect of its transportation by transmission pipeline that would make diluted bitumen more likely than other crude oils to cause releases.", "However, the NRC report did not examine how spills of oil sands crude may differ from spills of conventional crude oil. CRS is not aware of an authoritative study that has assessed this topic, but the recent oil sand crude spills may offer some insights. The 2010 pipeline spill (850,000 gallons) that reached Michigan's Kalamazoo River has demonstrated particular cleanup challenges. According to EPA, the oil will not appreciably degrade and it has mixed with sediment on the river bottom. The pipeline owner, Enbridge, estimated cleanup costs would be approximately $1.2 billion, substantially higher than the average cost of cleaning up a similar amount of conventional oil."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues with the Pipeline Route Across Nebraska", "paragraphs": ["During the national interest determination period for the 2008 Presidential Permit application, it became clear that changes to Nebraska law would require the selection of a pipeline route that would avoid the Sand Hills region of Nebraska. The region is unique due to its high concentration of wetlands, extensive areas of very shallow groundwater, and its sensitive ecosystem. The highly porous soil of the Sand Hills makes it a significant recharge zone in the northern Ogallala Aquifer. That is, the sandy, porous soil of the Sand Hills allows a significant amount of surface water to enter (recharge) the aquifer system. Water from the aquifer also accounts for a significant amount of water use\u201478% of the region's public water, 83% of irrigation water in Nebraska, and 30% of water used in the United States for irrigation and agriculture.", "Along the preferred route of the originally proposed pipeline configuration, areas in the Sand Hills region were identified as locations where the water table may be close to the surface. The depth to groundwater is less than 10 feet for approximately 65 miles of the preferred pipeline route in Nebraska. Both the soil porosity and the close proximity of groundwater to the surface increase the potential that a release of oil from the pipeline could contaminate groundwater in the region.", "When the 2008 permit application was denied, TransCanada announced it would work with the Nebraska DEQ to identify a potential pipeline route that would avoid the Sand Hills. On January 13, 2013, the governor of Nebraska approved a proposed reroute of the Keystone XL pipeline through Nebraska, as noted above. However, as stated earlier, a Nebraska District Court ruled that the 2012 state law authorizing the governor to approve TransCanada's pipeline route violated the Nebraska Constitution. Prior to the passage of the 2012 law, that authority rested exclusively with the state's Public Service Commission (PSC). As a result of the court's decision, the governor's approval of the pipeline siting in 2013 was temporarily declared null and void pending appeal.

Historically, the energy relationship between the United States and Canada, while intertwined, has been straightforward\u2014taking the form of a steadily growing southward flow of crude oil to U.S. refineries. Energy products have been traded freely back and forth between the two countries under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and energy transportation infrastructure generally has been constructed as needed with little fanfare.

The governments of British Columbia (B.C.) and Alberta have quarreled over the pipeline. B.C. Premier Christy Clark had laid out five conditions for B.C.'s assent to construction of the pipeline: successful completion of an environmental review; \"world-leading\" marine spill response and land oil-spill prevention; addressing aboriginal legal requirements; treaty rights and opportunities; and a \"fair share\" of economic benefits. Many in British Columbia believe that the province would be subject to most of the risks associated with the pipeline, but the monetary benefit would flow primarily to Alberta. In November 2013, after months of negotiations between the two provinces, the premiers of both provinces announced a framework agreement on inter-provincial energy movement.

Many regard the project as one element of a revitalized energy production sector in North America and urge that U.S. policy should support investment in such infrastructure for economic and national security reasons.

Generally, powers exercised by the executive branch are authorized by legislation or are inherent presidential powers based in the Constitution.

The defendant responded that the authority to issue Presidential Permits for these border-crossing facilities \"does not derive from a delegation of congressional authority ... but rather from the President's constitutional authority over foreign affairs and his authority as Commander in Chief.\" The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota agreed, noting that the defendant's assertion regarding the source of the President's authority has been \"well recognized\" in a series of Attorney General opinions, as well as a 2009 judicial opinion. The court also noted that these permits had been issued many times before and that \"Congress has not attempted to exercise any exclusive authority over the permitting process.
