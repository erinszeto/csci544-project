The responsibility for making these appointments is shared by the President and the Senate. Pursuant to the Constitution's Appointments Clause, the President nominates persons to fill federal judgeships, with the appointment of each nominee also requiring Senate confirmation. Although not mentioned in the Constitution, an important role is also played midway in the appointment process by the Senate Judiciary Committee.", "Presidential Selection of Nominees", "The need for a President to make a circuit or district court nomination typically arises when a judgeship becomes or soon will become vacant. With almost no formal restrictions on whom the President may consider, an informal requirement is that judicial candidates are expected to meet a high standard of professional qualification. By custom, candidates whom the President considers for district judgeships are typically identified by home state Senators if the latter are of the President's party, with such Senators, however, generally exerting less influence over the selection of circuit nominees. Another customary expectation is that the Administration, before the President selects a nominee, will consult both home state Senators, regardless of their party, to determine the acceptability to them of the candidate under consideration.", "In recent Administrations, the pre-nomination evaluation of judicial candidates has been performed jointly by staff in the White House Counsel's Office and the Department of Justice. Candidate finalists also undergo a confidential background investigation by the FBI and an independent evaluation by a committee of the American Bar Association. The selection process is completed when the President, approving of a candidate, signs a nomination message, which is then sent to the Senate.", "Consideration by Senate Judiciary Committee", "Once received by the Senate, the judicial nomination is referred to the Judiciary Committee, where professional staff initiate their own investigation into the nominee's background and qualifications. Also, during this pre-hearing phase, the committee, through its \"blue slip\" procedure, seeks the assessment of home state Senators regarding whether they approve having the committee consider and take action on the nominee.", "Next in the process is the confirmation hearing, where judicial nominees engage in a question and answer session with members of the Judiciary Committee. Questions from Senators may focus, among other things, on a nominee's qualifications, understanding of how to interpret the law, previous experiences, and the role of judges.", "The committee, when it ultimately votes on a nomination, has three reporting options\u2014to report favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. Only on rare occasions has the committee voted to reject a judicial nomination or to report it other than favorably.", "Senate Floor Consideration", "Customarily, most circuit or district court nominations have reached confirmation under the terms of unanimous consent agreements. On this procedural track, the Senate by unanimous consent not only takes up nominations for floor consideration, but also arranges for them to either receive up-or-down confirmation votes or be confirmed simply by unanimous consent. If a roll call vote is asked for, a simple majority of Senators voting, with a minimal quorum of 51 being present, is required to approve a nomination.", "For a minority of judicial nominations, however, particularly those facing strong opposition, the procedural track, for moving forward without unanimous consent, customarily has involved the Senate voting on cloture motions to bring floor debate on them to a close. A simple majority of Senators voting is needed to close debate on all nominations except to the Supreme Court. (Prior to a Senate reinterpretation of its rules in November 2013, a three-fifths majority was required.)", "Nominations Not Confirmed", "Judicial nominations sometimes fail to be confirmed. This occurs most often when nominations in committee or on the Senate's Executive Calendar are returned to the President at the end of a session or upon a recess or more than 30 days. Senate votes rejecting a nomination are rare."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, the President and the Senate share responsibility for making appointments to the Supreme Court, as well as to various lower courts in the federal judiciary. While it is the President who nominates persons to fill federal judgeships, the appointment of each nominee also requires Senate confirmation. ", "Historically, the vast majority of appointments to judgeships in federal courts other than the Supreme Court have typically not engendered much public disagreement between the President and the Senate and between the parties within the Senate. Debate in the Senate over particular lower court nominees, or over the lower court appointment process, was uncommon, with controversy arising over nominees only on rare occasions. Most such nominations typically were both reported out of committee and confirmed by the Senate without any recorded opposition. ", "In recent decades, however, appointments to two kinds of lower federal courts\u2014the U.S. district courts and the U.S. circuit courts of appeals\u2014have often been the focus of heightened Senate interest and debate, as has the process itself for appointing judges to these courts. Given congressional interest in the subject, this report is intended to provide readers with a basic overview of the appointment process for U.S. circuit and district court judges. Accordingly, the report, following a brief background section, describes, in successive parts, the three primary phases of the appointment process, namely", "the selection of judicial nominees by the President, including the key role often played by home state Senators in recommending judicial candidates to the President; the role of the Senate Judiciary Committee in considering and deciding whether to approve and report out the President's judicial nominations to the Senate; and the Senate's floor consideration and confirmation of judicial nominations, through use of either its unanimous consent process or its cloture process.", "The report then discusses the final appointment steps for nominees after Senate confirmation, including receipt of commissions signed by the President and the taking of their oaths of office, as well as various possible outcomes for nominees whose nominations are not confirmed, including the possibility of their being re-nominated. ", "The report's exclusive focus, it should be emphasized, is the process of appointment of U.S. circuit and district court judges through presidential nomination and Senate confirmation . This has been, historically as well as in contemporary times, the process by which the vast majority of circuit and district court judges have been appointed. Not analyzed in this report are judicial appointments that occur on rare occasions when a President exercises his constitutional power to make \"recess appointments,\" a process under which an individual can temporarily take office without Senate confirmation. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background and Context", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. district courts are the trial courts of general federal jurisdiction, while the U.S. circuit courts of appeals are the intermediate appellate courts that generally consider appeals in cases originally decided by the district courts. With the Supreme Court deciding fewer than 100 cases per term, the district and circuit courts, one scholar has written, \"today serve as the final arbiter of more than 99 percent of all federal court litigation,\" with \"important policy ... being made every day in the lower federal courts.\" Ruling on a wide range of issues, the lower courts, and the persons selected to serve as judges on those courts, arguably have become of much more interest and concern to Congress in recent decades than they were historically.", "As congressional interest in the lower federal courts has heightened, the judicial appointment process in turn has often been at the center of Senate debate. In committee and on the Senate floor, Senators periodically have debated over the standards to use in evaluating judicial nominees; over whether certain nominees, if confirmed, would be impartial judges or bring with them ideological agendas or other disqualifying biases; or over how promptly or deliberately to act on judicial nominations. ", "The judicial confirmation process in the Senate also is longer than it was historically. During the three most recent presidencies (of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama), the Senate has, on average, taken much more time to confirm district and circuit court nominees than it did previously\u2014with average times from date of first nomination to confirmation no longer measured in weeks but in multi-month or half-year periods. Perhaps indicative of a more contentious process, the Senate in recent years has been confirming fewer district and circuit nominees by unanimous consent or voice vote than previously, increasingly voting instead by roll call, often with some, and occasionally with a substantial minority of, Senators casting \"nay\" votes. ", "Periodically during recent presidencies, the Senate has been divided over when or whether to hold up-or-down confirmation votes. Illustrative of such division have been occasions where motions filed by Senators of the President's party to close debate on particular nominations have, in roll call votes, been opposed, and sometimes defeated, by a substantial number of \"nay\" votes cast by Senators of the other party. ", "Frequently, debate over judicial nominations also has centered on the general pace at which the Senate should process the nominations. In a recurring pattern of this debate over recent years, Senators of the President's party, on the one hand, have accused the other party of generally engaging in \"obstructionism\" or tactics designed to delay or block committee or full Senate action on particular or even relatively large numbers of judicial nominations. Senators of the opposite party, on the other hand, have denied engaging in delaying tactics against judicial nominations, while asserting a Senate duty, under the Constitution's Appointments Clause, to deliberately review the qualifications of judicial nominees rather than to rush or \"rubber stamp\" the processing of their nominations. Often, in this debate, a related Senate concern has been the number of district or circuit judgeships vacant at that particular time. Senators, along party lines, have differed over whether judicial vacancy levels, when relatively high, were primarily due to delays by the President in making judicial nominations, or to delays by the Senate in confirming them. ", "Recent frustrations over the judicial appointment process led to a bipartisan agreement reached on January 25, 2013, early in the first session of the 113 th Congress. That day, by a 78-16 vote approving S.Res. 15 , the Senate established a standing order of the Senate which could accelerate the consideration of nominations, including those to the district courts. The standing order, applicable only in the 113 th Congress, significantly reduced (from 30 to 2 hours) the maximum time for consideration of district court nominations after at least three-fifths of the Senate had agreed that debate on the nominations should be brought to a close. The order excluded circuit court nominations (as well as nominations to the Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, and major executive branch positions), for which the length of \"post-cloture\" consideration, under Senate rules, continued to be 30 hours. ", "Throughout the rest of 2013, however, the Senate again found itself periodically divided, along party lines, over judicial nominations. At issue was how quickly the Senate should act on lower court nominations in general, and whether or when various circuit court nominations pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar should receive confirmation votes. Late in the session, confirmation votes on three circuit court nominations were prevented when motions to close Senate debate on them received only simple majority votes in favor, rather than the three-fifths supermajority then required under Senate rules to close debate. These episodes (along with a simple Senate majority unable again, under similar circumstances, to close debate on an executive branch nomination) set the stage for the Senate's majority leader, shortly thereafter, to put before that body the following issue: Whether, as the majority leader proposed, the Senate should change its procedure to require only a simple majority vote in order to close debate on nominations\u2014thereby more easily reaching confirmation votes, including those on circuit and district court nominations. The proposed procedural change was referred to by some Senate Members, as well as by outside observers and news media reports, as the \"nuclear option.\" ", "On November 21, 2013, the proposed change in procedure was considered by the Senate. By a vote of 52-48, it overturned a ruling of the chair and set a precedent that lowered the vote threshold required by the Senate for \"invoking cloture\" (closing debate) on most presidential nominations. Specifically, the Senate reinterpreted the provisions of Senate Rule XXII to require only a simple majority of those voting, rather than three-fifths of the full Senate, to close debate on all presidential nominations except those to the Supreme Court.", "The November 21, 2013, reinterpretation of its cloture rule ushered in a significant change in the way that the Senate thereafter processed circuit and district court nominations. For the rest of the 113 th Congress, until the day of its final adjournment almost 13 months later, cloture motions, rather than unanimous consent (UC) agreements, were the invariable procedural tool used in the Senate to reach confirmation votes on these nominations. Specifically, from November 21, 2013, through December 15, 2014, the process for every confirmed circuit or district court nomination involved the filing of a cloture motion, with the Senate then voting to invoke cloture. With a vote threshold needed to close debate lower during this period than it was previously, every motion filed to close Senate debate on a circuit or district court nomination succeeded, followed in turn by each nomination receiving Senate confirmation. During this period, no confirmations of circuit or district court nominations were reached through the unanimous consent process. ", "The Senate, however, would eventually return to using unanimous consent agreements to reach confirmation votes on judicial nominations. On December 16, 2014, the day of the final adjournment of the 113 th Congress, the Senate reverted, for the first time in more than a year, to using a UC agreement, rather than the cloture process, to reach confirmation votes on district court nominations. Regular reliance on UC agreements to process judicial nominations returned in the 114 th Congress, coinciding with a change in party control of the Senate. In this Congress, the party not of the President was the new Senate majority, precluding continued use of the cloture process by the President's party to secure confirmations by party line or near party line votes. Instead, circuit and district court nominations in the 114 th Congress thus far have received Senate confirmation votes only pursuant to unanimous consent agreements requested by the majority leader or his designee.", "In future Congresses, the relative extent to which the Senate will rely on the unanimous consent or the cloture process to confirm judicial nominations remains to be seen. Accordingly, given the potential future relevance of both approaches to the Senate, this report, in its discussion of Senate floor consideration of judicial nominations, describes in some detail the two alternate procedural paths that the Senate has taken in recent years when arranging for such nominations to receive confirmation votes.

A judicial vacancy is created by an incumbent judge assuming part-time duties as a \"senior status\" judge; by a judge's retirement, resignation, or death; or by his or her elevation to a higher court. Judicial vacancies also arise when legislation is enacted creating new judgeships that are to be filled for the first time. ", "Judges with imminent departure plans frequently give several months of advance notice, permitting the search for judicial replacement candidates to begin even before the vacancy occurs. The stated policy preference of the federal judiciary is that circuit and district court judges intending to leave full-time active status notify the President and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts \"as far in advance as possible.\" (According to the judiciary, over fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the average advance notice provided by outgoing circuit and district court judges ranged from a low of 106 days in FY2009 to a high of 196 days in FY2011.) ", "Occasionally, a judge also will give notice of the intention to leave office not on a specified future date, but upon the Senate's confirmation of his or her successor. In these circumstances, because of the conditional nature of the outgoing judge's departure, the President's selection of a nominee to succeed the judge necessarily will occur before there is a judicial vacancy.

It is a well-established practice, however, that candidates for nomination to circuit and district court judgeships are rigorously evaluated for their degree of professional qualification at successive points in the selection process. Expectations that circuit and district court nominees meet a high standard of professional qualification have particularly been fostered by the long-standing role of a committee of the American Bar Association (a role dating back to the early 1950s) in evaluating and rating a President's judicial candidates.

Scholars also have suggested that in recent decades an informal qualification requirement for judicial candidate has been that their selection be acceptable to the President's political base and to interest groups whose support is important to the President.

In nearly all cases, a fundamental starting requirement for judicial candidates presumably will be that any person selected have the professional qualifications, integrity, and judicial temperament needed to perform capably as a federal judge. Also, a Senator likely will be guided by at least some political party considerations in the judicial candidate search. (Traditionally, scholars have found, the overwhelming majority of all federal judicial nominees come from the same party as the nominating President.) Further, a Senator may evaluate the suitability of a judicial candidate according to whether certain groups or constituencies are adequately represented on the court in question.

Whereas home state Senators of the President's party often, if not always, dictate whom the President nominates to district judgeships, their recommendations for circuit court nominees, by contrast, typically compete with names suggested to the Administration by other sources or generated by the Administration on its own.

On the other hand, a \"not qualified\" rating may be a reason for the President not to nominate. In such instances, another pre-nomination consideration is that the \"not qualified\" rating, and the reasons for it, will be publicly disclosed if the candidate is nominated.

This factor would be important if, in future Congresses, it discouraged a Senate majority from readily using the cloture process and inclined it instead to seek unanimous consent to consider judicial nominations.

After November 21, 2013, many nominations were able to be considered in the 113 th Congress through the cloture process in part because the maximum time for post-cloture consideration had been temporarily lowered to two hours for district court nominations (and to eight hours for many executive branch nominations), and half of that time could be yielded back by the majority.
