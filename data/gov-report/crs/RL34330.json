The KORUS FTA entered into force on March 15, 2012.", "With the KORUS FTA now in force for over two years, focus has shifted from the debate over its passage to its implementation, economic impact, and effect on future U.S. FTAs. Some U.S. companies have argued that certain aspects of the KORUS agreement are not being implemented appropriately, citing issues related to rules of origin verification, express delivery shipments, data transfers, and pending auto regulations. In addition, a widening trade deficit with South Korea since the implementation of the agreement has led some observers to argue the agreement has not benefitted the U.S. economy, but it is difficult to distinguish the KORUS FTA's impact on U.S.-South Korea trade patterns from the impact of other economic variables. As the largest of the recently passed U.S. FTA's, perceptions of the KORUS FTA's economic impact and concerns over its implementation may influence congressional debate in the new FTAs now under negotiation, specifically the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which South Korea has signaled an interest in joining, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) between the United States and the European Union.", "The KORUS FTA is the second-largest U.S. FTA (next to NAFTA). In goods trade in 2013, South Korea was the sixth-largest trading partner of the United States, and the United States was South Korea's second-largest trading partner. The KORUS FTA covers a wide range of trade and investment issues and, therefore, could have significant economic implications for both the United States and South Korea.", "Congress approved the KORUS FTA implementing legislation using expedited procedures authorized by Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Under TPA, which expired in 2007, the President had the discretion on when to submit the implementing legislation to Congress. The KORUS FTA was negotiated and signed on June 30, 2007, by President George W. Bush. However, President Bush did not submit the legislation because of differences with the Democratic leadership over treatment of autos and beef, among other issues. On December 3, 2010, after a series of negotiations, President Obama and South Korean President Lee announced that they had reached an agreement on addressing the outstanding issues related to the KORUS FTA. As a result, the final implementing legislation modified certain provisions of the 2007 agreement, primarily focused on trade in agriculture and autos.", "A broad swath of the U.S. business community supported the KORUS FTA. With the modifications in the commitments reached in December 2010, the three Detroit-based auto manufacturers and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union changed their positions and backed the agreement. Other labor unions and some nongovernmental organizations opposed the agreement. Many U.S. supporters viewed the KORUS FTA as important to secure new opportunities in the South Korean market, while opponents claimed that the KORUS FTA did not go far enough to break down South Korean trade barriers or that it would benefit U.S. corporations without producing gains for U.S. workers.

While most of the agreement's provisions went into effect immediately, some are being phased in over the next several years.", "The United States and South Korea entered into the KORUS FTA as a means to further solidify an already strong bilateral economic relationship. The United States specifically sought increased access to South Korean markets for agricultural products, manufactured goods, services, and foreign investment. The United States likely also sought to maintain its competitiveness in South Korea in the face of Seoul's FTA negotiations with other major trading partners, including the European Union. For South Korean leaders, the KORUS FTA was a mechanism to promote reform in its own economy and also to gain greater access to the U.S. market for autos and other manufactured goods.", "In general and in the short- to medium-term, the KORUS FTA's largest commercial effects are expected to be microeconomic in nature. In other words, from the perspective of specific industries, the agreement may have a noticeable impact even if its economy-wide effects are modest. However, the increase in the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea since the agreement's entry into force has caused some observers to question the benefits of the agreement, although other factors\u2014including a decrease in South Korea's rate of economic growth\u2014may have been the main drivers of evolving trade patterns.", "As discussed in the \" Implementation Issues \" section below, some U.S. companies have argued that certain aspects of the KORUS agreement are not being implemented appropriately. For instance, U.S. exporters have claimed the agreement's effectiveness has been diminished by South Korean customs authorities requiring allegedly excessive documentation to certify rules of origin of imports of U.S. products. U.S. manufacturers also have raised concerns that a proposed South Korean tax credit/tax penalty program for car purchases may discriminate against imports of U.S.-made cars. South Korean and U.S. officials are reportedly working to resolve these issues.", "Perceptions about the KORUS FTA and its provisions may influence other U.S. trade negotiations, as well as congressional debate over their potential implementation. The most prominent of these is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation FTA negotiation that now includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam, and in which South Korea has signaled an interest in participating. Views on the relative benefits of KORUS may also affect the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) negotiations between the United States and the European Union.", "Many observers have argued that in addition to its economic implications, the KORUS FTA has diplomatic and security implications. For example, they have suggested that it will deepen the U.S.-South Korean alliance by strengthening the bilateral economic relationship. The United States and South Korea have been allies since the United States intervened on the Korean Peninsula in 1950 and fought to repel a North Korean takeover of South Korea.", "This report examines the provisions of the KORUS FTA and issues related to its implementation in the context of the overall U.S.-South Korean economic relationship, U.S. objectives, and South Korean objectives.

Tariffs and import quotas on most other agricultural goods will be phased out within 10 years, with a few commodities and food products subject to provisions that phase out such protection by year 23. However, because of their sensitivity, duty-free access for several U.S. products will slowly expand in perpetuity but remain subject to South Korean import quotas.", "Much effort went into negotiating provisions covering four agricultural commodities of export interest to the United States. Under the KORUS FTA, South Korea agreed to eliminate its 40% tariff on beef muscle meats imported from the United States over a 15-year period. However, negotiators did not reach a breakthrough by the end of the talks on the separate but parallel issue of how to resolve differences on the terms of access for all U.S. beef in a way that would address Korea's human health concerns arising from the 2003 discovery of mad cow disease in the U.S. cattle herd. It was only following the conclusion one year later of a difficult series of negotiations on a separate bilateral understanding on the terms of U.S. beef access to the South Korean market\u2014accompanied by widespread public protests in Korea\u2014that shipments resumed in July 2008.", "Negotiations on access for U.S. rice and oranges into the South Korean market also were contentious. Rice was a \"make-or-break\" issue for Seoul, and excluded at South Korea's insistence out of U.S. recognition that if pushed, the talks would likely have collapsed. Special treatment for U.S. oranges was agreed to at the last moment, when negotiators compromised on a multi-part solution expected to increase U.S. navel orange exports over time. In the December 2010 changes to the initial agreement, Korea secured a two-year extension in the tariff phase-out for one commercially important line of U.S. frozen pork product in return for changes the United States sought in its commitments under the auto and other provisions. In June 2011, South Korea's trade minister clarified that the use of certain generic names by U.S. cheese exporters selling to that market will not be restricted by provisions in the EU-Korea (KOREU) FTA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Automobiles", "paragraphs": ["Trade in autos and auto parts proved to be among the most contentious areas tackled by U.S. and South Korean negotiators. In recent years, South Korean auto manufacturers have increased their market share through imports and expanded car production in the United States and other major automotive markets like the European Union. U.S. industry argued that South Korea should eliminate policies and practices that seemingly discriminate against U.S. auto imports. In December 2010, the United States and South Korea reached a joint understanding on automotive trade. Due to these modifications, all three U.S. automakers ultimately supported the KORUS FTA. A detailed discussion of the auto-specific provisions is provided later in this report. A few of the most important provisions are discussed below.", "The United States will eliminate its tariff of 2.5% on passenger cars, including electric and hybrid vehicles, as of 2016. South Korea cut its passenger car tariff to 4% upon implementation of the KORUS FTA and will remove the remaining tariff in 2016. For trucks, South Korea dropped its 10% duty upon implementation, while the U.S. tariff of 25% will remain in place for seven years and then be phased out entirely by 2021. The KORUS FTA also includes a \"snapback provision\" that allows the United States to reinstate its 2.5% passenger car tariff, once the duties are completely eliminated, if U.S. automakers claim and the dispute settlement panel finds that South Korea is in violation of the agreement. The snapback could also be imposed due to violations regarding imports of trucks. South Korean commitments regarding a specified group of new and already proposed regulations on automobile fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions do not seem to be enforceable under the dispute settlement provisions of the KORUS FTA; presumably the snapback will not apply to these commitments. A special motor vehicle safeguard allows the United States to take action if there are \"any harmful surges in South Korean auto imports due to the agreement.\" A safeguard can be initiated by the United Auto Workers union, the domestic auto industry, or the U.S. government. The remedy for finding injury is a snapback to the original tariff levels in place prior to the implementation of the FTA. This remedy can be used more than once and is available for a period of up to 10 years after the concerned tariffs are eliminated. As a remedy under the auto-specific safeguard, the United States will be able to re-impose the 2.5% passenger vehicle tariff. South Korean assembly production in the United States rose to almost 770,000 cars and light trucks in 2013. At more than 750,000 units, nearly an equal number of passenger vehicles and light trucks were imported from South Korea in 2013, up 28% from two years earlier. If U.S.-based producers\u2014including foreign-owned automakers such as BMW or Toyota\u2014meet U.S. federal safety standards, each manufacturer can export as many as 25,000 cars directly to South Korea from the United States without complying with South Korean safety standards. Additionally, they must satisfy KORUS FTA domestic content provisions. U.S. automakers also have some flexibility to be considered in compliance with new South Korean fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards. The Koreans made some concessions on issues that were seen as non-tariff barriers to auto trade involving safety and environmental (e.g., fuel economy and emissions) standards. Trade data show that exports of U.S. autos to South Korea have risen in recent years measured by dollar value and number of units. Sales of \"Detroit 3\" cars in Korea grew 20% to more than 11,600 cars in 2013, a difference of almost 2,000 cars from 2012, with Ford vehicles representing the majority. However, it is too early to make any conclusive observations about the benefits or disadvantages of the KORUS FTA for the auto industry. A two-year snapshot can be misleading, especially since tariffs are still being phased out.

The two countries agreed to liberalize trade in services by opening up their markets beyond what they have committed to do in the World Trade Organization (WTO). About 60% of U.S.-South Korea trade in textiles and apparel became duty-free immediately, and the KORUS FTA will provide a special safeguard mechanism to reduce the impact of textile and apparel import surges.

The FTA allows for the United States to exempt imports from South Korea from a \"global\" escape clause (\u00a7201) measure if they are not a major cause of serious injury or a threat of serious injury to the U.S. domestic industry. The FTA also provided for a binational consultative committee for information sharing on trade remedy matters.", "In addition, South Korea and the United States agreed to establish an independent body, a Medicines and Medical Devices Committee, to review recommendations and determinations regarding South Korean pricing and government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals and medical devices and to improve transparency in the process for making those determinations.", "Furthermore, one year after the KORUS FTA entered into force, a binational committee was to be formed to study the possibility of eventually expanding the agreement's coverage to products from \"Outward Processing Zones,\" including the Kaesong Industrial Complex and/or other future zones located in North Korea.

As a result, U.S. and South Korean negotiators agreed to modifications to some of the commitments made in the 2007 agreement. These modifications, which were signed on February 10, 2011, are in the form of an \"exchange of letters\" and two \"agreed minutes.\" They pertained mostly to the auto provisions and included changes in phase-out periods for tariffs on autos and pork, a new safeguard provision on autos, and concessions by South Korea to allow a larger number of U.S. cars into South Korea under U.S. safety standards than was the case under the original KORUS FTA provisions.", "On October 3, 2011, President Obama submitted draft implementing legislation ( H.R. 3080 / S. 1642 ) to both houses of Congress.

The same day, the Assembly passed over a dozen implementing bills. The debate over the agreement's ratification was contentious and divisive, despite the fact that President Lee's party, the conservative Grand National Party (GNP) , controlled the National Assembly. Korea's largest opposition party, the left-of-center Democratic Party (DP) , strongly opposed the agreement. The final vote was held only after the GNP surprised the opposition by convening a special session for a snap vote. During parliamentary and presidential elections in 2012, several prominent DP candidates called for renegotiating parts or even all of the KORUS FTA. However, the issue appears to have faded since that time, in large part because the GNP's successor party retained control of both the presidency and the National Assembly in the 2012 elections.

A primary objective of the United States was to gain greater access to South Korean markets in agricultural products, autos, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, some other high-technology manufactured goods, and services, particularly financial and professional services\u2014areas in which U.S. producers are internationally competitive. In addition, the United States sought to establish updated trade and investment disciplines in the dynamic and trade-oriented East-Asian region.", "Launching the FTA negotiations was largely at the initiative of South Korea. Its main objective in securing an FTA with the United States was much broader than gaining reciprocal access to the U.S. market. South Korean exporters already had a significant presence in areas in which they have proved to be competitive. Instead, entering an FTA with the United States meshed with a number of former South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun's long-term domestic economic and strategic goals. Roh made an FTA the top economic priority for the remainder of his tenure, which ended in February 2008. Soon after his election in 2002, Roh committed himself to raising South Korea's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) to $20,000 by the end of the decade and to transforming South Korea into a major \"economic hub\" in Northeast Asia by expanding the economic reforms begun by his predecessor following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Ongoing competitive pressure from Japanese firms, increased competition from Chinese enterprises, and the rapid ageing of the South Korean workforce has heightened the sense of urgency about boosting national competitiveness. Former President Lee Myung-bak, who succeeded Roh in December 2007, made the economy the centerpiece of his campaign and supported the KORUS FTA as part of a larger program to promote South Korean economic growth. ", "During the negotiations, South Korean officials and other South Korean proponents of the KORUS FTA tended not to focus on the increased access to the U.S. market. Rather, they emphasized the medium and long-term gains that would stem from increased allocative efficiency of the South Korean economy, particularly in the services industries. This would presumably be brought about by an influx of U.S. investment and technology into South Korea and by the spur of increased competition with U.S. firms. Some, however, raised concerns that an FTA would worsen South Korea's income gap, and during the talks, there were continuous and often large scale anti-FTA protests, generally led by South Korean farmers and trade unionists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Policy Goals", "paragraphs": ["The United States and South Korea negotiated the KORUS FTA in part as a means to strengthen and restore the health of a critical foreign policy and national security alliance.

These tensions decreased markedly in 2007, following the Bush Administration's decision to place greater emphasis on engagement and negotiations with North Korea. The December 2007 election of Lee, who stressed the importance of rebuilding U.S.-South Korean ties improved relations further. Thus, with the alliance on firmer ground, by 2009 the KORUS FTA no longer appeared to be an exceptional area of bilateral cooperation.", "Although the FTA's utility as an acute salve for the alliance was reduced, some argue it will help to boost the alliance over the medium and longer term, by deepening bilateral economic and political ties. Entering into an FTA, some argue, was a way to help reorient the alliance to adapt to the changes on the Korean Peninsula and in East Asia. However, in concrete terms, it is difficult to see how the KORUS FTA has made or will make a significant difference in the strategic relationship, as it is not clear that it has altered either country's fundamental interests on the Peninsula or in Northeast Asia.", "In contrast, while the passage of the KORUS FTA was unlikely to have a major substantive impact on the strategic relationship, a collapse of the KORUS FTA would probably have had a profound symbolic effect, particularly upon the way South Koreans view the alliance. If the KORUS FTA had been rejected or subjected to a prolonged delay by the United States, it would have been a psychological blow to many South Korean policymakers, many of whom would likely have seen it as a betrayal. This would be particularly true since, in their eyes, they made politically costly concessions on autos, beef, labor, and the environment to help ensure the agreement would be more favorably received in the U.S. Congress. The KORUS FTA's failure in the United States, according to some Korean politicians and policymakers, would have lent credence to arguments in South Korea that the U.S. commitment to Korea and Northeast Asia was declining.

In general, U.S. exporters and trade negotiators identify the lack of transparency of South Korea's trading and regulatory systems as the most significant barriers to trade with South Korea in almost every major product sector. Many U.S. government officials also raise concerns that Seoul continues to use government regulations and standard-setting powers to discriminate against foreign firms in politically-sensitive industries, such as automobiles and telecommunications. Another issue of concern is that rigidities in the South Korean labor market, such as mandatory severance pay, raise the cost of investing and doing business. Finally, the United States and other countries have pressed South Korea to open further its agricultural market, which is considered one of the most closed among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The intensity of these disputes has diminished considerably in the past two decades, in part due to reforms enacted following the near collapse of the South Korea economy in 1997, and South Korea has become more open to foreign investors, such that many U.S. firms now have a significant presence in South Korea.

The USITC study concluded that U.S. GDP would be higher by $10.1 billion to $11.9 billion (approximately 0.1%) when the KORUS FTA is fully implemented, a negligible amount given the size of the U.S. economy. The USITC based this estimate primarily on the removal of tariffs and tariff rate quotas, that is, barriers that can be relatively easily quantified. The study concluded that U.S. exports of goods would likely be higher by $9.7 billion to $10.9 billion, primarily in agricultural products, machinery, electronics, transportation equipment, including passenger vehicles and parts. U.S. imports would increase $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion, primarily in textiles, apparel, leather products, footwear, machinery, electronics, and passenger vehicles and parts.", "The estimates did not take into account the impact of the reduction of barriers to trade in services and foreign investment flows and changes in regulations as a result of the KORUS FTA. The study noted that U.S. exports in services would increase as a result of South Korean commitments under the KORUS FTA, and that changes in the regulatory environment in both countries would also help to increase bilateral trade and investment flows.", "The ITC study estimated that changes in aggregate U.S. employment would be negligible given the much larger size of the U.S. economy compared to the South Korean economy. However, while some sectors, such as livestock producers, were estimated to experience increases in employment, others such as textile, wearing apparel, and electronic equipment manufacturers were expected to experience declines in employment.", "Other studies draw similar conclusions, although the magnitudes differ because they employ different models from the USITC study. For example, a University of Michigan analysis commissioned by the Korea Economic Institute estimated that U.S. GDP will increase by $25.12 billion (0.14% of U.S. GDP). This is larger than the USITC estimate partly because it estimated the effects of liberalization in services trade. The authors also analyzed the impact of a KORUS FTA before the final text had been released and assumed, among other things, that rice trade would be liberalized, which, in the end, was not the case.", "In December 2005, the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP) published a study measuring the potential economic impact of the KORUS FTA on South Korea alone. The study estimated some of the dynamic, or long-run, economic effects, in addition to the static, one-time effects.

By the tenth year of the agreement, the figures are estimated to be 99% and 98%, respectively, with tariff elimination occurring in stages and the most sensitive products, such as agricultural products, having the longest phase-out periods. Non-tariff barriers in goods trade and barriers in services trade and foreign investment also will be reduced or eliminated under the KORUS FTA. ", "Assessing the impact of the KORUS FTA on U.S.-South Korea trade flows and the U.S. economy is a difficult question to answer definitively for several reasons. First, assessing the impact of a policy change (the KORUS FTA) on an economic variable (trade flows) requires a careful analysis that takes into account other variables, which may also affect the outcome. Without a more dynamic modeling framework that accounts for these other variables, one may attribute a change in the trade balance to the KORUS FTA when a change in exchange rates or aggregate demand, for example, is actually responsible. In addition, the KORUS FTA has only been in effect for about two years, making it difficult to discern its long-term direct economic and trade effects on the United States. Tariffs on the most sensitive products will be phased out over several more years, and production and consumption patterns take time to adjust. Indeed, the benefits of trade agreements are generally long-term in nature, accruing gradually over time.", "In addition, aggregate data on trade flows may not capture the full impact of the agreement. Any significant effects of the KORUS FTA are more likely to be evident on individual firms and industries rather than trade flows as a whole. Moreover, some of the potential benefits of freer trade, which include lower-priced and more diverse goods and services, as well as improved productivity among firms, cannot be easily measured by trade balances.", "With these challenges in mind Table 1 and the discussion that follows provides an examination of U.S. trade flows with South Korea since 2011, the last full year prior to the KORUS FTA's entry into force. From 2011 to 2013, U.S. goods exports to South Korea decreased from $41.3 billion to $39.2 billion (5% decrease), while imports increased from $56.0 billion to $62.1 billion (11% increase). This caused the U.S. goods trade balance with South Korea to decrease (become more negative) from $-14.7 billion to -$23.0 billion (56% decrease). During the same period, U.S. services exports increased from $16.7 billion to $20.9 billion (25% increase), while imports increased from $9.7 billion to $10.8 billion (10% increase), such that the U.S. services trade balance with South Korea increased from $6.9 billion to $10.1 billion (46% increase).", "The increase in the U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea since the implementation of the KORUS FTA has caused concern among some U.S. policymakers. Some of the decrease in exports to South Korea, a contributor to the rising trade deficit, is likely due to fluctuations in the business cycle in South Korea during the same time period and is not unique to the United States. Figure 1 charts the annual percent change of South Korea's imports from the world and the United States as well as its annual change in GDP.

The customs office of each trading partner applies procedures to determine whether an import from an FTA partner country meets the criteria under the rules of origin provisions of the FTA and therefore qualifies for the preferential treatment (i.e., the lower tariffs or duty free treatment). U.S. exporters have raised concerns that South Korean Customs Service (KCS) procedures require excessive documentation, unduly burdening importers of U.S. products and undermining the effectiveness of the FTA by eliminating the companies' tariff benefits. The U.S. government has questioned negative KCS rulings on imports of U.S.-origin products such as frozen orange juice concentrate, chemicals, cars, and other products. USTR and CBP reportedly are working with KCS to resolve this issue, and recent positive rulings may suggest some improvements have been made. Express delivery packages . U.S. officials have also raised concerns that South Korea may not be abiding by KORUS FTA requirements that express deliveries of packages of less than $200 in value be exempt from formal entry document requirements, thus slowing down shipments. Data transfers . The KORUS FTA includes provisions allowing financial services companies operating in South Korea to process data off-shore and new regulations in South Korea allow for such activities. U.S. companies have raised concerns, however, with the discretion afforded regulators in determining whether or not data offshoring activities are permissible. The South Korean government has agreed to review implementation quarterly of its commitments on data transfers. Proposed a utomotive regulations . The South Korean government has proposed a new regulation on auto sales intended to incentivize consumers to purchase cars with lower greenhouse gas emissions, generally closely correlated with engine size. U.S. automakers are particularly concerned about a potential tax penalty for consumers purchasing cars with a higher emissions profile, which they claim could effectively eliminate the tariff benefits they receive through the KORUS FTA. The South Korean government is reviewing the proposed regulation scheme, which was to be implemented in January 2015. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices . U.S. industry has raised concerns over a new pricing regime for pharmaceuticals in South Korea that they argue may undervalue new drugs. U.S. business groups also claim that the South Korean government's proposed patent linkage system, which is required under the KORUS FTA, may be biased toward generic drug manufacturers.", "U.S. industry has also suggested that factors not adequately covered in the KORUS FTA may be negatively impacting their ability to export to South Korea.

Furthermore, as one of the most recent U.S. FTAs to be implemented the KORUS FTA reflects the most current U.S. trade and investment policy priorities of any existing FTA and its provisions likely serve as a starting point for current U.S. trade negotiations. The agreement also reflects both U.S. and South Korean use of bilateral trade agreements, alternative efforts to the WTO and the multilateral trading system, to achieve trade and investment liberalization.

South Korea's decision to negotiate and implement a comprehensive FTA with the United States may also influence these other region-wide trade policies.

RCEP includes the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as Australia, China, India, Japan, and New Zealand, and is the other major Asia-Pacific trade initiative in addition to the TPP.", "Some observers note that the KORUS FTA may have sparked the interest of other Asia-Pacific countries to negotiate FTAs with the United States, such as Japan's entry, in July 2013, into the TPP negotiations. Japan and South Korea trade similar products with the United States, and despite generally low U.S. import tariffs, the KORUS FTA now provides South Korea with a competitive advantage in the U.S. market. Japan's entry into the TPP negotiations may likewise have prompted South Korea's interest in joining TPP. In the fall of 2013, South Korea announced its interest in participating in the TPP negotiations, despite existing trade agreements with a number of the TPP participants, including the United States. While the U.S. Administration has welcomed South Korea's interest, President Obama highlighted that full implementation of the KORUS FTA would help prepare South Korea to \"meet the high standards of the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" and the Administration also appears to wish to conclude an initial TPP agreement with current members before allowing new negotiating partners to participate.

The USITC estimated that the increase in U.S. exports of agricultural commodities and processed foods will account for up to one-third of the entire projected increase in total U.S. exports to South Korea's market once the KORUS FTA's provisions are fully implemented. It projected that the sale of agricultural products to South Korea would be $1.9 billion to $3.8 billion (44% to 89%) higher, compared to what exports would be under a no-agreement scenario. Almost half of this export increase would accrue to the U.S. beef sector, based on the USITC's assumption that U.S. beef exports recover to the level before South Korea imposed import restrictions in late 2003. About 20% of the export increase would benefit U.S. producers and exporters of pork, poultry and other meat products. In another analysis, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) projected that U.S. agricultural exports by the end of the transition period would be more than $1.5 billion (45%) higher under the KORUS FTA than would be the case otherwise.

That is because South Korean tastes have developed a preference for grass-fed Australian beef, according to the AFBF, and will continue to be competitive in price against U.S. beef even with the current 40% tariff removed.

If the panel finds a violation of an auto-related commitment or the nullification/impairment of expected benefits, the complaining Party may suspend its tariff concessions on passenger vehicles and assess duties at the prevailing MFN rate (i.e., \"snapback\" any tariff reductions provided by the FTA). The final agreement does not extend the snapback to the higher 25% U.S. truck tariff, but measures affecting trucks could lead to the snapback of the 2.5% passenger car tariff. Reduction of alleged discriminatory effects of engine displacement taxes. Automotive-specific taxes play an important role in determining the final price of a vehicle. U.S. automakers have complained that South Korea's steeply ascending vehicle tax schedule, with very high rates on vehicles with larger engine capacities that might be exported by U.S. producers, makes U.S. imported cars more expensive than smaller South Korean cars. Moreover, the tax system has a \"cascade\" effect, so that subsequent taxation rates also incorporate the duty paid on an imported vehicle. A special consumption tax, an educational tax, a value-added tax, a registration tax, and a subway bond are currently among the taxes that apply to motor vehicles. As part of the KORUS FTA, the South Korean government agreed to simplify and reduce the taxes imposed on each category of passenger vehicles. They also agreed to eliminate the discrepancy in the rates between imported and domestic vehicles by reducing the tax rate for vehicles in the largest engine-displacement-size categories. U.S. automakers have raised concerns about a prospective Korean incentive/penalty regulation giving a consumer of a new car either a subsidy or a surcharge to the price of the car, at the point of sale, depending on the car's emission profile. They claim this new regulation is simply an engine displacement tax and such taxes are prohibited under KORUS. Improved regulatory transparency for new automotive regulations . South Korea also committed to an improvement in its regulatory process. U.S. auto companies are provided one year between the time a final auto regulation is issued and when U.S. automakers must comply with the new regulation. In addition, South Korea agreed to develop a new post-implementation review system within two years after the agreement takes effect to ensure that existing auto regulations are applied in the least burdensome manner possible. The Korean government would argue that it is meeting its regulatory obligations under KORUS. However, the U.S. auto industry has already identified a few proposed Korean automotive regulations that could impose additional burdens and costs on them, making it more difficult for them to sell cars in Korea. Regulations on harmonization of automotive safety and environmental standards. U.S. manufacturers have long complained that South Korea sets automotive safety and environmental regulations in a closed and non-transparent manner, and that its standards remain idiosyncratic. As one remedy, the KORUS FTA provides for self-certification to U.S. federal safety standards for a limited number of U.S.-exported vehicles raising the ceiling to 25,000 per automaker per year. Further, the agreement permits some flexibility in meeting new, higher South Korean environmental standards. U.S. automakers will be considered in compliance with new South Korean fuel economy or greenhouse gas emissions standards if \"they meet a target level that is 19% more lenient than the relevant target level provided in the regulation that would otherwise be applicable to that manufacturer.\" This provision applies to U.S. carmakers that sold fewer than 4,500 cars in South Korea in calendar year 2009. Creation of an \"Automotive Working Group.\" The KORUS FTA established an Automotive Working Group (AWG), which should meet at least annually, to address regulatory issues that may endure or new issues that could emerge with respect to developing, implementing, and enforcing relevant standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures. The AWG, which includes representatives from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met once in June 2013, to discuss assorted issues, such as automotive safety, fuel economy, and greenhouse gas regulations. It expects to convene again sometime in 2014. Inclusion of a Special Motor Vehicle Safeguard . The KORUS FTA includes a special safeguard for motor vehicles to ensure that the U.S. auto industry is not hurt owing to any \"harmful surges\" in South Korea auto imports. The new auto-specific safeguard provision allows the United States to impose extra duties if there is an import surge due to the trade agreement. Any higher tariff that might be imposed could be applied for four years. In the case of truck tariffs, the auto safeguard could be in place until 2031 as it is allowed to continue for 10 years after the full elimination of tariffs. Another feature of the safeguard is that it can be applied to a particular auto product more than once in the event of a recurring surge that causes serious injury to U.S. production of that product. It appears easier to apply the safeguard if there are complaints because, as a White House fact sheet notes, \"fewer procedural steps are required to speed up the application of the safeguard when workers need faster relief.\" ", "The KORUS FTA will not affect the hundreds of thousands of cars assembled by South Korean automakers in the United States and their U.S. production capacity is poised to grow. Thus, a surge in automobile imports from South Korea seems unlikely in the next few years. GM Korea, the South Korean arm of U.S. automaker GM, has manufactured over 100,000 cars in South Korea every year since 2005. See Appendix for an overview of South Korea's motor vehicle manufacturing industry.", "The USITC simulation model of the KORUS FTA estimates that while U.S. automotive exports to South Korea will increase by a range of 45% to 59%, this will only amount to about $300 million-$400 million because of the low current baseline. It states that tariff elimination \"would likely have a positive effect on U.S. exports ... further, the overall tax burden on the South Korean consumer who purchases an imported vehicle would be reduced, more or less equalizing the total taxes paid on imported and domestic vehicles.\" It particularly emphasizes the potential gain for U.S.-exported hybrid vehicles to South Korea. Currently, most hybrids in the U.S. market are imported from Japan. With sales at 222,140 in 2013, the Toyota Prius, including the Prius C and V, accounted for 45% of all hybrid electric vehicles sold in the United States. Hyundai's Sonata hybrid, the first South Korean hybrid sold in the United States, represented 4% of all such vehicles sold in 2013 to become one of the best-selling gas-electric cars in the United States. Combined, the Detroit-based U.S. manufacturers have increased their hybrid electric vehicle sales in recent years, rising from 0 in 2003 to nearly 100,000 in 2013.", "Alongside hybrids, Hyundai and Kia seem to be considering the development of pickup trucks that could be sold in the U.S. market, although whether they will be produced, and where (in the United States or South Korea), remains unclear. Hyundai and Kia do already produce small pickup-type vehicles in South Korea, such as the Porter and Bongo, but they would not appear to be suitable in design or style for the United States.

Purchases of garments by the United States from South Korea shrank to less than 1% of all apparel imports in 2013, down from 10% in 1990.

Also included is a special safeguard provision whereby, if imports of textiles or garments to one KORUS FTA partner country from the other increases at such a rate as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry of the importing country, the importing country can suspend further reduction of tariffs, or it can increase the duty on the imported product to (the lesser of) the MFN rate applicable at the time the action was taken or the MFN duty that was in force when the FTA went into effect. The safeguard action can be in place for two years with a possible extension of two years, but no more than a total of four years. However, the importing country will have to compensate the exporting country by making additional trade liberalizing concessions equivalent in value to the additional duties expected to result from the safeguard action. The concessions will be limited to textiles and apparel unless the two countries agree otherwise.", "The USITC has estimated that the KORUS FTA will over time lead to an increase in U.S. imports of South Korean textiles of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and of apparel of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, with the major portion of the increase being diverted from other countries. The USITC also has estimated that the KORUS FTA will lead to an increase in U.S. exports of textiles of $130 million to $140 million and of apparel of $39 million to $45 million to South Korea.", "The KORUS FTA allows some fibers, yarns, and fabrics originating outside the United States and South Korea to become eligible for preferential treatment if the product is not available domestically in commercial quantities in either country.

Prior to the change, it maintained a \"negative list\" system, under which products would be eligible for reimbursement unless they appeared on the list. With the change, the South Korean government switched to a \"positive list\" requiring a product to be listed before it would be eligible making it potentially more difficult for a product to become eligible. Announcement of the policy came without prior notification to U.S. officials or affected U.S. manufacturers and occurred at an early point in the negotiations placing a cloud over them. Despite complaints from the United States, South Korea went ahead with implementing its positive list system.", "P&M manufacturers also cited the South Korean government's policies on reimbursements for pharmaceuticals and medical devices under its single-payer health insurance program. U.S. manufacturers argued that the policies discriminate against innovative pharmaceuticals because they establish relatively low reimbursement amounts for medicines thus not taking into account the costs that producers of leading-edge pharmaceuticals incur and that are reflected in higher prices. U.S. manufacturers wanted the KORUS FTA to establish transparency as an important principal in South Korea's development and implementation of pricing and reimbursement policies, including an appeal process for decisions going against U.S. manufacturers.", "The KORUS FTA provisions allow U.S. pharmaceutical makers to apply for increased reimbursement levels based on safety and efficacy. South Korea also agreed to publish proposed laws, regulations, and procedures that apply to the pricing, reimbursement, and regulation of pharmaceuticals and medical devices in a nationally available publication and to allow time for comment. In addition, South Korea agreed to establish a process for U.S. manufacturers to comment on proposed changes in laws and regulations and for them to obtain a review of administrative determinations that adversely affect them. Intellectual property rights protection in South Korea has been a critical issue for U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers.

In addition, the South Korean government has, in some cases, approved marketing of some pharmaceuticals before it has determined that the applicant is the rightful owner of the patent and trademark.

In addition, if a third party submits safety or efficacy information for a product that an FTA partner government had already approved, the government is to notify the original patent holder of the identity of the third party and is to prevent the marketing of the third party's product on its territory if permission had not been granted by the original patent holder. In a side letter, the United States and South Korea originally agreed to not invoke the data exclusivity provision until the FTA had been in effect 18 months. Under the modifications to the commitments, the United States agreed to double to 36 months, or three years, the time South Korea will have to put in place a system of patent linkages for pharmaceuticals that is required under the FTA. Furthermore, South Korea agreed to a patent-linkage system; that is, neither government is to approve the marketing of a generic drug while the original patent is still in effect. Another provision, known as patent-term extension, requires the United States and South Korea to adjust the length of the effective period for patents on pharmaceuticals to take into account delays incurred in receiving patent approval and marketing approval.

Speaking in April 2007, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Korea, Japan, and APEC Wendy Cutler, the chief U.S. negotiator, implied that the consultative committee will focus on information sharing and \"will not provide a forum to discuss specific cases.\" She also mentioned that the committee could be a benefit to the United States by providing a platform for discussing certain industrial subsidies that the South Korean government may be supplying to manufacturing firms, and that negotiators worked out an \"accommodation\" that was beneficial to both sides' needs on a very contentious part of the negotiations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Kaesong Industrial Complex133", "paragraphs": ["A significant goal for South Korea in the FTA talks was securing preferential treatment for products made in the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) in North Korea, a position the United States opposed throughout most of the negotiations. Located near the North Korean city of Kaesong (also spelled \"Gaesong\"), 40 miles north of Seoul, the KIC is designed for South Korean companies to employ North Korean workers. As of the end of 2010, over 120 medium-sized South Korean companies were employing over 47,000 North Korean workers to manufacture products in Kaesong. The facility, which in 2010 produced $323 million in output, has the land and infrastructure to house two to three times as many firms and workers. Products vary widely, and include clothing and textiles (71 firms), kitchen utensils (4 firms), auto parts (4 firms), semiconductor parts (2 firms), and toner cartridges (1 firm). ", "The KIC generated controversy because it provides an ongoing revenue stream to the Kim Jong-il regime in Pyongyang, by virtue of the share the government takes from the salaries paid to North Korean workers. South Korean and U.S. officials estimate this revenue stream to be around $20 million per year. On the other hand, the KIC arguably helps maintain stability on the Peninsula and provides a possible beachhead for market reforms in the DPRK that could eventually spill over to areas outside the park and expose tens of thousands of North Koreans to outside influences, market-oriented businesses, and incentives. ", "In the final KORUS FTA agreement, the two sides reached a compromise on the KIC. On the one hand, the agreement does not include any reference to the complex, and KIC products are not eligible for the agreement's special treatment provisions. On the other hand, a binational committee was formed to study the possibility of eventually incorporating products from \"Outward Processing Zones\" (OPZs), including those\u2014like the KIC\u2014that are located in North Korea. The agreement identifies three general categories for which the committee is to develop more detailed criteria: progress in the denuclearization of North Korea, developments in intra-Korean relations; and wages, business management practices, the environment, and labor standards. For the third category of issues, the committee is to consider relevant international norms as well as the \"situation prevailing elsewhere on the Peninsula.\" After the committee has developed criteria, the OPZ provisions in the FTA lay out a three- step process by which products made in the KIC could be incorporated into the FTA. First, the committee must deem that an outward processing zone meets the criteria it has established. Second, the two governments must agree that the FTA should be amended accordingly. Third, both governments must seek \"legislative approval for any amendments to the Agreement with respect to outward processing zones.\" The agreement does not lay out the procedures by which the committee is to arrive at decisions, except that decisions would have to be reached by unified consent.", "For years, neither the Bush nor Obama Administrations specified what form \"legislative approval\" for OPZ-related amendments to the KORUS FTA would take. In March 2011, the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) issued a statement that Congress \"would need to pass, and the President would need to sign, a law to extend any KORUS FTA tariff benefits to products made in Kaesong or any OPZ.\" ", "Some observers, particularly opponents of the KORUS FTA, argued that the agreement could lead to increased U.S. imports of goods or components made in North Korea. The scenario they suggest involves South Korean firms obtaining low-cost Kaesong-made goods or components, incorporating the latter into finished products such as electronics or automobiles, and then reshipping the goods to the United States with \"Made in [South] Korea\" labels. If the KORUS FTA were in effect, the argument runs, these goods might receive preferential treatment. However, a close analysis of the agreement and the nature of trade flows reveals that unless the KIC is brought into the KORUS FTA, the FTA would likely have only a marginal impact on whether the United States imports North Korean finished products or goods that contain North Korean components. Instead, the extent of the problem of North Korea imports will be largely determined by the degree to which North Korean producers become integrated into the global economy. In addition, imports from North Korea require U.S. government approval. This restriction includes finished goods originating in North Korea as well as goods that contain North Korea-made components.", "Another criticism of the KORUS FTA was that it could constrain the United States' ability to restrict imports of North Korean goods or components, for instance, by invoking the agreement's dispute settlement procedures to challenge a U.S. decision to prohibit the entry of a South Korean product that contains North Korean components. However, provisions in the KORUS-FTA will appear to allow either the United States or South Korea to impose or maintain trade restrictions against the goods of a third country (such as North Korea); thus the agreement will accord each Party the right to restrict trade with the other Party in implementing any such embargo. ", "In the KORUS FTA negotiations, the United States backed away from the principle of its initial position of not ever expanding the KORUS FTA to North Korea-made products, a significant achievement for South Korea. At the same time, the United States appeared to give up little in substance in the near-to-middle term. The United States apparently would be able to control the decision to and pace of any move to grant preferential treatment to North Korea-made products. Any perceptions of foot-dragging by the United States, however, may come at a diplomatic price if future South Korean governments push for more rapid integration of North Korean industrial zones into the FTA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Investment", "paragraphs": ["Foreign investment is becoming an increasingly significant element in the U.S.-South Korean bilateral economic relationship.

In the 1990s, the two countries tried to negotiate a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) that would commit each party to provide national treatment to the investments from the other party and abstain from performance requirements for foreign investments from the other party.

In contrast, U.S. union representatives argue that recent changes to make South Korean labor markets more flexible are reducing the rights of South Korean workers. Korea's unions have earned a reputation for activism; the number of working days lost to strikes is regularly among the highest in the OECD. Hyundai Motors, for instance, has experienced a strike every year since 1994. Moreover, strikes in South Korea are notable in that they are sometimes accompanied by violence and the occupation of workplaces and public spaces (such as highways), to which the government often responds with police action.

The 1980 edition of the Automotive News Market Data Book , an authoritative industry source, listed no South Korean company among the top 50 global producers. By 2013, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA), South Korean production of cars and commercial vehicles totaled 4.5 million units; South Korea ranked as the global number five national producer, behind, in order, China, the United States, Japan, and Germany. Yet, South Korea remains only a mid-level consumer of motor vehicles, with domestic sales of around 1.4 million in recent years. Exports accounted for about 70% of Korea's motor vehicle production volume in 2013, a figure that is matched by no other major motor vehicle producing country.", "South Korea has aggressively developed and protected its automotive manufacturing base. Motor vehicle imports were prohibited in South Korea until 1987, and imports from Japan were banned until 1999. Originally, the South Korean government promoted the development of a fleet of domestically owned producers, but this strategy failed. In the shakeout after South Korea's economic crisis of 1997-1998, only one major South Korean-owned company was left, Hyundai, which also took control of the number-two producer by volume, Kia. Others were marginalized, out of the business altogether, or controlled by foreign companies. Korea's third producer, and their only other major manufacturer left in the business, Daewoo, is now controlled by General Motors. The lone major South Korean-owned producer, the Hyundai-Kia combination, in 2012 produced 6.8 million passenger cars worldwide, ranking it fourth globally, behind Toyota, G.M., and Volkswagen.

The export orientation of the South Korean motor vehicle industry, the quality of South Korean cars, and the relatively low U.S. tariff on all imported motor vehicles, except trucks, has made the United States a good market of opportunity for South Korean automobile exports. Until 2016 and 2021, respectively, the United States will impose a 2.5% duty on imported passenger vehicles and a 25% duty on trucks. South Korean automakers export many more cars to the United States than U.S. car manufacturers export to South Korea. Total South Korean motor vehicle exports to the United States peaked at more than 860,000 units in 2004, according to U.S. Commerce Department data, and dropped every year through 2009, but increased to more than 750,000 passenger vehicles and light trucks in 2013 (see Figure A-1 ).

Hyundai and Kia have established production facilities in the United States. Thus, Hyundai's Montgomery, AL, plant and Kia's West Point, GA, facilities allow them to substitute for some imports. In 2013, Hyundai and Kia sold 1.26 million light vehicles in the United States, of which some 60%, or about 770,000 units, were produced in the United States. Nearly 400,000 Sonata's, Elantra's, and Santa Fe's were assembled in Hyundai's Alabama facilities and about 370,000 Kia Sorento's and Optima's and Hyundai Santa Fe's were produced in Georgia in 2013. At full capacity, the Georgia Kia plant can produce 360,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, GM Korea, which is the South Korean arm of U.S. automaker GM, builds and sells cars in South Korea.

By comparison, overall sales of U.S. light vehicles grew to 15.6 million units in 2013 from 14.5 million in 2012, rising 8%. Despite their growth in sales in recent years, South Korean automakers' share of the U.S. market dropped in 2013 to 8.1% from 8.7% in 2012. Sales of Chevrolet's Spark EV model, which is imported from South Korea, totaled 34,130 units in 2013, its first full year on the market.", "For years, South Korean policies that allegedly restrict imports of foreign-made motor vehicles have been a major target of U.S. trade policy. In 1995 and 1998, the USTR negotiated memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with South Korea, aimed at reducing formal and informal South Korean policies that were said to discriminate against imports of U.S.-made vehicles and other foreign imports. U.S. policy primarily focused on motor vehicle taxation policies and South Korean motor vehicle standards, which supposedly did not conform to international standards, or those widely used in major markets. The import share of the domestic market in South Korea has increased since the MOUs were signed.
