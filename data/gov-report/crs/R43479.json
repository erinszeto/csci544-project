Among other things, H.Con.Res. 96 expresses the desired levels of spending for government health programs over 10 years (FY2015-FY2024), creates four health care-related reserve funds, and presents policy statements regarding assumptions about future Medicare reforms and replacing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended (ACA, P.L. 111-148 , P.L. 111-152 ). H.Con.Res. 96 does not include instructions for reconciliation. A budget resolution is not intended to establish details of spending or revenue policy and does not provide levels of spending for specific agencies or programs. It is not a law and is not signed by the President. Rather, a budget resolution provides the framework for the consideration of subsequent legislation. While the House budget resolution suggests and assumes certain health care-related policy changes, separate legislation would need to be developed by the committees of jurisdiction, passed by Congress, and signed by the President in order for such changes to be made to the affected federally funded health care programs.", "In general, the budget proposal, as outlined in Chairman Ryan's Path to Prosperity report and in the committee report, suggests a change in the structure of the Medicare and Medicaid programs; the repeal of many (or all) of the provisions in the ACA, including those that establish insurance exchanges; and changes to tort law governing medical malpractice.", "This CRS report provides a synopsis of the health care-related changes in the House FY2015 budget proposal.

Typically such conditions consist of legislation dealing with a particular policy being considered on the floor. Once this action has taken place, the Budget Committee chairman submits the revised levels to his respective chamber. Generally, the goal of such a reserve fund is to allow certain policies to be considered on the floor without triggering a point of order for violating levels in the budget resolution. Often, but not always, reserve funds require that the underlying legislative language be deficit-neutral. Typically, such deficit-neutral reserve funds allow for a committee to report specific policy legislation that violates the committee's spending allocation, as long as the excess amount is \"offset\" by equivalent amounts.", "H.Con.Res. 96 contains four reserve funds related to federal health care programs. Section 301 of H.Con.Res. 96 would create a reserve fund to allow for the consideration of legislation that would fully repeal the ACA as amended, even if the legislation were projected to increase the deficit. Section 302 would allow for the consideration of legislation that would reform or replace the ACA, as long as the legislation would not increase the deficit over the period of FY2015 through FY2024. Similarly, Section 303 would create a reserve fund to allow for the consideration of legislation that would repeal all or some of the Medicare-related ACA provisions that reduce program spending, as long as the legislation were deficit-neutral for the FY2015-FY2024 period. The fourth reserve fund, created in Section 304, would allow for a deficit-neutral fix to the Medicare physician payment system (see \" Short-Term Medicare Changes (FY2015-FY2024) \").", "While the reserve funds allow for flexibility in considering subsequent legislation affecting federal health care programs, the two health care policy statements in H.Con.Res. 96 , as well as the committee report and the Path to Prosperity and Setting the Record Straight documents, provide more specific assumptions and suggestions of changes to these programs. The following sections of this report describe those specific proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is the nation's federal insurance program that pays for covered health services for most persons 65 years old and older and for most permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65. In FY2014, the program will cover an estimated 54 million persons at an estimated total cost of $618 billion. CBO estimates that federal Medicare spending (after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts) will be about $518 billion in FY2014, accounting for over 14% of total federal spending and close to 3% of GDP. Medicare is an entitlement program, which means that it is required to pay for covered services provided to eligible persons so long as specific criteria are met. Spending under the program (except for a portion of the administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the appropriations process.", "The Medicare program has four parts, each responsible for paying for different benefits, subject to different eligibility criteria and financing mechanisms. Medicare Part A covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, some home health, and hospice care. Part A services are paid for out of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (HI), which is mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings of current workers, shared equally between employers and workers. Part B covers physician services, outpatient services, medical equipment, ambulance services, laboratory tests, and some home health services; Part D covers outpatient prescription drugs. Parts B and D benefits are paid for out of the Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund (SMI), which is primarily funded through beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues. High-income beneficiaries pay higher premiums for Parts B and D, and certain low-income beneficiaries may receive assistance from Medicare and/or Medicaid with premiums and cost-sharing. Part C, called Medicare Advantage, is a private health plan option for beneficiaries that covers all Part A and B services, except hospice, and is funded through both the HI and SMI trust funds. ", "Under traditional Medicare, Parts A and B, services are generally paid directly by the government on a \"fee-for-service\" basis, using different prospective payment systems or fee schedules. Under Parts C and D, private insurers are paid a set monthly per person amount to provide coverage to enrollees, and plan payments are adjusted to reflect the higher relative costs of sicker beneficiaries. Premium amounts may vary, depending on which plan the enrollee selects.", "Since its enactment in 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change. Because of its rapid growth, both in terms of aggregate dollars and as a share of the federal budget, the Medicare program has been a major focus of deficit reduction legislation passed by Congress. With a few exceptions, reductions in program spending have been achieved largely through freezes or reductions in payments to providers, primarily hospitals and physicians, and by making changes to beneficiary premiums and other cost-sharing requirements. Most recently, the ACA made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modify provider and Medicare Advantage plan reimbursement methodologies, create incentives to improve the quality and efficiency of care, and provide additional program integrity tools and funding. Except in a few instances where the ACA enhanced coverage, it did not make any changes to Medicare benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Short-Term Medicare Changes (FY2015-FY2024)", "paragraphs": ["H.Con.Res. 96 suggests total Medicare outlays of $6.8 trillion over the 10-year budget window (FY2015-FY2024). According to estimates provided in the Path to Prosperity document, this level of outlays is about $129 billion less than projected spending based on current policy. Baseline projections are based on current law, and therefore assume the continuation of ACA Medicare plan and provider payment reductions, physician payment reductions under the sustainable growth rate system (SGR) beginning in 2015, and 2% reductions in Medicare benefit spending under Budget Control Act of 2011 sequestration requirements. Therefore, for the proposed spending levels to be attained, the expected reductions under current law, or equivalent reductions, would need to occur. Other policies would also need to be adopted to achieve the additional proposed savings. However, as described later in this section, the budget resolution provides for some flexibility in these spending levels.", "The committee report suggests several policy options to reduce Medicare spending over the next 10 years. These include (1) additional means-testing of Parts B and D premiums for high-income seniors similar to that proposed in the President's FY2014 budget; (2) medical liability insurance reforms (see the \" Medical Malpractice \" section of this report); and (3) increased program integrity efforts to reduce improper payments. The Setting the Record Straight document also suggests that savings could be realized through the repeal of the ACA provisions that close the Part D prescription drug benefit \"doughnut hole.\" ", "The proposed restructuring of Medicare, described in the \" Long-Term Medicare Changes (FY2024 and Beyond) \" section below, would begin in the last year of the 10-year budget window, FY2024. Whether this change would lead to program costs or savings in that year would depend on how the system is structured, how many people were enrolled, and on the extent of the administrative related expenditures needed to set up the new program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Flexibility in Proposed Spending Levels", "paragraphs": ["The reserve funds described in \" Health Care Related Reserve Funds in H.Con.Res. 96 \" allow the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget to revise allocations of spending for Medicare and to adjust other budgetary levels. For instance, the fund created by Section 302 of H.Con.Res. 96 allows for the consideration of legislation to reform or replace the ACA as long as it is deficit-neutral, and the reserve fund in Section 303 allows for the consideration of deficit-neutral legislation to repeal some or all of the ACA provisions expected to decrease Medicare spending. Both of these reserve funds would allow for the consideration of legislation that would increase Medicare spending, as long as those increases were offset by decreased spending somewhere else in the federal budget (the provisions do not specify that the increased spending must be offset within the Medicare budget category). On the other hand, the reserve fund created by Section 301 would allow for legislation to fully repeal the ACA, including all of the Medicare provisions, without it being deficit-neutral. This reserve fund would thus allow for higher federal spending, including Medicare spending, regardless of whether it would increase the budget deficit.", "The budget resolution also accommodates legislation that fixes the Medicare physician payment (SGR) formula for the next 10 years. Specifically, Section 304 of H.Con.Res. 96 would provide procedural flexibility to allow for the consideration within the framework of the budget resolution of legislation that would reform the sustainable growth rate system, as long as the legislation did not increase the deficit for the period FY2015-FY2024. The committee report does not suggest specific changes to the payment methodology, but proposes as an \"illustrative policy option\" that the new system provide incentives to improve the quality and efficiency of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. This policy option also proposes a requirement that CMS assume an override of scheduled reductions in physician payments when setting payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans, similar to the methodology the agency used in determining payments for 2014.", "In addition, the budget resolution assumes a repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) created by the ACA. Under current law, beginning in 2014, the IPAB is required to develop proposals to reduce the Medicare per capita expenditure growth rate if Medicare spending is projected to exceed a certain target. To date, however, no board members have been nominated to serve on the IPAB and the board has not yet been established. Further, in its April 2014 baseline, CBO projected that the rates of growth in spending per beneficiary would be below the target rates of growth for fiscal years 2015 through 2024. Recent CBO legislative cost estimates, however, have noted that the increased spending associated with permanently fixing the physician payment rates would \"increase the likelihood that the IPAB mechanism would be triggered.\" Thus, the repeal of IPAB coupled with a repeal of the SGR physician payment system could mean that additional costs may need to be offset."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Medicare Changes (FY2024 and Beyond)", "paragraphs": ["The budget assumes that the current Medicare defined benefits program will be changed into a fixed federal contribution (\"premium support\") system beginning in 2024 for newly eligible beneficiaries.

", "Plans would be required to accept all people eligible for Medicare who apply, regardless of age or health status.

For example, decisions would need to be made regarding which parts of Medicare would be financed through premium subsidies. This could include determining whether Parts A and B (and possibly D) and their trust funds and funding sources would be combined; whether changes would be made to the voluntary nature of Parts B and D (or could one opt out of Medicare entirely); and whether beneficiary premiums would be based on expected per capita Part B and D costs, or whether they would also include the costs of Part A (which is now premium free for most enrollees). ", "Decisions would also need to be made regarding whether Medicare Advantage would still be an option in or after 2024 for those age 55 and older in 2013, or whether private plans would only be available through the exchanges, and whether the financial risk to private plans participating in the exchanges would need to be mitigated to encourage participation (e.g., Part D provides reinsurance for catastrophic costs and has risk corridors to limit losses). Finally, an administrative infrastructure, including information technology systems, would need to be designed to administer both the old and new programs, including managing the bidding process for private plans, reimbursing plans and providers, educating and enrolling beneficiaries, and providing financial and quality of care oversight. ", "A CBO analysis of two illustrative premium support system models generally found that such models may reduce federal spending, but that beneficiaries' premiums could be higher or lower depending on which model is implemented and in which plan they enroll. For example, in some regions, premiums for traditional fee-for-service Medicare could be higher than under current law. In its analysis, CBO assumed that that there would be no limit on the growth rate for federal contributions, and that all Medicare beneficiaries, other than those dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, would be enrolled in the new system (not just new beneficiaries). CBO noted that federal savings would be \"substantially lower over an extended period if all current beneficiaries stayed in the existing Medicare system and only new enrollees participated in the premium support system.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services as well as long-term services and supports.
