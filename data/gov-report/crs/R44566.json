According to oil spill data compiled by the Coast Guard, from 1995 to 2011 (the latest year available) barges spilled about 2.7 times more oil in U.S. waters than did tanker ships. During this time, the number of oil spill incidents and the amount spilled annually have declined significantly for both barges and tankers.

The Coast Guard cited a number of expert studies supporting this contention. Barge operators filed comments opposed to addressing hours of service as part of this particular rulemaking (which also included the proposed rules on tug vessel inspection), while maritime unions have filed comments in favor of a mandatory eight-hour rest period. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) filed comments reiterating its support for a crew schedule that allows for 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep per 24-hour period (which could require a 10-hour rest period). A report by a group of experts in sleep and circadian biology at Northwestern University contends that a rotating schedule of six hours of work followed by six hours of rest (referred to as the \"square-watch system\") does allow for adequate sleep by barge crews.

An ATB is a coastal tank barge designed for open seas that can hold 50,000 to 185,000 barrels of oil. Some recently built ATBs can carry 240,000 to 340,000 barrels, a capacity comparable to that of coastal tankers. Seagoing barges have speeds of about 10 knots (12 miles per hour), a few knots slower than a tank ship. ", "According to an original designer of the ATB, \"the American coastwise shipping business has grown in a way that differs from many other nations. The high cost of manning and building ships has led over the years to a coastwise transportation network dominated by tugs and barges.\" ATBs are sometimes referred to as \"rule breakers\" within the maritime industry because they operate with smaller crews. The Coast Guard determines crewing requirements based on the registered tonnage of a vessel, which for barges includes only the tug, not the barges the tug may be pushing. As a result, an ATB typically has a crew of 6 to 12, versus 21 to 28 for a tank ship. The precise number for any particular vessel depends on that vessel's level of advanced technology (more automated vessels may need smaller crews). ", "If the Coast Guard were to require ATBs to carry larger crews, it could reduce their economic advantage compared to tankers. Such an outcome occurred previously with a precursor to the ATB called the integrated tug barge; when the Coast Guard increased their manning requirements in 1981, integrated tug barges lost their economic advantage, and none have been built since. The Coast Guard increased manning requirements because integrated tug barges operated essentially as ships since the tug and barge seldom separated. While ATBs are designed for easier separation of tug and barge, they also seldom separate. A river barge can be used in \"drop and swap\" operation\u2014that is, the tugboat can drop a loaded barge at a facility where it can be used for storing product while the tugboat is free to make other barge movements\u2014but the tugs designed for ATBs sail poorly without the barge, so they generally do not perform drop and swap operations.", "Some stakeholders have criticized the distinction in crewing requirements between ships and ATBs because they believe it distorts the domestic shipping market by encouraging the use of otherwise less efficient barges instead of ships. Since 1980, the amount of cargo carried by coastal ships in domestic commerce has declined by 72% while the amount carried by coastal barges has increased by 35%, with barges now carrying more cargo than ships. Since ships are needed for military deployments overseas, a primary objective of U.S. maritime policy is development of the skills and know-how for building and crewing oceangoing ships. Addressing this may require reducing manning requirements for coastal tankers to make them more competitive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Vessel Safety Inspections", "paragraphs": ["In the Howard Coble Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-281 , Section 605), Congress asked for an independent review of Coast Guard requirements for U.S.-flag vessels that are different from international standards.

Most manufacturers do not build their equipment to requirements of the relatively small U.S.-flag fleet. The report also recommended that the Coast Guard accept international practices for \"reduced manning\" of engine room operations with automated equipment (particularly for ship operators with proven safety track records) rather than requiring additional equipment, trial periods, and a period of Coast Guard onboard observation. The report suggested that the Coast Guard rely more on independent vessel classification societies (described in the Appendix ) to perform inspections of U.S.-flag vessels, particularly because the classification societies update their equipment standards more frequently than the Coast Guard does.

For example, the NTSB's survey of VTS watchstanders found that 95% had never worked on a commercial vessel and 93% had five years of experience or less working at a VTS center. Thus, most of the recommendations the NTSB made to improve the effectiveness of VTS centers concerned the training and qualifications of the personnel working in them.", "S. 1129 (\u00a7405) requires the Coast Guard to examine whether it is feasible to establish a VTS center in U.S. arctic waters.", "The Coast Guard's technical expertise in providing effective safety oversight of certain maritime operations has been a persistent issue. In 2007, the then chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure considered creating a civilian agency within the Department of Transportation to take over maritime safety functions. In an internal report, the Coast Guard acknowledged that its practice of regularly rotating staff geographically or by activity, as military organizations typically do, hinders its ability to develop a cadre of staff with sufficient technical expertise in marine safety. In response to this problem, the agency revamped its safety program, and Congress has appropriated additional funds specifically for safety personnel. Under the revamped safety program, the Coast Guard created additional civilian safety positions, converted military positions into civilian ones, and developed a long-term career path for civilian safety inspectors and investigators.

At a July 2016 hearing, the Coast Guard indicated its preferred strategy was to rely on mobile assets (vessels and aircraft) and seasonal bases of operation rather than pursue a permanent port in the Arctic. Less sea ice during late summer has led to increased maritime activity in the Arctic. The Bering Strait along the west coast of Alaska is the entrance and exit waterway for ships transiting the Northern Sea Route along Russia's north coast as well as the Northwest Passage through the Canadian archipelago. The latter appears to be far less viable as a route for large commercial vessels, as it is more constricted by shallow and narrow straits and unpredictable ice movement. Most cargo ship activity has taken place along the Northern Sea Route, while cruise vessel excursions have increased in the Northwest Passage. Before the recent fall in oil prices, there was also exploratory oil drilling activity off Alaska's North Coast.

According to the Coast Guard, there are about 50,000 federally owned visual aids, and an equal number of nonfederal visual aids. Because storms or ice can move buoys out of place and channels can move due to shoaling, the Coast Guard services about 134 buoys and fixed aids to navigation on an average day.

The guidelines are not new regulations but identify existing regulations pertaining to the carriage of LNG as cargo and to storage of LNG in bulk at waterfront terminals. For example, the same safeguards required for loading or unloading LNG as cargo aboard an LNG tanker are applicable when transferring LNG to fuel a ship. In April 2012, the Coast Guard issued guidelines regarding the specifications for LNG engines and fuel system machinery and equipment on vessels. LNG-fueled ship engines are not entirely new, as LNG tankers often have engines that are fueled by \"boil-off\" (LNG that has re-gasified in cargo tanks). Both guidelines are issued as policy letters, not as final rules in a rulemaking procedure, and are meant to inform industry and local Coast Guard officials about existing regulations that are enforceable with regard to LNG used as fuel.", "There may be uncertainty concerning aspects of LNG bunkering that existing Coast Guard regulations do not specifically address. For instance, a shoreside LNG fueling facility has different siting needs from an LNG cargo terminal. Existing regulations for LNG cargo terminals therefore may not take into account the surrounding environment that may be different for an LNG fueling facility, posing different safety issues. Another matter left unclear is whether LNG-fueled cargo ships may load or unload cargo, passengers, or crew supplies simultaneously while loading LNG fuel; existing regulations for transferring LNG as cargo do not envision other operations that an LNG-fueled ship might need to engage in while refueling is taking place. The guidelines currently state that an LNG fuel supplier should conduct a formal quantitative risk assessment to assist the Coast Guard in evaluating whether simultaneous operations can occur. Also, current regulations concerning spill response are written with heavy marine oil or marine diesel fuel in mind. These requirements are not readily adaptable to LNG, which would vaporize in the event of a spill.

Maritime Safety: Key Elements", "paragraphs": ["Harbor Pilots", "Maritime pilots play an important role in maritime safety because they drive many of the ships arriving and departing U.S. harbors. Maritime pilots possess navigational expertise for a particular harbor and are hired by ocean carriers to take command of their ships for harbor transits. The pilots board ships at the entrance to a harbor (with use of a pilot boat) and take position at the bridge alongside the master (captain) of the vessel and other bridge crew. The pilot will order instructions to the helmsmen to steer the ship through the harbor and may direct tugboats, if they are assisting. Pilots describe turning a ship like turning a car on ice\u2014it slides through the turn. Pilotage is described as a process of continually watching how the ship responds to a maneuver, which will dictate the pilot's next command. How a ship responds is affected by the characteristics of the ship, weather, and water conditions. A pilot needs to be aware of multiple cues: wind, tide and river currents, and (in the case of estuaries) the salt water versus fresh water mix that affects buoyancy. While the pilot is in command of the navigation of the ship through the harbor, the captain of the ship remains in command of the ship and retains ultimate responsibility for its safe passage. ", "Often the pilot will board the ship with a computer laptop or other handheld device that contains his or her own set of charts for that harbor as well as ship tracking technology. The laptop may also be plugged into the ship's navigation console to incorporate the ship's navigation technology into the pilot's navigation software. When the pilot boards the ship, the captain is required to inform the pilot about the navigation particulars of the ship, such as the draft, air draft (highest point on the vessel), and maneuvering characteristics. A \"pilot card\" is used for this purpose. Although English is the required language of international shipping, language can be a barrier to expansive communication between the pilot and captain.", "Most U.S. ports make it compulsory for a ship to hire a pilot, although in some ports hiring a pilot may be voluntary. In these latter cases, if a ship captain regularly calls at a port and is confident that he or she can navigate the ship through the harbor, the captain may elect not to hire a pilot, but the shipping line will still be charged either the full pilotage fee or some portion thereof. For liability reasons, many shipping lines will take on a pilot even if it is not compulsory. On the west and Gulf coasts, the pilot usually navigates the ship from the harbor entrance to the dock (and vice versa), but on the east coast, some ports require a \"docking pilot\" to take over from the pilot when docking the ship. Docking pilots are usually former tugboat captains and are not members of the local pilot association. In Louisiana, in addition to hiring a harbor pilot, shipping lines may also be required to hire one or two \"river pilots\" depending on how far up the Mississippi River the ship is transiting (to call at the Port of Baton Rouge or South Louisiana). Especially large ships may be required to hire two pilots, or a full pilot and an assistant pilot. ", "A maritime pilot typically works as an independent contractor through the pilot association at a given port. The association takes care of administrative functions such as dispatching pilots to vessels, maintaining pilot boats, and billing and collecting pilotage fees. Pilots are assigned to ships on a rotating basis and the shipping line has no choice in the selection of the pilot. Pilot associations are regulated by a state board of commissioners, or in some cases, by city government. Typically, a pilot board is composed of 3 to 10 members who serve part time. Representation on the board must consist of a specific ratio of pilots, members of the broader maritime industry in the port area, and members of the public not connected with the maritime industry. The pilot board is responsible for ensuring the qualifications of the pilots, setting pilotage fees charged to the vessel operators, and reviewing the performance of pilots. Pilotage fees are based on the draft and tonnage of the vessel and, in some cases, the distance piloted.", "Pilots do not work in a competitive environment. Pilot associations are effectively local or regional monopolies. The pilot association only selects enough member pilots to service the traffic at hand. Pilot associations chartered by state and local governments have jurisdiction only over the pilotage of ships in foreign trade\u2014that is, ships carrying import or export cargo. Congress has decided not to exercise federal control over pilotage of foreign trading ships.

Typically, a sea captain engaged in domestic trade will carry a Coast Guard pilot's endorsement on his or her captain's license and therefore will not need to hire a pilot upon entrance to a harbor. This type of federal pilot authorization is the most common. There are also a few independent federal pilots who are not employed by a coastwise shipping line, but offer their piloting service at the particular port for which they are licensed. Like a state pilot license, the federal pilot license pertains to a specific port. Therefore, the ship captain must obtain a pilot license for each port that he or she expects to call on a routine basis. Generally, all state and local pilots licensed to pilot foreign trade vessels also hold a federal license to pilot ships in domestic trade. Most state and local pilot associations require a federal pilot's license as a minimum requirement for being allowed to work toward a state pilot's license. The federal government will grant a federal pilot's license to anyone who qualifies, unlike states, which limit the number of licenses based on the perceived need for pilot services.", "Marine Exchanges and Vessel Traffic Services", "To assist the pilot and crew with safe navigation, the Coast Guard has established vessel traffic services (VTSs) in many ports. From the VTS, Coast Guard \"watchstanders\" can monitor and provide guidance to harbor traffic with the use of electronic communication, radio, radar, differential global positioning system (DGPS), surveillance cameras, and binoculars. A VTS operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. VTSs vary depending on the geography and the nature and volume of vessel traffic in a port area, but they generally are staffed with both uniformed and civilian Coast Guard watchstanders. Currently there are VTSs in 12 U.S. ports staffed by about 155 civilian and 130 active-duty personnel.", "VTSs may also be staffed by members of a \"maritime exchange\" from which they have evolved. U.S. ports without a Coast Guard-led VTS have a maritime exchange that provides \"VTS-like\" services, and are more accurately called Vessel Traffic Information Services (VTIS). A maritime exchange may be jointly operated or run by a pilot association and be staffed by pilots. VTSs and VTISs are funded from some combination of user fees charged to vessel operators, financing from port authorities, state governments, and the Coast Guard.", "The original purpose of maritime exchanges was to alert ship service providers in port (i.e., agents, pilots, tugs, stevedores, longshoremen unions, terminals, U.S. Customs, and other vendors and government agencies) of a ship's pending arrival. Before the development of current technology, a lookout was posted with a telescope, signal flags, and flashing signal lights. While maritime information exchange is still the central function of marine exchanges, in the 1960s and 1970s they also began offering a VHF radio communication and radar system for pilots and captains to avoid collisions and groundings. Participation was initially voluntary and unregulated and there were no protocols. However, after a ship collision in San Francisco Bay in 1971, Congress passed the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-340), which directed the Coast Guard to establish VTS systems at ports where the Coast Guard deemed them necessary. In the 1970s, VTSs were established in San Francisco, Puget Sound, New York, New Orleans, and Houston-Galveston. VTSs were added in Morgan City, Port Arthur (including Lake Charles), Louisville, Valdez, Los Angeles, and Sault St. Marie thereafter. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, passed in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, made participation in the VTS mandatory where they exist.", "While VTSs or VTISs might be compared to an air traffic control tower in an airport, the key difference is that maritime watchstanders do not direct whether and how a vessel is to proceed in a harbor. For instance, they do not issue orders to pilots about vessel heading and speed. Those decisions are entirely left to pilots, who maintain open radio communication with other vessels in the area to avoid collisions. VTSs are an advisory service, not a traffic control center. The Coast Guard describes them as offering a range of four basic services that represent an increasing continuum of involvement: (1) monitoring of harbor traffic; (2) providing information to mariners so that they can navigate more safely or efficiently; (3) advising or recommending a course of action to a vessel (usually infrequently); and (4) in rare circumstances, directing a vessel to move to a certain location or hold at anchor or at the dock until safe to proceed, but without giving direct maneuvering orders. ", "The level of VTS involvement in harbor navigation varies depending on the circumstances of the harbor. For instance, in busy harbors or in harbors with a drawbridge, the VTS may enforce a harbor traffic management plan that dictates one-way traffic or order of procession through a waterway. In these cases, the VTS could be described as traffic management, as opposed to traffic control. VTSs could potentially exert more control over harbor traffic in bad weather conditions. The Coast Guard already has authority to restrict vessel movements during hazardous weather conditions, but does not regularly do so. In the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-281 , Section 228) Congress directed the Coast Guard to establish a process for marine exchanges to send relevant navigation information to vessels via the Automatic Identification System, a short-range communication system among vessels for transmitting vessel headings and speeds, among other information, to avoid collision.", "The International Maritime Organization (IMO)", "Due to the international nature of the shipping industry, maritime trading nations have adopted international treaties that establish standards for ocean carriers in terms of safety, pollution prevention, and security. These standards are agreed upon by shipping nations through the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations agency that first met in 1959. The Coast Guard represents the United States at the IMO and has been the lead proponent of some amendments regarding shipping safety and security.", "Key conventions that the 168 IMO member nations have adopted include the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS), which was originally adopted in response to the Titanic disaster in 1912 but has since been revised several times; the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), which was adopted in 1973 and modified in 1978; and the Standards for Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), which was adopted in 1978 with the most recent amendment coming into force January 1, 2017. It is up to ratifying nations to enforce these standards. The United States is a party to these conventions, and the U.S. Coast Guard enforces them when it boards and inspects ships and crews arriving at U.S. ports and the very few ships engaged in international trade that sail under the U.S. flag. ", "Flag Registration", "Like the United States, most of the other major maritime trading nations lack the ability to enforce IMO regulations as a \"flag state\" because much of the world's merchant fleet is registered under so-called \"flags of convenience\" or \"open-registry\" countries. While most ship owners and operators are headquartered in developed countries, they often register their ships in Panama, Liberia, the Bahamas, the Marshall Islands, Malta, and Cyprus, because these nations offer more attractive tax and employment regulatory regimes. For instance, crews do not have to be nationals of these countries. Because of this development, most maritime trading nations enforce shipping regulations under a \"port state control\" regime\u2014that is, they require compliance with IMO standards as a condition of calling at their ports. The fragmented nature of ship ownership and operation can be a further hurdle to regulatory enforcement. It is common for cargo ships to be owned by one company, operated by a second company (which markets the ship's space), and managed by a third (which may supply the crew and other services a ship requires to sail), each of which could be headquartered in different countries. ", "Classification Societies", "Classification societies are independent third parties that inspect and certify that a ship meets their specifications in design and operation. The inspection process occurs at various stages as the ship is constructed and periodically after the ship is in operation. Inspection becomes more thorough as the ship ages. Insurance companies and banks require a ship to be classed before they will underwrite or finance it and, thus, class certification is necessary if a vessel is to enter and remain in commercial service. The Coast Guard may refer to a set of classification society standards in its regulations when identifying requirements that ship operators must meet. ", "Decades ago the credibility of classification societies began to be questioned because they were paid by vessel owners who found it advantageous to have their ships built to the societies' standards (\"built to class\"). From an insurer's or banker's perspective, a classification society had a conflict of interest if it was being paid by a ship's owner. In response, some insurers and banks began hiring their own inspectors to survey ships, in addition to requiring class inspection. Also, classification societies typically have a for-profit side of their business, selling technical expertise to vessel owners. This places them in competition with one another and raises the possibility that they might allow for some leeway when enforcing standards in order to gain business. ", "Some of the classification societies established a trade association in 1969 to set industry practices to address these concerns. In 2004, Congress required that the Coast Guard not accept certifications by classification societies that are not members of this trade association or that have not been approved by the Coast Guard under specified criteria. The criteria include the requirement that the society not be involved in any activity that could be a conflict of interest."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
