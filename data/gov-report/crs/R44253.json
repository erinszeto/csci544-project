Appendix\u2014Federal Advisory Committee Act; 86 Stat. 770, as amended). FACA was prompted by the perception that some advisory committees were duplicative, inefficient, and lacked adequate oversight. FACA mandates certain structural and operational requirements, including formal reporting and oversight procedures. Additionally, FACA requires committee meetings be open to the public, unless certain requirements are met. Also, FACA committee records are generally required to be accessible to the public. Pursuant to statute, the General Services Administration (GSA) maintains and administers management guidelines for federal advisory committees.", "During FY2015, 1,009 active FACA committees reported a total of 72,200 members.

", "Federal advisory committees are one of only a few formalized mechanisms for private-sector citizens to participate in the federal policymaking process. Whether called commissions, committees, councils, task forces, or boards, these entities have historically been used to address a gamut of public policy issues, offering policy recommendations on topics ranging from organ transplant practices to improving operations at the Department of Homeland Security.", "In 1972, the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was enacted to set operational requirements for federal advisory committees. FACA defines a federal advisory committee as", "any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof ... established by statute or reorganization plan, ... established or utilized by the President, ... established or utilized by one or more agencies, in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government....

Advisory bodies statutorily mandated may or may not be obligated to follow FACA requirements\u2014often depending on whether Congress explicitly states in legislation whether FACA should apply. One general principle is that FACA's application can be determined by examining which branch of the federal government appoints committee members and to which branch the committee reports its findings. More detail on determining whether FACA's requirements apply to a particular committee are provided later in this report.", "Pursuant to statute, the General Services Administration (GSA) maintains and administers management guidelines for federal advisory committees. In FY2015, 1,009 active FACA committees reported total operating costs of $367,568,370. These committees reported a total of 72,200 members and were divided among 49 departments and agencies. With advisory committees' broad utility, agency administrators, the President, and Congress are likely to continue creating federal advisory committees throughout the 114 th Congress (2015-2016) and in the future.", "In the 114 th Congress, one bill has been introduced that, if enacted, would affect FACA's implementation and administration government-wide. The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2016 ( H.R. 2347 ), introduced by Representative William Lacy Clay in May 2015, would require that advisory committee members be selected to serve without regard to partisan affiliation. Additionally, the bill seeks to ensure that any advisory body subcommittees and privately contracted advisory committees adhere to FACA's requirements. Currently, such subcommittees and privately contracted committees are not covered by FACA. Among other changes, H.R. 2347 seeks to clarify the ethics requirements of committee members and would increase certain federal advisory committee records access requirements.

Since the 1840s, Congress has legislated control over federal advisory bodies\u2014mostly by limiting funding and committee member pay. In 1842, for example, a law was enacted that prohibited payment to \"any commission or inquiry, except courts martial or courts of inquiry in the military or naval service\" without explicit \"special appropriations.\" Similarly, in 1909, another law was enacted that prohibited appropriation to \"any commission, council, board, or other similar body ... unless the creation of the same shall be or shall have been authorized by law.\" The law also prohibited the detailing of any federal employee to work on an unauthorized commission.", "By the 20 th century, some Members of Congress believed the executive branch's advisory bodies were inefficient and not accessible to the public. Some Members believed that the public harbored concerns that a proliferation of federal advisory committees had created inefficient duplication of federal efforts. Moreover, some citizens argued that the advisory entities did not reflect the public will, in part because many committees' policies of closed-door meetings. Congress was called on to increase oversight of the proliferating advisory boards. Subsequently, Congress enacted FACA in 1972. The legislation requires advisory bodies that fit certain criteria to report a variety of information\u2014including membership status, costs, and operations\u2014annually to GSA, which then aggregates and reports the information to Congress.

For example, FACA requires congressional committees to continuously review whether existing federal advisory committees that fall under their legislative jurisdiction are necessary or redundant. Congress is also to determine if the committees are \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed.\" FACA committees established legislatively are to be created with enough autonomy from the appointing power (Congress, the President, or an agency head) so as to not be unduly influenced. Each committee's reporting requirements are to be clearly stipulated, and proper funding and staffing are to be provided.", "The 1972 statute authorized OMB to oversee the management of advisory committees. The OMB Director's first mandated task was to review, concurrently with Congress, existing advisory entities to determine whether they should be abolished. The Director was also to create operating policies for advisory committees and provide \"advice, assistance, and guidance\" to entities \"to improve their performance.\" The guidelines were to include pay rates for members, staff, and consultants, and catalog overall costs for the committees to be used for budget recommendations to Congress. Agency heads were to ensure proper implementation of OMB's guidelines and to \"maintain systematic information on the nature, functions, and operations of each advisory committee within [their] jurisdiction.\" In December 1977, the duties charged to OMB were reassigned to GSA by E.O. 12024. ", "A FACA committee's recommendations are strictly advisory and cannot mandate policy action by recipients of the report. In the case of a presidential advisory committee, however, the President must submit to Congress\u2014within a year of receiving a committee's public report\u2014proposals for action or reasons for inaction on the recommendations in the public report. The President is also required to report annually to Congress the \"activities, status, and changes in the composition of advisory committees in existence during the preceding year.\" FACA requires the President to exclude the activities and composition changes of advisory committees related to national security from the report.", "The law authorizes only Congress, the President, or an agency head to create an advisory committee. FACA requires all committees file a charter, a document that outlines committee mission, bylaws, and authorities, prior to its operation. A charter is required to include the committee's objectives, the support agency, the committee's duties, the estimated operating costs, the estimated number of committee meetings, and the anticipated termination date, among other information.

The Code of Federal Regulations defines an advisory committee nearly identically to FACA's definition, but adds that the body must be created \"for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or on issues or policies within the scope of an agency official's responsibilities.\" In short, FACA applies when an advisory committee is \"either 'established' or 'utilized' by an agency.\" Pursuant to FACA, any advisory body that performs a regulatory or policy-making function cannot be a FACA entity.", "Committees that consist entirely of part- or full-time federal employees are explicitly exempted from FACA, as are committees created by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration. Committees created by or operating within the Central Intelligence Agency or the Federal Reserve System are also FACA exempt. Additionally, some specific committees\u2014for example the Commission on Government Procurement\u2014are statutorily exempt from FACA.", "Although both FACA and the Code of Federal Regulations define advisory committees, it may sometimes be unclear whether some advisory committees\u2014especially those created by statute\u2014must adhere to FACA requirements. Advisory committees created by the executive branch that fit FACA criteria are governed by FACA. Advisory committees that are created by statute, however, may or may not be obligated to follow FACA requirements\u2014often depending on which branch of the federal government appoints committee members and to which branch of the federal government the committee must report its findings. If, for example, a statutorily created advisory committee reported only to Congress and not the executive branch, FACA guidelines likely would not apply. If, however, the same committee reports to both Congress and the President, it is unclear whether FACA guidelines would apply. According to GSA, it is generally up to the agency that hosts the advisory committee to determine whether FACA statutes are applicable. To avoid confusion over whether a committee is governed by FACA, Members of Congress sometimes include a clause within committee-establishing legislation to explicitly clarify whether a committee is to be subject to FACA.", "While FACA may improve both the reality and perception of transparent governmental operation and accessibility, its requirements may also place a number of additional chartering, record-keeping, notification, and oversight requirements on the entity. In particular, agencies have claimed that compliance with the various FACA requirements are cumbersome and resource intensive, thereby reducing the ability of committees to focus on substantive issues in a spontaneous and timely fashion. Moreover, some scholars have argued that the scope of the openness requirements could have the practical effect of stifling candid advice and discussion within a committee. Congress may choose to exempt a statutorily established advisory committee from FACA to allow it potentially to operate more quickly and less expensively than FACA might permit. For example, the requirement that all meetings be posted \"with timely notice\" in the Federal Register may slow down the daily operations of an advisory committee, which will typically not hold meetings until 15 days after the notice is published."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current FACA Operations, Responsibilities, and Costs", "paragraphs": ["Each year roughly 1,000 active advisory committees operate.

Within that time span, FY2011 had the greatest number of active FACA committees with 1,029, while FY2014 had the fewest with 989. In each year examined, a majority of the active committees were required to be established by statute. In FY2015, for example, of all operating FACA committees, Congress required the establishment of 53.4% of them, including 20 committees that began operations in FY2015.

The bill included language noting \"an increasing tendency among Government departments and agencies to utilize the services of experts and consultants as advisory committees or other consultative groups,\" but warned that \"protection of the public interest requires that the activities of such committees and groups be made subject to certain uniform requirements.\"", "In addition to making the five DOJ standards law, the bill would have required the President to submit to Congress an annual report \"detailing the membership of each advisory committee used by each Federal department or agency; the function of each such committee; and the extent to which the operations of the committees have complied with the Standards provided in this Act.\" The bill, as amended, passed the House on July 10, 1957. The bill was sent to the Senate and referred to the Government Operations Committee. No further action was taken.", "The President and the Executive Branch", "In 1962, President John F. Kennedy issued an executive order (E.O. 11007) that reinforced the DOJ advisory committee requirements. The executive order defined an advisory committee as", "any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group ... that is formed by a department or agency of the Government in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations ... that is not composed wholly of officers or employees of the Government.", "E.O. 11007 also limited the lifespan of all federal advisory committees to \"two years from the date of \u2026 formation\" unless special actions were taken by an agency or department head to continue the committee.", "On March 2, 1964, the Bureau of the Budget issued Circular No. A-63, which laid out the executive branch's policies for creating, maintaining, and terminating advisory committees. The circular included guidelines that discouraged dual chairmanships, required annual status reports to the Bureau of the Budget, and compelled all advisory entities not created by statute to be called committees\u2014not commissions, councils, or boards. Throughout the early 1960s and early 1970s, while Congress was holding hearings to determine effective ways to gain oversight and control over advisory committees, executive branch representatives maintained that legislation was unnecessary and used Circular No. A-63 as evidence of systematic oversight of advisory committees.", "On June 5, 1972, just months prior to congressional passage of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, President Richard M. Nixon issued E.O. 11671, which delineated new operating, transparency, and oversight standards for advisory entities. The order incorporated many of the elements within the bill that was to become FACA, including vesting the Office of Management and Budget (OMB\u2014formerly the Bureau of the Budget) with oversight responsibilities for committee management.", "Congressional Reaction", "Congress held a series of hearings to examine the executive branch's use of federal advisory committees throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. During an introduction to one of the hearings, the Senate Committee on Government Operations' Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations Chairman Edmund S. Muskie stated that Congress was using the hearings to examine \"two fundamentals, disclosure and counsel, the rights of people to find out what is going on and, if they want, to do something about it.\" More than 30 witnesses testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations over 12 days of hearings. As a result of the hearings, some Members concluded that advisory committees were \"a useful means of furnishing expert advice, ideas and recommendations as to policy alternatives\" but \"there [are] numerous such advisory bodies that are duplicative, ineffective and costly, and many which have outlived their usefulness, and that neither the Federal agencies, the Executive Office of the President, nor the Congress, have developed any effective mechanisms for evaluating.\"", "In December 1970, the House Committee on Government Operations' Special Studies Subcommittee issued a comprehensive report titled \"Role and Effectiveness of Federal Advisory Committees,\" which compiled research and information gathered from federal agencies from 1969 through 1970. The studies included policy recommendations for advisory bodies. On February 2, 1971, Representative John Mongan introduced the Federal Advisory Committee Standards Act (H.R. 4383; 92 nd Congress), which incorporated many of the study's recommendations.", "The bill addressed the responsibilities of Congress, the Director of OMB, the President, and agency heads to control and maintain federal advisory bodies. For example, congressional committees with legislative jurisdiction over particular issues were to review all advisory bodies related to that topic. The congressional committees were then to eliminate any statutorily created advisory bodies they believed were duplicative, clarify advisory body missions, and ensure that adequate staff and resources were assigned to advisory bodies under their jurisdiction.", "Additionally, the congressional committees were to make certain the ad hoc advisory committees had \"a date established for termination and for submission of the committee report.\" The Director of OMB was to conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of duplicative advisory bodies and recommend to the relevant authority whether they should be eliminated or merged into existing advisory entities. The Director was to work with Congress and agency heads to \"provide advice, assistance, guidance, and leadership to advisory committees.\"", "In the Senate, Senator William V. Roth, Jr., and others, introduced a similar bill (S. 1964; 92 nd Congress) \"to authorize the Office of Management and Budget to establish a system of governing the creation and operation of advisory committees throughout the Federal Government.\" During introductory remarks on the Senate floor on May 26, 1971, Senator Roth acknowledged a lack of congressional oversight of the more than 2,600 advisory committees operating in the federal government.", "Advisory committees have contributed substantially to the effectiveness of the Federal Government in the past. But as the function of Government has become more complex and the decisions more difficult, numerous advisory committees have sprung up to advise the President and other decision-makers in the Federal Agencies and the Congress. Over 2,600 interagency and advisory committees exist today and it is possible that this figure could be as high as 3,200.", "In spite of the large number of advisory committees and their participation in the process of government, Congress has neglected to provide adequate controls to supervise their growth and activity. As a result, the use of committees or advisory groups has come under strong attack in the press and other media as wastes of time, money, and energy. The creation of another committee is often viewed by the public as another indication of inefficiency and indecisiveness in Government.", "S. 1964 was referred to the Senate Committee on Government Operations. No further action was taken on the bill.", "On May 9, 1972, Members of the House voted (357 to 9) to pass H.R. 4383, with several amendments, including the addition of \"openness provisions\" that required public notice of advisory body meetings and public access to advisory body records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552). The bill was then sent to the Senate.", "S. 3529, introduced on April 25, 1972, merged the goals of a number of pending advisory committee bills. According to the Senate report that accompanied the bill, S. 3529 aimed to make advisory committees less redundant and more accessible.", "The purpose of S. 3529 is to: strengthen the authority of Congress and the executive branch to limit the use of Federal advisory committees to those that are necessary and serve an essential purpose; provide uniform standards for the creation, operation, and management of such committees; provide that the Congress and the public are kept fully and currently informed as to the number, purposes, membership, and costs of advisory committees, including their accomplishments; and assure that Federal advisory committees shall be advisory only.", "The Senate debated on whether to make public participation and transparency of advisory committee meetings and recordkeeping mandatory. S. 3529 required facilitating public information requests by making committee records subject to FOIA. The bill, however, did not include explicit requirements for committee membership or participation. When the bill came up for vote on the Senate floor, an amendment was added exempting committees that furnish \"advice or recommendations only with respect to national security or intelligence matters\" from reporting requirements. Another amendment exempting the Federal Reserve Advisory Council was also added to the bill. S. 3529 passed the Senate by voice vote on September 12, 1972. The Senate then struck all the House language of H.R. 4383 and replaced it with that of S. 3529. The Senate then passed H.R. 4383 as amended.", "A conference report that reconciled differences between the House and Senate versions of H.R. 4383 was published on September 18, 1972. The final bill included reporting requirements for advisory committees planning to hold meetings, and ensured public inspection of advisory committee materials would be possible. The conference report was adopted by the Senate on September 19, 1972, and by the House on September 20. President Nixon signed the Federal Advisory Committee Act into law (P.L. 92-463) on October 6, 1972. Following the signing of FACA, then-President Nixon rescinded E.O. 11671, which previously had been the primary document guiding the creation and operation of federal advisory bodies.", "Legislative and Executive Branch Efforts Since FACA's Enactment", "In the years since FACA's enactment, congressional oversight hearings have resulted in legislative and executive branch attempts to clarify the statute or streamline the number of FACA committees. One substantial amendment to FACA was the 1977 Federal Advisory Committee Act, which incorporated the Sunshine Act ( P.L. 94-409 ) into the law. The Sunshine Act is specifically designed to make government agency meetings more publicly accessible and transparent. Another significant change in FACA's administration came in December 1977 when E.O. 12024 transferred advisory committee oversight duties from the Director of OMB to the Administrator of General Services. Additional executive orders have been issued since the law's inception; many of them abolished particular federal advisory committees or lengthened the lifespan of others.", "From 1983 through 1989, legislation was introduced in Congress to strengthen FACA's management controls, as well as to establish new ethical, financial, and conflict-of-interest disclosure requirements for committee members. None of these bills were enacted.", "On February 10, 1993, President William J. Clinton issued E.O. 12838, which required each executive department to \"terminate not less than one-third of the advisory committees subject to FACA (and not required by statute) ... by the end of fiscal year 1993.\" Agency heads were required to review all advisory committees under their jurisdictions and eliminate them or justify in writing why they were necessary to continue. Committees would need approval from the OMB Director to continue operation. The following year, as part of the National Performance Review, Vice President Albert Gore issued a memorandum requiring all agencies to reduce advisory committee costs by 5%. The memorandum also stated that President Clinton would not support legislation that established a new advisory committee or exempted an advisory committee from FACA. ", "On October 5, 1994, Alice M. Rivlin, then-acting Director of OMB, released a circular detailing management policy for remaining FACA committees. The circular reinforced the Clinton Administration's decision to reduce the number of advisory committees and cut costs. It also laid out the criteria GSA was to use when evaluating the utility of existing advisory bodies, and it required GSA to create a variety of operating and reporting guidelines for advisory committees.", "In 1995, two FACA-related laws were enacted. The first exempted intergovernmental advisory actions\u2014official advisory efforts between federal officers and officers of state, local, or tribal governments\u2014from FACA. The second was a law that eliminated GSA's annual reporting requirements to Congress. Pursuant to the law, GSA stopped creating its Annual Report to Congress in 1998, but GSA officials continue to collect and examine data on FACA committees and publish it in the Annual Comprehensive Review, an additional oversight document required by FACA. The Review is used to determine whether advisory bodies are executing their missions and adhering to statutes, or whether they are in need of revision or abolition.", "The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997 further provided for public comment on committee membership and public attendance at committee meetings for advisory bodies that existed within the National Academy of the Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
