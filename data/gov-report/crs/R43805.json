Because the credit is refundable, an EITC recipient need not owe taxes to receive the benefit. Eligibility for and the amount of the EITC are based on a variety of factors, including residence and taxpayer ID requirements, the presence of qualifying children, age requirements for childless recipients, and the recipient's investment income and earned income. Tax filers with income above certain thresholds\u2014these thresholds are based on marital status and number of qualifying children\u2014are ineligible for the credit.", "The EITC varies based on a recipient's earnings. Specifically, the EITC equals a fixed percentage (the \"credit rate\") of earned income until the credit amount reaches its maximum level. The EITC then remains at its maximum level over a subsequent range of earned income, between the \"earned income amount\" and the \"phase-out amount threshold.\" Finally, the credit gradually decreases to zero at a fixed rate (the \"phase-out rate\") for each additional dollar of adjusted gross income (AGI) (or earned income, whichever is greater) above the phase-out amount threshold. The specific values of these EITC parameters (e.g., credit rate, earned income amount) vary depending on several factors, including the number of qualifying children a tax filer has and his or her marital status. For the 2018 tax year, the maximum EITC for a tax filer without children is $519 per year.

The first modification was a larger credit for families with three or more children, while the second reduced the EITC's marriage penalty.", "The EITC is provided to individuals and families once a year, in a lump sum payment after individuals and families file their federal income tax returns. The credit may be received in one of three ways: (1) a reduction in federal tax liability; (2) a refund from the Treasury if the tax filer has no income tax liability; or (3) a combination of a reduced federal tax liability and a refund. The amount of the credit a tax filer receives is based on the prior year's income, earnings, and family composition (marital status and number of qualifying children). That is, the EITC earned based on 2018 earned income will not be paid until 2019.", "The EITC cannot be counted as income in determining eligibility for or the amount of any federally funded public benefit program.

However, the largest EITC benefits are focused on low-income earners near the poverty line, with those with greater earnings receiving reduced benefits.", " Figure 9 shows the number of tax returns with EITC claims for 2015 by adjusted gross income level. Figure 9 shows that the most typical (modal) EITC tax return had an AGI between $10,000 and $14,999, with 6.2 million returns including an EITC in that income range for 2015. For that year, close to half (48.1%) of all returns with EITC claims had AGIs below $15,000. This AGI is equivalent to earnings less than the $15,080 earned by a full-time (40 hour per week) full-year (52 weeks per year) worker earning the federal minimum wage ($7.25 per hour). ", " Figure 9 also shows the average EITC claimed by AGI category. Average EITC benefits first increase with AGI, then decline. This outcome reflects the formula for determining the EITC, which provides an increasing credit up to a maximum amount, then ultimately a reduced credit as it is phased out above a certain income threshold (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). It also reflects a difference in the mix of family types claiming the EITC in the various AGI categories. For example, 73% of all filers claiming the EITC with AGIs of less than $5,000 had no qualifying children. All those claiming the EITC at AGIs above $25,000 in 2015 had qualifying children, and hence were eligible for a larger maximum EITC benefit than filers without children. For detail on returns claiming the EITC by AGI and number of qualifying children, see Table A-2 ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Filing and Marital Status", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Service does not provide data on EITC dollars claimed by filing status. The Tax Policy Center (TPC), however, estimated that in 2015, 70% of all EITC dollars will be claimed by unmarried tax filers (head of household and single filing statuses), with most (60% of all EITC dollars) claimed by those filing as heads of household.

However, the rate at which the EITC is claimed by tax filers varies considerably by state. In 2015, the state with the highest percentage of returns claiming the EITC was Mississippi, with the credit claimed on 31.6% of all returns. In contrast, the EITC was claimed on 11.5% of all returns in New Hampshire that year.", " Figure 11 provides a map showing the percentage of all tax returns claiming the EITC by state. In addition to considerable state variation, the map shows that there is a regional pattern to EITC receipt. A greater share of returns filed in certain southern states claimed the EITC than returns in other regions of the country. The EITC was claimed on the smallest percentage of returns in New England as well as some states in the northern Midwest. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
