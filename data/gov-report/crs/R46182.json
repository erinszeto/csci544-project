In addition, on average, women outlive men and today's widows face increased life expectancy relative to earlier cohorts, potentially incurring significant expenses for their own long-term care and increasing the risk of outliving their retirement resources. These factors contribute to high observed poverty rates among widows and concerns about the adequacy of Social Security benefits in widowhood.", " Table 2 provides hypothetical examples of the differing benefit reductions experienced by widows depending on the relative earnings of the husband and wife. ", "In Example 1, spouse A (worker) in a single-earner couple receives a Social Security benefit at the FRA of $1,770 per month and spouse B (nonworker) receives a Social Security spouse benefit at the FRA of $885 per month (50% of the worker's benefit). The combined couple's retirement benefit is $2,655, or 150% of the worker's PIA (100% of the worker's PIA plus a spouse benefit equal to 50% of the worker's PIA). After the worker's death, the widow (spouse B) receives a widow benefit equal to 100% of the deceased worker's benefit, which is 67% of the combined couple's benefit while both were alive (or a 33% reduction). For the two-earner couple in Example 2, where spouse A and spouse B have equal earnings and both claim benefits at the FRA, their combined benefit is 200% of either worker's PIA ($1,120 for spouse A plus $1,120 for spouse B equals $2,240 combined for the couple). After spouse A's death, the widow (spouse B) continues to receive a worker benefit (which is equivalent to the widow benefit from the deceased husband). The total monthly benefit is 50% of the combined couple's benefit while both spouses were alive (or a 50% reduction). Example 3 shows a two-earner couple with unequal earnings. Spouse A receives a Social Security retirement benefit at the FRA of $1,770 per month. Spouse B, with lower earnings, receives a worker benefit at the FRA of $1,120 per month. The combined couple's benefit is $2,890 per month. Upon spouse A's death, the widow (spouse B) continues to receive a worker benefit, increased by the widow benefit to equal $1,770 per month, or 100% of the deceased worker's benefit. The widow's monthly benefit is 61% of the combined couple's benefit while both were alive (or a 39% reduction).", "Placing the Social Security benefit reduction experienced by a widow upon the spouse's death in the broader context of benefit adequacy requires assessing a single person's consumption needs relative to a couple's. Clearly, a single person's consumption (and thus income) needs are lower than a couple's. The precise amount of the reduction depends upon the extent of economies of scale experienced by a couple relative to a single person, that is, the degree to which a single person needs more than half the income of a couple to sustain the same standard of living. One way to operationalize this concept is to look at the differences between poverty thresholds for one-person and two-person families. The federal poverty threshold in 2018 for a one-person family over the age of 65 was 79% of the federal poverty threshold for a two-person family over the age of 65. The Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure results in a threshold for a one-adult family equal to about 70% of the threshold for a two-adult family. These measures suggest that Social Security widow benefits equaling between 50% and 67% of the combined couple's benefit while both spouses were alive may not be sufficient to sustain the widow's consumption.", "In addition to reduced Social Security benefits, widows are likely to lose part\u00e2\u0080\u0094or in some cases, all\u00e2\u0080\u0094of any private pension payments that were received by the deceased spouse. Prior to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) reforms in 1974, the default pension payout scheme was a single-life annuity that ended upon the retired worker's death. ERISA changed the default to a joint-and-survivor benefit that would continue payments to the widow, albeit at a reduced rate (typically 50%). Further reforms under the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 require the signatures of both the worker and the spouse when choosing a single-life benefit instead of the (default) joint-and-survivor benefit. In either case, the reduction in pension income upon widowhood can be substantial. Pension income also tends to decrease in real value over time, with very few private-sector defined-benefit pensions offering postretirement cost-of-living adjustments.", "Widows may experience significant reductions in wealth and private savings following their spouse's death because of medical and long-term care expenses at the end of life. One study finds that end-of-life out-of-pocket medical expenses are large both in absolute terms and relative to income. Among those in the lowest 25% of the income distribution, end-of-life medical expenses were found to equal roughly 70% of income.", "On average, women live longer than men, and women today live longer than women from earlier cohorts. Remaining life expectancy at retirement is projected to be 2.5 years greater for women reaching age 65 in 2019 compared with men reaching age 65 in 2019. In addition, remaining life expectancy at retirement has increased substantially across birth cohorts. For example, remaining cohort life expectancy for a woman reaching age 65 in 2019 is projected to be 21.5 years, compared with 20.0 years for a woman reaching age 65 in 1999 and 18.8 years for a woman reaching age 65 in 1979. However, these life expectancy gains are not shared equally by all men and women. Greater improvements in life expectancy have been experienced by those in the upper portions of the income distribution relative to those with lower incomes, resulting in a growing gap in life expectancy by income.", "With that as background, consider that in 2017, about 18% of all individuals aged 60 or older were widows; however, nearly 26% of individuals aged 60 or older who lived in families with income below the federal poverty threshold were widows, as shown in Table 3 .

Poverty rates were lower across the board for individuals aged 60 or older who receive Social Security benefits, but still relatively high for widows (10.1%). Never-married individuals had the highest poverty rate among Social Security beneficiaries aged 60 or older, at 19.8%, whereas 2.4% of married individuals living together and receiving Social Security benefits lived in poverty. Although considerably smaller in number, non-Social Security beneficiaries aged 60 or older had substantially higher poverty rates, reaching 30.5% among widows (not shown).", "Older women\u00e2\u0080\u0094in general and among Social Security beneficiaries; among widowed women in particular as well as women who are divorced or separated\u00e2\u0080\u0094had higher poverty rates than older men.

The poverty statistics provide clear evidence that widows are more vulnerable than widowers across all subgroups. The poverty statistics also show that receipt of Social Security benefits reduces poverty overall and, for many subgroups, narrows the gap in poverty rates between widows and widowers. Focusing on widows receiving Social Security benefits, young widows (aged 60-64) have a higher poverty rate (19.5%), and older widows (aged 75 or older) have moderately higher poverty rates (10%-11%), compared with widows aged 65-74 (roughly 8%). White, Asian, and non-Hispanic widows aged 60 or older receiving Social Security benefits have substantially lower poverty rates (around 9%) than black and Hispanic widows aged 60 or older receiving Social Security benefits (20.4% and 19.6%, respectively). Better-educated widows aged 60 or older receiving Social Security benefits have lower poverty rates. Among the small fraction of widows aged 60 or older receiving Social Security benefits who had any earnings in 2017, the poverty rate was 0.9%.", "Considering changes in all income sources, studies find that widows experience an income reduction of 35% to 40% upon their spouse's death. The reduction in income leads to significant increases in poverty rates among widows, the effects of which may compound over time for women who become widowed at younger ages and experience widowhood for longer time periods. Moreover, a substantial fraction of older adults living alone (which may include widows as well as divorced or separated individuals and never-married individuals) has income above the poverty threshold but still below a level that achieves long-term economic stability. Estimates from the CPS show that, in 2017, 16.7% of all widows aged 60 or older and 18.3% of all widows aged 60 or older receiving Social Security benefits lived in near poverty , meaning their family income is above the federal poverty threshold but below 150% of the federal poverty threshold."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefit Equity Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Changes over the past 80-plus years in family structure and the work patterns of husbands and wives are not reflected in current Social Security program rules, leading to some concerns about benefit equity.

Social Security benefits for a spouse with no labor market earnings were designed to be relatively generous. Thus, a traditional one-earner couple receives higher benefits than a two-earner couple with identical lifetime earnings and payroll tax contributions.

Example 2 is a two-earner couple, with the same total annual earnings and payroll taxes as in Example 1, earned and paid in equal proportions by spouse A and B. Despite paying equal payroll taxes, the couple in Example 2 receives lower Social Security benefits during retirement and the total monthly benefit to the widow (spouse B) is substantially lower. In Example 3, spouse A's earnings are the same as in Example 1, but now spouse B also has earnings and makes payroll tax contributions.

For widows who experience the maximum benefit reduction of 17.5% under the widow(er)'s limit, eliminating the widow(er)'s limit would substantially improve benefit adequacy. However, the SSA study estimated that only 14% of the increased benefit payments would be received by widows in poverty and that 40% would be received by widows near poverty (with income under 150% of the federal poverty threshold). Adjustments to the widow(er)'s limit could be designed to direct more of the increased benefit payments to widows in or near poverty, but then would affect fewer widows and would do less to improve benefit adequacy. Other options explored in the SSA study to modify the widow(er)'s limit, again affecting fewer widows, focus on individuals who are widowed before the FRA or cases in which the worker dies before the FRA.

The alternative widow benefit could be capped at a specified level to improve targeting to low- and moderate-income widows and reduce cost. Current-law spouse benefits also could be reduced to offset the alternative widow benefit's cost.", "When calculating the combined benefit, the widow's own worker benefit would be reduced for claiming before the FRA, if applicable. Some proposals include the spouse benefit for this portion of the calculation as well, while others use only the widow's own worker benefit. Including the spouse benefit would broaden eligibility to include single-earner couples and provide greater improvements to benefit adequacy. Using only the widow's worker benefit would do more to improve the proposal's effects on benefit equity. ", "If the deceased spouse claimed benefits before the FRA, the calculation could use the deceased spouse's reduced worker benefit, or it could use the full PIA as if the deceased spouse had claimed benefits at the FRA. The latter approach would effectively eliminate the widow(er)'s limit for those who receive the alternative widow benefit, and is more effective at improving benefit adequacy for lower earners.", "Most proposals for an alternative widow benefit specify that the widow would receive the greater of 75% of the couple's combined worker benefits when both were alive and the current-law widow benefit, as illustrated in Table 7 following the example couples from Table 2 and Table 6 . ", "For the single-earner couple in Example 1a, assuming that both spouses claim benefits at the full retirement age, the alternative widow benefit would be 75% of $1,770, or $1,327.50. Since the alternative widow benefit is less than the current-law widow benefit of $1,770, the widow would continue to receive the current-law amount (equal to 67% of the combined couple's benefit). Note that if spouse benefits were included in the alternative widow benefit computation, and assuming that both spouses claim benefits at the full retirement age, the widow in Example 1b would receive 75% of the combined couple's benefit of $2,655, or about $1,991.25 per month, compared with 67% of the combined couple's benefit while both were alive under current law. For a two-earner couple where the husband and wife have equal earnings, and again assuming that both spouses claim benefits at the full retirement age, the widow benefit would increase from 50% of the combined couple's benefit while both spouses were alive to 75%, as shown in Example 2. The monthly widow benefit would increase from $1,120 under current law to $1,680 under the alternative widow benefit proposal. Example 3 shows a two-earner couple where the husband and wife have unequal earnings. Again assuming that both spouses claim benefits at the full retirement age, the widow benefit would increase from 61% of the combined couple's benefit while both spouses were alive to 75%. Although the monthly widow benefit would increase from $1,770 under current law to $2,167.50 under the alternative widow benefit proposal, the percentage increase in the widow benefit would be smaller than for the couple with equal earnings. ", "The examples in Table 7 show that the alternative widow benefit proposal, which does not include the value of the spouse benefit, would not improve widow benefits for nonworking survivors in single-earner couples. It would provide the greatest benefit to two-earner couples with roughly equal earnings. Including spouse benefits in the alternative widow benefit calculation would magnify the favorable treatment of nonworking spouses under current law. From the perspective of benefit equity, excluding the spouse benefit would allow the widow's own worker benefit to contribute to the alternative widow benefit on an equal footing with the deceased spouse's worker benefit.", "Without a cap on the alternative widow benefit, one study found that most of the proposal's benefits would go to higher-earning couples. Imposing a cap on the alternative widow benefit can improve benefit adequacy by targeting benefit increases to widows at the lower end of the income distribution. Several approaches are available, such as setting the cap at the PIA of a career average earner, the average benefit of all retired workers, or the average benefit of newly retired workers. The solvency and distributional analyses below impose a cap based on the PIA of a career average earner who becomes eligible for retired worker benefits in the same year the deceased spouse became entitled to worker benefits.", "As explained in detail below, based on SSA analysis, the alternative widow benefit's cost is modest and the distributional effects point to improvements in both benefit adequacy and benefit equity. The alternative widow benefit proposal would not reduce benefits for anyone. Thus, no transition period would be needed and it could be applied to new widow beneficiaries as well as current widow beneficiaries. If other changes to the Social Security program were desired to offset the alternative widow benefit's cost, policymakers could consider raising revenue (e.g., increasing the payroll tax), reducing cost (e.g., reducing spouse benefits, other benefit reductions), or both. However, depending on the alternative widow benefit's exact formulation, some approaches may be less desirable. For example, if the widow's spouse benefit is not included in the alternative widow benefit calculation, then offsetting the proposal's cost by reducing spouse benefits would not be appropriate. Additional solvency and distributional analyses could help policymakers to refine the details of any formal proposals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost and Solvency Effects", "paragraphs": ["Three bills introduced in the 116 th Congress contain a provision for the alternative widow benefit, constructed largely as described above. OCACT estimated the financial effects on Social Security of previous versions of two of these bills. OCACT also updates alternative widow benefit estimates after the Trustees Report is released each year. The estimates are based on the Trustees Report's intermediate assumptions and address the policy change's effects on the combined reserves of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds.", "OCACT's latest estimates of the alternative widow benefit proposal's cost and solvency effects reflect the 2019 Trustees Report's intermediate assumptions. The estimates assume the proposal would be implemented for widows receiving benefits at the beginning of 2021 and those becoming eligible after 2021. The alternative widow benefit estimated by OCACT would be 75% of the couple's combined worker benefits when both were alive (the widow's own worker benefit and the deceased worker's PIA). It would apply actuarial reductions or delayed retirement credits to the widow's own worker benefit and the deceased spouse's PIA. Finally, it would impose a cap defined by the PIA of a hypothetical worker who earns the SSA average wage index every year and becomes eligible for retired worker benefits in the same year the deceased spouse became entitled to worker benefits. Under these alternative widow benefit parameters, the long-range actuarial balance would worsen by 4%. However, the changes are not large enough to change the year of reserve depletion, estimated to be 2035 in the 2019 Trustees Report under both current law and the alternative widow benefit proposal.

The ORES estimates are derived from the Modeling Income in the Near Term, Version 7 (MINT7) microsimulation model. The estimates pertain to current-law beneficiaries aged 60 or older in 2030, 2050, and 2070. Outcomes of interest from the ORES MINT estimates include changes in benefits, household income, and poverty, among all beneficiaries and affected beneficiaries, disaggregated by gender, marital status, educational attainment, and household income quintile. ", "Among current-law beneficiaries aged 60 or older in 2030, the ORES MINT estimates suggest that 8% of beneficiaries will experience higher benefits under the alternative widow benefit relative to current law, including 10% of female beneficiaries, 11% of beneficiaries whose education was limited to high school, and 14% of beneficiaries with less than a high school education. The proposal would result in higher benefits for nearly one-third of current-law widow beneficiaries, with gains concentrated among those in poverty and in the bottom two-fifths of the household income distribution (due to the cap at the PIA of a career average wage worker). Similar, though slightly stronger, results are obtained for current-law beneficiaries aged 60 or older in 2050 and 2070. Among beneficiaries affected by the alternative widow benefit in 2030, the median benefit increase is 17%, again with the largest gains among those in poverty. The poverty rate is estimated to decrease by 10.2% (or 0.5 percentage points) among all current-law beneficiaries aged 60 or older in 2030, and by 38% (or 1.9 percentage points) among current-law widow beneficiaries aged 60 or older in 2030. In 2070, 43% of current-law widow beneficiaries aged 60 or older are estimated to experience a benefit increase. While the gains continue to be concentrated among the lowest income quintiles in 2050 and 2070, the poverty effects are muted in 2070 relative to 2030 and 2050. Gains relative to payable benefits (rather than scheduled benefits) in 2050 and 2070 are orders of magnitude larger but follow the same general patterns.", "When considering the alternative widow benefit's distributional effects, some of the proposal's limitations are worth noting. First, a person must have a qualifying marital history to receive widow benefits. As such, the alternative widow benefit would not improve benefit adequacy for a growing group of women who do not have a marital history that would qualify for widow benefits, including never-married women, who have a high poverty rate ( Table 4 ).", "Further, if the alternative widow benefit is based only on the widow's own worker benefit (not also including the spouse benefit), then both members of the couple would need to have a work history sufficient to earn Social Security worker benefits. Under this scenario, the alternative widow benefit would not improve benefit adequacy for nonworking survivors in single-earner couples.", "Finally, a higher Social Security widow benefit could lead to reduced or lost Supplemental Security Income payments for some widows, which in turn could lead to lost eligibility for other means-tested programs, such as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as Food Stamps), and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Policymakers may wish to consider offsets or exclusions (hold-harmless provisions) in these programs to prevent loss of eligibility."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Other Policy Changes That May Benefit Widows", "paragraphs": ["Several other policy changes proposed for other vulnerable groups would aid widows who are members of those targeted groups.

However, the SMB grows with prices rather than wages, and thus affects fewer beneficiaries every year. In December 2018, 35,505 beneficiaries received the SMB, with an average monthly benefit of just over $900. In addition, the SMB is computed based on years of coverage, rather than lifetime earnings. The earnings threshold for a year of coverage in 2019 is $14,805 (by comparison, in 2019 a worker earns four quarters of coverage for traditional Social Security benefits with annual earnings of $5,440). A worker must have at least 11 years of coverage to qualify for the SMB, and the maximum SMB is obtained with 30 years of coverage.", "Proposals to improve benefit adequacy by providing an enhanced minimum benefit under Social Security take many forms and may serve to increase retirement income and reduce poverty among some older women and widows. Some proposals would reform the SMB to apply to a larger group of workers with substantial work histories and low earnings. The initial SMB could be tied to wage growth rather than price growth, the amount of earnings required for a year of coverage could be reduced, partial years of coverage could be allowed, and the amount of the SMB could be tied to a fraction of the federal poverty threshold, increasing with the number of years of coverage.", "Others point out that workers with shorter working careers are a larger group at greater risk of poverty in older age and would not be aided by a reformed SMB. Some options to address this group include (1) creating a new basic minimum benefit as a supplement to traditional Social Security benefits for low-income beneficiaries above the FRA and (2) revising the bend points and PIA factors in the traditional Social Security benefit formula to increase benefits for low earners and improve progressivity. Older women and widows from birth cohorts currently of retirement age may be well represented among workers with shorter working careers, given traditional propensities to leave the workforce for raising children and potentially for providing elder care. However, recent research suggests that women's labor force participation patterns are changing, with higher levels of employment early in life, motherhood coming later in life, motherhood's impact on employment lessening, and women working longer at older ages. Among women who worked at some point during their pregnancy, the fraction who reported quitting their jobs around the time of the birth decreased substantially for those having their first child in the early 2000s compared with those having their first child in the 1980s, whereas the fraction taking paid leave increased substantially and the fraction taking unpaid leave remained constant. Cohorts of women born in the 1950s and later are expected to enter their retirement ages with more work experience and more steeply sloped earnings patterns.

With increased life expectancy comes greater risk of outliving one's non-Social Security retirement resources and, consequently, greater reliance on Social Security benefits. Poverty rates also increase with age, particularly among women (although Table 5 shows an even higher poverty rate among young widows aged 60-64).

One proposal would target the benefit increase to low-income beneficiaries. Another would provide a delayed annuity for older beneficiaries whose benefit is below some minimum level relative to the federal poverty threshold and increase it with years of covered earnings. Estimates of an option to increase benefits by 5% for beneficiaries aged 85 or older (about 64% of whom are widows) in 2030 point to modest reductions in poverty.
