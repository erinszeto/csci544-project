Thelower federal appellate courts were divided over whether failure to provide notification should betreated as a violation of the Rule or as a constitutional violation; and they likewise could not agreeon how long notification might be postponed when exigent circumstances justified delayednotification, United States v. Freitas , 800 F.2d 1451 (9th Cir. 1986); United States v. Pangburn , 983F.2d 449 (2d Cir. 1993); United States v. Simmons , 206 F.3d 392 (4th Cir. 2000).
