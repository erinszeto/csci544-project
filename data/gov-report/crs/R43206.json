Provisions supporting the oil and gas sector reflect desires for domestic energy production and energy security, long-standing cornerstones of U.S. energy policy. Incentives for renewable energy reflect the desire to have a diverse energy supply, also consistent with a desire for domestic energy security. Incentives for energy efficiency are designed to reduce use of energy from all energy sources. Incentives for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and alternative technology vehicles reflect environmental concerns related to the production and consumption of energy using fossil-based resources.", "Many energy-related tax provisions are temporary, with a number scheduled to expire at the end of 2016. Most recently, expired energy tax incentives were extended as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113). Most energy-related provisions were extended for two years, through the end of 2016. Incentives for wind and solar were given longer-term extensions, with credits scheduled to phase out over a multi-year period in the future. One issue is whether energy-related tax incentives currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2016 will be further extended.", "Energy-related tax incentives reduce the amount of federal tax revenue collected. Between 2015 and 2019, it is estimated that incentives for fossil fuels will reduce revenues by $21.5 billion. For renewables, the cost of energy-related tax incentives is an estimated $46.5 billion over the same time period. The cost of tax incentives for energy efficiency is estimated to be $3.1 billion in federal revenue loss between 2015 and 2019. These estimates reflect the recent extensions enacted in P.L. 114-113. However, further extensions of energy-related tax provisions currently scheduled to expire would increase the cost of these incentives.", "The Obama Administration has also proposed a number of changes to energy tax policy as part of its annual budget proposal.

In theory, energy taxes and subsidies, like tax policy instruments in general, are intended either to correct a problem or distortion in the energy markets or to achieve some economic (efficiency, equity, or even macroeconomic) objective. The economic rationale for government intervention in energy markets is commonly based on the government's perceived ability to correct for market failures. To correct for these market failures governments can utilize several policy options, including taxes, subsidies, and regulation, in an effort to achieve policy goals. In practice, energy tax policy in the United States is made in a political setting, determined by fiscal dictates and the views and interests of the key players in this setting, including policymakers, special interest groups, and academic scholars.

Tax incentives for the domestic production of fossil fuels also promote energy security by attempting to reduce the nation's reliance on imported energy sources.", "The idea of applying tax policy instruments to energy markets is not new. Until the 1970s, however, energy tax policy had been little used, except to promote domestic fossil fuel production. Recurrent energy-related problems since the 1970s\u2014oil embargoes, oil price and supply shocks, wide petroleum price variations and price spikes, large geographical price disparities, tight energy supplies, and rising oil import dependence, as well as increased concern for the environment\u2014have caused policymakers to look toward energy taxes and subsidies with greater frequency. The direction of U.S. energy tax policy has changed several times since the 1970s.

There are times, however, when tax policy can be used to achieve other goals. These include the use of tax policy as an economic stimulus or to achieve social objectives. Tax policy can also be used to correct for market failures (for example, the under- or over-supply of a good), which without intervention result in market inefficiencies. There are a number of market failures surrounding the production and consumption of energy. Tax policy, as it relates to energy, can be used to address these market failures. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rationale for Intervention in Energy Markets3", "paragraphs": ["There are a variety of circumstances in which government intervention in energy markets may improve market outcomes. Generally, government intervention has the potential to improve market outcomes when there are likely to be market failures. Externalities represent one of the most important market failures in energy's production and consumption. Market failures in energy markets also arise from principal-agent problems and information failures. Concerns regarding national security are used as a rationale for intervention in energy markets as well. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Externalities", "paragraphs": ["An externality is a spillover from an economic transaction to a third party, one not directly involved in the transaction itself. Externalities are often present in energy markets as both the production and consumption of energy often involve external costs (or benefits) not taken into account by those involved in the energy-related transaction. Instead, these externalities are imposed on an unaffiliated third party. The market mechanism will likely lead to an economically inefficient level of production or consumption when externalities are present.", "When externalities are present, markets fail to establish energy prices equal to the full cost to society of supplying the good. The result is a system where price signals are inaccurate, such that the socially optimal level of output, or allocative efficiency, is not achieved. Economic theory suggests that a tax be imposed on activities associated with external costs, while activities associated with external benefits be subsidized\u2014in order to equate the social and private marginal costs. These taxes or subsidies are intended to provide a more efficient allocation of resources.", "Many energy production and consumption activities result in negative externalities, perhaps the most recognized being environmental damage. Air pollution results from mining activities as well as from the transportation, refining, and industrial and consumer use of oil, gas, and coal. Industrial activity can also produce effluents that contaminate water supplies and lead to other damages to the land. These environmental damages can lead to lung damage and a variety of other health problems. The use of fossil fuels, both in the production of energy (e.g., coal-fired power plants) and at the consumer level (e.g., using gasoline to power automobiles), and the associated greenhouse gas emissions are widely claimed to have contributed to global climate change. ", "There may also be market failures associated with external benefits stemming from the process of learning-by-doing. Learning-by-doing refers to the tendency for production costs to decline with experience. As firms become more experienced in the manufacturing and use of energy-efficient technologies their knowledge may spill over to other firms without compensation. In energy markets, early adopters of energy-efficient technologies and practices may not be fully compensated for the value of the knowledge they generate. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principal-Agent and Informational Inefficiencies", "paragraphs": ["Market failures in energy use may also arise due to the principal-agent problem. Generally, the principal-agent problem exists when one party, the agent, undertakes activities on the behalf of another party, the principal. When the incentives of the agent differ from those of the principal, the agent's activities are not undertaken in a way that is consistent with the principal's best interest. The result is an inefficient outcome. In energy markets, the principal-agent problem commonly arises when one party is responsible for making equipment purchasing choices while another party is responsible for paying the energy costs, which are related to the efficiency level of the purchased equipment. ", "For residential rental properties, the incentives for the landlords and tenants surrounding the adoption of energy-savings practices are often not aligned, demonstrating the principal-agent problem. Landlords will tend to under-invest in energy-saving technologies for rental housing when the benefits from such investments accrue to tenants (i.e., tenants are responsible for paying their own utilities) and the landlord does not believe the costs of installing energy-saving devices can be recouped via higher rents. Tenants do not have an incentive to invest in energy-savings technologies in rental units when their expected tenure in a specific property is relatively short, and they will not have enough time to reap the full benefits of the energy-conserving investments. There is also evidence that when utilities are included in the rent, tenants do not engage in energy-conserving behaviors. On the other hand, when tenants pay utilities on their own, energy-saving practices are more frequently adopted. The implication is that inefficient energy use by tenants in apartments where utilities are included as part of the rent would offset energy-saving investments made by landlords; consequently, landlords under-invest in energy efficiency. In general, the under-investment in energy conservation measures in rental housing provides economic rationale for intervention. ", "In another example, the incentives of homebuilders and homebuyers may not be aligned. Consequently, the principal-agent problem may result in an inefficient utilization of energy-efficient products in newly constructed homes. Homebuilders may have an incentive to install relatively low-efficiency products to keep the cost of construction down, if they do not believe that the cost of installing energy-efficient products will be recovered upon sale of the property. The value of installing energy-efficient devices may not be recoverable, if builders are not able to effectively communicate the value of energy-efficient devices once installed. Further, since homebuilders are not able to observe the energy use level of prospective buyers they may not be able to choose the products that best match the use patterns of the ultimate energy consumer. The result may be less energy efficiency in new homes. ", "There are also informational problems that may lead to underinvestment in energy-efficient technologies. For example, homeowners may not know the precise payback or rate of return of a specific energy-efficient device. This may explain the so-called \"energy paradox\"\u2014the empirical observation that consumers require an abnormally high rate of return to undertake energy-efficiency investments. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Security", "paragraphs": ["Preserving national security is another often-cited rationale for intervention in energy markets. However, in recent years, the proportion of petroleum consumed in the United States imported from foreign countries has declined. In 2015, about 24% of petroleum consumed in the United States was imported, the lowest level since 1970. ", "There are potentially a number of external costs associated with petroleum importation, especially when imported from unstable countries and regions. First, a high level of reliance on imported oil may contribute to a weakened system of national defense or contribute to military vulnerability in the event of an oil embargo or other supply disruption. Second, there are costs to allocating more resources to national defense than necessary when relying on high levels of imported oil. Specifically, there is an opportunity cost associated with resources allocated to national defense, as such resources are not available for other domestic policy initiatives and programs. To the extent that petroleum importers fail to take these external costs into account, there is market failure. ", "In addition, the economic well-being and economic security of the nation depends on having stable energy sources. There are economic costs associated with unstable energy supplies. Specifically, increasing unemployment and inflation may follow oil price spikes. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Interventions in Energy Markets", "paragraphs": ["When there are negative externalities associated with an activity, correcting the economic distortion with a tax, if done correctly, can improve economic efficiency. While such taxes are theoretically desirable, historically, such taxes have been politically unpopular. Conversely, when there are positive externalities associated with an activity, a subsidy can improve economic efficiency. The tax (subsidy) should be set equal to the monetary value of the damages (benefits) to third parties imposed by the activity. The tax serves to increase the price of the activity, and reduce the equilibrium quantity of the activity, while a subsidy reduces the price, increasing the equilibrium quantity of the activity. ", "The production and consumption of fossil fuel energy can have negative externalities via detrimental environmental impacts. While multiple policy options to address this externality exist, economists tend to favor an emissions tax to address this externality because of such a tax's efficiency advantage. In the late 2000s, proponents of greenhouse gas controls favored a cap and trade policy, as proposed in House-passed American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 ( H.R. 2454 ). The policy discussion, however, has shifted to focus on a carbon tax or emissions fee approach. ", "An alternative approach to reducing the use of fossil fuels has been to subsidize energy production from alternative energy sources. There are concerns, however, that using subsidies to stimulate demand for alternative fuels, as an alternative to fossil fuels, may not be economically efficient. First, subsidies reduce the average cost of energy, and as the average cost of energy falls, the quantity of energy demanded increases, countering energy conservation initiatives. Second, while the subsidy is intended to enhance economic efficiency, subsidies may be inefficient to the extent they are funded with distortionary taxes. Hence, the more economically efficient alternative may be to place a tax on the undesirable activity.", "Other energy-related activities may have positive externalities. There is the potential for learning-by-doing from early adopters of energy-efficient technologies, indicating that there may be positive external effects associated with these activities. For this reason, subsidies given to early adopters may enhance economic efficiency. Further, positive externalities are associated with R&D activities that lead directly to technological innovations. In addition to budgeted spending on R&D, the tax code provides incentives for firms to engage in energy R&D (for example, the energy research credit [Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \u00a741]). ", "When principal-agent problems lead to a market failure, economically efficient corrective measures would be those that increase the equilibrium quantity of the underprovided good. The market for energy efficient technologies is one example of this type of market failure. Currently, a taxpayer's gross income excludes any subsidy provided by a public utility to a consumer for the purchase or installation of energy-saving devices (see IRC \u00a7136). This exclusion subsidizes energy-efficient devices. This exclusion does not specifically target the inefficiency in rental housing created by the principal-agent problem, since the exclusion applies to both owner- and non-owner-occupied property. Nonetheless, the exclusion may serve to ameliorate some of the market failure in the provision of energy-efficiency for rental property.", "There are also various options for market intervention to address the informational problem associated with energy consumption and energy-efficient technologies. One option would be an information-based solution, such as energy-efficiency labeling and education and awareness campaigns. Alternatively, a tax-incentive-based approach\u2014such as a credit or deduction for the purchase of energy-efficient devices\u2014could be used to address the market inefficiency. Given that this market failure is an informational problem, it might be more efficient to pursue information-based solutions (such as energy-efficiency labeling like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy's Energy Star program).", "Finally, there are questions regarding the most efficient and effective mode of intervention to address the negative external costs, specifically national and economic security concerns, associated with the consumption of imported oil. One option would be to impose a tax to correct the distortion. There are two problems with imposing such a tax. First, a tax on imported oil is likely to violate trade agreements. This has led policymakers to pursue policies that subsidize domestic petroleum production. The second problem is that oil is a commodity priced on world markets. The United States producing oil for its own use does not necessarily insulate consumers from global fluctuations in oil prices. Additionally, to the extent that oil price fluctuations impact export prices in other parts of the world, such as Europe and China, the United States is still likely to experience economic impacts from oil price fluctuations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Taxes as a User Charge", "paragraphs": ["Energy taxes may be employed as user charges for a public good or a quasi-public good. In the United States, non-toll highways and highway infrastructure have the public good property of non-excludability. Highways are not likely to be provided by the market because public goods and quasi-public goods are susceptible to the free-rider problem. If the private market fails to provide a public good, like highways, then government intervention via provision of highways can enhance economic efficiency. The federal excise tax on gasoline is often viewed as a user fee for the federal highway system. For the tax to be efficient and equitable, it would charge individuals in proportion to their benefit from the public good (the highway system). In practice, gas taxes do not reflect the cost to the user but instead depend on the fuel efficiency of a specific vehicle. Furthermore, some of the revenues collected from the federal gas tax serve to subsidize public transportation, undermining the view of the federal gas tax as a highway user fee."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Current Status of U.S. Energy Tax Policy26", "paragraphs": ["Current U.S. energy tax policy is a combination of long-standing provisions and relatively new incentives.

They can be broadly categorized as (1) enhancing capital cost recovery; (2) subsidizing extraction of high-cost fossil fuels; or (3) encouraging investment in non-petroleum or cleaner fossil fuel energy options. Certain incentives are designed to support coal, while others tend to support the oil and gas sector. The fossil fuels related incentives listed in Table 1 are estimated to reduce federal tax revenues by $21.5 billion between 2015 and 2019.", "Among the capital cost subsidies, the allowance of the percentage depletion method is estimated to cost $8.8 billion between 2015 and 2019. Under percentage depletion, a deduction equal to a fixed percentage of the revenue from the sale of a mineral is allowed. Total lifetime deductions, using this method, typically exceed the capital invested in the project. To the extent that percentage depletion deductions exceed project investment, percentage depletion becomes a production subsidy, instead of an investment subsidy. In other words, taxpayers may be able to claim allowances that reduce tax liability even after the cost of investment is fully recovered. Other capital cost recovery provisions include expensing of intangible drilling costs related to exploration and development and a decrease in the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical (G&G) expenditures. The expensing of exploration and development costs is estimated to cost the federal government $7.5 billion in revenue losses over the 2015 through 2019 budget window, while the reduced amortization period for G&G expenditures is estimated to cost $0.7 billion over the same time period.", "Compared to capital cost recovery provisions, tax expenditures intended to offset high extraction costs are small. These provisions do not appear in Table 1 as they fall below the de minimis threshold. In recent years, credits for enhanced oil recovery and oil and gas production from marginal wells were phased out due to high oil prices. In 2015, the enhanced oil recovery credit was fully phased out, as the reference price for oil ($87.39, based on 2014 prices) exceeded the phaseout threshold amount ($28, adjusted for inflation, or $45.49) by $41.90. The phaseout for the marginal wells credit begins once the price of oil exceeds $18 (the $18 amount is adjusted for inflation after 2005). It is possible, however, if oil prices remain low, that these incentives could become available. The expensing allowance for tertiary injectants is also estimated to cost less than $50 million over the 2015 through 2019 budget window. ", "There are also coal-specific energy tax provisions. These include certain coal production credits, as well as tax credits to support the development of clean coal facilities. The tax credits for investing in clean coal facilities are estimated to cost $1.0 billion over the 2015 through 2019 budget window. There are also provisions that provide for 5-year amortization for investments in pollution control facilities associated with certain coal-fired power plans. This provision has an estimated revenue cost of $1.7 billion between 2015 and 2019.", "The credit for alternative fuels and alternative fuels mixtures is a 50-cent per gallon tax credit available to several fossil-based non-petroleum fuels.

This grant was available for projects that were under construction before the end of 2011. Since grants will be paid out when facilities are placed in service, outlays will continue through 2017. Since the grant is paid once a project is completed, the cost of the grant program will be partially offset by reduced PTC claims over time (since the PTC is awarded during the first 10 years of production). Allowing investors to take a one-time grant instead of future tax credits was intended to address uncertainty renewable energy investors may have regarding their future tax positions.

The residential energy-efficient property credit provides a tax credit for the installation of renewable electricity generating property for a residential dwelling. For non-solar technologies, the credit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2016. For solar property, the credit is available through 2021, although the credit begins to phase out after the end of 2019.

Energy-efficient improvements for commercial property, including upgrades to a building's envelope, heating and cooling, or lighting system, are eligible for a tax deduction, limited to $1.80 per square foot.
