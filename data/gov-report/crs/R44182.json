The final FY2015 DHS appropriation had not been finalized by the time the FY2016 budget justifications were released to Congress. Program changes could therefore not be measured against a FY2015 enacted level, so the new FY2016 justifications compared the proposal to the old FY2015 justification.

The budget request also included an increase of $10 million to assess the risk to critical infrastructures associated with climate change ($6 million in the Infrastructure Analysis and Planning PPA and $4 million in the Sector Management and Governance PPA).

For example, despite a program increase of $87 million for certain Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring (CDM) activities, the request included a relatively large drop in the request for the overall Federal Network Security PPA, the request for which is $40 million below the FY2015 request. This was because the PPA also included a negative adjustment-to-base of $126 million associated with non-recurring costs from the previous year related to other CDM activities.

The Administration generally requests funding for the DRF based on what FEMA plans to spend on all past declared catastrophic events, plus the 10-year average for non-catastrophic events, and a reserve to prevent shortfalls.", "Funding currently provided to the DRF can be broken out into two categories. The first is funding for activities not directly tied to major disasters under the Stafford Act (including activities such as assistance provided to states for emergencies and fires). This category is sometimes referred to as the DRF's \"base\" funding. The second (and significantly larger) category is for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act. This structure reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act ( P.L. 112-25 , hereinafter referred to as the BCA), which allows these costs incurred by major disasters to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to the discretionary spending caps, rather than having them count against the discretionary spending allocation for the bill (see insert below).", "The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed $7,375 million for the DRF\u2014a 5% increase compared to the enacted level of $7,033 million from FY2015. $662 million was requested for the base, while $6,713 million was requested for the costs of major disasters. In addition, the Administration requested a $24 million transfer from the DRF to the DHS Office of Inspector General (DHS OIG) for oversight of disaster relief activities. Transfers from the DRF are a long-standing means of supporting the DHS OIG's annual budget for oversight of disaster relief, first occurring in FY2004, the first annual appropriations act for the department. The Administration also requested a $250 million rescission from prior-year DRF appropriations not designated as emergency funding or disaster relief under the BCA.", "The House- and Senate-reported bills included the amount requested by the Administration for the DRF ($662 million for the base, and $6,713 million for disaster relief) including the $24 million transfer to the DHS OIG.

After the rescission, the amount provided for the DRF was $6,713 million, the same amount initially requested by the Administration and recommended by the House- and Senate-reported bills.

When the account neared depletion, Congress usually provided additional funding through supplemental appropriations. In some fiscal years, Congress passed two or three supplemental appropriations to fund the DRF. ", "Since the passage of the BCA, an increase in the annual funding level for the DRF may have decreased the need for supplemental funding. As demonstrated in Table 5 , annual appropriations for the DRF have been significantly larger since FY2011, the last year appropriations were provided for the DRF without benefit of the mechanisms of the BCA.

Even then, when Hurricane Sandy made landfall, the existing balance in the DRF helped fund the immediate assistance needs in the wake of the storm without a supplemental appropriation. The larger balance provided the Administration and Congress with more time to assess the need for federal assistance and target it rather than requiring immediate legislative action to fund the DRF.", "Existing balances in the DRF are also attributable in part to FEMA's efforts to recover unused relief funds. Initial obligations of disaster relief funding are based, in part, on initial cost estimates. In some cases FEMA later determines the project will cost less than anticipated. FEMA then \"deobligates\" the excess funds, returning them to the DRF, and counting the deobligation as a recovery. Monthly FEMA reporting indicates that FEMA currently recovers an average of $67 million a month. ", "This same reporting noted that for FY2015, a total of $14,206 million was available in the DRF: $2,594 million for the base and $11,612 million for the costs of major disasters. The report stated that as of the end of June 2015, there was $7,936 million in unobligated funds remaining in the DRF: $2,095 million in the base, and $5,743 million for the cost of major disasters. FEMA projected that by the end of the year, $3,267 million would be left unobligated. Some may argue a relatively healthy balance is beneficial compared to years prior to the BCA where a large disaster or active hurricane season (or both) could have quickly depleted the remaining unobligated amount, necessitating a supplemental appropriation for additional funds for disaster relief. Others may point at the recoveries and the large DRF balance and question the budgetary practices used to appropriate funds for the DRF. They might conclude the account is being funded at too high a level and any excess funds not used for an emergency or disaster could be transferred or rescinded for purposes other than disaster assistance.", "From FY2014 through FY2016, rescissions were made from the DRF that offset the cost of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act. These rescissions were limited to unexpended balances that were not designated as being for the costs of major disasters under the Stafford Act or as emergency appropriations. Thus, the funds were either appropriated to the base, or recovered from projects that were funded prior to the BCA's impact on appropriations. The Administration actually requested such rescissions for FY2015 and FY2016, seeking $200 million and $250 million in rescissions respectively.

However, the FY2015 budget request, while not suggesting funding for the program itself, did use the PDM Fund as a potential receptacle for funds as part of its \"Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative.\" That initiative, which was not realized, would have provided significant funding for the PDM fund, although not for the PDM program as currently understood.

", "Though the Administration was not requesting new funding for PDM in previous years, Congress was providing a base level of $25 million to $30 million during those years. The Administration had previously justified the lack of a funding request on two points: one, a backlog of PDM projects that had created a substantial balance in the PDM fund and two, the existence of the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP).
