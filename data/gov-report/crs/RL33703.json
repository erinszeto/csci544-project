The Administration pointed out several weaknesses of the rules that were then in place:", "Sponsors of underfunded plans were not required to make additional contributions, called deficit reduction contributions , as long as their plans were at least 90% funded. Because the interest rates used to calculate current pension plan liabilities were averaged over a four-year period and asset values used to calculate minimum funding requirements could be averaged over five years, neither plan assets nor liabilities were measured accurately. Plans that were underfunded were sometimes able to amortize their funding shortfalls over periods as long as 30 years. Some sponsors of underfunded pensions were able to avoid making contributions to their plans for several years because they had made contributions beyond the required minimum in the past. The use of these so-called \"credit balances\" led to greater underfunding of pension plans, according to the Administration's analysis.", "The PBGC was created by Congress in 1974 to insure defined benefit pension plans of private-sector employers. The possibility that the termination of defined benefit pension plans with large unfunded liabilities might eventually lead to the insolvency of the PBGC lent a particular urgency to the effort to mandate improved pension plan funding. Although the PBGC receives no appropriations from Congress, it is generally acknowledged that if the agency were to become financially insolvent\u00e2\u0080\u0094threatening the retirement income of the 44 million Americans who have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans\u00e2\u0080\u0094Congress would have little choice but to step in and engineer a financial bailout of the agency. In 2000, the PBGC recorded a $9.7 billion surplus, but several years of falling interest rates and declining stock prices and the termination of several large, underfunded pension plans led to a rapid deterioration in the PBGC's financial position. Nine of the ten largest pension plan claims for PBGC insurance occurred between 2001 and 2005. (See Table 1 .) These nine claims accounted for 63% of the total dollar value of claims made on the PBGC since the agency began operating in 1975. By 2005, the PBGC had a funding deficit of $22.7 billion, only slightly lower than the record deficit of $23.3 billion that the agency posted in 2004.", "In 2005, major pension reform bills were introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

If a plan is underfunded, the plan sponsor must amortize (pay off with interest) this unfunded liability over a period of years. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) establishes new rules for determining whether a defined benefit pension plan is fully funded, the contribution needed to fund the benefits that plan participants will earn in the current year, and the contribution to the plan that is required if previously earned benefits are not fully funded. In general, the new rules become effective in 2008, but many provisions of the law will be phased in over several years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Minimum Funding Standards for Single-Employer Plans", "paragraphs": ["Pension plan liabilities extend many years into the future. Determining whether a pension is adequately funded requires converting a future stream of pension payments into the amount that would be needed today to pay off those liabilities all at once. This amount, the \"present value\" of the plan's liabilities, is then compared with the value of the plan's assets. An underfunded plan is one in which the value of the plan's assets falls short of the present value of its liabilities by more than the percentage allowed under law. Converting a future stream of payments (or income) into a present value requires the future payments (or income) to be discounted using an appropriate interest rate. Other things being equal, the higher the interest rate, the smaller the present value of the future payments (or income), and vice versa.", "Beginning in 2008, the PPA introduces new funding requirements for single-employer defined benefit pension plans. The law establishes new rules for calculating plan assets and liabilities, and it eliminates deficit-reduction contributions for underfunded plans. When it is fully phased in, the law will require plan funding to be equal to 100% of the plan's liabilities. Any unfunded liability will have to be amortized over seven years. Sponsors of severely underfunded plans that are at risk of defaulting on their obligations will be required to fund their plans according to special rules that will result in higher employer contributions to the plan. Plan sponsors will continue to be allowed to use credit balances to offset required contributions, but only if the plan is funded at 80% or more. The value of credit balances will have to be adjusted to reflect changes in the market value of plan assets since the date the contributions that created the credit balances were made.", "Under the PPA, a plan sponsor's minimum required contribution will be based on the plan's target normal cost and the difference between the plan's funding target and the value of the plan's assets. The plan's target normal cost is the present value of all benefits that plan participants will accrue during the year. The funding target is the present value of all benefits, including early retirement benefits, already accrued by plan participants as of the beginning of the plan year. If a plan's assets are less than the funding target, the plan has an unfunded liability . This liability, less any permissible credit balances, must be amortized in annual installments over seven years. The plan sponsor's minimum required annual contribution is the plan's target normal cost for the plan year, but not less than zero. The 100% funding target will be phased in at 92% in 2008, 94% in 2009, 96% in 2010, and 100% in 2011 and later years. The phase-in will not apply to plans that are already underfunded to the extent that they are subject to the deficit reduction contribution rules in 2007. Those plans will have a 100% funding target beginning in 2008.", "Federal law prescribes the interest rate that pension plans must use to calculate the present value of plan liabilities. The PPA requires plans to discount future liabilities using three different interest rates, depending on the length of time until the liabilities must be paid. The interest rates correspond to the length of time until the obligations are due to be paid. A short-term interest rate will be used to calculate the present value of liabilities that will come due within five years. A mid-term interest rate will be used for liabilities that will come due in 5 to 15 years, and a long-term interest rate will be applied to liabilities that will come due in more than 15 years. The Secretary of the Treasury will determine these rates, which will be derived from a \"yield curve\" of investment-grade corporate bonds averaged over the most recent 24 months. The yield curve requirement will be phased in over three years beginning in 2007.

Pension plans that are determined to be at risk of defaulting on their liabilities will be required to use specific actuarial assumptions in determining plan liabilities that will increase the plan sponsor's required contributions to the plan. A plan will be deemed at-risk if it is unable to pass either of two tests. Under the first test, a plan is deemed to be at-risk if it is less than 70% funded under the \"worst-case scenario\" assumptions that (1) the employer is not permitted to use credit balances to reduce its cash contribution and (2) employees will retire at the earliest possible date and will choose to take the most expensive form of benefit. If a plan does not pass this test, it will be deemed to be at-risk unless it is at least 80% funded under standard actuarial assumptions. This latter test will be phased in over four years, with the minimum funding requirement starting at 65% in 2008 and rising to 70% in 2009, 75% in 2010, and 80% in 2011. If a plan passes either of these two tests, it will not be deemed to be at-risk; however, it will still be required to make up its funding shortfall over no more than seven years. Plans that have been in at-risk status for at least two of the last four years also will be subject to an additional \"loading factor\" of 4% of the plan's liabilities plus $700 per participant, which will be added to the plan sponsor's required contribution to the plan.

For example, in an actuarial valuation, the plan's investment returns could be \"smoothed\" (averaged) over a five-year period, and the average asset value could range from 80% to 120% of the fair market value. Averaging asset values over a period of years is permitted because pension plans are considered long-term commitments, and averaging reduces volatility in the measurement of plan assets that can be caused by year-to-year fluctuations in interest rates and the rate of return on investments. Averaging asset values therefore reduces the year-to-year volatility in the plan sponsor's required minimum contributions to a defined benefit pension plan. The PPA narrows the range for actuarial valuations to no less than 90% and no more than 110% of fair market value, and it reduces the maximum smoothing period to two years.

Existing credit balances and new prefunding balances must both be subtracted from assets in determining the \"adjusted funding target attainment\" percentage that is used to determine whether certain benefits can be paid and whether benefit increases are allowed.

Thus, these deferred compensation plans for executives are commonly referred to as \"nonqualified plans.\" Provided that they meet certain requirements under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), nonqualified plans are sometimes permitted to set aside funds to prefund deferred compensation for executives without the funds being treated as income to the plan participants in the year that the contribution to the trust is made. The PPA establishes rules for taxing amounts set aside to prefund nonqualified deferred compensation for executives during a \"restricted period.\" A restricted period occurs if (1) the plan sponsor's defined benefit plan is in at-risk status, (2) the plan sponsor is in bankruptcy, or (3) the plan sponsor's defined benefit plan is terminated in an involuntary or distress termination.

Many defined benefit plans also offer participants the option to take their accrued benefits as a single lump sum at the time they separate from the employer. The amount of a lump-sum distribution from a defined benefit pension is inversely related to the interest used to calculate the present value of the benefit that has been accrued under the plan: the higher the interest rate, the smaller the lump sum, and vice versa. Under prior law, lump-sum distributions were calculated using the average interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds. The PPA replaces the 30-year Treasury bond interest rate as the interest rate for calculating lump-sum distributions from defined benefit plans.", "Beginning in 2008, plan sponsors must calculate lump-sum distributions using a three-segment interest rate yield curve, derived from the rates of return on investment-grade corporate bonds of varying maturities. Plan participants of different ages will have their lump-sum distributions calculated using different interest rates. Other things being equal, a lump-sum distribution paid to a worker who is near the plan's normal retirement age will be calculated using a lower interest rate than will be used for a younger worker. As a result, all else being equal, an older worker will receive a larger lump sum than a similarly situated younger worker. The interest rates used to calculate lump sums will be based on current bond rates rather than the three-year weighted average rate used to calculate the plan's funding target. The new rules for calculating lump sums will be phased in over five years. Plans funded at less than 60% will be prohibited from paying lump-sum distributions.

Benefits paid as a lump sum or other optional form must be converted to an equivalent annuity value for purposes of applying this limit. The PPA requires plans making this calculation to use an interest rate that is no lower than the highest of (1) 5.5%, (2) the rate that results in a benefit of no more than 105% of the benefit that would be provided if the interest rate required for determining a lump-sum distribution were used, or (3) the interest rate specified in the plan documents.
