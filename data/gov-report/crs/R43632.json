Many of the programs in the 2004 act were further expanded and reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill (Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246). Some other programs were established in the 2002 farm bill (Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, P.L. 107-171), often as pilot initiatives that have since become established programs. In addition, some programs supporting specialty crops and organic agriculture are long-standing farm support programs that benefit all agricultural producers and are regularly contained within omnibus farm legislation. These include marketing and promotion programs, crop insurance and disaster assistance, plant pest and disease protections, trade assistance, nutrition programs, and research and extension services, among other types of program support.", "The 2014 farm bill (Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. 113-79) reauthorized and expanded many of the existing farm bill provisions designed to support the specialty crop and certified organic sectors. The 2014 farm bill also provided additional program funding in some cases. Many provisions in Title X (\"Horticulture\") of the farm bill fall into the categories of marketing and promotion; data and information collection; pest and disease control; food safety and quality standards; and support for local foods. Title X also includes provisions benefitting certified organic agriculture producers, including USDA's National Organic Program. However, provisions supporting the specialty crop and certified organic sectors are not limited to Title X, but are also contained within several other titles of the farm bill, including the research, nutrition, and trade titles. An important source of support for the specialty crop industry includes fruit and vegetable purchases under USDA's domestic nutrition assistance programs.", "Despite this wide range of program support, overall program spending for specialty crops and organic agriculture still accounts for a small share of estimated total farm bill spending and remains lower than spending levels for program commodity crops (such as corn, soybeans, grains, dairy, and other farm commodities). Total mandatory spending for specialty crops and organic agriculture under the 2014 farm bill is expected to average about $773 million annually (FY2014-FY2018). In addition, individual specialty crop and organic producers generally do not directly benefit from the same types of federal commodity price and income support programs that benefit producers of commodity crops.", "Other federal agencies also play important roles in the specialty crop industry\u2014either indirectly supporting or overseeing the industry\u2014but are not addressed in this report.

Despite their relatively large share of crop receipts, specialty crops occupy only about 3% of U.S. harvested cropland acres. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that retail sales of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables for at-home consumption total nearly $100 billion annually. Exports of U.S. specialty crops totaled about $14 billion in 2013, or about 10% of total U.S. agricultural exports. ", "In 2012, about 244,000 farming operations grew more than 350 types of fruit, vegetable, tree nut, flower, nursery, and other horticultural crops in addition to the major bulk commodity crops. Specialty crop production is focused in California, Florida, Washington, Oregon, North Dakota and Michigan; however, every state has some commercial specialty crop production within its borders. USDA data illustrate the nationwide distribution of areas producing vegetables ( Figure 1 ), fruits and tree nuts ( Figure 2 ), and floriculture crops ( Figure 3 ).", "A majority of specialty crop producers are considered specialized, which means that they receive at least half of their gross value of production from the sale of vegetables, fruits, tree nuts or other horticultural crops. These specialized farms rely mostly on specialty crop production for their farm income, even though they may be also engaged in other forms of agricultural production. USDA reports that about 50% of all vegetable growers and 80% of fruit and tree nut growers are considered specialized; however, specialized farms account for 90-95% of the total value of U.S. specialty crop production. Conditions may vary considerably by major production region. Specialized fruit and vegetable farms are more concentrated in the Western United States, including California, Washington, and Oregon. Some farms also participate in the major commodity support programs, but these tend to be more concentrated in the Midwestern states.", "For some specialty crop producers, obtaining organic certification to sell their products as \"organic\" represents a viable business strategy. Organic agriculture accounts for a small but growing share of the U.S. farming sector. USDA reports that farm sales from organic fruit and vegetable operations total more than $1 billion annually, or about 4% of all farm-level fruit and vegetable sales in the United States.

In contrast, farm bill support for specialty crops is relatively recent. ", "During the past few farm bill debates, specialty crop producers argued that their sectors should occupy a larger role in farm bill policy discussions and that some of the benefits supporting major commodity producers should be extended to specialty crop and organic producers, in order to create \"a broader, more equitable farm bill.\" Several programs addressing specialty crops specifically were initially established in the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-465 ), which was enacted outside a farm bill year.

", "Unlike programs supporting the production of specific commodity crops, farm bill programs tailored to support specialty crops provide benefits that accrue to all specialty crop producers and generally do not accrue to individual produce growers directly. These types of programs include marketing and promotion programs, crop insurance and disaster assistance, plant pest and disease protections, trade assistance, and research and extension services, among other types of indirect support. The industry also benefits from fruit and vegetable purchases under various food and nutrition programs.

Precise estimates of total mandatory and discretionary sources of funding are difficult to measure, given that support for specialty crops is spread across a wide range of USDA programs and not within a price and income support program such as that available for most of the major commodity crops. Following the 2008 farm bill, an average of approximately $676 million annually (FY2008-FY2012) in mandatory program funding was authorized to be spent on specialty crops and organic agriculture, mostly through government purchases of fruits and vegetables for domestic nutrition and feeding programs ( Table 2 ). The 2014 farm bill reauthorized many of the existing farm bill provisions and also increased spending for some programs supporting specialty crops. Total mandatory spending for specialty crops and organic agriculture is expected to be higher and average $773 million annually (FY2014-FY2018). The 2014 farm bill also authorized another roughly $302 million in average annual appropriations across certain programs. See also Table 2 . ", "Although the 2014 farm bill provided for an increase above current funding levels, total mandatory spending for specialty crops and organic agriculture will still account for a small share of estimated total farm bill spending and will remain well below spending levels for commodity crops. Mandatory spending for the major commodity crops is expected to average about $4.7 billion per year under the 2014 farm bill (FY2014-FY2018), mostly through direct price and income support.

Some key programs in Title X supporting certified organic producers are: continued support for USDA's National Organic Program (NOP); Organic Production and Market Data Initiatives (ODI); and the National Organic Certification Cost Share Program (NOCCSP). The 2014 farm bill also gives USDA authority to consider an application for a research and promotion order (or \"checkoff\" program) for the organic sector.
