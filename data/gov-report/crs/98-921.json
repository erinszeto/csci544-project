It provides broad nondiscrimination protection in employment, public services, public accommodations and services operated by private entities, transportation, and telecommunications for individuals with disabilities. As stated in the act, its purpose is \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\" Enacted on July 26, 1990, the majority of the ADA's provisions took effect in 1992. The ADA Amendments Act, P.L. 110-325 , was enacted on September 25, 2008, to respond to a series of Supreme Court decisions that had interpreted the definition of disability narrowly.", "The Supreme Court has decided 20 ADA cases. In the most recent Supreme Court decision, United States v. Georgia, the Court held that Title II of the ADA created a private cause of action for damages against the states for conduct that actually violated the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the Court did not reach the issue of whether the Eleventh Amendment permits a prisoner to secure money damages from a state for state actions that violate the ADA but not the Constitution. In addition, the Supreme Court decided Arbaugh v. Y. & H Corp. , a case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which has implications for the ADA's prohibition of discrimination where employers employ 15 or more employees. ", "On December 7, 2007, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Huber v. Wal-Mart Stores, to determine whether an individual with a disability who cannot perform her current job must be reassigned to a vacant, equivalent position without competing with other workers. However, the Court dismissed the petition since the case was settled prior to oral argument. Currently, there is a split in the circuits on this accommodation issue, and in light of the Court's dismissal of the case, there will continue to be divergent views.", "Before examining the provisions of the ADA and these cases, it is important to briefly note the ADA's historical antecedents. A federal statutory provision which existed prior to the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, prohibits discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, solely on the basis of the disability, in any program or activity that receives federal financial assistance, the executive agencies or the U.S. Postal Service. Many of the concepts used in the ADA originated in Section 504 and its interpretations; however, there is one major difference. While Section 504's prohibition against discrimination is tied to the receipt of federal financial assistance, the ADA also covers entities not receiving such funds. In addition, the federal executive agencies and the U.S. Postal Service are covered under Section 504, not the ADA. The ADA contains a specific provision stating that except as otherwise provided in the act, nothing in the act shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under Title V of the Rehabilitation Act (which includes Section 504) or the regulations issued by federal agencies pursuant to such Title.", "The ADA is a civil rights statute; it does not provide grant funds to help entities comply with its requirements. It does include a section on technical assistance which authorizes grants and awards for the purpose of technical assistance such as the dissemination of information about rights under the ADA and techniques for effective compliance. However, there are tax code provisions which may assist certain businesses or individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of Disability", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statutory Language", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Definition Language", "paragraphs": ["The definitions in the ADA, particularly the definition of \"disability,\" are the starting point for an analysis of rights provided by the law.

Due to these interpretations, Congress enacted the ADA Amendments Act, which kept essentially the same statutory language but contains new rules of construction regarding the definition of disability. These rules of construction provide that", "the definition of disability shall be construed in favor of broad coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the act; the term \"substantially limits\" shall be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes of the ADA Amendments Act; an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities to be considered a disability; an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would have substantially limited a major life activity when active; the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, except that the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered.", "The final EEOC regulations track the statutory definition but also provide some clarifying interpretations. For example, the operation of major bodily functions is included in the definition of major life activities. In addition, although the EEOC emphasizes the ADAAA's requirement for an individualized assessment, the regulations list some impairments that will almost always be determined to be a disability. These include deafness, blindness, an intellectual disability, missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair, autism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statement of Findings and Purposes Regarding the Definition", "paragraphs": ["The findings of the ADA Amendments Act include statements indicating that the Supreme Court decisions in Sutton v.

The codified findings in the original ADA are amended to delete the finding that \"43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities....\" This finding was used in Sutton to support limiting the reach of the definition of disability. P.L. 110-325 specifically states that the current EEOC regulations defining the term \"substantially limits\" as \"significantly restricted\" are \"inconsistent with congressional intent, by expressing too high a standard.\" The EEOC has promulgated regulations under the ADA Amendments Act which change the definition of \"substantially limits.\" ", "The ADA Amendments Act states that the purposes of the legislation are to carry out the ADA's objectives of the elimination of discrimination and the provision of \"'clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination' by reinstating a broad scope of protection available under the ADA.\" P.L. 110-325 rejected the Supreme Court's holdings that mitigating measures are to be used in making a determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity as well as holdings defining the \"substantially limits\" requirements.

The House Judiciary Committee report indicates that \"this clarification was needed to ensure that the impact of an impairment on the operation of major bodily functions is not overlooked or wrongly dismissed as falling outside the definition of 'major life activities' under the ADA.\" There had been judicial decisions which found that certain bodily functions had not been covered by the definition of disability.

A transitory impairment is one with an actual or expected duration of six months or less. The ADA Amendments Act also provides in a rule of construction in Title V of the ADA that a covered entity under Title I, a public entity under Title II, or a person who operates a place of public accommodation under Title III, need not provide a reasonable accommodation or a reasonable modification to policies, practices, or procedures to an individual who meets the definition of disability solely under the \"regarded as\" prong of the definition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Authority to Promulgate Regulations Regarding the Definition of Disability", "paragraphs": ["The Supreme Court in Sutton questioned the authority of regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations for the definition of disability in the ADA.

The Supreme Court declined to address this issue since, as both parties to Sutton accepted the regulation as valid, \"we have no occasion to consider what deference they are due, if any.\" The ADA Amendments Act specifically grants regulatory authority and states that \"[t]he authority to issue regulations granted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Transportation under this Act, includes the authority to issue regulations implementing the definitions contained in sections 3 and 4.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title V Provisions on the Definition of Disability", "paragraphs": ["The definition of \"disability\" was further elaborated in Title V of the ADA.

An individual who has been rehabilitated would be covered.

Ms. Abbott had indicated in her registration form that she was HIV positive but at that time she was asymptomatic. Dr. Bragdon told her that he would not fill her cavity in his office but would treat her only in a hospital setting.

Noting the immediacy with which the HIV virus begins to damage an individual's white blood cells, the Court found that asymptomatic HIV infection was a physical impairment. Second, the Court examined whether this physical impairment affected a major life activity and concluded that the HIV infection placed a substantial limitation on her ability to reproduce and to bear children and that reproduction was a major life activity. Finally, the Court examined whether the physical impairment was a substantial limitation on the major life activity of reproduction. After evaluating the medical evidence, the Court concluded that Ms. Abbott's ability to reproduce was substantially limited in two ways: (1) an attempt to conceive would impose a significant risk on Ms. Abbott's partner, and (2) an HIV infected woman risks infecting her child during gestation and childbirth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sutton v.

The Sutton Court stated: '\"a disability' exists only where an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity, not where it 'might,' 'could,' or 'would' be substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken.\" The Court also emphasized that the statement of findings in the ADA that some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disability \"requires the conclusion that Congress did not intend to bring under the statute's protection all those whose uncorrected conditions amount to disabilities.\"", "Similarly, in Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc ., the Court held that the fact that an individual with high blood pressure was unable to meet the Department of Transportation (DOT) safety standards was not sufficient to create an issue of fact regarding whether an individual is regarded as unable to utilize a class of jobs. The Court in Murphy found that an employee is regarded as having a disability if the covered entity mistakenly believes that the employee's actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.

Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment states: \"The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\"", "The circumstances where Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment can be used to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment were discussed in the Supreme Court decisions in College Savings Bank v.

The term employer is defined as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees. Therefore, the employment section of the ADA, unlike the section on public accommodations, which will be discussed subsequently, is limited in scope to employers with 15 or more employees. This parallels the coverage provided in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As noted previously, the Supreme Court, in Arbaugh v. Y. & H. Corp. , held that the 15-employee limitation in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was not jurisdictional, but rather was related to the substantive adequacy of a claim. Thus, if the defense that the employer employs fewer than 15 employees is not raised in a timely manner, a court is not obligated to dismiss the case.

The statutory language paraphrased above provides some guidance for employers but the details of the requirements have been the subject of numerous judicial decisions. In addition, the EEOC issued detailed enforcement guidance on these concepts on March 1, 1999, which was amended on October 17, 2002, to reflect the Supreme Court's decision in U.S. Airways v. Barnett. Although much of the guidance reiterates long-standing EEOC interpretations in a question and answer format, the EEOC also took issue with some judicial interpretations. Notably the EEOC stated that", "an employee who is granted leave as a reasonable accommodation is entitled to return to his or her same position, unless this imposes an undue hardship; and an employer is limited in the ability to question the employee's documentation of a disability (\"An employer cannot ask for documentation when: (1) both the disability and the need for reasonable accommodation are obvious, or (2) the individual has already provided the employer with sufficient information to substantiate that s/he has an ADA disability and needs the reasonable accommodation requested.\").", "Issues regarding the amount of money that must be spent on reasonable accommodations have also arisen. The EEOC regulations and guidance provide that an employer does not have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an \"undue hardship\" to the employer. However, the Seventh Circuit in Vande Zande v. State of Wisconsin Department of Administration found that the cost of the accommodation cannot be disproportionate to the benefit. \"Even if an employer is so large or wealthy\u2014or, like the principal defendant in this case, is a state, which can raise taxes in order to finance any accommodations that it must make to disabled employees\u2014that it may not be able to plead 'undue hardship', it would not be required to expend enormous sums in order to bring about a trivial improvement in the life of a disabled employee.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates P.C. v.

The EEOC has issued guidelines which list six factors to be considered in determining whether the individual acts independently and participates in managing the organization or whether the individual is subject to the organization's control and therefore an employee. These six factors are:", "Whether the organization can hire or fire the individual or set the rules and regulations of the individual's work; Whether and, if so, to what extent the organization supervises the individual's work; Whether the individual reports to someone higher in the organization; Whether and, if so, to what extent the individual is able to influence the organization; Whether the parties intended that the individual be an employee, as expressed in written agreements or contracts; and Whether the individual shares in the profits, losses, and liabilities of the organization.", "Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, found that some of the district court's findings of fact, when considered in light of the EEOC's standard, appeared to favor the conclusion that the four physicians were not employees of the clinic.

The Ninth Circuit in Echazabal had determined that an employer violated the ADA by refusing to hire an applicant with a serious liver condition whose illness would be aggravated through exposure to the chemicals in the workplace. The Supreme Court rejected the Ninth Circuit decision and upheld a regulation by the EEOC that allows an employer to assert a direct threat defense to an allegation of employment discrimination where the threat is posed only to the health or safety of the individual making the allegation.

The Court found no language in the ADA which would change this presumption if the seniority system was imposed by management and not by collective bargaining. However, Justice Breyer found that there were some exceptions to this rule for \"special circumstances\" and gave as examples situations where (1) the employer \"fairly frequently\" changes the seniority system unilaterally, and thereby diminishes employee expectations to the point where one more departure would \"not likely make a difference\" or (2) the seniority system contains so many exceptions that one more exception is unlikely to matter.", "Although the majority in Barnett garnered five votes, the Court's views were splintered. There were strong dissents and two concurring opinions.

This was seen as sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Wal-mart intentionally discriminated. Wal-mart had also made an agency argument, stating that liability for punitive damages was improper because the employees who discriminated against the employee did not occupy positions of managerial control.

The Attorney General may bring pattern or practice suits with a maximum civil penalty of $50,000 for the first violation and $100,000 for a violation in a subsequent case. The monetary damages sought by the Attorney General do not include punitive damages. Courts may also consider an entity's \"good faith\" efforts in considering the amount of the civil penalty. Factors to be considered in determining good faith include whether an entity could have reasonably anticipated the need for an appropriate type of auxiliary aid to accommodate the unique needs of a particular individual with a disability.

In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 contained some additions to Title V.", "Section 501 concerns the relationship of the ADA to other statutes and bodies of law. Subpart (a) states that \"except as otherwise provided in this act, nothing in the act shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under Title V of the Rehabilitation Act ... or the regulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant to such Title.\" Subpart (b) provides that nothing in the act shall be construed to invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures of any federal, state, or local law that provides greater or equal protection. Nothing in the act is to be construed to preclude the prohibition of or restrictions on smoking. Subpart (d) provides that the act does not require an individual with a disability to accept an accommodation which that individual chooses not to accept.", "Subpart (c) of Section 501 limits the application of the act with respect to the coverage of insurance; however, the subsection may not be used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of Titles I and III. The exact parameters of insurance coverage under the ADA are somewhat uncertain. As the EEOC has stated: \"the interplay between the nondiscrimination principles of the ADA and employer provided health insurance, which is predicated on the ability to make health-related distinctions, is both unique and complex.\" The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in Henderson v. Bodine Aluminum, Inc. issued a preliminary injunction compelling the plaintiff's employer to pay for chemotherapy that required an autologous bone marrow transplant. The plaintiff was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer and her oncologist recommended entry into a clinical trial that randomly assigns half of its participants to high dose chemotherapy that necessitates an autologous bone marrow transplant. Because of the possibility that the plaintiff might have the more expensive bone marrow treatment, the employer's health plan refused to precertify the placement noting that the policy covered high dose chemotherapy only for certain types of cancer, not breast cancer. The court concluded that, \"if the evidence shows that a given treatment is non-experimental\u2014that is, if it is widespread, safe, and a significant improvement on traditional therapies\u2014and the plan provides the treatment for other conditions directly comparable to the one at issue, the denial of treatment violates the ADA.\"", "The ADA Amendments Act made several additions to Section 501. The act states that the ADA does not alter eligibility standards for benefits under state workers' compensation laws or under state or federal disability benefit programs. P.L. 110-325 also states that nothing in the act alters the provision of Section 302(b)(2)(A)(ii), specifying that reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures shall be required, unless an entity can demonstrate that making such modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, including academic requirements in postsecondary education, would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations involved. The Senate Statement of Managers notes that this provision was added at the request of the higher education community and \"is included solely to provide assurances that the bill does not alter current law with regard to the obligations of academic institutions under the ADA, which we believe is already demonstrated in case law on this topic.\" The Managers' Statement also noted that this provision \"is unrelated to the purpose of this legislation and should be given no meaning in interpreting the definition of disability.\"", "The ADA Amendments Act specifically prohibits reverse discrimination claims and states that nothing in the act shall provide the basis for a claim by a person without a disability that he or she was subject to discrimination because of a lack of a disability. The rules of construction provide that a covered entity under Title I, a public entity under Title II, or a person who operates a place of public accommodation under Title III, need not provide a reasonable accommodation or a reasonable modification to policies, practices, or procedures to an individual who meets the definition of disability solely under the \"regarded as\" prong of the definition.", "Section 502 abrogates the Eleventh Amendment state immunity from suit and was discussed previously. Section 503 prohibits retaliation and coercion against an individual who has opposed an act or practice made unlawful by the ADA and was amended by the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, P.L. 111-2 , to allow for increased compensation in cases of discrimination. Section 504 requires the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) to issue guidelines regarding accessibility. Section 505 provides for attorneys' fees in \"any action or administrative proceeding\" under the act.

This section was the subject of a Supreme Court decision in Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., v. West Virginia Department of Human Resources. In Buckhannon, the Supreme Court addressed the \"catalyst theory\" of attorneys' fees which posits that a plaintiff is a prevailing party if the lawsuit brings about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. The Court rejected this theory finding that attorneys' fees are only available where there is a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.", "Statutes providing for the award of attorneys' fees allow courts to make the awards to the \"prevailing party.\" The question presented in Buckhannon was whether the term \"prevailing party\" includes a party who did not secure a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree, but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit has brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. The Court, in an opinion by then Chief Justice Rehnquist, examined the ADA and the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) and held that the term \"prevailing party\" cannot be interpreted in this manner, thus rejecting the concept of a \"catalyst theory.\" Four other members of the Court, Justices O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas joined with the Chief Justice while Justices Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter and Breyer dissented.", "The Court first noted that in the United States parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorneys' fees but that Congress has authorized the award of attorneys' fees in numerous statutes in addition to the ones at issue in Buckhannon. These fee-shifting provisions have been interpreted in the same manner and the Court noted, citing to Hensley v. Eckerhart, that it approached the attorneys' fees provisions of the ADA and the FHAA in this manner.", "Examining prior Supreme Court cases, Chief Justice Rehnquist found that a party receiving a judgment on the merits would clearly have a basis on which attorneys' fees might be awarded. Similarly, the court found that settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree may serve as the basis for an award of attorneys' fees. The catalyst theory was seen as dissimilar from these examples since \"it allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\" A voluntary change, even if it accomplished what the plaintiff sought, the Court found, \"lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislation Relating to the ADA in the 112th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Changes in the ADA's statutory language to address the issue of vexatious law suits have been proposed since the 106 th Congress.
