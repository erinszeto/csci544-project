The Department has argued that these childcare benefits help support their recruiting, retention, and readiness goals and that there is generally a high level of satisfaction among servicemembers who use DOD childcare services. Moreover, military family advocacy groups have largely supported existing childcare benefits and have also called for expanding awareness of, access to, operating hours for, and improving or enhancing other aspects of military childcare services.", "While there has been broad support for DOD's CDP since its inception, the questions of what benefits should be provided to military servicemembers and their families, how these benefits should be structured, and what resources should be directed to these benefits are issues for Congress when considering the annual defense budget authorization and appropriation."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Introduction", "paragraphs": ["For most of the history of the U.S. military, young, single males were favored for recruitment and induction to the military by various laws and policy.

As DOD continually expanded its recruiting efforts, the proportion of women in the active component of the military grew from about 2.5% in 1973 to 16% in 2018. In addition there are almost twice as many dual-military married couples and single parents serving on active duty than in 1985 (see Figure 1 ).Thus, family-oriented benefits and programs have become an increasingly important component of DOD's total servicemember compensation package.

For example, in 1987, the Army reported survey data showing that 20% of enlisted and 22% of officers had lost job and duty time due to lack of adequate childcare.", "Some within DOD and military family advocacy groups have tied childcare benefits to improved recruitment, morale, and retention of military personnel. A 2017 survey of active duty servicemembers found that 16% of members listed childcare as one of the top five stressors related to military life and 33% listed other worries about the impact of military life (e.g., time away) on their children. With an all-volunteer force (AVF), DOD must compete for talent with civilian employers who have begun to offer more family-friendly policies and benefits over the past few decades. This means that the compensation and benefits packages offered to servicemembers may need to be as good as or better than available civilian compensation packages to recruit and retain talent.", "Research on the links between employer-sponsored childcare and employee performance, morale, job satisfaction, and recruitment and retention have had mixed results. In general, some studies suggest positive links between these benefits, employee satisfaction, and organizational commitment. In particular, childcare benefits are seen as more important to those employees lacking support from immediate or extended family. In addition, a 2011 study of family-friendly benefits at federal agencies found positive relationships between childcare subsidy programs, agency performance, and reduced employee turnover. Nevertheless, other research has found little empirical evidence that employee-sponsored childcare in the private or public sector has significant positive effects on individual performance, productivity, or job satisfaction. Research on military families has shown that the readiness impact of childcare concerns varies by family type, with single parents and dual military couples reporting more missed duty time after the birth of a new child or when moving to a new installation. There is also some evidence that childcare challenges may impact retention decisions. Military families have reported that it is \"likely or very likely\" that child care issues would lead them to leave the military and those with pre-school age children have reported that they are more likely to leave the military than their counterparts with school-age children.", "On the other hand, some human resource professionals have also warned that family- friendly benefits may lead to perceived inequities and could have negative effects on the morale of childless workers or parents who are unable to use the benefit (e.g., those who are wait-listed for childcare spots and/or lower on the priority list). Nevertheless, while researchers have found some evidence of negative employee attitudes towards specific family-friendly benefits, they have not found a relationship with overall attitudes and behaviors towards the organization.

Wait list data is one way to measure this demand, which is affected by demographic, geographic, and structural factors. The wait lists for CDCs are managed locally by priority and are based on the date that the request for care was filed, priority criteria, and other mission-related factors at the installation commander's discretion (see Table 2 ).

The installation commander typically has the discretion to direct additional MWR-generated revenues towards childcare services or other installation activities and services. Using these funds could help augment the quality of childcare services or provide additional resources to the centers' resources. However, over-reliance on MWR subsidies to support childcare operations could be problematic, since those revenue streams are less reliable and are more subject to economic downturns. Also, use of too much MWR revenue for family-related benefits may raise concern about inequity for servicemembers who do not require childcare services and might prefer subsidies for other MWR activities (e.g., clubs, golf courses). Finally, due to the decentralized nature MWR funds distribution, there is less accountability for how funds are spent and whether spending is effective in achieving program goals.", "Military childcare programs generate approximately $400 million in non-appropriated funds annually through parent-usage fees. Statute requires the Secretary of Defense to establish CDC fees and these are adjusted annually to reflect cost of living increases. Statute also authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use appropriated funds to subsidize family home day care providers at rates comparable to those at the CDCs. DOD's guidance specifies that \"childcare is not an entitlement\" and that each family is required to pay their share of the cost of childcare. The amount that each family pays is on a sliding scale based on total family income . In the lowest income category, at 2017-2018 rates (including market adjustments), a family might pay as little as $222 per month per child and in the highest category would pay a maximum of $944 per month per child (See Table 4 ).

To put the military childcare fees in context, the average basic pay and allowances for an E-5 is $57,661 annually, using the 2017 enlisted pay scale. This pay rate would place the E-5 (with no spousal or other source of income) in income category IV. Therefore, an E-5 would be paying approximately 9.7% of his or her income for childcare fees for one child under the standard fee structure. A mid-level officer, O-4, would have average pay and allowances of $118,080 annually and would be eligible for income category VIII. This servicemember (with no spousal or other source of income) would be paying approximately 6% of his or her income in childcare fees for one child.

The U.S. Census Bureau has reported that out-of-pocket childcare costs have risen over the past three decades, nearly doubling between 1985 and 2011. The cost of civilian childcare varies widely depending on the age of the child, quality of care, and the geographic location. A 2017 study of childcare costs across the nation found that the average annual care cost for center-based childcare for one infant in a high-cost state like California is $23,077, and $12,393 for a lower-cost state like South Carolina.

DOD uses accreditation and certification rates as its primary metric for monitoring childcare program quality (see Table 6 ).

The accreditation can serve two key purposes. First, the process of becoming accredited and accreditation renewal requires an organization to self-assess and can be a mechanism for improved operations and staff development. Second, accreditation can serve as a signaling mechanism to parents who typically do not have the information to individually assess the level of childcare center quality. Critics of accreditation have argued that the requirements impose unnecessary time and resource burdens on childcare staff.

In 1941, in response to the need for women to work outside the home while the men were away at war, the government passed the Lanham Act of 1940. The act provided grant funding to communities based on demonstrated need, for care for children ages 0-12. Funds were used for the construction of childcare facilities, teacher training and pay, and meal services. Over 550,000 children nation-wide are estimated to have received care from Lanham Act programs. By 1946, the funds were withdrawn with the expectation that most women would return to childcare duties within the home following the end of the war. ", "In the U.S. military, demand for childcare was low throughout much of the early 20 th century. This was due to the demographic composition of the force and prevailing social norms. In the 1950s approximately 70% of servicemembers in the Army were single males. Today over 50% of the total active duty force is married and females account for approximately 16% of the force. In the 1950s and 1960s, non-working spouses mainly provided care for children of military servicemembers at home. During this era, if childcare was needed outside the home, relatives, private groups, parents' cooperatives, or wives' clubs provided it. Some of these wives' clubs also sponsored part-day preschools that provided education and development programs for toddlers aged 3-5 years old. This childcare system was loosely structured and had few regulations. ", "Between 1970 and 1980 a number of developments increased demand for military childcare services. With the advent of the all-volunteer force in 1973, new recruits increasingly included women and career-oriented personnel with dependents. Between 1973 and 1978 the proportion of women in the military climbed from 2.5% to over 6% and the number of dual military marriages increased. In 1975, DOD directed the services to discontinue involuntary discharges for pregnant or custodial mothers, in favor of a voluntary separation policy. Meanwhile, between 1970 and 1980 the proportion of women participating in the U.S. labor force jumped from 40% to 50% , and civilian employer-sponsored childcare initiatives began to gain popularity. An increase in civilian spouses of military members working outside the home meant both an increased demand for childcare services and fewer participants in the informal caregiver support networks that had been providing these services. ", "Around the same time the quality of childcare services on DOD installations came under scrutiny. In 1976, a nation-wide survey of military centers operating as non-appropriated fund programs, found that there was a wide variance in the services and standards of military facilities relative to civilian facilities. The study also noted a lack of specialized training for teachers and aides. It wasn't until 1978 that DOD issued a directive formalizing government responsibility for installation childcare centers as part of the military's morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) program. This directive held the individual services responsible for developing their own policies and standards and allowed installations to establish their own operating procedures.

Those who oppose government support of childcare programs typically express social, fiscal, or equity concerns. Some contend that childcare should be a parental responsibility rather than a social good to be provided by the government. Some believe that it is best for a mother to stay home with her children and that when the government provides economic incentives for work outside the home it expresses a societal preference for out-of-home care. Some carry this argument further and contend that subsidized childcare endorses and incentivizes single-parenthood or unstable family arrangements, which they contend may have negative economic and social consequences. Research from a Canadian effort to introduce universal subsidized childcare in one province found some evidence suggesting that in the short run, children and families experienced some undesirable outcomes, including negative behaviors among children (e.g., hyperactivity, aggressiveness) and reduction in parental relationship quality. ", "On the other hand, those who advocate for publicly-funded childcare programs often argue that childcare provides societal benefits and should be a community resource in the same manner as schools, libraries, and parks. In 2017, the birthrate in the U.S. was the lowest in 30 years. Falling birthrates can have some societal consequences, such as diminished economic growth and increased strain on entitlement programs such as Social Security. Some studies have shown that accessible and affordable childcare helps to improve fertility rates as well as labor-force outcomes for women, who are often the default caregivers, allowing them to pursue a career and earnings outside of the home. ", "For children, center-based childcare is associated with both positive and negative social and behavioral outcomes relative to those who receive home-based or parental care. Effects are generally small, and depend on factors such as the length of time per day spent in care and the child's temperament and home environment. On the other hand, h igh-quality center-based care is generally correlated with slighter better cognitive, social, academic, and language skills. Benefits are more pronounced for children from low-income households, and gains are sustained through adulthood. ", "Pointing to these potential positive outcomes for children and parents, some contend that it is in the government's best interest to regulate and/or subsidize childcare services to ensure broad access to high-quality care as a societal good. In the military, this means that junior enlisted members, who generally have lower earnings, may have access to higher quality care than they would be able to otherwise afford. This could have first order effects of better financial security for junior enlisted and single-parent military families through greater opportunities for spousal employment and lower childcare fees. Some advocacy groups and researchers have gone further and argue that the federal government has a national security interest in the provision of high-quality childcare for members, since it can improve the quality of the eventual recruiting pool for the military. Some studies have found that youth with a military family member are more likely to serve, and approximately one-third of new military recruits have a parent who served. This suggests that early investments in children of military families may provide indirect long-term benefits to the military services.", "Other arguments against government sponsorship of childcare suggest that use of taxpayer dollars to subsidize single-parent families or those with two working parents is inherently inequitable or discriminatory against those without children or families with one parent who stays at home to care for children. Others suggest that the federal government should play a smaller role in the provision of social welfare programs such as subsidized childcare, and that these programs are better funded by state and local governments, or through private/nonprofit groups where there may be more accountability for the allocation of funds. In terms of DOD-funded childcare programs, military leaders and other experts have raised concerns about rising personnel costs and the resulting pressure on defense budgets, particularly during times of fiscal austerity or growth in the size of the force. Some argue that with limited resources, the Department should put a priority on war-fighting capabilities rather than expanding personnel benefits. ", "Those who advocate specifically for DOD-sponsored childcare services point to expansion of family-friendly benefits among private sector employers and suggest that these benefits help to make DOD a more attractive employer. DOD's ability to offer competitive benefits becomes increasingly important in order to attract and retain talent during periods of force growth and times when the economy is strong and there is low civilian unemployment.

Proponents of FCCs note that they are lower cost to the services. A 2002 RAND study found that the average annual cost per infant (age 6 weeks -12 months) in a CDC was more than twice as much as the average annual cost per infant in an FCC. In general, while DOD subsidizes FCC fees, they have lower overhead costs. Care is provided in private residences, and operational costs are typically the responsibility of the FCC provider. One FCC home coordinator may be assigned to multiple homes or work on a part-time basis, whereas CDC administrative staff members are likely to be full-time employees. ", "Another purported benefit of the FCCs is that they provide an opportunity for military spouses to own and operate a business while caring for their own children. In 2015, the Navy reported that 94% of FCC providers were military spouses. This may let FCCs provide employment opportunities to military spouses while also freeing space at a CDC for other children (e.g., children of dual-military couples or single parents). In-home centers may have more flexibility for drop-in/respite services, care for sick children, and care outside \"normal\" working hours. An Air Force survey of FCC providers found that just over half were willing to offer extended duty and weekend care, while 24% were willing to offer overnight care. In addition, FCC care is available for infants from four weeks old while CDC care eligibility starts at six weeks. The number of children in FCCs is capped at six children at any one time. Some parents may prefer a smaller, in-home setting to the day care environment. Other parents may prefer FCCs because they can allow parents to exercise more discretion over the care setting and the caregivers that are most suitable to their child's needs.", "Nevertheless, there are some limitations to in-home care. In many cases, in-home care is operated by military spouses who may be subject to frequent or short-notice permanent change of station (PCS) orders. In addition, if the FCC operator falls ill or takes leave time, there may not be available back-up caregiving options. These factors could affect continuity of care for FCC patrons. The potential for frequent moves may also deter some military spouses from establishing an FCC if the time and resources needed to start up and certify home-based care in a new location are overly burdensome. The services have estimated that the amount of time it takes to certify a new FCC (including background checks, home inspections, and training and orientation) is anywhere from two to nine months.

DOD has noted that there is \"a continued need for repairing and replacing aging facilities in addition to building new facilities.\" At the same time, 2016 data show that 70% of married servicemembers live off the military installation.

First, within DOD's certification requirements for the fee assistance programs, parents may have a broader range of choice over the model of care and developmental curriculum (e.g., Montessori, parochial, home-based, etc.). Second, by participating in community-based childcare, military families may have more opportunities to build social networks and connections with non-military families in their neighborhoods. A recent survey of military families found that approximately half of the families \"feel like they don't belong in their local civilian community,\" and would like more opportunities to build local networks. In addition, survey respondents indicated school and childcare as one of the top opportunities to increase local connections. Some evidence suggests that fee assistance programs may also be a better fit for families that do not live on military installations. ", "A 2006 study found that, \"Across the board, families living off base are more likely to choose formal civilian child-care options over the DoD CDC, and propensity to use civilian child care increases as the distance from an installation grows.\" Fee assistance programs may be particularly beneficial for reservists, who often live farther from military installations and do not have access to CDCs or FCCs.

DOD's high standards and criteria for private provider eligibility could serve to improve the quality of childcare services within the community for both military and civilian families.

Some in the Congress have expressed concern about the privatization of quality of life services such as childcare and its potential impact on quality of care. In addition, GAO found that some families using fee assistance off-installation care still had higher costs than those offered by on-installation care.

Supporters of such a system argue that cash benefits are generally more efficient than in-kind benefits, since members can more easily assess the value of the benefit. Past focus groups with military families have revealed that among parents who used the CDC's, many were unaware that they were receiving a subsidy from DOD and some even believed DOD was profiting from the CDCs.", "Nevertheless, an unrelated survey of military personnel found that a substantial majority \"would rather maintain access to existing quality of life benefits than exchange those benefits for cash vouchers.\" In addition, depending on how the benefit system was designed, oversight, accountability, and management may be more challenging.

Would cash benefits be provided on a per-child basis? Would it vary by the child's age? Would families with non-working spouses be eligible to receive a stipend?
