India, the region's dominant actor with more than 1 billion citizens, is often characterized as a nascent great power and \"indispensable partner\" of the United States, one that many analysts view as a potential counterweight to China's growing clout. Since 2004, Washington and New Delhi have been pursuing a \"strategic partnership\" based on shared values and apparently convergent geopolitical interests. Numerous economic, security, and global initiatives, including plans for civilian nuclear cooperation, are underway. This latter initiative\u2014first launched in 2005 and codified in U.S. law in 2008\u2014reversed three decades of U.S. nonproliferation policy, but has not been implemented to date. Also in 2005, the United States and India signed a ten-year defense framework agreement to expanding bilateral security cooperation. The two countries now engage in numerous and unprecedented combined military exercises, and major U.S. arms sales to India are underway. The value of all bilateral trade tripled from 2004 to 2008 and continues to grow; significant two-way investment also flourishes. The influence of a large, relatively wealthy, and geographically dispersed Indian-American community is reflected in Congress's largest country-specific caucus. More than 100,000 Indian students are attending American universities.", "Further U.S. attention on South Asia focuses on ongoing, historically rooted tensions between India and Pakistan. In the interests of regional stability, in particular as a means of facilitating U.S.-led efforts to stabilize nearby Afghanistan, the United States strongly endorses an existing, but largely moribund India-Pakistan peace initiative, and remains concerned about the potential for conflict over Kashmiri sovereignty to cause open hostilities between these two nuclear-armed countries. The United States also seeks to curtail the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles in South Asia.", "President Barack Obama's Administration has sought to build upon the deepened U.S. engagement with India begun by President Bill Clinton in 2000 and expanded upon during much of the past decade under President G.W. Bush. This \"U.S.-India 3.0\" diplomacy was most recently on display in July 2011, when the second U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue session saw a large delegation of senior U.S. officials visit New Delhi to discuss a broad range of global and bilateral issues. Many analysts view the U.S.-India relationship as being among the world's most important in coming decades and see potentially large benefits to be accrued through engagement on many convergent interests. Bilateral initiatives are underway in all areas, although independent analysts in both countries worry that the partnership has lost momentum in recent years. Outstanding areas of bilateral friction include obstacles to bilateral trade and investment, including in the high-technology sector; outsourcing; the status of conflict in Afghanistan; climate change; and stalled efforts to initiate civil nuclear cooperation.", "India is the world's most populous democracy and remains firmly committed to representative government and rule of law. Its left-leaning Congress Party-led ruling national coalition has been in power for more than seven years under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, an Oxford-trained economist. New Delhi's engagement with regional and other states is extensive and reflects its rising geopolitical status. The national economy has been growing rapidly\u2014India's is projected to be the world's third-largest economy in the foreseeable future\u2014yet poor infrastructure, booming energy demand, and restrictive trade and investment practices are seen to hamper full economic potential.

India dominates the geography of the now strategically vital South Asia region, and its vibrant economy, pluralist society, cultural influence, and growing military power have made the country a key focus of U.S. foreign policy attention in the 21 st century. This attention is to some degree motivated by China's longer-standing and more rapid rise, with many analysts viewing U.S. and Indian geopolitical interests as convergent on many fronts, perhaps especially in the area of Asian power balances. President George W. Bush is credited with building on the breakthrough visit by President Bill Clinton in 2000, which ended the estrangement of the post-1998 Indian nuclear weapons tests. Under President Bush and continuing with President Barack Obama the U.S. and Indian governments have been seeking to sustain a substantive \"strategic partnership,\" even as bilateral commercial and people-to-people contacts flourish of their own accord.", "The U.S.-India partnership is based on shared values such as democracy, pluralism, and rule of law. Numerous economic, security, and global initiatives, including unprecedented plans for civilian nuclear cooperation, are underway. The two countries inked a ten-year defense framework agreement in 2005 to facilitate expanded bilateral security cooperation. In the new century, large-scale combined military exercises have become commonplace, and bilateral cooperation on intelligence and counterterrorism is increasing. Unprecedented major U.S. arms sales to India are underway; more are anticipated. The influence of a geographically dispersed and relatively wealthy Indian-American community of some 2.7 million is reflected in Congress's largest country-specific caucus. More than 100,000 Indian students are attending American universities. Notably, a number of Indian-Americans now occupy senior positions in the Obama Administration, Agency for International Development Administrator Rajiv Shah among them.", "Further U.S. interest in South Asia focuses on ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan rooted largely in competing claims to the Kashmir region and in \"cross-border terrorism\" in both Kashmir and major Indian cities.

The United States also seeks to curtail the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles in South Asia.", "President Obama desires to continue expanded engagement and cooperation with India. His May 2010 National Security Strategy noted that, \"The United States and India are building a strategic partnership that is underpinned by our shared interests, our shared values as the world's two largest democracies, and close connections among our people.\" Yet there are concerns among observers in both countries that momentum has waned (by some accounts due to U.S. inattention), that outstanding areas of friction continue to hinder optimal levels of cooperation, and that India's geostrategic, economic, and security circumstances combine with New Delhi's lingering skepticism over America's global and regional role to preclude the kind of \"special relationship\" that many boosters of U.S.-India ties envisage. While U.S.-India engagement under the Obama Administration has not (to date) realized any groundbreaking initiatives as was the case under the Bush Administration, it may be that the apparently growing \"dominance of ordinariness\" in the relationship is a hidden strength that demonstrates its maturing into diplomatic normalcy.", "Indeed, there is a pervasive sense in policy circles that dramatic new breakthroughs in U.S.-India relations are not on the horizon, and that President Obama's November 2010 travel to India may have brought the two countries to a plateau of sorts whereupon routinized, but still meaningful interactions take place in the near term. Both national governments have been dealing with serious domestic issues in 2011 (the United States with federal budget issues, India with major corruption scandals), as well as with more pressing foreign policy concerns. ", "Given a setting in which the private sectors of both countries are impatient with the pace of economic reform in India and with rampant corruption there, some analysts call on the two governments to concentrate on limited goals with clear chances for success, such as in defense trade and with the development of multilateral and Asian architectures, in both the economic and security realms. One leading Indian commentator urges American patience and recognition that New Delhi views engagement with the United States as its highest foreign policy priority. The contention here is that India's four purported top long-term foreign policy objectives\u2014a stable Afghanistan-Pakistan region; exerting influence across the Indian Ocean region; obtaining status as a \"rule-maker\" in the international system; and strengthening \"global power\" factors such as sustained economic growth and military modernization\u2014all require strategic cooperation with the United States. Yet a more pessimistic view has the bilateral relationship constrained in large part by differences over the U.S.-Pakistan alliance and by India's apparent reluctance to exert power in its own region, resulting in years of \"a lot of rhetoric but very little substantive movement\" in U.S.-India ties.", "The sweeping scope of the bilateral relationship, as well as the perceived lack of focus within it, may be found in the various and usually large number of issue-areas listed in joint statements. However, in May 2011, the lead U.S. diplomat for the region helpfully summarized U.S.-India relations under the rubric of four major \"agendas\":", "an innovation agenda that includes collaboration on energy security, civil nuclear cooperation, agriculture, space, climate, and other sciences; a security agenda that includes military-to-military relations, arms sales, and nonproliferation; a people-to-people agenda that encourages civic engagement, and open governance and democracy initiatives; and a growth agenda focused on increasing bilateral trade and investment by removing barriers to both. ", "Tangible progress is being made in each of these areas despite ongoing U.S. government irritants, in particular obstacles to full implementation of civil nuclear cooperation; overly restrictive limits on foreign investment; lingering barriers to trade; and insufficient protection of intellectual property rights, among others.

In April, New Delhi announced that it had narrowed the list of competitors for a roughly $11 billion contract for 126 new medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) to two finalists, both European vendors. U.S. government officials expressed being \"deeply disappointed\" by news of the \"deselection\" of U.S.-based Boeing and Lockheed Martin from consideration, and what seemed a choice with major geostrategic implications elicited much debate over its meaning (see the \"Defense Cooperation and Trade\" section below). Major corruption scandals that broke in New Delhi in late 2010 have snowballed into a crisis not only for the sitting Congress Party-led United Progressive Alliance national coalition government, but also for India's political system writ large. Summer months have seen the emergence of a massive people's movement protesting the country's pervasive corruption, a movement lead in particular by social activist Anne Hazare (see the \"Corruption Scandals and Congress Party Woes\" section below). U.S. Ambassador to India Tim Roemer tendered his resignation on April 28, 2011, the same day that New Delhi announced the MMRCA deselection, and departed the New Delhi post on June 30. Roemer explained his departure as arising for personal, professional, and family reasons. The interim Chief of Mission, Peter Burleigh, is a highly competent veteran American diplomat with significant regional experience, but observers warn that U.S.-India relations could suffer if the Obama Administration does not move quickly to appoint a new permanent Ambassador.

Many concerns arose in New Delhi, among them that the Obama Administration was overly focused on U.S. relations with China in ways that would reduce India's influence and visibility; that it was intent on deepening relations with India's main rival, Pakistan, in ways that could be harmful to Indian security and perhaps lead to a more interventionist approach to the Kashmir problem; that a new U.S. emphasis on nonproliferation and arms control would lead to pressure on India join such multilateral initiatives as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty; and that the Administration might pursue so-called protectionist economic policies that could adversely affect bilateral commerce in goods and services.", "While some of these concerns persist, robust, positive, high-level U.S. attention to relations with India has continued. Secretary Clinton was widely seen to have concluded a successful visit to India in July 2009, inking several agreements, and also making important symbolic points by staying at Mumbai's Taj Mahal hotel (site of a major Islamist terrorist attack in 2008) and having a high-profile meeting with women's groups.", "In November 2009, President Obama hosted his inaugural state visit when Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dined at the White House. Despite the important symbolism, the resulting diplomacy was seen by many proponents of closer ties as disappointing (if not an outright failure) in its outcome, at least to the extent that no \"breakthroughs\" in the bilateral relationship were announced. Yet from other perspectives there were visible ideational gains: the relationship was shown to transcend the preferences of any single leader or government; the two leaders demonstrated that their countries' strategic goals were increasingly well aligned; and plans were made to continue taking advantage of complementarities while differences are well managed. Perhaps most significantly, the visit itself contributed to ameliorating concerns in India that the Obama Administration was insufficiently attuned to India's potential role as a U.S. partner.", "Still, in the wake of Prime Minister Singh's U.S. travel, some observers continued voicing concerns at the Obama Administration's perceived \"air of ambivalence\" toward India, with one going so far as to accuse the U.S. Administration of \"diplomatic negligence\" in its allegedly insufficient attention to New Delhi's key concerns, and for policies that could \"put India into its subcontinental box\" by relegating it to a regional role through the Asia-wide elevation of China."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "June 2010 Strategic Dialogue", "paragraphs": ["The United States and India formally reengaged the U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue initiated under President G.W.

He sought to ameliorate these concerns by assuring his audience that the United States does not view relations in Asia as a zero-sum game and that its relations with Pakistan did not come at the expense of India. Two days later, the Strategic Dialogue produced a joint statement in which the two countries pledged to \"deepen people-to-people, business-to-business, and government-to-government linkages \u2026 for the mutual benefit of both countries and for the promotion of global peace, stability, and prosperity.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "President Obama's November 2010 Visit to India", "paragraphs": ["As the U.S. President planned his November 2010 visit to India, an array of prickly bilateral issues confronted him, including differences over the proper regional roles to be played by China and Pakistan; the status of conflict in Afghanistan; international efforts to address Iran's controversial nuclear program; restrictions on high-technology exports to India, outsourcing, and sticking points on the conclusion of arrangements for both civil nuclear and defense cooperation, among others. Moreover, while Indian officials will present a long list of demands to their American interlocutors, they come under fire for paying insufficient attention to American interests and concerns, and for not recognizing the sometimes serious costs of appearing insensitive to same. ", "Upon arriving in the Indian financial hub of Mumbai on November 7, 2010, President Obama laid a white rose at a memorial to the victims of the November 2008 terrorist attack and spoke at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, a main target of that attack. While in that city, the President announced $10 billion in new trade deals, among them a $7.7 billion contract for Boeing to supply 30 737 commercial aircraft to India's SpiceJet airline. The new deals were projected to create some 50,000 U.S. jobs. Many Indian observers were irked by the President's failure to mention Pakistan in his initial remarks, fueling for some a persistent Indian belief that the United States remains too devoted to its alliance with Islamabad. When asked about this in a meeting with a group of Mumbai college students, President Obama sought to impress upon the audience a belief that no country has a bigger stake in Pakistan's success than does India, commenting, \"I think that if Pakistan is unstable, that's bad for India. If Pakistan is stable and prosperous, that's good.\"", "In New Delhi, President Obama's historic speech to a joint session of the Indian Parliament characterized the U.S.-India partnership as serving three broad purposes: (1) promoting prosperity on both countries, especially through greater trade and two-way investment, and food security and health-related initiatives; (2) enhancing shared security by working together to prevent terrorist attacks, and; (3) strengthening democratic governance and human rights. In the context of this last issue-area, President Obama chided India for often \"shying away\" from taking clear public stands in the face of gross human rights violations and the suppression of democratic movements, as was recently seen to be the case in Burma.", "While appearing a joint news conference, Prime Minister Singh called the American President \"a sincere and valued friend\" of India, and he welcomed an acceleration of the deepening of bilateral ties with an aim of working \"as equal partners\" in the relationship. For his part, President Obama reiterated his view that the U.S.-India relationship will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21 st century, and he reviewed the litany of varied bilateral initiatives both underway and planned.

There is evidence of U.S. congressional support for a permanent Indian role on the Council. Although this unprecedented expression of support was widely hailed as a positive shift in U.S. policy, some Indian observers noted that the President's statement was not nearly as explicit an endorsement as was received by Japan and that, in the absence of a timeline for Security Council reform, it could be taken as little more than a \"vague promise.\" In neighboring Pakistan, the endorsement met with expected resistance; Islamabad claimed India is undeserving of such status given New Delhi's \"conduct in relations with its neighbors and its continued flagrant violations of Security Council resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reactions to the President's Visit", "paragraphs": ["President Obama's India trip was widely considered successful as a diplomatic exercise, although reviews of the substantive outcome were somewhat mixed.

Even in the absence of major new initiatives, there was a sense among some observers that the visit had exceeded expectations, with the U.S. President's \"calm demeanor and soaring rhetoric\" winning over a previously skeptical Indian audience.", "Other commentators, however, saw President Obama turning a blind eye toward or underestimating the seriousness of India's ongoing struggles with poverty, government bureaucracy, and health and education issues while remaining overly focused on the country's high-technology innovation successes. In these accounts, the New Delhi government's failure to push forward with economic reforms has made foreign investors wary, a problem only exacerbated by recent corruption scandals. There also continued to be contentions from some quarters that India's polity is skeptical about being subsumed into a U.S. \"imperialist agenda,\" with fears that Indian commercial markets will be opened in ways that do not benefit the country's people and that India will be drawn into a military alliance with the United States."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "July 2011 Strategic Dialogue", "paragraphs": ["Another Strategic Dialogue was held in New Delhi in July 2011.

Clinton traveled with a group of nine other senior U.S. officials, including the Director of National Intelligence.

On the former, and in what could be seen as a thinly veiled expression of concern about China's rise, she sought India's close cooperation in seeing formation of a regional architecture that adopts \"international norms on security, trade, rule of law, human rights, and accountable governance.\" In this respect she welcomed New Delhi's \"Look East\" policy of closer engagement with the ASEAN countries. She also took the opportunity to issue an unusually open criticism of India's Burma policy, contending that, \"As India takes on a larger role throughout the Asia-Pacific, it does have increasing responsibilities, including the duty to speak out against violations of universal human rights.\" This last reflects a pervasive view in Washington that New Delhi is too hesitant to exercise India's growing power and influence.", "On South and Central Asia, Secretary Clinton focused on three key issues. First, a reiteration of a strong and lasting U.S. commitment to Afghanistan well beyond the planned 2014 withdrawal of American combat troops, and a reiteration of \"unambiguous redlines\" for reconciliation with Afghan insurgents (their renunciation of violence, divorce from Al Qaeda, and acceptance of the laws and constitution of Afghanistan). She acknowledged New Delhi's \"rightly expressed concerns about outside interference in the reconciliation process\" and vowed to consult closely with India on this shared concern. Second, and related, Clinton stated that lasting peace and security in the region will \"require a stable, democratic, prosperous Pakistan free from violent extremism,\" and assured listeners that the United States continues to press the Pakistani government to seek those ends. Finally, the new \"Silk Road\" initiative was raised: \"an international web and network of economic and transit connections\" that would facilitate regional commerce and prosperity. According to senior U.S. officials speaking later, this regional economic integration would be \"anchored in the Indian economy.\"", "As with President Obama's earlier travel to India, the Administration's second Strategic Dialogue session and Secretary Clinton's public appearances in New Delhi and Chennai were widely hailed as successful in moving the bilateral relationship forward.

As a rising power, India has appeared unwilling to take the kinds of policy stances expected of major global players, in particular those who sit on the U.N. Security Council, as India has been in 2011. From vague positions on Middle East uprisings to the appearance of fence-sitting on issues such as U.S.-led efforts to isolate Iran and Burma, New Delhi's leaders may be finding it increasingly difficult to avoid taking on the responsibilities many in Washington and elsewhere are looking for. One example is New Delhi's largely hands-off response to uprisings in the Arab world, with External Affairs Minister Krishna saying India would not \"jump into the fray\" unless invited and would maintain a \"very cautious\" approach to the Libyan conflict. In March 2011, India officially opposed NATO's military action in Libya and notably abstained\u2014along with Brazil, China, Russia, and Germany\u2014from voting on U.N.

Indeed, India's domestic and social indices continue to rank it as a developing country, or what one former senior Indian diplomat called a \"premature power.\" Moreover, Indian bureaucrats' prickly and sometimes distrustful attitude toward their American counterparts survives long after the Cold War's end, and is sometimes evident in New Delhi's vehement reactions to what many Americans would consider minor and essentially meaningless slights."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Major Streams of Thought in Indian Foreign Policy", "paragraphs": ["In the assessment of one former U.S. diplomat and longtime South Asia expert, there are two major schools of thought in India's current foreign policy approach: \"21 st century Nehruvian\" and \"great power advocates.\" The former is notable for its essential continuation of Jawaharlal Nehru's emphasis on developing world unity and an attendant skepticism regarding U.S. power, which, from this view, may require taking action to balance against. The latter, energized by India's rapid economic growth and higher visibility on the world stage, concentrates on New Delhi's triangular relations with Washington and Beijing with an eye toward increasing India's relative power, mainly through economic growth and innovation. Yet both schools share several important basic characteristics, including a view of India as a more-or-less natural regional hegemon; limited attention to global governance issues; a commitment to maintaining India's \"strategic autonomy\"; and a preference for hedging strategies, be they balancing against a more aggressive China by welcoming a continued major U.S. presence in the region, or by working with China and Russia to preclude an excessively dominant American presence.", "In an informal but extensive survey of Indian elite opinion about the United States, this same expert found broad areas of consensus and concluded that Washington has now supplanted Moscow as New Delhi's most important external partner. As is reflected in opinion surveys of the Indian public more broadly, views of the United States, its varied power capabilities, and its continued substantive presence as a player in Asia are widely welcomed by Indian decision makers. The United States is seen to possess a unique ability to turn innovation into wealth and military power, both coveted by aspiring global powers such as India. America's national will and soft power tend to be admired by Indians, and the leading U.S. role in international institutions may serve as a model for New Delhi. Moreover\u201440 years after the Nixon Administration was seen to \"tilt\" toward Pakistan by sending the USS Enterprise carrier task force into the Bay of Bengal\u2014American military capabilities and ability to project significant power into the Indian Ocean Region are no longer viewed as threatening to most in New Delhi, where there is a widely held view of the United States as the only viable hedge against the rise of a potentially adversarial or revisionist China.", "The above-noted schools of thought correspond closely to what two other senior observers identify as India's \"traditional nationalist\" and \"pragmatist\" strains of foreign policy visions. These analysts see policy makers tending to \"split the difference\" by mouthing traditional nationalist rhetoric while pursuing a largely pragmatic course. While nationalists are inherently opposed to any international alliance that would constrict India's autonomy and tend toward legal-moral rather than political arguments, pragmatists are accepting of a balance of power approach emphasizing a flexible pursuit of Indian national interests over ideological positioning. One result is that pragmatists are less averse to alliance-making and international treaties.

", "Meanwhile, the unresolved border dispute is seen to be a significant obstacle to expanded India-China economic and trade relations, and some analysts see Beijing's Kashmir stance becoming more adversarial, as was the case in the past, perhaps even more hostile to India than is Islamabad's. Indian sources have accused Chinese patrols of \"transgressing\" the LOAC\u2014an average of about ten such incursions per month was reported in 2008\u2014and periodic reports of incursions continue. Official Chinese news outlets at times accuse the Indian media of issuing \"war rhetoric\" and \"sowing the seeds of enmity\" with reports of Chinese \"intrusions\" across the LOAC. Earlier in 2011, Indian military officials issued statements that the alleged presence of Chinese troops in Pakistan-held Kashmir poses a serious military challenge to India. Beijing denies reports of a Chinese military presence in Kashmir.", "In August 2010, three separate episodes illuminated ongoing frictions. First, New Delhi and Beijing exchanged sharp diplomatic words after China refused to issue a visa to the Indian general responsible for Indian Kashmir. Later, India reportedly moved to counter the alleged deployment of advanced Chinese missiles to the border area with its own plans to place intermediate-range Agni II and short-range Prithvi III missiles near the frontier. Finally, two Chinese warships paid a first-ever port visit to Burma, exacerbating fears among some that Chinese naval power was being wielded too closely to Indian shores. In September 2010, Prime Minister Singh reportedly warned that China \"would like to have a foothold in South Asia.\" Only days earlier, External Affairs Minister Krishna opined that China had been showing \"more than the normal interest in the Indian Ocean affairs. So we are closely monitoring the Chinese intentions.\"", "While few Indian decision makers are desirous of direct conflict with China, there seems to be an upswing in negative views about Beijing's evolving regional and global role, with misgivings perhaps arising along a perspective that New Delhi's past policies have been too concessionary in dealing with a China that may increasingly be perceived as \"an erratic, ultra-nationalist state that seeks to constrain India.\" The pessimistic Indian perspective sees Beijing as unworthy of New Delhi's trust and so rejects the Chinese government's rhetorical commitment to cooperation and dispute resolution as bromides veiling more nefarious intent.", "While there are causes for concern in the India-China relationship, there are also some new areas of convergence between the two states, as was made evident when the two governments closely coordinated their positions in the lead up to the Copenhagen Conference on climate change. The potential for future renewed conflict between India and China warrants a close watch as the correlates of power and strategic architectures evolve in Asia. Yet, while tensions appear to mount, neither country is likely to seek open conflict as both have made economic development their key national priority.", "From this perspective, increased economic interdependence will act as an inhibitor to conflict, but the workings of this dynamic are not so clear. Some analysts also note that the nature and imbalance of the dramatically growing trade between India and China is leading to a degree of mutual antagonism over the trade relationship. Yet China arguably faces strong disincentives to behave aggressively in the IOR given that doing so would be likely to accelerate India's partnership with the United States, and that any open conflict in the region could cause potentially major harm to the Chinese economy. The argument is thus that incentives for India and China to cooperate are strong. In a sign that recent India-China animosity may have crested, Indian National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon announced in April 2011 that the two countries had agreed to restore suspended defense ties, take steps to enhance their balance of trade, and establish a new consultation mechanism to address border disputes.

Sri Lanka is divided between a largely Sinhalese-Buddhist majority in the south, which dominates the government, and a Hindu-Tamil minority in the north and east. The still-unresolved ethnic conflict has complicated the relationship between India and Sri Lanka due to the presence in south India of a large Tamil minority of more than 60 million (mainly the state of Tamil Nadu).

New Delhi continues to emphasize its view that Sri Lanka's national reconciliation must come through a negotiated political settlement of ethnic issues that is \"acceptable to all communities within the framework of a united Sri Lanka and which is consistent with democracy, pluralism, and respect for human rights.\" In meetings with Sri Lanka's President in June 2011, three top Indian officials asked that his government move quickly to reach a political settlement with the Tamils.", "A 2011 report by the Brussels-based International Crisis Group acknowledged New Delhi's \"active engagement and unprecedented financial assistance\" in Sri Lanka, but contends that India's policies have failed to date in facilitating a sustainable peace on the island. The report urges the Indian government to work more closely with the United States, European Union, and Japan in pressing Colombo to negotiate a political settlement to Sri Lanka's ethnic disputes, in part by lifting blanket emergency rule, re-establishing civil administration in Tamil-majority areas, and taking other democratizing and reconciliatory actions.

Some observers see India developing east-west connectivity with Bangladesh to facilitate links with both its own isolated northeastern states and Southeast Asia, as well as with Bangladesh. A few express concern that Bangladesh's expanding ties with China could facilitate Beijing's north-south connectivity with the Indian Ocean littoral at the expense of India.

The issue has become a sore point for Dhaka; Bangladesh's foreign minister has urged Indian border security forces to exercise \"utmost restraint\" and was assured by her Indian counterpart that steps were being taken to address the problem. Prime Minister Hasina has discussed with Prime Minister Singh her government's crackdown on Bangladesh-based Indian separatists, and reportedly made a commitment that she would not allow Bangladesh territory to be used for anti-Indian activities. Hasina's government reportedly arrested and handed over to India a key leader of the United Liberation Front of Assam early in 2010, then later in the year remanded to India 28 leaders of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA).

China has been assisting Bangladesh in developing port facilities in Chittagong, and some Indian sources believe Pakistan's main intelligence agency has used Bangladesh to infiltrate operatives and even \"terrorists\" into India. In October 2010, Bangladesh formally sought Chinese assistance to build a deep water sea port in the Bay of Bengal near the southeastern island of Sonadia. The Dhaka government hopes that such a port could become a key shipping hub for northeast India and China's Yunnan Province, as well as for Nepal, Bhutan, and Burma. Bangladesh is also reportedly in discussion with China and Burma on plans to build a highway linking Bangladesh's Chittagong with Kunming, the capital of China's Yunnan Province. Such connectivity with China would likely be an issue of concern for India. India's multi-billion-dollar transit projects could go far in bringing development to isolated regions of both countries, but some in Dhaka worry that India intends to create a \"security corridor\" across Bangladesh to supply counterinsurgency forces in its northeastern states and potentially even defense forces facing China in Arunachal Pradesh, which could elicit reprisals from Beijing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "India-Nepal131", "paragraphs": ["India-Nepal relations traditionally have been close and come under the aegis of the 1950 Indo-Nepal Peace and Friendship Treaty, which allows for unrestricted travel and residency across their 1,150-mile-long shared border.

First, Nepal is viewed as a \"buffer state\" between India and China. As such, India seeks to minimize (or at least balance against) Chinese influence there. The substantial Tibetan community in Nepal can at times complicate this dynamic. While the Kathmandu government allows Tibetans to live in Nepal, it has a policy of not allowing any \"anti-China\" activity inside Nepal. Nepali authorities prevented the election of a Tibetan community government-in-exile in October 2010, a step taken by some as a hardening of Kathmandu's stance toward Tibetan refugees. Tibetan protests in Nepal in the lead-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics had also led to a crackdown by Nepali authorities. There is growing evidence of Chinese ties with Nepali Maoists. A high profile bribery case alleges that a Maoist leader asked a Chinese official for substantial amounts of money to influence Madheshi lawmakers in support of the Maoist's bid for the prime ministership. Former Nepali Prime Minister Prachanda traveled to China at least four times. Current Prime Minister Bhattarai, also of the CPN-M, has stated that Nepal needs to be sensitive to the security concerns of both India and China. Prachanda was viewed by some as having tilted towards China. India reportedly was \"deeply uncomfortable with and suspicious of Maoist intentions\" under the previous Prachanda government. Bhattarai has reportedly offered that \"the days of playing India and China are over.\"", "The second key Indian geopolitical interest in Nepal is to maintain political stability in Kathmandu and keep Nepal from becoming a base of support for insurgents in India. India is concerned that a Maoist government in Nepal could lend support to the already significant Maoist insurgency in India. Thus far, there have been only limited connections between these groups, but it appears that India is concerned the links could grow should the Maoists assert their dominance over Nepal. Political stability in Nepal could lead to infrastructure development and the establishment of major new projects to tap the country's estimated 43,000 megawatts of hydropower potential that is seen to be technically feasible and economically viable.

The New Delhi government formally outlawed the IM in 2010; months later, the group claimed responsibility for a December bombing in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi that left a child dead and at least 20 people injured. In July 2011, three synchronized bomb blasts killed 17 people and injured some 130 more during Mumbai's evening rush hour. No credible claims of responsibility were received and, to date, Indian officials have refrained from naming any specific foreign or domestic groups as suspects, but the coordinated bombings appear to have required sophisticated explosives training (Pakistan's two top leaders had immediately condemned the attack).

Prime Minister Singh acknowledged in 2008 that the involvement of \"local elements\" in terrorist attacks added a \"new dimension\" to the country's indigenous militancy problem. SIMI may be viewed in alignment with the greater international jihadi movement, given its endorsement of the goals of Al Qaeda and its links with other international terrorist groups such as the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami. As India's Muslim minority continues to suffer from glaring social inequities, it is likely that some among its numbers will remain vulnerable to recruitment in SIMI and/or the IM.", "Indigenous Hindu Terrorism.

By year's end, police had arrested nine members of a \"Hindu terrorist cell\" in connection with the bombing, including an active army lieutenant colonel and a Hindu nun with links to the main opposition BJP. Thus did \"Hindu terrorism\" become a new and highly controversial phrase in India's national dialogue. Never before in the country's history had the phrase been so widely used, and the development had major and continuing effects on India's national psyche.

The State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor has in the past claimed that India's human right abuses \"are generated by a traditionally hierarchical social structure, deeply rooted tensions among the country's many ethnic and religious communities, violent secessionist movements and the authorities' attempts to repress them, and deficient police methods and training.\" ", "Government treatment of actual or suspected militants and terrorists can be severe and potentially unlawful. India's 1958 Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which gives security forces wide leeway to act with impunity in conflict zones, has been called a facilitator of grave human rights abuses in several Indian states. Visits by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 2002-2004 reportedly revealed evidence of widespread torture by security forces in Kashmir. Such evidence was presented to U.S. officials, according to press reports about leaked diplomatic cables. A senior Indian police official in Kashmir called the allegations \"baseless propaganda.\" A 2010 report by the Delhi-based Asian Center for Human Rights found that the incidence of torture and prison custody deaths in India is on the rise, and it chastised the current New Delhi government for failing to address these problems through legislative changes. After examining India's nonconflict areas, Human Rights Watch issued a 2011 report detailing what it calls India's \"numerous, serious human rights violations\" in the treatment of terrorism suspects detained following attacks, saying the \"abuses are both unlawful under Indian and international law and counterproductive in the fight against terrorism.\" ", "Indian authorities have brought and threatened to bring sedition charges against prominent social activists. According to watchdog groups, India's colonial-era sedition law has been used to intimidate peaceful political dissenters in cases involving activists such as Dr. Binayak Sen and Arundhati Roy. Human Rights Watch repeatedly has called for the law's repeal. Sen, who spent in a total of 28 months in what he described as horrific prison conditions, later accused the government of using the sedition laws \"to silence voices of dissent.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Religious Freedom", "paragraphs": ["An officially secular nation, India has a long tradition of religious tolerance (with periodic lapses), which is protected under its constitution.

The diffusion of enabling medical technology and the existence of unethical doctors have made sex-selective abortions more common there. Prime Minister Singh has called female feticide a \"national shame\" and said the government has a responsibility to curtail the widespread practice. The country's 2001 census found only 927 girls aged 0-6 for every 1,000 boys nationwide. Wealthier states, such as Delhi, Punjab, and Gujarat, have the lowest ratios (Punjab's was the lowest at 798). A 2006 study published in the British medical journal Lancet estimated that up to 10 million Indian females are \"missing\" due to sex-selective abortions and infanticide over the past two decades, and that some 500,000 girls are being \"lost\" annually. In subsequent years, the incidence of such practices only appears to be increasing.
