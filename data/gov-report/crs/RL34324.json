First and most significantly, a lobbying and ethics law enacted in September 2007, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA; P.L. 110-81, which was S. 1), contains some campaign finance provisions. Second, P.L. 110-433 (H.R. 6296) will extend the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) Administrative Fine Program (AFP) until 2013. Third, the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee have held hearings on automated political telephone calls (also known as \"robo calls\" or \"auto calls\"), a subject that is related to campaign finance.", "Otherwise, the House and Senate have largely focused on different campaign finance issues. Specifically, the House has passed three bills, not passed by the Senate, containing campaign finance provisions. First, H.R. 3032 would allow candidates to designate an individual to disburse remaining campaign funds if the candidate dies. Second, H.R. 2630 would restrict campaign and leadership political action committee (PAC) payments to candidate spouses. Third, a provision in the House-passed version of an appropriations bill (H.R. 3093) would have prohibited spending Justice Department funds on criminal enforcement of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) \"electioneering communication\" provision. However, the language was not included in the FY2008 consolidated appropriations law (P.L. 110-161).", "Similarly, the Senate has largely considered legislation not considered in the House. The Senate's campaign finance activity has also been confined largely to hearings. S. 223, which would require electronic filing of campaign disclosure reports was reported from the Rules and Administration Committee but has not received floor consideration. During the spring and summer of 2007, the committee also held hearings on coordinated party expenditures (S. 1091) and congressional public financing legislation (S. 1285).", "Non-legislative items are also noteworthy. Following a Senate impasse over four nominees to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) during the first session of the 110th Congress, the Commission lacked the quorum necessary to make major policy decisions between January and June 2008. Senate confirmations of five nominees on June 24, 2008, restored the FEC to full capacity. FEC rulemakings are ongoing or expected in response to legislative activity, and Supreme Court rulings addressing electioneering communications (Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.) and the \"Millionaire's Amendment\" (Davis v.

The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002\u2014also known as \"BCRA\" or \"McCain-Feingold\" for its principal Senate sponsors\u2014constituted the first major change to the nation's campaign finance laws since 1979. Among other points, BCRA banned large corporate and union donations to political parties (soft money) in federal elections and restricted certain political advertising preceding elections (electioneering communications).

In May 2008, in addition to withdrawing Lenhard's nomination, President Bush withdrew the Mason and von Spakovsky nominations. This series of events left the Walther nomination pending and Weintraub in holdover status.", "Also in April 2008, the President nominated Cynthia L. Bauerly (D), Caroline C.

The law also prohibits Member attendance at presidential convention events in their honor if registered lobbyists or \"private entit[ies]\" that hire lobbyists pay for the events. It also requires additional disclosure about lobbyists' contributions (exceeding $200) to political committees, presidential inaugural committees, and presidential libraries.", "FEC rulemaking (discussed below) is required to implement the bundling and campaign travel portions of HLOGA (sections 204 and 601 respectively). Although the travel section took effect upon the bill's enactment, the FEC in late 2007 adopted rules providing its interpretation of the law.

Before HLOGA became law, although FEC regulations on \"earmarked\" contributions technically restricted bundling, they were viewed as largely inapplicable to designated campaign fundraisers, including certain lobbyists. In response, HLOGA requires disclosure of bundling activities by registered lobbyists. Specifically, political committees (candidate committees, party committees, and PACs) must report to the FEC the name, address, and employer of each Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)-registered lobbyist \"reasonably known\" to have made at least two bundled contributions totaling more than $15,000 during specified six-month reporting periods. HLOGA only requires disclosure of bundling by registered lobbyists\u2014not other fundraisers.

Most notably, and consistent with HLOGA, the FEC's proposed rules would require political committees to report bundled contributions if the same source arranged or was credited with arranging two or more contributions totaling at least $15,000 during a six-month period. (The FEC also solicited comments about an alternative proposal for quarterly reporting.) The proposed rules would also add the term \"lobbyist/registrant PACs\"\u2014those committees \"established or controlled\" by registered lobbyists\u2014to existing examples of political committees subject to FECA regulation and bundling disclosure.", "Despite some specificity, the NPRM did not address how all reporting issues would be resolved. Rather, throughout the document, the Commission posed several questions about a range of issues, such as how widely disclosure requirements should apply and how committees should determine whether contributions were bundled. Parts of the NPRM suggested that bundling disclosure could apply beyond lobbyists per se. Specifically, the FEC asked whether Congress intended for bundling disclosure to apply only to contributions arranged by registered lobbyists (who would be known as \"lobbyist/registrants\" under proposed rules), or also to fundraising by other actors. The latter could include non-lobbyist employees at lobbying organizations or hosts of fundraisers at which bundling occurs. Several interested parties, including Members of Congress, submitted comments responding to the NPRM.", "A September 17, 2008, FEC hearing explored many of the issues raised in the NPRM. In particular, discussion and debate among Commissioners and witnesses (election lawyers and interest-group representatives) addressed how bundling activities should be reported to the FEC, which activities should be reported, and how fundraising should be reported if several individuals are involved in fundraising at a single event. The FEC has yet to announce final bundling rules. As noted previously, HLOGA requires the FEC to issue bundling rules within six months of the law's enactment (the relevant deadline would have been March 14, 2008). However, the agency was unable to act between January and June 2008 due to the loss of its quorum. On July 28, 2008, FEC Chairman Donald F. McGahn reportedly stated that bundling regulations could not realistically be promulgated in time to affect the 2008 elections.

Under the new law, Senators, candidates, and staff may continue to travel on private aircraft only if they reimburse the entity providing the aircraft for the \"pro rata share of the fair market value\" for rental or charter of a comparable aircraft. Those amounts could be well above the old first-class rate that applied to most flights before the law took effect.

Consistent with HLOGA, political committees related to House of Representatives candidates are prohibited from making reimbursements for campaign travel aboard private aircraft, which essentially bans such travel. The \"pro-rata share\" reimbursement standard for Senate, presidential, and vice-presidential travel is based on the number of candidate committees (i.e., candidate campaigns) represented on a flight. If more than one candidate is represented on a flight, reimbursement would be shared among the relevant candidate committees.", "Specifically, political committees must provide reimbursement for all campaign travelers' shares of the \"normal and usual charter fare or rental charge for travel on a comparable aircraft or comparable size.\" These requirements also apply to travel on behalf of PACs, including leadership PACs, and party committees, although candidate committees represented on the flight would be responsible for covering costs for those travelers.

Another provision in the bill would hold candidates personally liable for violations of the new restrictions (if they knew violations occurred).

Upon the candidate's death, only the designee would have authority to disburse campaign funds. Currently, campaign treasurers have authority over campaign funds, as is discussed below. The bill would not relieve treasurers from FEC reporting responsibilities. The bill could alleviate the potential for asset disputes following candidate deaths, provided that designees would be more faithful to candidates' wishes than would be treasurers. To that end, H.R. 3032 also permits candidates to provide instructions for disbursing campaign funds in the event of their death.", "H.R. 3032 would provide more candidate control over campaign assets than currently exists. FECA is largely silent on candidate responsibility for campaign operations, including spending. In fact, treasurers\u2014not candidates\u2014are legally responsible for disbursing campaign funds (and for most FEC compliance) regardless of whether the candidate is living or dead. FECA also does not specify a role for candidates in campaign financial decisions. Accordingly, although H.R. 3032 would provide a legal mechanism for circumventing the treasurer after a candidate dies, the bill would not provide additional remedies for such action while the candidate is living. This may be a minor distinction due to candidates' de facto influence over their campaigns, despite FECA's general silence on the issue. Nonetheless, if Congress chose to enact H.R. 3032 and felt it were important to create parity in candidates' abilities to direct campaign spending in life and after death, it could amend FECA to create a clearer candidate role over campaign funds regardless of whether the candidate is living or dead.

On the other hand, the FEC's explanatory statement accompanying the new rules suggests that even general references to elections or candidates (e.g., election dates or a party name) could void the safe harbor protection for corporate and union spending. If the Commission reaches such a determination in future enforcement cases, electioneering communications funded by corporate or union treasury funds would have to be strictly related to public policy issues, although they could be aired during election periods. Precise implications of the new rules are likely to become clearer over time, as advertisers test the rules during the 2008 election cycle and beyond and as the FEC considers future advisory opinions and enforcement cases.

Other significant campaign finance developments have occurred away from Capitol Hill, particularly at the FEC and in the federal courts.", "FEC activity has focused on rulemakings in response to recent congressional activity, particularly regarding HLOGA. The campaign travel rules are relatively straightforward and consistent with the new lobbying and ethics law. Those rules, however, could be clarified by an E&J statement that has yet to be considered. The bundling and electioneering communications rulemakings (the latter was undertaken in response to the Supreme Court's ruling in WRTL II ) are more complicated and, in some cases, less clear. Although the proposed bundling rules are consistent with HLOGA's content, the many questions and regulatory alternatives posed in the NPRM and at the September 2008 FEC hearing suggest that the agency is still considering how to implement that section of the law. Similarly, although the Commission has already adopted final electioneering communications rules, what those rules mean in practice will depend on how the FEC decides to pursue future enforcement and advisory cases. These issues could also be revisited now that additional Commissioners are in office.", "The long-term effect of the FEC's inability to consider major policy questions between January and June 2008 remains to be seen. It is clear, however, that the agency faces a substantial rulemaking and enforcement backlog in the short term. The fact that four of six Commissioners are new to the agency could also delay some activities.", "The HLOGA rulemaking is perhaps the most prominent one now facing the FEC. The absence of bundling rules means that certain disclosure required under HLOGA is not occurring, nor can it occur until the agency tells political committees how to report their bundled contributions. The schedule set forth in HLOGA would have facilitated partial reporting for the 2008 cycle. It now appears, however, that bundling disclosure as envisioned in HLOGA will not take effect until the 2010 cycle.", "Even if bundling-disclosure rules were in place now, however, they would not necessarily alter fundraising practices. Indeed, as was discussed at the September 17 FEC hearing, HLOGA requires more transparency about bundling, but does not restrict the practice. In addition, and as noted previously, although the HLOGA travel rules also have yet to be finalized via publication in the Federal Register , implementation of those rules is perhaps a less pressing matter because the relevant portion of the law took effect upon enactment, whereas the FEC bundling-disclosure provisions in HLOGA require Commission action to take effect.", "Overall, recent changes in campaign finance policy have been incremental, as has been the case since FECA became law in the 1970s. Congress generally did not focus on campaign finance legislation in the immediate aftermath of FECA and BCRA, perhaps because passing those laws had required substantial momentum that was difficult to replicate in the short term. That pattern could also hold following HLOGA, although most of that bill was related to lobbying and ethics rather than campaign finance. Even if Congress decides not to undertake major legislative activity on campaign finance in the near future, non-legislative activity is likely to keep campaign finance before the public and lawmakers. This is particularly true given the high-profile 2008 elections and heavy spending that has and will accompany those contests. Litigation, and the FEC's response, is also likely to continue shaping the policy environment. These events demonstrate that the evolution of campaign finance policy occurs not only in Congress, but also at the FEC, in the courts, in other federal agencies, and, perhaps most of all, in campaigns themselves. As long as those campaigns continue, Congress will be faced with questions about how to regulate political money."], "subsections": []}]}}
