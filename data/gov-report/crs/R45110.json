In 2001, the Quadrennial Defense Review recommended that 3.0% of total DOD funding be directed toward Defense S&T. In FY1996, Defense S&T was at the 3.0% level. It subsequently fell to 1.7% in FY2011 and has since risen to 2.2%. An alternative approach recommended by the DSB in 1998 was to set Defense S&T at a percentage of DOD RDT&E, similar to the industry ratio of research funding to total R&D funding (which it calculated for the pharmaceutical industry as 24%). In 2015, the Coalition for National Security Research (CNSR), a coalition of industry, universities, and associations, recommended a target of 20%. At the time of the DSB report, S&T's share of DOD RDT&E was approximately 21%.

It includes all scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs. It is farsighted high payoff research that provides the basis for technological progress. Basic research may lead to: (a) subsequent applied research and advanced technology developments in Defense-related technologies, and (b) new and improved military functional capabilities in areas such as communications, detection, tracking, surveillance, propulsion, mobility, guidance and control, navigation, energy conversion, materials and structures, and personnel support. ", "Applied research [Budget Activity Code 6.2] is systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need. It is a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, an d systems or methods. It may be oriented, ultimately, toward the design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet general mission area requirements. Applied research may translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs, short of system development. This type of effort may vary from systematic mission-directed research beyond that in Budget Activity 1 [basic research] to sophisticated breadboard hardware, study, programming and planning efforts that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges. It includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts. The dominant characteristic is that applied research is directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters. Applied research precedes system specific technology investigations or development.", "Advanced Technology Development, [Budget Activity Code 6.3] includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. Budget Activity 3 includes concept and technology demonstrations of components and subsystems or system models. The models may be form, fit, and function prototypes or scaled models that serve the same demonstration purpose. The results of this type of effort are proof of technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use. Projects in this category have a direct relevance to identified military needs. Advanced Technology Development demonstrates the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of military equipment or techniques\u2026.Projects in this category do not necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement phases, but should have the goal of moving out of Science and Technology (S&T) and into the acquisition process within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).

Budget activity 6.4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, efforts are directed toward the evaluation of integrated technologies and prototype systems in realistic operating environments, not just in controlled laboratory environments. Funding in this budget activity seeks to expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Budget activity 6.5, System Development and Demonstration, is engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. At this stage, prototype performance is near or at planned operational system levels. Budget activity 6.7, Operational Systems Development, is focused on development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. Budget activity 6.6, RDT&E Management Support, includes management support for RDT&E efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations required for general research. Accordingly, BA 6.6 funding supports RDT&E activities in each of the other budget activities.", "From FY2007 to FY2017, Defense S&T averaged 17.1%, approximately one-sixth, of total Defense RDT&E (ranging from 15% to 19% during these years). Historical funding levels and recent trends are discussed in more detail in the following section of this report.", "According to the National Academies' 2007 report Rising Above the Gathering Storm :", "Keeping a technological edge over adversaries of the United States has long been a key component of our national security strategy. US preeminence in science and technology is considered essential to achieving that goal.", "The report further emphasizes the importance of DOD basic research, asserting that", "The importance of DOD basic research is illustrated by its products\u2014in defense areas these include night vision; stealth technology; near-real-time delivery of battlefield information; navigation, communication, and weather satellites; and precision munitions.", "DOD investments in basic research are also considered vital to maintaining university research, the education of scientists and engineers, and the preservation of teaching capacity in key scientific and engineering fields. Proponents of these investments assert that it is essential to ensure steady funding to these fields to ensure stability for professors, researchers, and academic programs. Uneven funding patterns, some assert, can create uncertainty (in positions, salary, equipment, and programs, for example) that may drive out some of the best scientists and engineers and discourage the most capable students from pursuing degrees and research in these disciplines, resulting in adverse impacts on future innovation in fields key to national security. ", "Some analysts express concern that, in times of tightly constrained budgets, Defense S&T may be an easy target for budget cuts. Cuts to Defense S&T might produce few short-term consequences to national defense, as the benefits of these investments tend to be realized in the medium to long term. However, the neglect of these earlier-stage research and development activities could have serious medium- and long-term consequences, depriving the U.S. defense sector of the critical underpinnings necessary for maintaining technological superiority and global dominance in the future. ", "Former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall noted the following:", "R&D is not a variable cost. R&D drives our rate of modernization. It has nothing to do with the size of the force structure. So, when you cut R&D, you are cutting your ability to modernize on a certain time scale, period\u2014no matter how big your force structure is ... [T]he investments we're making now in technology are going to give us the forces that we're going to have in the future. The forces we have now came out of investments that were made, to some extent, in the 80s and 90s\u2026if you give up the time it takes for lead time to get\u2026a capability, you are not going to get that back.", "Alan R. Shaffer, Principal Deputy, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Defense Research and Engineering, underscored this point, stating the following:", "If we don't do the research and development for a new system then the number of systems of that type we will have is zero. It is not variable.", "Such cuts may also result in lasting damage to important segments of the U.S. R&D infrastructure\u2014researchers, professors, academic programs, student interest, equipment, infrastructure, etc.\u2014in defense-critical fields, even if funding were to be later restored. Such effects could not only diminish U.S. innovative capacity, but result in the transfer of knowledge and loss of people, capabilities, and leadership to other nations. According to a 2012 Defense Science Board report on DOD basic research", "The DOD basic research program has supported a large fraction of revolutionary research in the physical sciences. Without DOD support, these U.S.-based research communities would find it more difficult to expand knowledge, collaborate, publish, and meet. Without adequate U.S. support, these centers of knowledge will drift to other countries.", "While there is little direct opposition to Defense S&T spending in its own right, there is intense competition for available dollars in the appropriations process. This competition has been made more acute under congressionally enacted budget control provisions. Congressional acts establish and provide enforcement mechanisms for separate spending caps for defense and nondefense spending. These independent budget caps essentially fence off certain funds from being used for defense purposes by those who would prioritize such defense spending over certain nondefense activities. Increases in the defense and nondefense budget caps for FY2018 and FY2019 included in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-123 ) may ease the resource competition in these fiscal years, but not eliminate it. With the spending caps has come greater competition for available dollars within the defense portion of the budget (for example, between RDT&E and procurement), and among the various RDT&E budget activities and program elements (for example, between Defense S&T and the rest of the defense RDT&E budget activities). With members of the U.S. Armed Forces currently engaged in combat and others facing potentially imminent threats in other locations around the world, some may believe it is appropriate to prioritize defense spending to support immediate operational needs and contingency preparations of the military over activities whose payoff is likely to be realized only in the longer term.", "In addition, some have questioned the effectiveness of defense investments in R&D. For example, a 2012 article published by the Center for American Progress (CAP), a public policy research and advocacy organization, notes that the technological superiority of the United States did not initially provide an effective defense for U.S. troops against low-tech improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq and Afghanistan. The article also asserts that many high-priced major weapons systems\u2014such as President Reagan's missile defense program\u2014have failed to deliver on their promised capabilities due to scientific and engineering shortcomings. Further, the article notes that commercial technology development is now outstripping defense technology due to the \"strength of capitalism\"\u2014including large markets, consumer demand, and competitive challenges\u2014suggesting the potential benefits of pursuing a technology acquisition strategy based more heavily on off-the-shelf technologies or the repurposing of those technologies to meet defense needs. The article treats basic research less harshly than other Defense RDT&E activities, which CAP describes as \"the kind of boondoggle R&D spending the Pentagon engages in at the applied and developmental level.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Defense S&T Funding and Recent Trends", "paragraphs": ["Defense S&T has grown substantially in current dollars (unadjusted for changes in buying power) over the past four decades, from $2.3 billion in FY1978 to $13.4 billion in FY2017.
