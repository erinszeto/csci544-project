Mandatory spending is highly variable and driven by program participation rates, economic conditions, and weather patterns ( Figure 3 ).", "Although these programs have mandatory status, many of these accounts ultimately receive funds in the annual agriculture appropriations act. For example, the food stamp and child nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs. Supplemental appropriations generally are made if these estimates fall short of required spending. An annual appropriation also is made to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for losses in financing the commodity support programs and the various other programs it finances.", "The other 20% of the agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill is for discretionary programs.

The House bill includes no provisions changing WIC rules/operations. In addition to the WIC-only store provision noted above, the Administration called for a cap on the proportion of grants that can be spent on nutrition services and administration (leading to a state match requirement after FY2007) and an income limit on those who can get WIC services automatically because of their participation in Medicaid.", "For programs under the child nutrition, commodity assistance, and nutrition program administration accounts , the House and Senate bills adopt one proposal advanced by the Administration\u2014barring the use of Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program funds to pay sales taxes, coupled with disregarding the value of the program's benefits as financial resources for tax and public assistance purposes.

In FY2006, $15 million was available for this program ($9 million in mandatory funding and $6 million in discretionary money included in the FY2006 appropriation).

This is intended to allow expansion of the existing (FY2006) program to selected schools in all states (albeit at a per-state payment amount lower than received by states currently allowed to participate).
