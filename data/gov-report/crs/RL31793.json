Oncea vaccine is licensed, its continued production remains complex, as the 2004-2005 flu vaccineshortage in the United States illustrates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Problems", "paragraphs": ["Production Costs. Because vaccines arebiologics, even routine manufacture involves care, expertise, and expense much beyond that requiredfor pharmaceuticals. To produce a drug, the manufacturer essentially repeats a chemical formula. Vaccines require dedicated production facilities that include physical and chemical barriers to protectworkers from pathogen exposure and finely regulated temperature and ventilation to keep thebiologics viable while stored. Also, because the product is injected, the purity standard has to bemuch higher than for a pill. Although FDA inspects both drug- and vaccine-production facilities,it inspects every lot of vaccine produced and only a sample of drug production lots. (16) ", "For example, manufacturers ceased production of licensed vaccines against plague becauseof manufacturing difficulties, and against adenovirus infection because of contract cost issues. Torestart production, these or other manufacturers must submit new license applications to FDA,conform to current good manufacturing practice standards, and demonstrate the safety andeffectiveness of the new vaccines -- all before they can make the vaccine available to the public.", "Production Failures. In October 2004, when theU.S. manufacturer Chiron announced that the British drug regulatory authorities had shut itsLiverpool plant, the United States was instantly plunged into a flu vaccine shortage. Chiron wasslated to supply approximately half of the vaccine for U.S. use in the 2004-2005 flu season. TheBritish agency -- and then with FDA concurrence -- found some bacterial contamination andmanufacturing practices that could not assure the safety of the rest of the vaccine production. (17) ", "Liability. Why go to the trouble for a product thatdoes not promise the sales volume common to pharmaceuticals -- particularly when manufacturersmay be liable if vaccines cause injury? The huge claims for compensation that followed the swineflu immunization program in the mid-1970s have made the vaccine industry wary. Manufacturerexecutives recall, for example, discussions of unindemnified liability in their decisions to declineplans to produce anthrax or Lyme disease vaccines.", "Market. For some diseases, scientists know howto produce protective vaccines but manufacturers have chosen not to pursue the time-consuming andexpensive steps necessary to obtain FDA approval. For some, there is insufficient market size in theUnited States to warrant the effort. An example is the tick-borne encephalitis vaccine that DODadministered to troops in Bosnia during the 1990s. Although licensed in Europe where thedisease-carrying ticks are more widespread, the vaccine is not FDA-licensed. To get FDA approvalrequires U.S. clinical trials for safety. Neither the interested manufacturer nor DOD has been willingto bear the expense of those trials. (18) ", "Malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS kill 7 million and sicken 400 million worldwide eachyear. (19) Yet, aside fromHIV, manufacturers have little incentive to develop vaccines because U.S. incidence is low,involving mostly travelers or immigrants and their contacts, and preventive and treatmentmedications are readily available. In countries where vaccines could make a big difference, fewresources are available to support development or purchase. Interestingly, private benefactors havebeen stepping in to support public-good-focused research. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,for example, gave $150 million to the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, which announced in October 2004initial findings that a malaria vaccine it is developing with industry was somewhat effective in youngchildren. (20) ", "Planning. Finally, difficulties with planning canrender even licensed vaccines temporarily unavailable. In 2002, such problems created shortagesof licensed vaccines for eight of the 11 vaccine-preventable childhood diseases. (21) , (22) , (23) ", "Aside from production set-backs, influenza vaccine poses a perennial challenge involvingchoice of vaccine components and amount to manufacture. Each year, public health authorities andmanufacturers analyze worldwide surveillance information to determine which flu virus strains arelikely to put humans at risk in the coming year. Sometimes, the viral strain that most threatens theU.S. public is not among those chosen for that year's vaccine, the situation in 2003 when vaccinedevelopers could not formulate a Fujian component in time for the season's distribution. (24) ", "Because influenza changes slightly each year, healthy adults have partial immunity to newstrains; each year, the virus typically makes healthy people sick, but not too sick. Several times acentury, however, the virus changes enough that there is no partial immunity. This situation can leadto rapid worldwide spread of the virus, called an influenza pandemic, with severe illness and death,even in healthy people, and possible serious disruptions in services and social order. Some haveexpressed concern that the problems evident in the national response to the 2004-2005 flu vaccineshortage serve as a relevant drill -- and warning -- for pandemic preparedness. (25) ", "Also a topic of international surveillance and planning is avian influenza (\"bird flu\") -- aninfluenza strain affecting poultry in Asia -- in anticipation of its possible joining with a viral strainthat infects humans. Rather than a unique circumstance, this international investigation is part ofthe intensive, ongoing process of animal and human (clinical and laboratory) surveillance, testing,and action that is public health practice. For example, CDC laboratories collaborate with the WorldHealth Organization in testing and describing avian viruses to help in developing a potentialvaccine.

Most people in the UnitedStates now view protections against bioterrorism or biowarfare agents, such as vaccines, as in thepublic interest. Many also so categorize all vaccines, whether intended against naturally occurringor bioterror-related infectious diseases. The bottom line in persuading companies to producevaccines is largely one of opportunity cost: whether they can afford to put aside other potentiallylucrative projects to do so.", "Over the years, Members of Congress have proposed changes to the Internal Revenue Codeinvolving tax credits for certain vaccine research and distribution activities to effectively lower thecost to manufacturers. Another way to provide a financial incentive is to assure that a primarypurchaser is available to generate demand for the vaccine. When the government is the primarypurchaser, such as for anthrax or smallpox vaccines, it can develop contracts with manufacturers thataddress volume, liability protection, and long-term plans, for example, that make productionpractical.", "In his 2003 State of the Union speech, President George W. Bush proposed a federalinitiative, Project BioShield, to encourage private industry to develop medical countermeasures tobioterrorism threats. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 was signed into law in July 2004 ( P.L.108-276 ). (27) ", "Liability. Because some manufacturers havenamed liability concerns among reasons to forgo vaccine production, legislative proposals haveaddressed indemnification, liability insurance, and injury compensation plans. Protection ofpotential manufacturers, seen as a necessary incentive to participation, was included in the HomelandSecurity Act of 2002 and the Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003. The AmericanJobs Creation Act of 2004 (28) added the influenza vaccine to those that the National VaccineInjury Compensation Program covers. ", "Partnerships. Some Members of Congress haveexpressed interest in industry consortia or public-private partnerships to accelerate vaccine researchand development and manufacture. This may involve considering issues of intellectual propertyprotection among collaborators and anti-trust law accommodations to allow private manufacturersto make joint decisions. Such partnerships have been recommended as ways to spread financial risk,thus making vaccines available for diseases that are prevalent among small or impoverished groups.", "Improved Coordination. Better coordinationamong federal regulators, private manufacturers, government scientists, and purchasers could avoidmany supply shortages, such as occurred with childhood vaccines in 2002. Coordination could alsoshorten the time between initial research and product licensure. Policy analysts look for mechanismsto streamline FDA administrative -- but not human safety and effectiveness assurance -- procedures. Some, including the Institute of Medicine (IOM), have suggested establishing a National VaccineAuthority. (29) Two otherIOM committees, in DOD-sponsored reports addressing naturally occurring infectious diseases (30) and biowarfareagents, (31) recommendedbetter coordination within the DOD vaccine acquisition programs and between DOD and otherentities, particularly HHS. These groups anticipate that a coordinated decision and budget authoritycould present a coherent front to private manufacturers and within government. After the 2002reports, DOD assigned vaccine acquisition responsibilities to a higher administrative level (32) and interagency agreementsand working groups have been formed. Cutting down on frustrations arising from getting differentanswers or timetables from different offices could make vaccine work more appealing to those inresearch and development and manufacture.", "While almost any change in research and development, production, monitoring, and saleswould involve FDA, some questions focus on FDA itself. These include the extent to which itsbudget limits the scope and timeliness of its activities. Some analysts suggest that FDA standardsare too high to be reasonably feasible.", "Sometimes all the necessary pieces of potential solutions exist, but without an organizingforce. For years, various representatives of HHS, DOD, and private manufacturers had met overcontracts to develop and produce vaccines to protect, for example, against smallpox and anthrax. The September and October 2001 attacks on the U.S. population quickly dissolved the stickingpoints. Political will -- and its ability to get all the right people and their checkbooks in the roomat the same time -- fueled action to acquire smallpox vaccine, both doses of previously made andlicensed product and contracts to develop new products. In the years since then, HHS has announcedcontracts to develop new vaccines against smallpox, plague, and tularemia; (33) and, with Project BioShieldfunding, a second-generation anthrax vaccine will be stored in the Strategic National Stockpile. (34) ", "Ensuring Safety and Effectiveness May DelayAvailability. It takes a long time from the start of clinical trials to FDAlicensure. (35) Manyobservers consider much of that time as necessary to ensure that vaccines produced and sold are safeand effective. FDA has formal mechanisms to expedite the review process: fast-track drugdevelopment, priority review, and accelerated approval. Its \"Animal Rule\" and provisions under theProject BioShield Act of 2004 also support shorter time from idea to approved public use. (36) The Congress could assessthe extent to which the laws that direct HHS and DOD to facilitate or accelerate research anddevelopment and approval of bioterrorism countermeasures as well as needed vaccines for seriousconditions (37) aresucceeding and consider legislative ways to help those processes along.", " Fast-Track Mechanism. The Food and Drug Administration ModernizationAct of 1997 (FDAMA, P.L. 105-115 ) described a \"Fast Track\" mechanism whereby themanufacturer and FDA discuss development plans and strategies before the formal submission ofa Biologics License Application (BLA, for a vaccine application, for example) or a New DrugApplication (NDA, for a drug). The early interaction can help clarify goals and work throughobstacles that would delay approval decisions if they became evident only at BLA submission. (38) ", " Accelerated Approval. For the treatment of a serious or life-threateningillness, FDA regulations allow \"accelerated approval\" of a biologic product that provides a\"meaningful therapeutic benefit ... over existing treatments.\" The approval is based on clinical trialsthat, rather than using standard outcome measures such as survival or illness, use \"a surrogateendpoint that is reasonably likely ... to predict clinical benefit.\" FDA usually requires postmarketingstudies of biologics approved this way. (39) ", " Animal Rule. Scientists use clinical trials and field trials to test a vaccine'seffectiveness. Clinical trials designed to test vaccines for most infectious diseases usually involverandom assignment of individuals to groups -- members of one group are given the new vaccine andmembers of the other (the control group) are given a placebo or an existing licensed vaccine -- toassess whether the investigational vaccine would effectively prevent disease. When the diseaseunder study has no known treatment and has severe outcomes (including death), it is unethical tochallenge human research subjects, because if the vaccine is not effective, the subjects are irreparablyharmed. Field trials, in which scientists observe naturally occurring disease among vaccinated andunvaccinated groups, are not feasible for diseases that occur sporadically or would occur only in thecontext of bioterror or biowarfare action. For these reasons, researchers and regulators maysometimes need alternative models for demonstrating vaccine effectiveness.", "In 2002, FDA published its long-debated final Animal Efficacy Rule. The regulations applyonly \"when adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in humans cannot be ethically conductedand field efficacy studies are not feasible.\" They allow submission of data from animal studies ofeffectiveness as evidence to support licensure applications of new drug and biological products thattarget \"serious or life-threatening conditions\" in humans. (40) It could apply, for example, to inhalational anthrax, for whichthere is no surrogate of immunity and no natural endemic disease. Although no vaccine has yet beenapproved under this rule, FDA used the rule for the first time in February 2003 to approve adrug. (41) Congress mayfollow the implementation of this rule and discuss alternative actions in its oversight of safety,effectiveness, and availability goals.", " Priority Review. Unlike Fast Track, Accelerated Approval, or Animal Ruleactivities, the Priority Review process begins only when a manufacturer officially submits a BLA(or an NDA). Priority Review, therefore, does not alter the steps taken in a drug's development ortesting for safety and effectiveness. It does, however, for products believed to address unmet needs,shorten the anticipated amount of time until approval decision from 10 months to 6 months. (42) ", " Medical Countermeasures to Bioterrorism Attack. Although FDA, NIH,and DOD had been working on vaccines against potential bioterrorism or biowarfare agents, theevents of September and October 2001 infused the efforts with resources and political capital. Product development was supported with increased interaction among and within governmentagencies and with manufacturers, and consideration of fast track, accelerated approval, and animalefficacy mechanisms to bring products to review. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 allows theHHS Secretary (with directions regarding potential risk and benefit and required recordkeeping) toauthorize the emergency-use of products that do not have FDA approval in the event of potentialserious or life-threatening effects of a biological agent for which there is no approved product.

A vaccine need not be side-effect free for FDA licensure; the licensed smallpox vaccine carriesan estimate, based on data from its routine use 30 years ago, of one or two deaths per millionrecipients. Similarly, effectiveness does not mean that a vaccine must protect permanently orcompletely. Researchers attempt to assess efficacy , generally, with expensive and lengthy clinicaltrials that compare infection or illness rates in two groups, both exposed to the disease-causing agent,but with only one provided with the hypothesized vaccine protection. Effectiveness describes howthe product works in a real-world situation. For drugs, effectiveness is often lower than efficacybecause of interactions with other medications or health conditions of the patient, sufficient dose orduration of use not prescribed by the physician or followed by the patient, or use for a off-labelcondition that had not been tested.

Another FDA program, MedWatch, informs the public with clinicalinformation about safety issues involving vaccines and other medical products. These so-called passive surveillance systems rely on consumers and physicians to both recognize adverse events aspossibly vaccine-related and to follow through with reporting their concern to FDA.

Often, decisions of vaccine safety revolve around perceptions ofrisk, methodologic limits of risk assessment, and communication of what is known about risks. Scientists, clinicians, Members of Congress, and public policy analysts continue to face choices onrisk -- hypothetical and real -- that do not offer clear alternatives. These involve uncertainties, bothscientific and political, and, therefore, will reflect personal and communal values.

Some legislators, in considering cost, would broaden theanalysis to include value-for-cost, arguing that if the government is going to consider paying fordrugs, it may as well pay for the most effective ones.

For those times when safetyefforts have been unsuccessful, earlier Congresses have addressed compensation. Since its creationby Congress in 1986, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) (55) has made many awards,primarily to families of children, following injuries deemed to have been associated withACIP-recommended vaccinations. For several years, sentiment has been growing in Congress thatmodifications to the program are needed to make it more fair and efficient. Senator Bill Fristproposed changes to VICP in his Improved Vaccine Affordability and Availability Act( S. 754 , introduced April 1, 2003); committee mark-up of the bill has been postponedindefinitely.

On April 30, 2003, President Bush signedthe Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-20 ), which the House andSenate had adapted from the Administration's proposal. It includes provisions to pay for smallpoxvaccine injury-related medical care, lost employment income under specified circumstances, anddeath benefits. HRSA published the required injury table in August 2003 (57) and the administrativeguidelines for the Smallpox Vaccine Injury Program in December 2003.

These include the need forimprovements in technology, training, hospital and laboratory capacity, and communication amongparticipants.

In the context of medical countermeasures to bioterrorism attacks, such as the smallpox vaccine,Congress may consider questions about the payment for the vaccine administration and, then, forfollow-up and treatment, if necessary, of vaccine-related illness.

Concerns about access to vaccinesare not limited to biodefense and domestic use. Many government agencies and private groups worktoward international health objectives, such as eradicating polio. Some Members noted concern forpublic health needs of developing countries worldwide and the need to assist those countries in fightsagainst infectious diseases. Their concern stemmed from both humanitarian impulses and a growingawareness of the links between poor health and economic and political instability. Their workresulted in P.L. 108-25 , the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and MalariaAct of 2003.
