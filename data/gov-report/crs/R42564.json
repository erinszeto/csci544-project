S. 3187 (the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act) and H.R. 5651 (the Food and Drug Administration Reform Act of 2012) each include provisions that would affect the regulation of human drugs, biological products, and medical devices, along with several agency-wide administrative or miscellaneous items. Majority and minority committee leaders have expressed the desire to get a completed bill to the President before July 4, 2012.", "The impetus to the timing of these bills is that current authority for FDA to collect fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments (PDUFA) of 2007 and the Medical Device User Fee Amendments (MDUFA) of 2007 will expire on October 1, 2012, unless reauthorizing legislation is enacted before then. Member statements at committee hearings indicated no opposition to reauthorization and very little comment about changes to the current user fee programs.

Because revenue from those fees supports over 2,000 full-time equivalent FDA positions and accounts for more than half of the agency's drug and device review resources, Members of Congress have referred to the user fee reauthorizations as generally uncontroversial, must-pass legislation. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce have, in addition to developing legislation that would reauthorize the drug and device user fees, crafted additional titles that would create new user fee authority for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products, permanently authorize programs to encourage or require studies of drugs for pediatric use, medical device regulation, drug regulation, and several areas, such as advisory committee conflict of interest, that cut across FDA product areas.

Low-risk medical devices (Class I) and a very small number of moderate-risk medical devices (Class II) are exempt from premarket review.

That company must seek and receive FDA approval, by way of an investigational new drug (IND) application, to test the product with human subjects. Those tests, called clinical trials, are carried out sequentially in Phase I, II, and III studies, which involve increasing numbers of subjects. The manufacturer then compiles the resulting data and analysis in a new drug application (NDA). FDA reviews the NDA with three major concerns: (1) safety and effectiveness in the drug's proposed use; (2) appropriateness of the proposed labeling; and (3) adequacy of manufacturing methods to assure the drug's identify, strength, quality, and identity.

For example, when one of two manufacturing facilities goes off-line for any reason, the remaining facility may be able to meet the total demand for a while, but not indefinitely. Patterns of practice in the drug distribution industry, such as just-in-time inventories, leave little back-up capacity from warehouses.", "It is not always feasible for other manufacturers to add production capacity to ease a shortage. First, it takes time to construct new facilities. Second, FDA must approve the manufacturing process and recordkeeping along with product specifications. Third, a manufacturer must decide to use the new or existing facility for the drug in shortage rather than for another product that may yield greater profit or better fit within the company's business plan.", "FDA has acted within its current authority by asking both sole source and other firms to increase production, exercising flexibility through regulatory discretion (e.g., allowing the importation), expediting review, and communicating with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) about quotas of controlled substances. An Executive Order directed FDA to use all tools to require that manufacturers give advance notice of manufacturing interruptions, to expedite applications, and to work with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to address instances of price gouging, for example, when pharmacies turn to supplies outside their routine distribution channels. FDA and GAO analyses suggested immediate steps to increase notification, increase staffing, develop legislation to require notification, and communicate with the public and within FDA. They suggested longer term steps such as using databases to identify factors that help prevent or mitigate shortages, identifying manufacturing quality issues and having backup plans, using sentinel reports from providers to identify imminent shortages, and encouraging wholesaler transparency.

Advisory committee members are also prohibited from participating if any of the following have a financial interest: the member's spouse; minor child; general partner; organization in which the member serves as an officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee; or any person or organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment.", "However, the criminal financial conflict of interest statute has several waiver provisions. The first of two specifically referenced in FFDCA Sec. 712 allows for a waiver if the advisory committee member fully discloses the financial interest and the official who appoints the member makes a written determination, in advance, that the financial \"interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee.\" The second wavier allows the official responsible for the advisory committee member's appointment, after reviewing the financial disclosure report, to make a written certification \"that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved.\"", "The FFDCA has its own, additional prohibition and waiver for conflicts of interest. Under the current FFDCA Sec. 712(c)(2)(A), any member of an advisory committee would be prohibited from participating in any \"particular matter\" in an advisory committee meeting in which such member, or an immediate family member of such member, has a \"financial interest that could be affected by the advice given to the Secretary with respect to such matter.\" The HHS Secretary retains the right to grant a waiver to any member of such advisory panel to participate in \"a particular matter considered in a committee meeting,\" either as a voting or non-voting member of the advisory committee, when the Secretary determines that \"it is necessary to afford the advisory committee essential expertise.\"", "Provisions in S. 3187 and H.R. 5651 regarding advisory committee conflicts of interest are summarized and compared with current law and with each other in Table 13 ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Reforms and Miscellaneous Topics52", "paragraphs": ["A number of additional provisions in the two bills are summarized and compared in Table 14 .

These include changing the premarket approval and clearance procedures for medical devices, further developing a supply chain system that meets global demands, and looking at whether federal health program drug payment policies influence drug shortages.
