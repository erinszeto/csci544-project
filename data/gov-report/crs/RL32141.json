The long duration of the operations and the use of some regular appropriations to fundcombat during the First Gulf War distinguish these operations from Bosnia, Kosovo, and Haiti.", "Operation Desert Shield for the First Gulf War was initially funded with supplemental appropriations that were included in the FY1991 continuing resolution. The next funding forOperation Desert Shield, consisting of $1 billion, was included in the FY1991 regular DefenseAppropriations Act from amounts contributed by allies. This use of regular appropriations early inthe Gulf War was contrary to the use of supplemental appropriations to fund combat operations inBosnia, Kosovo, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. However, it may reflectcongressional use of the funding vehicle that was immediately available to cover the initial costs ofthe operation. The next and largest appropriations for the First Gulf War were included in theFY1991 Desert Shield/Desert Storm supplemental, which was signed into law on March 22, 1991. The size of this supplemental appropriation ($42.6 billion) suggests that the $1 billion included inFY1991 regular appropriations was indeed an exception, rather than a significant change, to thepractice of funding combat operations with supplemental appropriations.", "The \"No-Fly\" zones (Southwest Asia operations) following the First Gulf War were funded at least partially with supplemental appropriations for 7 years, the longest use of supplementalappropriations in any of the cases examined. Unlike Kosovo and Haiti, the \"No-Fly\" zones did notprogress directly from supplemental to regular appropriations as they became ongoing operations. Instead, they were funded partially with supplemental appropriations in FY1992 and FY1993 andfully with supplemental appropriations in FY1994 and FY1995. In FY1996, Congress used regularappropriations to fund the \"No-Fly\" zones. At this point, rather than continuing to use regularappropriations, Congress returned to a combination of regular and supplemental appropriations fromFY1997 through FY1999. In FY2000 and FY2001, regular appropriations were used again.", "Thus, although Desert Shield/Desert Storm and the \"No-Fly\" zones began with supplemental appropriations and ended with regular appropriations, the 7-year interim between those pointsdiffered from the interim between combat operations and ongoing peacekeeping operations inBosnia, Kosovo, and Haiti. Not only was this interim longer in the case of the \"No-Fly\" zones, butit also provided two instances where Congress returned to either partial or full supplemental fundingafter having used only regular appropriations during the prior fiscal year.
