Given the importance of honey bees and other bee species to food production, many have expressed concern about whether a \"pollinator crisis\" has been occurring in recent decades. Although honey bee colony losses due to bee pests, parasites, pathogens, and disease are not uncommon, there is the perception that bee health has been declining more rapidly than in prior years, both in the United States and globally. This situation gained increased attention in 2006 as some commercial beekeepers began reporting sharp declines in their honey bee colonies. Because of the severity and unusual circumstances of these colony declines, scientists named this phenomenon colony collapse disorder (CCD). Since then, honey bee colonies have continued to dwindle each year, for reasons not solely attributable to CCD. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that CCD may not be the only or even the major cause of bee colony losses in recent years. In the United States, USDA estimates of overwinter colony losses from all causes have averaged nearly 30% annually since 2006.", "The precise reasons for honey bee losses are not yet known.

Familiar examples include pesticides used to kill insects (insecticides) and weeds (herbicides) that can reduce the yield, and sometimes harm the quality, of agricultural crops, ornamental plants, forests, and pastures, or wooden structures (e.g., through termite damage). But the broad legal definition of \"pesticide\" also applies to products with less familiar \"pesticidal uses.\" For example, substances are pesticides when used to control mites, mold, mildew, and other nuisance growths in hives or on equipment. The term also applies to disinfectants and sterilizing agents, animal repellents, rat poison, and many other substances. An estimated 18,000 pesticide products are currently in use in the United States. Pesticides vary greatly in toxicity, persistence in the environment, and ability to bioaccumulate up the food chain, as well as in the range of plants and animals that are likely to be affected in the event of exposure. Some are nearly nontoxic to some species but exquisitely toxic to other species.", "All pesticides are regulated by EPA under the authority of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and approximately 5,800 pesticide products used in food production also are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). FIFRA requires EPA to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the United States through product registration and labeling so as to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on people and the environment, taking into account the costs and benefits of various pesticide uses. FIFRA prohibits the sale of any pesticide in the United States unless it is registered (licensed) and labeled to indicate approved uses and restrictions. It is a violation of the law to use a pesticide in a manner that is inconsistent with the label instructions. EPA registers each pesticide product for each approved use. For example, a product may be registered for use on bee hives to control mites or as a seed treatment for corn. In addition, FIFRA requires EPA to reregister pesticides first registered prior to 1984 and to review all registered pesticides periodically on a 15-year cycle, based on new data that meet current regulatory and scientific standards.", "For the 600 or more active ingredients in pesticide products that are registered for use in food production, Section 408 of the FFDCA authorizes EPA to establish maximum allowable residue levels (also known as \"tolerances\") to ensure that human exposure to the pesticide ingredients in food and animal feed will be \"safe.\" A \"safe\" tolerance is defined in the law as a level at which there is \"a reasonable certainty of no harm\" from the exposure, even when considering total cumulative and aggregate pesticide exposure of children. Under the FFDCA, foods (or animal feeds) with a residue of a pesticide ingredient for which there is no tolerance established, or with a residue level exceeding an established tolerance limit, are declared \"unsafe\" and \"adulterated\"; such foods cannot be sold in interstate commerce or imported to the United States. Pesticides may not be registered under FIFRA for use on food crops unless tolerances (or exemptions) have been established under the FFDCA.

In evaluating a pesticide registration application, EPA assesses a range of potential human health and environmental effects associated with use of the product. EPA's process of registering a pesticide comprises a scientific, legal, and administrative procedure involving the ingredients of the pesticide; the particular site or crop where it is to be used; the amount, frequency, and timing of its use; and storage and disposal practices. EPA may require data from any combination of more than 100 different tests, depending on the potential toxicity of active and inert ingredients and degree of exposure.", "To register a pesticide for use on food, EPA also requires applicants to determine the amount of residue that could remain on crops, as well as on (or in) food products (such as corn syrup), assuming that the pesticide product is applied according to the manufacturers' recommended rates and methods. Based on the data submitted, EPA determines whether and under what conditions a proposed pesticide use would present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment, and, for a food or residential use, whether its use would be safe. Some features of pesticides that might affect registration decisions include the specificity of the pesticide for the targeted pest, its toxicity to people who apply it, its tendency to persist in the environment over time, and its ability to bioaccumulate in animals higher in the food chain. ", "EPA specifically takes into account unintended harm to bees and available information for other nontargeted insects in its registration decisions. EPA requires studies to determine acute (short-term) toxicity of a pesticide on individual bees when they come into body contact with pesticide residue. EPA also collects reports on bee-kill incidents. If a pesticide appears to be very toxic to bees, EPA may require long-term studies of its effects.", "If the risk is determined to be unreasonable or unsafe, EPA attempts to mitigate the risk by adjusting requirements on the label (for example, requiring a buffer zone around lakes and streams or requiring personal protective equipment for pesticide handlers). If the risk remains unreasonable or unsafe, EPA will refuse to register the pesticide. If the risk is determined to be reasonable and safe, registration is granted, and the agency specifies the approved uses and conditions of use, including safe methods of pesticide storage and disposal, which the registrant must explain on the product label. EPA can and often does require specific application methods to be printed on the product label to minimize environmental damage. For example, the label sometimes requires that application of certain pesticides occur only when bees are not foraging, when there is little wind, or in a granular form or as a seed coating rather than aerially, in order to minimize spray drift off property. Pesticide registrations are reviewed at least once every 15 years to consider new scientific information and may be reviewed at any time in response to reports of adverse effects and possible unreasonable risks from use of particular pesticides."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Neonicotinoid Pesticides", "paragraphs": ["Neonicotinoids are a relatively new major class of insecticides and among the fastest-growing class of insecticides in modern crop protection. Developed in the 1980s, some products such as imidacloprid were first introduced in the early to mid-1990s, but not widely marketed until the mid-2000s. Neonicotinoids are systemic pesticides that, regardless of application method (spray, drip irrigation, granular spreading, or seed coating), once taken into the plant, migrate into all parts, including flowers, pollen, and nectar. Neonicotinoids are related to nicotine and were developed as an alternative to highly toxic (to humans) organophosphate insecticides such as methyl parathion. Active ingredients of some of the most commonly applied neonicotinoids include imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam. Others include acetamiprid, dinotefuran, nitenpyram, and thiacloprid.

However, as their use has increased, so have concerns about their potential harm to birds, earthworms, aquatic insects, and insect pollinators, including bees. They comprise a class of active ingredients that have come under considerable scrutiny with respect to their potential effects on bee health. The attention is partly due to an incident of misuse (that is, use not in accord with the pesticide label) of one neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, in Germany that resulted in a large bee kill, as well as widespread beekeeper concerns about use of another neonicotinoid, clothianidin, and its impact on bees in France.", "Neonicotinoids are insect neurotoxins that vary in strength of their effect on honey bees. The scientific evidence to date indicates that although neonicotinoids are highly toxic to bees exposed to relatively high levels, individual pesticides in this class are not the only cause of declining bee health, and pyrethroid exposures may be more significant. Although neonicotinoids have been a focus of scientific, public, and political interest, they have not been proven to be the primary cause of declines in bee health.

Besides the active ingredients, pesticide products include other ingredients, such as \"inerts\" or adjuvants that are intended to improve delivery of the active ingredient to the target pest. Others are used to increase the toxicity of a pesticide, for example, by inhibiting breakdown of a pesticide by insets.", "Studies have shown that bees are exposed to pesticides in many ways throughout the foraging period: from planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated seed; from the soil of both planted and unplanted fields; in flowers growing near these fields; as well as applications in or near bee hives. Bees also sometimes are exposed to pesticides accidentally, either when pesticides are misused or misapplied or when they are used according to label directions to control pests in areas frequented by bees\u2014for example, alongside roads or rights of way for the control of weeds, trees, or other pests; on or near commercial farm crops; or on or near fields, lawns, and gardens to control fleas, ticks, weeds, grubs, mosquitos, or other adult insects.", " Figure 2 illustrates some significant paths of bee exposure to pesticides applied as a spray or as a soil or seed treatment (systemic). If bees happen to fly through a newly treated field or dust clouds from planting of seeds coated with pesticide or are orally exposed to pesticide in food or water, and if exposure is high enough, bees may be sickened or die from pesticide exposure.

Widespread use of herbicides reduces habitat available to bees; many pesticides are known to be lethal to bees, given sufficient levels of exposure; and some reports of local bee kill incidents have been well documented. Effects on individual bees may be lethal or sublethal depending on dose and other conditions of exposure. A summary of the types of sublethal effects reported in bees exposed to pesticides includes ", "decreased navigation, orientation, and communication abilities; altered foraging behavior and motor activity; short- and long-term memory loss; impaired learning behavior and sensory detection; compromised immune functioning; increased susceptibility to diseases and pests; reduced fecundity (fertility and reproduction); and impaired reproduction and development.", "Although pesticides have been shown to damage bee health, it is unclear whether the level of harm is sufficient to attribute pesticides as the single or as the major cause of honey bee population declines.", "The Appendix provides a summary of selected scientific literature based largely on publications in peer-reviewed journals.

This involves both selecting a site for an apiary in an area with low pesticide risk and notifying \"growers and applicators in the area, the county agent, and the State Apiary Inspector of the location of your hives.... If the insecticide to be used has a long residual life and is being applied to a plant where bees are foraging, it may be best to move your bees out of the area.\"", "For growers, recommendations involve reducing the hazards associated with insecticides, including avoiding the use of dusts, such as those from treated seeds, and using chemicals with reduced risk to bees whenever possible. Other recommendations include applying insecticides \"in the late evening, night, or early morning when fewer bees will be foraging, and when spray drift and volatilization due to extreme heat are at a minimum\"; not spraying \"when winds favor drifting, and us[ing] ground applications instead of air where possible\"; and avoiding \"spraying when the crop or other plants in the field or nearby (including weeds) are in bloom.\" Some agricultural groups provide such guidance to their growers. For example, the Almond Board of California recommends that growers avoid applying insecticides when plants are in bloom or when pollen is available and honey bees are feeding. Additional grower BMPs are listed in the text box below.

The text box below provides additional information on IPM practices.", "Other guidance by apiculturists and university extension focuses on providing recommendations to private landowners and homeowners for proper use of pest control products on ornamental plants. One recommendation is to avoid applying any pesticides, including insecticides and fungicides, during bloom of ornamental plants that attract bees (e.g., heather, lavender, linden, rhododendron, and rose). It is also recommended that any pesticides be applied \"only after flower petals have fallen, when ornamental plants are less attractive to bees,\" and that all specific requirements to protect bees on the pesticide label be strictly followed.

The guidance is founded on EPA's ecological risk assessment framework, integrates an analysis of honey bees and other pollinators within the agency's broader components of ecological risk assessment, and was prepared in collaboration with Health Canada's Pesticide Management Regulatory Authority and California's Department of Pesticide Regulation. The guidance describes the basic framework of the risk assessment process and the data used to support risk management decisions, and includes a process to assess both foliar spray applications and soil/seed treatment applications.", "Some groups argue that EPA does not take into account chronic, sub-lethal effects in its risk assessments, nor synergistic effects with other compounds used in real field settings, such as fungicides, adjuvants, and inerts. These groups also claim native and wild bee species are generally not addressed as part of EPA's risk assessment. Since most native bee species (about 70%) are ground nesting, these groups further claim that the use of systemic insecticides poses risks to native bees from exposure through their habitats in the ground. Native and wild bee species are also generally not addressed as part of EPA's pesticide labeling approach (discussed in \" EPA's New \"Bee Advisory\" Labeling Requirements \").", "As part of EPA's overall review, the agency has conducted a study of the benefits of neonicotinoid seed treatments for insect control in U.S. soybean production.

A 2013 study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) of three neonicotinoid pesticides\u2014imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam\u2014determined that bees faced several risks including exposure to pollen and nectar, dust, and guttation fluid from maize.", "Another potential source of exposure was suggested by another 2012 study, showing that bees might be exposed to neonicotinoids in the corn syrup they are sometimes fed during the winter by beekeepers. However, the researchers did not sample corn syrup actually fed to bees, but rather showed that bees would consume sufficient imidacloprid to produce toxic sublethal effects if they were provided contaminated corn syrup in the hive. Other research found no pesticides in samples of high-fructose corn syrup obtained from three major suppliers. ", "Pesticide Effects on Bee Health ", "According to research cited in a 2007 study by the National Research Council (NRC), \"the application of pesticides, especially insecticides used to control crop pests, kills or weakens thousands of honey bee colonies in the United States each year.\" Nevertheless, the study concluded that local bee kills \"likely have not contributed significantly to the recent national decline in colony populations\" [emphasis added]. ", "Recent studies have begun to identify mechanisms by which some chemical interactions occur. For example, some fungicides may inhibit an enzyme that bees need to detoxify miticides. However, further research is needed since measurement difficulties continue to complicate study of this issue, including difficulty testing the in-field or field-realistic doses; effects at different life stages; how to account for cases of accidental exposure or exposure to multiple different types of pesticides; and how to account for species diversity (e.g., between honey bees and native bees), differences in nutritional needs/access and nesting sites, biological organization, and floral specialization. ", "Generalizations about the relative importance of pesticides for global bee health cannot be drawn from available data, given the disparate study designs and results. Moreover, research has been and continues to be conducted, with most scientists focusing on a single pesticide or pathogen at a time. Consideration of interactions has been minimal\u2014whether exposure from different types of chemicals or exposure from chemicals in combination with other factors. One study explains:", "Attempts to correlate global bee declines or CCD with increased pesticide exposures alone, have not been successful to date.\u2026 Pesticide interactions among various mixtures as well as with other stressors including Varroa and Nosema , IAPV, beneficial hive microbes, and impacts on bee immune systems all require further study. It seems to us that it is far too early to attempt to link or to dismiss pesticide impacts with CCD.", "The study noted that the doses of individual pesticides found in bees were not concentrated enough to be lethal, but the authors remained concerned about possible chronic problems caused by long-term exposure and possible additive or synergistic effects of exposure to the combinations of pesticides found. For example, numerous pesticides classified as pyrethroids that were found in the field have been shown to cause disorientation in honey bees. ", "It is important to note that virtually all information about pesticide risks to bees derives from studies in cultivated fields or laboratories. There is little or no information about the possible impacts on bee populations of pesticides applied by homeowners (for example, to control mosquitos) or to ornamental plantings.", "Nevertheless, a sizeable and growing body of scientific research presents compelling evidence suggesting that pesticide exposure may be harmful to bees and other animal species. For example, a 2014 meta-analysis covering 800 peer-reviewed reports over two decades examined the reported effects of systemic pesticides on ecosystems and a range of animal species\u2014terrestrial invertebrates, including insect pollinators; aquatic invertebrates; and birds. The analysis, conducted by entomologists and ornithologists based in Europe, concluded that neonicotinoid pesticides \"pose a serious risk to honeybees and other pollinators such as butterflies and to a wide range of other invertebrates such as earthworms and vertebrates including birds.\"", "In response to reports that honey bees are disappearing and causing hives to collapse, recent studies of the impacts of exposure to imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids have focused more on their potential to affect complex behaviors in insects, including flight, navigation, olfactory memory, recruitment, foraging, and coordination. One study reported sublethal effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on honey bee foraging behavior that may impair the navigational and foraging abilities of honey bees. Another study found a reduction of foraging activity and homing behavior of honey bees exposed to treated crops at certain exposure levels of neonicotinoids.", "Scientists at Bayer Crop Science argue with the findings of these and other studies, claiming that the dose of pesticide delivered to bees in some studies is not \"field-relevant,\" resulting in findings obtained \"under artificial conditions\" and \"in conflict with\" earlier studies. Some of the statements made in the 2012 Bayer Crop Science review of the scientific literature have been rebutted by researchers at Purdue University and Pennsylvania State University, based on comments submitted by the Center for Food Safety as part of EPA's public rulemaking docket. Among a list of concerns regarding various statements in the Bayer Crop Science report, Professor Frazier from Pennsylvania State University states: \"To object to a specific dose on the basis of an estimated level without giving the reader the actual basis for this neglects not only good science protocol, but also obfuscates any arguments.\" Among other comments, Professor Krupke from Purdue University further acknowledges: \"These data suggest that there is a strong likelihood that the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam and/or clothianidin were responsible for the bee kills we investigated.\" ", "EPA has determined that clothianidin \"has the potential to be highly toxic on both a contact and an oral basis\" to honey bees. EPA also has reported that one honey bee field study submitted to the agency indicates that \"mortality, pollen foraging activity, and honey yield were negatively affected by residues of clothianidin,\" but the residue levels causing the effect were not reported. Acute effects also have been demonstrated in another field study. It showed that honey bees can be killed by exposure to pesticide-contaminated talc if they fly through dust clouds associated with planting, but mortality appears to depend on high levels of humidity. Health Canada has concluded that corn planting also was implicated in bee mortalities in Ontario during the spring planting season in 2012.", "Research has shown that honey bee exposure to sublethal levels of pesticides, including neonicotinoids, exhibit impaired brood development, impaired olfactory associative behavior, and impaired homing ability. Exposure to sublethal levels of neonicotinoid has also been associated with higher rates of Nosema infection, and also reduced immune functioning in those bees infected, making bees more susceptible to viral infections. In another study, responsiveness to sucrose and the bee's \"waggle dancing\" abilities were adversely affected when honey bees ingested imidacloprid. Another study alternatively fed honey bee hives corn syrup treated with imidacloprid, while other hives were fed untreated corn syrup. After 6 months, nearly all the treated hives collapsed, while the untreated control hives remained healthy. Another study showed that imidacloprid ingestion by larvae of the stingless bee ( Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioidides ) resulted in decreased survival rates, negatively affected development of a specific region of the bee brain, and impaired walking behavior of newly emerged adult worker bees.", "A 2013 study found that exposure to a combination of an insecticide (imidacloprid) and a miticide (coumaphos) impaired learning and memory formation, important behaviors involved in foraging, in honey bees exposed under \"field-realistic concentrations.\" A similar study also showed cognitive impairments from exposure to these same pesticides. Studies also have found increased honey bee susceptibility to and mortality from Nosema after exposure to sublethal concentrations of some pesticides (fipronil, amitraz, fluvalinate, chlorothalonil, pyraclostrobin, and imidacloprid). Another study concluded that high levels of the fungicide chlorothalonil in pollen and wax may be associated with entombing behavior, a sign that a hive has been poisoned. These and other pesticides commonly used to control mites have also been shown to have toxic effects on developing honey bee larvae at levels currently found in hives.", "A 2014 study reported linkages between CCD and sublethal exposure of neonicotinoid pesticides\u2014imidacloprid and clothianidin\u2014which affected the winterization of the bees, comparing exposed bee colonies to a control of non-exposed bee colonies. In the study, one-half the bee colonies exposed to neonicotinoids exhibited symptoms resembling CCD and had abandoned their hives during the winter, whereas one-sixth of the control colonies were lost exhibiting Nosema ceranae symptoms. The control colonies did not abandon their hives but re-populated quickly; the surviving exposed colonies were small and either without queen bees or had no brood, according to the study. Some have criticized this study for its small sample size, lack of replication at each location, and the use of pesticide doses that may not reflect realistic field conditions.", "Researchers at USDA and affiliated bee laboratories at land grant universities throughout the United States continue to study the effects of neonicotinoids and other pesticides, including the effects of interactions between pesticides and other stressors. Some of these studies demonstrate that exposure by bees to certain pesticides and/or combinations of insecticides (e.g., neonicotinoids with miticides) may affect the bee's overall energy budget, including its metabolism, physical activity, digestion, and immunity; cause other types of physiological effects; and affect different parts of the bee's nervous system, depending on the type or combination of insecticides studied among other variables, including diet and nutrition. ", "A few studies have examined the effects of pesticides on various species of bumble bees. One study found that bumble bee exposure to imidacloprid may affect bee brain functioning, as well as colony growth and nest conditions. Another study found that bumble bee colonies exposed in a laboratory to low levels of imidacloprid had a significantly reduced growth rate and an 85% reduction in queen production relative to untreated colonies. Other studies have found that exposure of neonicotinoids could adversely affect foraging behavior, reproductive success, and locomotor behavior. Another study showed effects following direct contact with a range of pesticides, including shortened life spans and inability to produce brood in worker bees; however, some pesticides and all fungicides tested reportedly did not result in sublethal effects. Yet another study reported no adverse impacts on brood production or other sublethal effects on bumble bees from exposure to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam. One study showed that chronic exposure to two pesticides, one a neonicotinoid, at concentrations close to those found in fields \"impairs natural foraging behavior and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in bumblebee brood development and colony success.\" Bayer Crop Science argues that the results of some of these studies were also obtained \"under artificial conditions and are in conflict with\" earlier studies. ", "A 2013 study examining the health of bumble bee colonies placed near crops treated with neonicotinoids were inconclusive due to weather and insufficient data, underlining the need to conduct further field studies that complement laboratory studies. Some cite this study as evidence against the need to impose restrictions on the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, while others criticize some of the study's published sources and research methodologies."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
