EERE works with industry, academia, national laboratories, and others to support research and development (R&D). EERE also works with state and local governments to assist in technology implementation and deployment. EERE supports nearly a dozen offices and programs including vehicle technologies, solar energy, advanced manufacturing, and weatherization and intergovernmental programs, among others.", "Funding for EERE is provided in the annual Energy and Water Development (E&W) Appropriations bill. At issue for the 115th Congress is the level of EERE appropriations and which activities EERE should support, including whether to continue support for specific initiatives and programs. On May 23, 2017, the Trump Administration submitted the budget proposal for FY2018. The FY2018 budget request for DOE is $28.2 billion of which about 2% is for EERE. The budget request for EERE is $636.1 million, a decrease of $1.5 billion, or nearly 70%, from the FY2017 enacted level of approximately $2.1 billion. The proposed reduction, if enacted, would affect all offices within EERE.", "For FY2018, the bulk of the EERE request is allocated to three areas: 25% for energy efficiency programs, 21% for renewable energy programs, and about 29% for sustainable transportation programs. The request estimates that two-thirds of the current portfolio of 2,500 multi-year projects (e.g., early-stage R&D projects) would remain active in FY2018. DOE anticipates that eliminating one-third of these projects would result in a reduction of approximately 30% in EERE-funded full-time equivalent staff. The President's request would include two specific program eliminations: the Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program, which received FY2017 appropriations of $225.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. The President's request for EERE emphasizes early-stage R&D, limited validation testing and simulation to inform R&D, and analysis to support regulatory activities. The DOE budget justification states that funding for EERE would focus on \"early-stage R&D, where the Federal role is critically important, and reflects an increased reliance on the private sector to fund later-stage research, development, and commercialization of energy technologies.\"", "There are several bills before Congress that recommend FY2018 appropriations for EERE.
