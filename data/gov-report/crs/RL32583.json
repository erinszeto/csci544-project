Between 1999 and 2003, gasoline consumption grew by 500,000barrels per day, accounting for all of the increase in petroleum consumption during that period. While 2004 may see growth slow down because of high prices, during the first seven months of theyear gasoline demand was up by another 1.9%.", "The fact that gasoline supply has not kept up with demand has been reflected in pump pricesthat have risen from $1.50 at the start of 2004 to as high as $2.06 per gallon in late May. Whensupply and demand become out of sync with their previous relationship, prices change to establisha new balance. The outcome has been a period of volatile gasoline prices, which have set recordhighs that have become a focal point for consumers and policy makers, and raised concerns abouttheir impact on the economy.", "Gasoline is supplied both by U.S. and foreign refiners. Domestic producers' capacity islimited. As a result, nearly 1 million barrels per day of gasoline and its components are imported.Imported blending components -- especially those used in ethanol-blended fuel -- are increasinglyimportant to total U.S. supply. Without this supplemental supply, gasoline would be less availableand prices likely higher.", "Imports most recently have come from Canada and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which supplyone-third of the off-shore supply. Argentina, the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom, andVenezuela provide another third. Imports peaked in March 2004, took a dip, and reached new highsin July. Increased imports may have contributed to pump prices backing off their May highs in latesummer.", "New gasoline blending components from Venezuela and the rehabilitation of a refinery inAruba may also contribute to enhanced gasoline component supply later this year. Gasolinecomponent availability -- which has increased during 2004 -- gives domestic refiners an addedmeasure of flexibility in using their capacity, and contributes to enhanced supplies of fuels neededto meet demand for ethanol-based gasoline and other specialized regional blends.", "Potential policy concerns raised by growing reliance on gasoline imports include theavailability of foreign supplies that meet U.S. specifications, whether incremental foreign suppliescan be provided quickly enough to meet shifting demand, and the delivered price of importedgasoline.", "Two legislative efforts were debated in the House regarding gasoline supply issues during2004. One, H.R. 4517 , has passed the House but not been taken up in the Senate. Itwould provide for easier permitting for refinery capacity expansion.

In April 2004, EPA designatedareas in a total of 32 states and the District as nonattainment areas for a new ozone standard to bephased-in between 2007 and 2021 (2) . RFG has several requirements, including the mandate that itcontain sufficient oxygenates to meet a minimum oxygen requirement of 2% by weight. Theoxygenate often added is either the chemical MTBE (now banned in several states) or ethanol. RFG's peak usage is during summer months, when it comprises about 29% of nationaldemand.", "Gasoline components are imported with increasing frequency, amounting to50% of imports during 2004. Gasoline is a \"cocktail\" of hydrocarbons blended at refineries and fuelterminals. Increasingly, cocktail ingredients are available from foreign refiners, and they are beingimported to expand U.S. refinery output. Since finished gasoline is a blended product, refiners cansupplement short capacity by buying foreign components and blending them here in such a way thatU.S. specifications are met.", "As a result of the Clean Air Act requirements and state mandates, many different types ofgasoline are sold in the United States. In addition to conventional and RFG, there is oxygenated fuel(higher oxygen content than RFG), low volatility conventional gasoline, and a variety of state andlocal blends. These \"boutique fuels\" include ethanol blends, California Cleaner-Burning Gasoline(also used in Nevada and Arizona) and a number of other local formulations.", "As noted above, the trend toward ethanol blends may continue because it is the oxygenateused to replace the additive MTBE. Ethanol blends cannot be stored or transported by pipeline,because ethanol and gasoline do not mix well and can separate. The blend must be mixed near thepoint of final consumption.", "Imported components of the gasoline \"cocktail\" fit into the increasingly common practiceof local blending for local markets, in that \"cocktail\" components often come from multiple sourcesand are assembled at terminals and other gasoline distribution points. For refiners, blending gasolinefrom component parts represents a small incremental supply bonus, since they can purchaseopportunistically those components that might be available on world markets, and manufacture theremainder in their own facilities. In total, U.S. refiners do not have the capacity to make all thegasoline sold in this country, but they often do have substantial flexibility -- within overall capacityconstraints -- to make hard-to-import components tailored to U.S. specifications which foreignrefiners cannot easily provide.", "The trend shown in Figure 2 suggests that U.S. refiners are able to produce during an averagemonth a bit more than 8.0 mbd, while demand is trending just under 9.0 mbd this year.

But blending components held in inventory rose from 54 millionbarrels, or 26% of inventory, to 72 million barrels, or 35% of total inventory.

In its Staff White Paper on BoutiqueFuels, (5) the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) contends that the refining and distribution system works well under normaloperating conditions. But the agency notes that when the entire fuel market is stressed, the placeswhere supply shortfalls and volatile prices tend to show up first and be most acute involvegeographically isolated fuel programs.", "Many state boutique programs are of this nature, and have fewer suppliers and fewertransport options. In situations where there is a transportation failure, a supply shortfall of gasolinecomponents, or some combination of these and possibly other factors, prices can become veryvolatile as small supply glitches impact an isolated local market disproportionately. There appear tohave been few such instances, but some have taken place.", "The experience in the Chicago metro area during the spring of 2000 is one example of howa confluence of circumstances can play out. As the Chicago metropolitan area transitioned toethanol-blended gasoline in the late spring of 2000, a key pipeline supplying gasoline from the GulfCoast refining area failed. The supply shortfall from traditional refiners -- coupled with the initialdifficulty in making reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending in local refineries --combined to create a tight regional supply situation, which saw pump prices nearly double in Mayand June. (6) But by July,supply from other sources and restoration of pipeline flow began to return prices to accustomedlevels. The price spike, while only a few months in duration, was substantial, and is often pointedto as a \"worst case\" situation of how a convergence of mishaps can lead to a substantial disruptionin a market delineated by boutique fuel requirements.", "EPA notes that problems of this type to date have been limited in terms of geographical scopeand duration. It appears that the fuel supply system can support the current structure of fuelstandards, absent some set of untoward circumstances. Most stakeholders, EPA contends, (7) are instead concerned with theproliferation of boutique fuels into the future and would like to see limits on new boutique fuelrequirements. ", "Figure 4.

PDVSA has planned to export 1 million barrels per month of thishigh-priced component, called RBOB, (8) starting with test cargoes in June. Platts Oilgram Price Report (9) noted that 720,000barrelswere exported in July, and the extra barrels in the U.S. market have provided extra competition forcomparable cargoes from Europe, where distances and shipping costs are greater. This illustrates thesignificance of the supply of foreign gasoline components, and how they can impact U.S. gasolineprices.", "It is likely that high U.S. prices for gasoline and its significant components will continue toattract foreign refiners' attention, perhaps leading them to seek permanent market share.

Factors such as the cost and timelinessof incremental supply, physical reliability, and meeting U.S. product specifications can affect priceand supply at the gas pump.", "Shipping cost may be an additional issue. Gasoline and many other refined products needto be protected from contamination from other oils. As a result, they must be shipped in cleanvessels. These product carriers are usually much smaller than crude carriers, and -- not benefittingfrom economies of large scale -- have higher unit costs. In addition, the clean tanker market isinfluenced by spot charter rates for vessels, making product shipping costs often higher and morevolatile than crude oil. It is cheaper to ship crude to a local refinery than to transport products anequivalent distance.

The higher import costs impact the last units of gasoline supply, providing a price umbrellafor domestic refiners, whose pricing -- like all industrial pricing -- is linked to the cost of the lastincrements of the good involved. As long as gasoline is imported to meet a sizeable imbalancebetween domestic supply and demand, this situation offers a likelihood of prices which are abovethe cost of domestic manufacture. This assumes that new domestic refining capacity to replaceimports could produce U.S.-spec gasoline at costs below those of foreign refiners plus producttransport tariffs to the United States. ", "In addition to price-related considerations, the speed of supply response to price signals fromU.S. gasoline markets seems less than it might be from a refiner located here. It may well be thatdistance mutes price signals related to an increase in demand, for example, and refiners abroad maybe slow to receive the message that U.S. consumers desire more gasoline and are currently payingprices which would justify a foreign refiner's manufacturing of U.S. specification fuel. Even if theforeign refiners' response to U.S. prices were instantaneous, it could take as long as a month -- insome cases more -- for the physical supply to arrive here.", "Manufacturing fuel for the U.S. market may be another source of delayed response to U.S.market signals.

For example, with regard to the refining bill, opponents express concern that such ameasure would override state clean air programs.

Encouraging growth in domestic refinery capacityimplies a judgment that it is advantageous to have that capacity in the United States, in contrast tooffshore, even if offshore is relatively nearby. As noted above, domestic production could reducetransportation costs and provide quicker supply response to unanticipated changes in demand. Thiscould shorten the duration of a potentially disruptive price spike resulting from a gasoline supplyshortfall.", "Refinery proposals under current debate do not address other issues impacting refineryprojects, such as an historic lack of profitability in this industry segment (12) . It may well be that thecurrent refining situation -- with imports holding a \"price umbrella\" over domestic gasolineproduction -- may be a profitable situation for many refiners, many of whom are realizing recordearnings in the first and second quarters of 2004. While this year's earnings may be high, one year'sexperience does not outweigh years of low profits. While a basic change in refiner profitability mightbe suggested, it is too soon for many firms to consider making significant investments in long-livedcapital equipment, whose cost is recouped over many years.", "Were the prospects for long-term profitability in the refining industry to improve by virtueof a sustainable recovery in refining margins, it is likely that additional investment in added capacitywould be seen.
