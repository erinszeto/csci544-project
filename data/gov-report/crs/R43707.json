To address this complexity, the Elder Justice Act was enacted on March 23, 2010 as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended). The act attempts to provide a coordinated federal response by emphasizing various public health and social service approaches to the prevention, detection, and treatment of elder abuse. The Elder Justice Act also represents Congress's first attempt at comprehensive legislation to address abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly at the federal level.", "To date, most activities and programs authorized under the Elder Justice Act have not received federal funding through the annual appropriations process. For the first time, Congress appropriated $4 million for a new Elder Justice Initiative in FY2015 and $8 million in FY2016. However, the authorizations of appropriations for most provisions under the act expired on September 30, 2014. Despite the lack of discretionary appropriations prior to FY2015, some elder justice activities have received funding from mandatory funding appropriated through the ACA Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). As a result of this limited federal funding, the federal government has not substantially developed and expanded its role in addressing the prevention, detection, and treatment of elder abuse.", "For FY2012, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) transferred $6.0 million to the Administration for Community Living (ACL) from the PPHF for new grants to states and tribes to test elder abuse prevention strategies. Funded projects included using forensic accountants to prevent elder financial exploitation, increasing medication adherence to prevent elder self-neglect, and developing screening tools to identify elder abuse. For FY2013, $2.0 million was transferred to ACL from the PPHF for elder justice activities, which funded development of the National Adult Protective Services Data Reporting System Project. No PPHF funds were transferred to ACL for elder justice activities for FY2014 or subsequent fiscal years.", "For FY2017, the President's budget request included $10.0 million in discretionary funding for Elder Justice/Adult Protective Services (APS) that would be used to fund APS, research, and evaluation activities. The 2017 budget request did not specify an intended transfer of funding from the PPHF for elder justice activities. For FY2017, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10.0 million for the Elder Justice Initiative in its FY2017 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $8.0 million in its FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill. Neither House nor Senate floor consideration of the bill occurred in the 114th Congress. Since the start of the fiscal year (October 1, 2016), funding for LHHS programs and activities has been provided by two continuing resolutions (CR; P.L. 114-223 and P.L. 114-254).

While the extent of such abuse is largely unknown, there is some indication that the problem is serious and that many incidents of abuse are never reported. A 2010 study of the extent of elder abuse in the United States found that 11% of individuals ages 60 and older who reside in the community reported some type of abuse in the past year. Another 2008 study found that 9% of community-residing older adults ages 57 to 85 reported verbal mistreatment; 3.5% reported financial mistreatment; and 0.2% reported physical mistreatment by a family member in the past year. ", "Yet, studies such as these are likely to underestimate the full extent of elder abuse as they do not include all categories of abuse, exclude individuals who reside in institutional settings such as nursing facilities, and generally exclude individuals with significant cognitive impairment (for more information see text box \"What is Elder Abuse?\"). In addition, incidents of elder abuse may go unreported as older individuals can be reluctant to report abuse by an individual they also rely upon for their personal care and well-being. Moreover, a number of studies have associated physical and mental health problems among victims of elder abuse as well as inadequate social supports that, if present, may assist individuals in prevention, detection, and treatment.", "Elder abuse is a complex issue that often requires a multifaceted policy response which combines public health initiatives, social services programs, and criminal law enforcement for abusive behavior.

It also represents Congress's first attempt at comprehensive legislation to address abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly at the federal level. Enactment of the Elder Justice Act places the issue of elder abuse on par with similar legislation Congress has enacted with respect to child abuse and neglect, under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and domestic violence, under the Violence Against Women Act.", "Similar to other newly authorized grant programs under the ACA, implementation of new grants and activities under the Elder Justice Act has been hampered by the lack of federal discretionary spending for authorized activities, which is subject to the annual appropriations process. Agency implementation of some elder justice programs and activities has moved forward with limited funding. However, a coordinated federal response to the issue as envisioned by the Elder Justice Act has been challenging; in part due to actions Congress has taken since FY2010 to curb federal discretionary spending. ", "The extent of elder abuse has the potential to grow in scope as the older population continues to increase in size, and individuals live longer post-retirement. In 2015, an estimated 14.9% of the total U.S. population was age 65 and older; more than one in every seven Americans. By 2030, the Census projects that one in every five, or 20.6% of the U.S. population, will be age 65 or older. Thus, Congress will likely have a continued interest in shaping the federal role and response to elder abuse going forward.

After that, Elder Justice Act legislation was re-introduced in subsequent Congresses with Senate Finance Committee action on bills in the 108 th , 109 th , and 110 th Congresses. In the 111 th Congress, Senator Orrin Hatch introduced the Elder Justice Act of 2009 ( S. 795 ) which addressed public health and social services approaches to the issue. A separate bill ( H.R. 2006 ) was introduced in the House by Representative Peter T. King, which, in addition to the public health and social services provisions also included criminal justice provisions. The Senate bill ( S. 795 ) was incorporated into the Senate Finance Committee's health reform bill ( S. 1796 ) and subsequently adopted in the Senate health reform bill ( H.R. 3590 ) which became the ACA ( P.L. 111-148 ). ", "It is important to note that the elder justice provisions enacted under the ACA did not achieve the multidisciplinary approach (public health, social services, and criminal justice) fully envisioned in earlier versions of introduced legislation. Enactment of the Elder Justice Act under the ACA contains provisions that address certain public health and social services approaches to prevention, detection, and treatment of elder abuse primarily under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authorities and administration. It does not include a criminal justice response which would address the prevention, detection, and prosecution of elder abuse crimes under various Department of Justice (DOJ) authorities and administration. Earlier versions of the Elder Justice Act included such a multidisciplinary approach that incorporated criminal justice provisions. With enactment of the Elder Justice Act under the ACA, criminal justice provisions have been subsequently introduced as separate stand-alone legislation. In the 114 th Congress, these bills included S. 3270 , the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act; S. 2747 / H.R. 5018 , the Elder Protection and Abuse Prevention Act; S. 1663 , the Robert Matava Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2015; and H.R. 4963 the Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2016. In addition, one bill was introduced to reauthorize the Elder Justice Act in the 114 th Congress.

The OAA first called attention to the importance of federal leadership in the area of elder justice. Under the OAA, the AOA has primary responsibility for federal leadership in carrying out elder justice activities. However, similar to EJA, funding under the OAA for such activities has also been limited. According to GAO, the Elder Justice Act \"reaffirmed the importance of federal leadership of elder justice activities and provides a vehicle for establishing and implementing national priorities in this area.\" While the Elder Justice Coordinating Committee has appointed members and convened several times, an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation tasked to put forth a plan to develop the field of elder abuse has yet to be established. Further federal efforts to develop objectives, priorities, policy, and a long-term planning on these issues may be limited by available funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elder Abuse Data Collection", "paragraphs": ["Federal efforts to collect data on elder abuse at the national level are compounded by variation in state statutory definitions of elder abuse that make it difficult to identify actions that constitute elder abuse, and by the absence of a uniform reporting system across states. A 2011 GAO report recommended the HHS Secretary conduct a pilot study to collect, compile, and disseminate APS administrative data. To this end, ACL has utilized Elder Justice Act funding to design, develop, and pilot test the National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System (NAMRS). Policymakers may have a continued interest in this initiative and further funding efforts to expand data collection activities to all states based on findings and recommendations from the administration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elder Abuse Prevention", "paragraphs": ["According to ACL, \"most communities do not have comprehensive elder abuse prevention efforts that engage a broad set of individuals and institutions that can play a role in combating abuse, such as health professionals, law enforcement and legal services agencies, social workers, clergy, and community organizations.\" To implement the Elder Justice Act, the ACL funded several grants to states and tribal organizations that test interventions designed to prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. These multidisciplinary models draw on prevention strategies from other family violence prevention programs and can assist in developing the evidence base for more widespread dissemination. ACL has invested in an evaluation of such grants. Based on findings from research, such initiatives could be disseminated more broadly to other states and entities through federally funded websites such as the National Center for Elder Abuse, federal technical assistance, and further funding opportunities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The Elder Justice Act represents one set of policies that exist in the broader context of domestic social policy to address the complex issue that is elder abuse. That is, as a federal legislative response, the Elder Justice Act may best serve as a catalyst for further federal coordination and action that can bring about greater public awareness and attention to the needs of a growing, and potentially vulnerable, aging population. According to GAO, the Elder Justice Act \"provides a vehicle for setting national priorities and establishing a comprehensive, multidisciplinary elder justice system in this country.\" Such a response touches on a range of domestic policy programs and issues that are not specific to one congressional committee's jurisdiction or area of expertise. Furthermore, congressional oversight into federal administration, implementation, and related activities must rely on different committees of jurisdiction as well as the experience of select committees such as the Senate Special Committee on Aging. According to subject matter experts, elder abuse is not an easy problem to address as it is", "a complex cluster of distinct but related phenomena involving health, legal, social service, financial, public safety, aging, disability, protective services, and victim services, aging services, policy, research, education, and human rights issues. It therefore requires a coordinated multidisciplinary, multi-agency, and multi-system response.", "Achieving such a response will likely require congressional interest in overseeing the range of elder justice programs and activities that currently exist across federal agencies. In addition, further research may assist policymakers to address areas where service delivery is either fragmented or lacks sufficient resources, or both. According to stakeholders, there are numerous challenges in responding to elder abuse, including lack of coordination, data, and resources. Addressing these challenges could assist in developing an informed strategic and coordinated federal response.", "Appendix A.
