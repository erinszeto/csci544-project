Examples include the Florida Everglades, San Francisco Bay-Sacramento/San Joaquin River Delta, and the Chesapeake Bay, among others. The Florida Everglades is especially prominent because of its inclusion of Everglades National Park and because human impacts in and around the Park have caused a substantial erosion of the balance and diversity of the original ecosystem. Government and private sector efforts to mitigate the effects of large-scale human change in the broader Everglades ecosystem are complex and sometimes contradictory undertakings. Complexities and conflicts arise because of definitions and goals; because of uncertainty about achieving desirable goals; because of costs; and because of likely tradeoffs with established economic and business activities. The restoration initiative in the South Florida ecosystem (which includes the Everglades) is a recent intergovernmental effort that attempts to address the ecological and socio-economic factors involved with ecosystem restoration. An examination of what has been effective and what has been less effective in ecosystem restoration efforts in the Florida Everglades may give insights on how to proceed in the implementation of other restoration projects.", "After being reduced to half its original size by flood control projects, agriculture, and urban development, the Florida Everglades is now targeted for a large restoration effort by an unusual partnership among federal, state, tribal and local stakeholders. A major step in this restoration effort was the authorization of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000 (P.L. 106-541). The objective of CERP is to restore the quantity, quality, distribution and timing of water supplies to natural areas without disrupting existing sources of water for agricultural and human needs.", "There are several policy components within CERP that may be applicable to other ecosystem restoration efforts. They include multi-agency committees for coordination, programmatic regulations for project implementation, adaptive assessment and monitoring, assurances for water allocation, and funding. This report provides a description of each policy component as well as an analysis of its potential benefits and disadvantages in the restoration process. A proposed version of programmatic regulations is cited throughout this report. Programmatic regulations are expected to provide guidelines for project implementation, monitoring, adaptive management, and water allocation for restoration activities provided by CERP. A proposed version of the programmatic regulations was published in the Federal Register in August 2002; the final version is expected in December 2002.

Restoration efforts have originated, in part, from controversies surrounding water supply and quality, federal laws (i.e., laws that protect endangered species or regulate water quality, and others), sport and commercial fishing, and environmental degradation. Ecosystem restoration initiatives have typically been accompanied with high expectations and publicity. Funding for these initiatives can amount to billions of dollars for each, and the duration of these initiatives can be 25 years or more. For example, in the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento/San Joaquin River Deltas (California Bay-Delta) a restoration program known as CALFED is expected to cost more than $7.8 billion, with more than $2.4 billion expected from the federal government, just for the first stage (7 years) of a 30-year restoration effort. Issues such as the coordination of multi-agency task forces, public participation, allocation of ecosystem resources (e.g., water supplies), and the science behind restoration projects have all been debated in ecosystem restoration efforts. Perhaps the greatest issue in ecosystem restoration efforts is that restoration can create \"losers.\" People may lose (or perceive loss of) property, income, and potential income among other things, as a result of restoration activities. In some cases, the threat of stakeholder loss has resulted in controversies or even barriers to restoration work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Definition", "paragraphs": ["Ecosystem restoration is a process or activity that initiates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity, and sustainability. Ecosystem restoration implies the recognition of impairment or disturbance to an ecosystem to the extent that remediation is necessary. In most cases, ecosystems that require restoration have been degraded, destroyed, or transformed directly or indirectly by human activities. For example, an ecosystem can deteriorate from polluted waterways, endangered species, transformed landscapes (e.g., forests to agricultural fields), and human development (e.g., urban areas, roads, or housing).", "Ecosystem restoration attempts to reverse the deterioration of an ecosystem, and to some extent, return it towards its \"pre-disturbed\" or Pre-Columbian state. Ecosystem restoration does not necessarily mean the restoration of an ecosystem to its original state. Rather, ecosystem restoration means human management that allows desirable uses without the negative impacts being incurred under the pre-restoration regime. Once an ecosystem is recovering under a desired trajectory, human management is important. Management may be required to counteract invasive species, the impact of human activities, climate change, and other unforeseeable events.", "One primary unknown of ecological restoration is the actual process of how to do it. Studying and monitoring current restoration initiatives and recording the lessons from these initiatives can provide insights for restoration. Policy makers creating or changing ecosystem restoration legislation may benefit from an understanding of the positive and negative aspects of previous ecosystem restoration projects. In this paper, key policy components of the ecosystem restoration effort in the South Florida ecosystem, which includes the Everglades, are examined to provide potential lessons for other ecosystem restoration efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government Role", "paragraphs": ["Ecosystem restoration efforts pose several challenges for governance. In most cases, large-scale ecosystem restoration initiatives cross political boundaries, communities, and agency jurisdictions. Generally several stakeholders, ranging from environmentalists to users to government agencies, have an interest in restoration and its benefits. Restoration efforts can result in changes to farming practices and urban development; alterations in water supplies and access to other natural resources (e.g., minerals and timber); and laws that create programs to mitigate environmental damage and improve infrastructure. Because of the diverse interest in restoration, past restoration efforts have often been fragmented in dealing with specific problems or consequences of ecosystem degradation, instead of working on the root causes affecting the entire ecosystem. The federal government has a special role in coordinating multi-jurisdictional ecosystem restoration efforts in large part because of its involvement in altering natural systems (e.g., flood control in the Everglades and water transfers to the Central Valley in California). The federal government also must respond to legal obligations under laws that protect endangered species, and water quality. Additionally, it has the capacity to create multi-agency task forces, employ the expertise of multiple federal agencies (e.g., Fish and Wildlife Service with respect to endangered species or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for construction), and provide funds for restoration projects.", "Congress plays a key role in large-scale ecosystem restoration efforts. Congress is generally responsible for authorizing federal agency involvement in restoration efforts and establishing guidelines for managing and implementing restoration projects. In some cases, such as in the Everglades, Congress has a role in authorizing individual restoration projects and their guidelines for implementation and management. Ecosystem restoration efforts are generally based on improving or rehabilitating one or more ecosystem services (e.g., water supply or habitat recovery for plant and animal populations). Congress can create guidelines for allocating ecosystem services (e.g., regulating water supplies for farmers and the environment), or in some cases, Congress may ensure the delivery of ecosystem services through legislative provisions (e.g., water supply assurances for farmers). Lastly, Congress is responsible for authorizing and appropriating federal funds for ecosystem restoration."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ecosystem Restoration Efforts in South Florida", "paragraphs": ["After nearly 40 years of individual environmental restoration projects in South Florida, the federal government along with state, local, and tribal entities has begun a collaborative effort to restore the entire South Florida ecosystem.

Title VI of WRDA 2000 outlines the coordination among various stakeholders involved in the restoration process, identifies funding responsibilities, and authorizes the creation of programmatic regulations, which will detail the implementation process of restoration projects. Title VI of WRDA 2000 also contains several policy functions intended to facilitate inter-agency coordination, satisfy stakeholder demands, and ensure the goal of ecosystem restoration. In some cases these policy functions are complex and have potential drawbacks, yet in other cases, these functions have potential benefits and could be used as policy models for other ecosystem restoration projects.", "The restoration of the Everglades represents a recent effort to deal with the myriad of issues related to ecosystem restoration. Described as the largest environmental project in American history, the restoration effort in the South Florida ecosystem is expected to cost more than $14 billion and last 30 years. Restoration efforts in South Florida have several attributes similar to restoration elsewhere: multiple stakeholders are involved, including the federal, state, and local governments; water supply and distribution is a central issue; the effort is considered a solution to standing controversies or legal obligations; and environmental restoration is promoted as the main goal. Experiences in restoration efforts in South Florida might be viewed as a \"test case\" for future restoration projects.

The South Florida ecosystem covers 18,000 square miles and consists of a network of sub-tropical wetland landscapes, which once stretched from Orlando to Florida Bay, approximately 200 miles (see Figure 1 ). It is also home to the Everglades, which are regarded as one of the world's most valuable and unique wetlands. The Everglades are located in the southern portion of the South Florida ecosystem that consists of disjointed freshwater marshes between the southern tip of Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Bay.", "An important ecological process in the South Florida ecosystem is the movement of freshwater from Lake Okeechobee south to the Florida Bay in a moving \"sheet\" that replenishes marshlands and swamps. This shallow sheet of water moved across the Everglades a few inches per second and in addition to rainfall was responsible for recharging the Biscayne Aquifer and nourishing plant and animal life. Human development and manipulation of water flows have disrupted the natural flow of this sheet of water.", "Partly in response to flooding and the need for agricultural lands, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) was asked by Congress to divert water in the Everglades. Specifically, water flow in the Everglades was altered to control flooding, to open land for agriculture, and to provide water supplies for urban areas. The cornerstone of this effort was the Flood Control Project Act of 1948. This project initiated several years of construction by the Corps and the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District to create nearly 1000 miles of canals, 720 miles of levees, and over 200 water control structures (e.g., dikes, dams and pumping stations). In addition, nearly 700,000 acres of land were drained and designated for agricultural use in what is now called the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). Another 900,000 acres were used to construct five Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), which were designed to recharge well fields, prevent flooding and provide habitat for plant and animal life.", "The man-made water distribution system created in South Florida led to environmental degradation. This system reduced water flow to the Everglades by nearly two-thirds by channelizing water to agricultural and urban areas, and the Atlantic Ocean. The alteration of water flow to the Everglades is widely believed to have degraded the environment. For example, studies have shown that the wading bird population has declined by 90% since alterations to the South Florida ecosystem were implemented. Further, there are more than 69 species in South Florida, including the loggerhead turtle, Florida panther, and wood stork, which are listed as endangered or threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; P.L. 93-205 , as amended). The Everglades also suffer from mercury contamination, invasive plants, and high levels of phosphorous."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restoration Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Restoration activities in South Florida progressed from a series of individual activities by various state and federal agencies to a coordinated multi-stakeholder effort in the late 1990s.", "Restoration efforts in the South Florida ecosystem were initiated by state and federal programs before the authorization of CERP in WRDA 2000. For example, Florida passed laws that authorized the clean-up of its bays, estuaries, lakes and rivers, and authorized the protection of certain wetlands in the public interest. Restoration projects that involved construction and regulation of hydrology in the South Florida ecosystem began in 1992 with a partnership between the state and the Corps to restore natural water flow through the Kissimmee River and its floodplain. Later, in 1994, the state authorized other construction and regulation projects to restore portions of the South Florida ecosystem.", "Federal involvement in restoring the South Florida ecosystem originated with projects aimed at restoring specific waterways or wetlands. One impetus for federal involvement began in 1989 when the federal government sued the State of Florida for not enforcing state water quality standards for agricultural run-off entering Everglades National Park. This lawsuit resulted in a pledge that created a federal and state partnership with local agriculture to improve water quality, increase water quantity, and construct artificial wetlands to filter pollutants from agricultural run-off. It also led to an understanding that improving water quality in the Everglades was an ecosystem problem that crossed property boundaries and required the cooperation of various stakeholders. To coordinate this effort to restore water quality in South Florida, a commission (termed the Working Group) consisting of representatives from various federal and state agencies was created.", "The Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (WRDA 1996; P.L. 104-303 ; 33 U.S.C. 2201-2330) changed the Working Group into a task force by expanding its membership to include state, local and tribal representatives. WRDA 1996 also initiated further federal involvement in restoration of the South Florida ecosystem by directing the Corps to develop a comprehensive plan (known as the Restudy) for restoring, protecting, and preserving the South Florida ecosystem. The choice to involve the Corps in restoration efforts stemmed from the realization that restoration problems in South Florida had hydrological solutions. Since the Corps was responsible for constructing and operating the existing water distribution and supply infrastructure and had expertise in hydrological projects, it was deemed the best agency to lead the restoration process.", "The Restudy represented the first attempt to address environmental restoration in South Florida in a multi-agency, ecosystem-level framework. Congress authorized the implementation of a portion of the Restudy in Title VI of WRDA 2000. This portion was entitled the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) and focused on restoring the natural hydrological functions and water quality, while maintaining water supplies for natural, agricultural, and urban needs. CERP contains 68 components that are expected to be implemented over a 35-year span. CERP seeks to vastly increase the storage capacity and water supply for the natural system, as well as for agricultural and urban needs. Increased water flow to natural areas as a result of CERP is also expected to improve the environment by restoring and increasing habitat for native flora and fauna."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parties Involved in the Restoration Effort", "paragraphs": ["One of the advancements in restoration planning and implementation is the understanding that all stakeholders (e.g., environmentalists; farmers) must be involved and committed to sustain restoration efforts.

Several stakeholders are involved in the restoration effort in South Florida, including environmentalists, agriculturalists, and federal, state, tribal and local governments.

Further, if federal laws are applicable within an ecosystem (e.g., endangered species and water quality), the federal government and certain agencies usually become involved. The federal role in the Everglades restoration effort is defined in CERP as restoring and preserving the South Florida ecosystem without sacrificing existing ecosystem services (e.g., water supplies) to agricultural and urban areas. The federal government is also responsible for providing 50% of the funding for restoration activities authorized by CERP.

SFWMD is one of five water management districts that have control over regional water allocation, supply, and quality. This level of authority over water supplies is high compared to water districts in most states, and may be one of the reasons why SFWMD was selected as the primary non-federal partner in restoration efforts. Under CERP, and with agreements made with the Corps, the SFWMD is expected to maintain its role of reserving and allocating water to natural, agricultural, and urban areas. SFWMD is also expected to assist in the implementation, construction, management, and monitoring of restoration projects.

Both tribes raise crops and livestock on their land and depend on flood protection for their well-being. The Miccosukee tribe supports the restoration effort in the Everglades, yet believes that the restoration process has been slow and should concentrate on improving water quality and interagency cooperation, and in taking a system-wide approach. Furthermore, some representatives from the Miccosukee tribe have emphasized that equal priority should be given to federal and tribal lands for restoration activities, and that flood protection should be extended to all inhabited lands. The Seminole tribe also supports restoration efforts, emphasizing that agricultural, human, and natural water needs should receive equal priority, and that the decision-making authority for water allocation should emphasize local participation. In 2000, the Corps signed a contract with the Seminole Tribe of Florida to construct the Big Cypress Reservation Water Conservation Plan.
