Complicating this issue further are GI protections afforded to registered products in third country markets.

In the United States, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers GI protections, along with labeling requirements for wine, malt beverages, beer, and distilled spirits under the jurisdiction of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. In the EU, a series of regulations governing GIs was initiated in the early 1990s covering agricultural and food products, wine, and spirits.

In the United States, GIs are generally treated as a subset of trademarks, whereas the EU protects GIs through a series of established \"quality schemes.\" GIs are also protected by various multilateral trade agreements.", "GIs are protected by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which sets binding minimum standards for IP protection that are enforceable by the WTO's dispute settlement procedure. Under TRIPS, WTO members have a mandatory responsibility to recognize and protect GIs as intellectual property. The United States and each of the EU countries are signatories of TRIPS and subject to its rights and obligations. Accordingly, under TRIPS, the United States has committed to providing a minimum standard of protection for GIs (i.e., protecting GI products to avoid misleading the public and prevent unfair competition) and an \"enhanced level of protection\" to wines and spirits that carry a geographical indication, subject to certain exceptions.

", "TRIPS defines GIs as \"indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a Member, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characterist ic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin\" (Article 22(1)). Accordingly, a product's quality, reputation, or other characteristics can be determined by where it comes from, and GIs are place names (or in some countries words associated with a place) used to identify products that come from these places and have these characteristics.", "Previously, the United States challenged the EU's GI laws under WTO Dispute Settlement in 1999, alleging discrimination against U.S. GIs and failure to protect U.S. trademarks. A WTO panel ruled that aspects of the EU's GI laws were inconsistent with TRIPS, resulting in changes to the EU program.", "TRIPS builds on treaties administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). WIPO is a specialized agency in the U.N. system with the mission to \"lead the development of a balanced and effective international intellectual property (IP) system.\" WIPO has 188 member states, including the United States and each of the EU countries. WIPO defines GIs as \"a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin.\" To function as a GI, \"a sign must identify a product as originating in a given place,\" \"the qualities, characteristics or reputation of the product should be essentially due to the place of origin,\" and there must be \"a clear link between the product and its original place of production.\" ", "WIPO also oversees the \"International Register of Appellations of Origin\" established in the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration (\"Lisbon Agreement\"). The Lisbon Agreement is among the major IP conferences and ensures for its members the protection against any \"usurpation or imitation, even when used in translation or accompanied by words such as 'kind', 'type' or the like.\" The agreement was adopted in 1958 (later revised in 1967) and entered into force in 1966.

Several EU countries are members, including Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain.", "The agreement's multilateral register (\"Lisbon Register\") covers food products and beverages and related products, as well as non-food products (including Cuban cigars). The register covers appellations of origin (AO) only, which comprise a category of GIs. AOs refer to \"geographical denomination of a country, region or locality which serves to designate a product originating therein, the quality or characteristics of which are due exclusively or essentially to the geographical environment, including natural and human factors.\" Both AOs and GIs require a qualitative link between the product and its place of origin, but AO designations generally result \"exclusively or essentially to the geographical environment,\" while for GIs a single criterion attributable to geographic origin may be sufficient to qualify. As of May 2016 the registry contained more than 1,000 products. ", "More recent developments have raised U.S. concerns about the possible expansion of GI restrictions promoted by the EU. Specifically, the so-called Geneva Act under the Lisbon Agreement would allow for the international registration of GIs and could allow the EU (as well as other countries in Africa and the Americas) to place further limits on the use of GIs and product names linked to geographic regions. The United States opposes expansion of the agreement given ongoing opposition to the GI registration of cheese names that the United States argues to be generic or common names. Congressional trade and judiciary committee leaders expressed disappointment that all WIPO members were not allowed \"meaningful participation\" in the negotiation process and that the Geneva Act was adopted despite the \"objection of multiple WIPO members.\" Some private stakeholders also expressed concerns about the process. U.S. interests may now be focused on ensuring that any expansion of the Lisbon Agreement does not allow the agreement's members to place further limits on the ability of trademark owners and others to use, in foreign markets, names linked to geographic regions that the United States argues are generic.

Others note that the GI debate in the T-TIP threatens U.S. commercial interests by blocking current and future U.S. exports of agricultural products (particularly cheese exports), discriminating against U.S. branded products that have greatly expanded the visibility and demand for certain GI products, and creating inconsistency in EU lists of generic terms\u2014for example, through the inclusion of new and expanded protected names, such as feta.", "Many U.S. food producers are also members of the Consortium for Common Food Names (CCFN), along with producers in other countries including Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Costa Rica. This group aims to protect the right to use common food names and protect legitimate food-related GIs. Among the U.S. agricultural groups that are supporting these efforts are the Wine Institute, the American Farm Bureau Federation, Agri-Mark, the International Dairy Foods Association, the American Cheese Society, the American Meat Institute, the Northwest Horticultural Council, and the Wine Institute, as well as some food groups in Central and Latin America.

Specifically, the American Origin Products Association (AOPA) is seeking to protect American Origin Products (AOPs) in the marketplace from fraud and deceptive labeling, increase the value-added for all AOPs as a distinct food category, and create a national system to recognize AOPs through certification, among other goals. This group contends that \"GIs respond to new trends in consumer demand, including the growth in a 'foodie' culture; a consumer-driven interest in wine education; the creation of new specialty meats and cheeses; the search for food with a story and a greater demand for regional products.\" Members include Napa Valley Vintners, California Dried Plum Board, Cuatro Puertas/New Mexico Native Chile Peppers, the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin, the Idaho Potato Commission, the International Maple Syrup Institute, the Kona Coffee Farmers Association, the Maine Lobstermen's Association, Missouri Northern Pecan Growers, and Vermont Maple Sugar Makers.", "This divide is particularly evident in the U.S. wine industry, which had largely considered some of its concerns regarding the use of traditional and semi-generic names, among other related bilateral trade concerns, to have been partly addressed following bilateral negotiations and the existing agreement on wine in the 2006 agreement. The 2006 agreement addressed a range of issues regarding wine production, labeling, and import requirements and was intended to establish predictable conditions for bilateral wine trade. Among the key provisions in the 2006 agreement were measures regarding the U.S. industry's use of 16 \"semi-generic\" names of wine that originate in the EU (including Sherry, Chablis, and Chianti) as well as the use of certain traditional labeling terms (such as Chateau and Vintage). (See the following text box for a full listing of these terms.) The EU also agreed to accept all current U.S. winemaking practices and to establish a process to approve new practices. Despite this agreement, ongoing trade concerns include GIs and \"semi-generic\" terms, market access issues regarding \"traditional\" terms, new winemaking practices and related technical issues, and issues related to \"regulatory coherence\" (especially testing and certification). ", "The Wine Institute and other U.S. agriculture groups have long asserted that the current EU GI registration process lacks transparency, often results in substantial bureaucratic delays, and is perceived as discriminating against non-EU products. However, other members of the U.S. wine industry, such as Napa Valley Vintners, have asserted that the real problem for wine GIs at the international level is the absence of a multilateral register for wines and spirits. In June 2016, Napa Valley wine growers expressed their support to EU officials for expanding and protecting the use of GIs in the United States, and many U.S. growing regions have joined a group called Wine Origins, which calls for strict identification of wine by growing region. There is also a divergence of opinion in the U.S. wine industry regarding GIs and \"semi-generic\" terms and their implications for the domestic wine industry.

For example, regarding GIs, the TPP agreement obligates member countries that recognize GI names to make this process available and transparent to all interested parties within the agreement while also providing a process allowing countries to cancel GI protection. Member countries that recognize GIs are also to adopt a procedure by which interested parties may object to the provision of a GI. Among the reasons the agreement lists for why a country may oppose a GI may include concerns that such protections may cause confusion with a trademark that is recognized within the country. Other provisions apply regarding wine and spirits. As the United States and EU continue to negotiate T-TIP, they are likely considering how GIs have been addressed in the TPP agreement as well as in other negotiated agreements.", "Stakeholders in the United States are also tracking GI issues in other ongoing negotiations between the EU and other third countries, including Canada and Japan. They also worry about the potential implications for global agricultural trade under these preferential agreements between the EU and its trading partners, as well as establishing precedent on certain issues. However, given concerns voiced primarily by the U.S. dairy industry and the seeming reluctance of either party to compromise on GIs, some have speculated whether this issue would need to be addressed at a higher political level than the negotiators within T-TIP."], "subsections": []}]}}
