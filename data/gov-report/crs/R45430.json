A bilateral water treaty from 1944 (the 1944 Water Treaty) and other binational agreements guide how the two governments share the flows of these rivers. The binational International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) administers these agreements. Since 1944, the IBWC has been the principal venue for addressing river-related disputes between the United States and Mexico. The 1944 Water Treaty authorizes the IBWC to develop rules and to issue proposed decisions, called minutes, regarding matters related to the treaty's execution and interpretation.", "Water Delivery Requirements Established in Binational Agreements. The United States' and Mexico's water-delivery obligations derive from multiple treaty sources and vary depending on the body of water. Under the 1944 Water Treaty, the United States is required to provide Mexico with 1.5 million acre-feet (AF) of Colorado River water annually. The 1944 Water Treaty also addresses the nations' respective rights to waters of the Rio Grande downstream of Fort Quitman, TX. It requires Mexico to deliver to the United States an annual minimum of 350,000 AF of water, measured in five-year cycles (i.e., 1.75 million AF over five years). For waters of the Rio Grande upstream of Fort Quitman, a 1906 bilateral convention requires the United States annually to deliver 60,000 AF of water to Mexico.", "Developments in the Colorado River Basin. The United States continues to meet its Colorado River annual delivery requirements to Mexico pursuant to the 1944 Water Treaty. At the forefront of recent IBWC actions on the Colorado River are efforts to cooperatively manage the Colorado River's water and infrastructure to improve water availability during drought and to restore and protect riverine ecosystems. Minute 323 is a set of binational measures in the Colorado River basin that provides for binational cooperative basin water management, including environmental flows to restore riverine habitat. Minute 323 also provides for Mexico to share in cutbacks during shortage conditions in the U.S. portion of the basin. Additionally, Minute 323 designates a \"Mexican Water Reserve\" through which Mexico can delay its water deliveries from the United States and store its delayed deliveries upstream at Lake Mead, thereby increasing the lake's elevation. Lake Mead elevation is the baseline used for determining shortage conditions and associated water delivery cutbacks for the lower Colorado River basin states of Arizona, California, and Nevada. Recent congressional attention to the Colorado River basin has related largely to oversight of Minute 323 implementation and water management during potential shortage conditions.", "Developments in the Rio Grande Basin. On multiple occasions since 1994, Mexico has not met its Rio Grande delivery obligations within the five-year cycle established by the 1944 Water Treaty. For example, Mexico fell 15% below its water-delivery obligations under the 1944 Water Treaty for the five-year cycle from 2010 to 2015. Mexico addressed its deficit by early 2016. The October 2015 to October 2020 cycle is under way. Mexico offset its below-target deliveries for the first year of this cycle with additional deliveries in the second year. IBWC indicates that Mexico delivered less than its 350,000 AF in the third year of the cycle; however, higher deliveries in the second year resulted in Mexico's deliveries being almost at 98% of the three-year cumulative delivery target of 1.05 million AF.", "Some U.S. stakeholders promote the adoption of mechanisms to achieve a water-delivery regime by Mexico that provides more reliability and benefit for U.S. interests in Texas. The IBWC is developing a binational model for water management in the Rio Grande, as part of its broader effort to improve reliability in Mexico's water deliveries.

However, Mexico's higher deliveries in the second year resulted in cumulative deliveries for the first three years of the cycle being almost 98% of the three-year delivery target of 1.05 million AF.", "In recent years, Congress has engaged in Rio Grande water issues by increasing its oversight of water deliveries, principally by requiring periodic reporting by the Department of State. As part of its broader effort to improve the reliability in Mexico's water deliveries, the IBWC is developing a binational model for water management in the Rio Grande. Recent water deliveries in the two portions of the Rio Grande basin and related issues, including congressional and diplomatic efforts, are discussed in more detail below.

During conditions of extraordinary drought, these deliveries to Mexico are reduced proportionally to reductions in available supplies in the broader basin. U.S. deliveries to Mexico have been reduced in roughly 30% of the years since the convention came into force. The United States is not required to repay any reduced deliveries. Table 1 shows U.S. deliveries to Mexico in recent years falling below the 60,000 AF annual requirement established by the 1906 Convention for six of the seven years from 2012 to 2018.", "In some years, U.S. water deliveries to Mexico in the El Paso-Ju\u00e1rez Valley have drawn attention from U.S. water users. The portion of the Rio Grande that traverses New Mexico at times has experienced particularly low flow and reservoir storage due to drought. When water stored in project reservoirs is low, Rio Grande Project water users have seen significant curtailment in their water deliveries. The Rio Grande Project is a Bureau of Reclamation project that furnishes irrigation water for approximately 178,000 acres in New Mexico and Texas. Data from Table 1 and data provided to the Congressional Research Service by the Bureau of Reclamation show that the amount delivered to Mexico represented on average around 9% of the amount allocated to the principal U.S. irrigation districts for the Rio Grande Project from 2012 to 2018. ", "Hydrologic changes in the Rio Grande in New Mexico and at the border, specifically climate conditions that can alter water availability and seasonal streamflow, could further complicate water delivery to U.S. water users and to Mexico and could exacerbate seasonal deficits for users and for riverine ecosystems and species. One assessment of conditions in the mountainous headwaters of the Rio Grande basin from 1958 to 2015 identified that winter and springtime temperatures have increased and peak snowpack has declined, contributing to the runoff from melting snowpack and post-snow rainfall occurring earlier in the spring and to diminished flows in late spring and summer months. ", "A topic of disagreement between Texas stakeholders and the IBWC has been whether half or all of the water reaching Fort Quitman, TX, is allocated to the United States under the binational agreements. According to Article 4 of the 1944 Treaty, Mexico and the United States each have right to one-half of the Rio Grande main channel flow between Fort Quitman and the lowest major international storage dam unless otherwise allocated. Since 1958, the IBWC has allocated half of the water that reaches Fort Quitman to Mexico and half to the United States. IBWC uses the resulting water volumes when tabulating each country's allocation pursuant to the 1944 Water Treaty. Estimates place the cumulative total allocated to Mexico at Fort Quitman around 2.1 million AF from 1958 to 2016. ", "The Texas Commission for Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and others argue against how IBWC allocates the water in the river segment that forms the U.S.-Mexico border between El Paso and Fort Quitman. Their argument is that Mexico in the 1906 Convention waived its rights to the Rio Grande waters arriving in Fort Quitman and that the division of the waters of the Rio Grande by the 1944 Water Treaty begins below Fort Quitman. Under the TCEQ's interpretation, the United States is entitled to 100% of the Rio Grande water in this segment of the river. In 2013, the USIBWC disputed this interpretation. It asserted that the 1944 Water Treaty intended to divide equally all Rio Grande waters beginning in Fort Quitman, including those waters arriving at Fort Quitman. In support of its position, the USIBWC cited historical IBWC practice, as reflected in the minutes to the 1944 Water Treaty, and statements made to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations during consideration of the 1944 Water Treaty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rio Grande Basin Below Fort Quitman, TX", "paragraphs": ["The 1944 Water Treaty requires Mexico to deliver to the United States portions of the water in several tributaries that flow into the Rio Grande basin below Fort Quitman, TX.

", "The IBWC accounts for Mexico's deliveries to the United States pursuant to the 1944 Water Treaty largely by aggregating deliveries (i.e., 1.75 million AF) over a five-year cycle, with an annual average delivery target of 350,000 AF. The cycles are typically five years long but may be shortened if certain reservoirs are filled with waters belonging to the United States. Once implementation of the 1944 Water Treaty began, Mexico met its deliveries within the five-year cycles until the 1994-2003 drought. Mexico has not met its obligations at the conclusion of the following four five-year cycles: 1992-1997, 1997-2002, 2002-2007, and 2010-2015.", "Various factors may have contributed to Mexico not meeting delivery obligations under the 1944 Water Treaty, including the over-allocation of the water and the effect of extended drought conditions. Over-allocation persists in both the Mexican and the U.S. portions of the basin. A 2011 academic assessment of the treaty's performance found that under drought conditions, the water-sharing system established by the 1944 Water Treaty did not recover as fast as expected (i.e., Mexico's water deficits lasted longer than anticipated) and the deficits that occurred were larger in volume than estimated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mexico's Rio Grande Deliveries: 2010-2015 Cycle and 2015-2020 Cycle", "paragraphs": ["A delivery cycle started October 25, 2010, and ended October 24, 2015. Final accounting for the 2010-2015 cycle indicated a shortfall of 15% (263,250 AF) in Mexico's water deliveries. The deficit largely resulted from low deliveries early in the cycle. By January 25, 2016, Mexico had paid off the debt from the previous cycle, while simultaneously making deliveries under the current cycle. Mexico paid off the remaining 263,250 AF through a combination of transferring water stored behind Amistad Dam and providing for a period 100% of the water from three of Mexico's treaty tributaries.", "The current cycle began in October 2015 and is anticipated to end in October 2020, unless the cycle ends early. During the current cycle, Mexico's deliveries were below 350,000 AF in the first year; that is, the first year of the 2015-2020 cycle ended with Mexico delivering 216,562 AF, which was 133,439 AF below the annual target delivery. During the second year of the cycle, Mexico's deliveries exceeded the cumulative two-year target of 700,000 AF. The combined amount delivered in the first and second years of the current cycle was almost 800,000 AF.

This tension was particularly acute during 2012, when Texas water-rights holders faced persistent dry conditions and Mexico delivered significantly less water than the annual delivery target. Two binational reservoirs on the Rio Grande at Amistad Dam and Falcon Dam store much of the water that Mexico delivers to the United States. The storage and releases from these reservoirs help to regulate the timing of when the water is available for U.S. interests. Some U.S. stakeholders have argued that the uncertainty regarding the timing of Mexico's deliveries reduces the effective use and management of the delivered water, its storage, and its release. Mexico, by contrast, has argued that its deliveries comply with the cycle provided for in the 1944 Water Treaty. ", "Some U.S. interests, particularly agricultural water users in Texas, have contended that Mexico's pattern of water delivery treats U.S. deliveries as a secondary priority to meeting Mexico's own water uses. These stakeholders see Mexico's use of wet-weather flows (e.g., excess flows after large storms) as reducing the reliability of U.S. water supplies from Rio Grande. The flexible five-year cycle for Mexico's Rio Grande deliveries at times is a frustration for U.S. water users in part because of the contrast with the more prescriptive nature of the U.S. water-delivery requirement to Mexico in the Colorado River (i.e., specified quantities are required to be delivered annually). Some interests have raised the possibility of renegotiating the 1944 Water Treaty.", "Other basin stakeholders have argued that the 1944 Water Treaty purposefully provided flexibility in the timing of Mexico's deliveries to account for the annual variability of water conditions in the basin.

Minute 234, established in 1969, includes a procedure whereby Mexico may pay a water debt in the Rio Grande using three different sources of water. Minute 234 requires that deficit payments from these three sources be made concurrently with required deliveries in the following five-year cycle. The United States and Mexico differ in their interpretation and implementation of Minute 234. For example, Mexico claimed that in the event of extraordinary drought, only the deficit incurred during the 1992-1997 five-year water cycle needed to be repaid in the following five-year cycle (i.e., by 2002) and that any deficit incurred during the 1997-2002 cycle could be deferred until the next five-year cycle.
