Developing and investing in flood-prone areas represents a tradeoff between the location's economic and other benefits and the exposure to a flood hazard. In the United States, flood mitigation, protection, emergency response, and recovery roles and responsibilities are shared. Local governments are responsible for land use and zoning decisions that shape floodplain and coastal development. State and federal programs, policies, and investments influence community and individual decisions on managing flood risk. The federal government constructs some of the nation's dams and levees, offers flood insurance, supports nonstructural risk reduction actions (known as hazard mitigation), and provides emergency response and disaster aid.", "In June 2008, a series of storms in several midwestern states caused $15 billion in damages. The 2008 flooding drew comparisons to the devastating 1993 Midwest flood and raised questions about whether the lessons from the 1993 flood were heeded. In 1993, hundreds of levees throughout much of the basin were breached in the Midwest causing $30 billion in damages; much of the damage was agricultural and occurred in soaked upland areas. In contrast, the majority of the 2008 damages were concentrated along a few Mississippi River tributaries and in population centers with breached levees. The magnitude of the two floods simply overwhelmed the region's levees and dams, illustrating that some residual risk remains to people and investment behind these protective structures. Since 1993, emergency response and hazard mitigation programs have reduced risks in some Midwest communities; however, the region's flood risk continues to increase as more investments and people are located in flood-prone areas.", "Since 1993, Congress, federal agencies, state, and local governments have taken steps aimed at reducing the nation's flood risk; at the same time, climate, population, and investment trends have increased the threat, vulnerability, and consequences of flooding. For example, Congress authorized using federal disaster assistance to cover more of the costs to acquire, relocate or elevate flood-prone homes and businesses. However, broader efforts to adopt a comprehensive flood policy and management strategy have not been pursued. The fundamental direction and approach of the national policies and programs remain largely unchanged since 1993. A comprehensive strategy would require regulation of floodplain use, significant changes to federal programs, and increased investment in flood risk reduction by all levels of government. Although they would reduce flood risk, these changes face significant opposition.", "The 2008 Midwest flooding, Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 have renewed interest in the suite of tools available to improve flood resiliency. The issue for Congress is deciding on whether and how to enact and implement feasible and affordable flood policies and programs to reduce flood risk. The challenge is how to structure federal actions and programs so they provide incentives to reduce flood risk without unduly infringing on private property rights or usurping local decision making. Tackling this challenge would require adjustments in the flood insurance program, disaster aid policies and practices, and programs for structural and nonstructural flood risk reduction measures and actions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Flood Challenge: A Federal Primer", "paragraphs": ["In late May and early June 2008, several midwestern states were hit with a series of storms that produced flooding along many Mississippi River tributaries and nearby segments of the Mississippi River. This flooding raised concerns about both the risk of another disaster like the devastating 1993 Midwest flood and the state of the nation's flood policies, programs, and infrastructure. Although emergency response has improved since 1993 and hazard mitigation programs have reduced some risks, the region's flood risk continues to increase as more investments and people are concentrated in flood-prone areas affected by extreme precipitation. ", "Riverine and coastal flooding remain serious risks to the nation's population and economy. The principal causes of floods in eastern states and the Gulf Coast are hurricanes and storms. Coastal counties are 17% of the land area, and home to roughly 50% of the country's population and jobs. Flooding in the Midwest and western states is primarily from snowmelt and rainstorms. At least 9 million homes and $390 billion in property are at risk from a flood with a 1% annual probability of occurring. ", "Increasing flood hazards are putting existing developments at risk. New development is occurring in flood-prone areas, often behind aging levees constructed to reduce agricultural damages rather than protect urban populations. National flood damages, which averaged $3.9 billion annually in the 1980s, nearly doubled in the decade 1995 through 2004. Total disaster assistance for emergency flood response operations, and subsequent long-term recovery efforts, increased from an average of $444 million during the 1980s to $3.75 billion from 1995 to 2004. ", "Congress and federal agencies have taken steps to address selected flood challenges; at the same time, climate, population, and investment trends have increased the threat, vulnerability, and consequences of flooding. In response to the 1993 flood, Congress shifted federal programs to increase support for a wider range of activities that reduce damage and prevent loss of life, such as moving flood-prone structures and developing evacuation plans; this broader set of activities is known as hazard mitigation. This shift has prompted wider use of nonstructural mitigation, particularly for new development and repairing damaged property. Traditional structural approaches, such as levees, floodwalls, and dams, continue to dominate much of the national investment in flood damage reduction. Often structural measures are the most readily available and locally acceptable tools to reduce flood risk for existing population, economic, and infrastructure hubs. ", "Since 2005, Congress has considered legislation and enacted other measures to address some flood issues; broader efforts to adopt a comprehensive flood policy and management strategy, however, have not been pursued. Hurricane Katrina's devastation in 2005 and the 2008 Midwest flood have again prompted attention to the suite of tools available to create a more flood-resilient nation. Many of these tools would require action by local governments, regulation of floodplain use, significant changes to federal programs, and substantially increased investment in flood damage reduction. Achieving these actions and implementing improved floodplain management is likely to confront opposition from those benefitting from the status quo and those opposed to land use regulation. And it likely would require broader congressional action than the incremental policy alterations that have been typical following recent floods.

In January 2009, the National Committee on Levee Safety (created by WRDA 2007) released its draft recommendations for a national levee safety program.

Floods are a vital element of variability in the hydraulic regime of healthy riverine, estuarine, and coastal ecosystems; however, they can result in immediate human suffering and economic loss. Failure of levees and dams and inadequate urban drainage also may result in flooding. ", "Hurricane Katrina focused attention on the performance of levees and floodwalls and the risk remaining behind these structures. There are over 100,000 miles of levees in the nation, only 14,000 miles of these receive regular inspections by the Corps. These levees do not work in isolation from the rest of the watershed. Levees restrict the size of the floodplain which constricts floodwaters to a smaller area, thus raising river crests and often increasing the river's velocity. How land is used can have a dramatic impact on the response of streams to flooding (e.g., tile drains in agricultural areas, impervious areas in urban developments can increase runoff and flood crests). Land use choices can cause 500-year flood levels to be produced by events of lesser magnitude. Some land uses can, therefore, result in levees having to hold back higher flows more frequently. ", "Generally the Corps no longer refers to levees and dams as \"flood control\" measures, rather it calls levee projects \"flood damage reduction\" measures and discusses them in the context of a suite of \"flood risk management\" actions. This language shift reflects an appreciation of the limitations of these structures. Levees, if constructed properly, should perform up to their design level of protection (i.e., 100-year level of protection is the design to reduce damages from a flood with a 1% probability of occurring in a given year); however, when a flood is greater than that design, the levees are overtopped. Sufficient overtopping often results in levee failure, known as breaching. Similarly, dam are designed to spill floodwaters when their capacity is exceeded.", "Although floodwaters overtopped and breached many Midwest levees and a few dams in 1993 and 2008 causing significant economic damage, the dams and levees worked largely as designed. The dams reduced the river crests, and many levees held, thereby preventing floodwaters from damaging many population centers and agricultural and industrial investments. Nonetheless, the potential role of the basin's levees in increasing damages because of their encouragement of risky development and reduction natural flood storage remains debated and part of the active discussion about the future of the basin's floodplains. ", "The performance of the Midwest levees contrasts to the performance of floodwalls in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Some of the floodwalls protecting urban New Orleans failed before their design level was reached, and the damage was catastrophic. These floodwalls lost their integrity, allowing the water level in the city to rise to the level of surrounding water bodies. ", "Residual risk is the portion of risk that remains after flood damage reduction structures have been built and other damage-reducing measures have been taken. Risk remains because of the likelihood that levees and dams will be overwhelmed by severe floods and the risk of structural failure. The damaging consequences of floods increase as development occurs behind levees and below dams; ironically, this development may occur because of the flood protection provided. The nation's risk in terms of lives lost, economic disruption, and property damage is increased by overconfidence in the level and reliability of structural flood protection.", "The inability of infrastructure to protect against all flooding is fundamental to understanding why some flood risk always remains and to making decisions of how to prioritize flood risk reduction investments. Decision-makers are faced with choosing the level of protection to provide for urban areas, critical infrastructure, rural areas, etc., and making tradeoffs when distributing limited funds across different projects throughout the nation and across the range of flood damage reduction measures (e.g., levees, buyouts, insurance)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "2008 Midwest Flood: What Happened and How Does It Compare to 1993?", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Intense Precipitation in Tributary Watersheds in June 2008", "paragraphs": ["Intense precipitation in May and early June 2008 led to numerous record and near-record river crests in the Midwest, particularly on Mississippi River tributaries in eastern Iowa and southern Wisconsin.

The 100-year and 500-year flood levels were exceeded in much of eastern Iowa. These exceptional flood levels overtopped levees and flooded areas that many people assumed to be safe.", "The most affected tributaries were the Cedar, Des Moines, and Iowa Rivers. Record river stages were set at 47 river gage stations on more than 12 tributary rivers and creeks. In some locations, the new record crests were considerably higher than the previous record crests, including 1993 records. Levees in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids were breached. Two significant examples were the Cedar River at Cedar Rapids (see Box 1 ) and the Iowa River at Columbus Junction and Iowa City.

Lower reaches of the Illinois River and extended reaches of the Kansas, Des Moines, and Iowa Rivers also recorded record flood crests. Approximately 600 river forecast points in the Midwest were above flood stage at the same time. In contrast, the 2008 flooding was shorter and concentrated along select Mississippi River tributaries and nearby segments of the Mississippi River.", "The 1993 differs from the 2008 flood in its areal extent, magnitude, duration, volume of floodwater, extent of damage, and time of the year. The rainfall causing the 1993 flood was uncommonly persistent and covered a huge drainage area encompassing most of nine states.

Unlike in 1993, damage in 2008 was from inundation by floodwaters along the rivers, not in saturated upland areas. ", "The magnitude and severity of the 1993 flood event was overwhelming. Hundreds of levees were breached along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers; in contrast, dozens of levees were breached in 2008. The levees breached on the Mississippi mainstem in 2008 were primarily lower agricultural levees. In 2008, although some levees overtopped, they worked largely as intended; that is, they held back floodwaters until the floodwaters exceeded the level of protection the levees were expected to provide. Many of these overtopped levees were protecting primarily agricultural areas and provided the anticipated 5- to 25-year protection. Floodwaters overtopping levees protecting larger communities, like Cedar Rapids, resulted in considerable and concentrated damage; these damages contributed to the 2008 damage estimates being half of the 1993 flood damages even though the duration and extent of flooding was less than in 1993.

Major rail lines in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri and Illinois were washed out. Navigation locks 13-25 on the Mississippi River closed, leaving 281 miles of the river closed to barge traffic. In June, the flooding was predicted to have major impacts on agriculture. CRS Report RL34583, Midwest Floods of 2008: Potential Impact on Agriculture , found that anticipated crop losses contributed to agricultural prices for corn and soybeans hitting record highs in late June and early July.

Relocation of key public infrastructure such as drinking water facilities reduced the consequences of flooding. The general sense is that flood risk reduction in the Mississippi River basin since 1993 paid off in 2008. However, the basin's aggregate flood risk appears to be increasing. ", "After the 1993 flood, the GAO found that not only had man-made changes within the basin over many decades raised the levels of floodwaters in the basin's rivers, but also the precipitation trend in the basin appeared to be increasing over the long term. Congress reacted to the 1993 flood by enacting a number of policy and program changes. It authorized using a portion of federal disaster assistance to cover 75% of the cost to acquire, relocate or elevate flood-prone homes and businesses; prior to the change, the federal cost share had been 50%. Buyouts of at-risk properties using FEMA disaster mitigation funds were more extensive for the 1993 flood than for previous disasters. In the nine states that flooded, FEMA ultimately moved more than 300 homes, and bought and demolished nearly 12,000 at a cost of over $150 million. The lands were turned to flood-friendlier uses such as parks and wildlife habitat. State and federal agencies have also acquired interest in over 250,000 acres of flood-prone land, principally frequently flooded farmland. Another 9,140 properties in 140 communities were elevated, acquired or relocated under hazard mitigation grants. Taken together, these actions signaled a dramatic departure from historic flood policies, which relied primarily on levees and dams.

The population in the 500-year floodplain has increased by 17%; the population in the area flooded in 1993 has increased by 18%. There also has been significant new commercial and industrial development and highway and interchange development within the 500-year floodplain. New development in the 100-year floodplain would be required to meet floodplain development regulations if the community participates in the NFIP. Therefore, this development ought to be more flood resilient than before. Development or redevelopment, however, may not be more flood resilient if built behind levees that are certified to provide 100-year protection or if the community does not participate in the NFIP. Therefore, risk from the 100-year flood in the NFIP-participating communities in the Midwest may have decreased since 1993, but the risk in these communities to more intense floods may have increased.

Its use is viewed by floodplain management advocates as promising because it is not only looking at rebuilding levees but also considering long-term mitigation and recovery.

Rehabilitation and Inspection Program funds are expressly restricted to repairing and cannot be used to increase protection. The RIP program is not designed to evaluate the federal interest in investments to further reduce the local flood risk. If federal participation is sought in increasing protection, the traditional process is to initiate a Corps flood damage reduction study. This is separate from repair work.

Since 2005, the levee inspection and certification programs used by the Corps for the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program and FEMA for the NFIP have been strengthened to address weaknesses identified in the programs. Consequently, significant numbers of levees have been identified as deficient since 2005. If the deficiencies are not addressed, the levee may not be eligible for federal repair assistance if damaged by a flood, and NFIP floodplain requirements may go into effect (e.g., areas behind the levee may be required to purchase flood insurance). The local entities that own and maintain the levees are responsible for making the improvements necessary to pass inspection and obtain certification. Generally federal funds are not available for these rehabilitations which are considered part of the local responsibility for levee upkeep.

The Commission believed that the full benefits of implementing the preferred alternative were not adequately measured with the current Corps project planning guidelines.

Despite these recommendations, a fundamental reorientation for floodplain management has not occurred. ", "Although federal efforts have not been guided by a clearly defined flood policy or floodplain vision, many incremental changes to improve flood programs and projects have been enacted or adopted at all levels of government. These actions include supporting nonstructural flood damage reduction, retiring flood-prone farmland, purchasing repetitive flood loss properties, augmenting hazard mitigation activities, fostering floodplain regulation, and guiding federal actions in floodplains. ", "Notwithstanding these changes, the nation's flood risk is increasing. Many of these changes have seen only marginal implementation, enforcement, and funding. The incremental improvements largely have been overwhelmed by incentives to develop floodplains and coastal areas and by a growing population, or have never fully implemented or enforced. Other federal actions produce some indirect flood risk reduction benefits; for example, Congress has supported conservation efforts on agricultural lands and wetlands protection that may reduce flood damages by slowing down or temporarily storing flood waters. Whether these benefits are overwhelmed by changes in flood-prone land use (e.g., conversion of agricultural land behind levees to residential development) remains largely unknown because regional-scale and multi-agency plans and evaluations have been rare.", "Generally, congressional oversight, administrative implementation, and federal appropriations have reflected a reactive and fragmented approach to flooding. Earlier institutional arrangements that provided avenues for more coordinated federal flood efforts have diminished. For example, the national-level Water Resources Council which was established by the Water Resources Planning Act (P.L. 89-80), disbanded in 1983; the Federal Interagency Task Force on Floodplain Management, which had continued some of the Water Resources Council flood-related functions after 1983, stopped convening in the late 1990s. Federal support and opportunities for local capacity building decreased with the loss of these institutions.", "Flood policy continues to be dominated by separate treatment of structural flood damage reduction investments (e.g., levee building), the NFIP, and federal disaster aid, rather than a comprehensive flood risk and floodplain management approach. Current arrangements of aid, insurance, and water resources projects at times unintentionally provide disincentives to reduce exposure to flood risks.

Since 1973, homeowners in 100-year flood-prone areas are required to buy flood insurance if using a federally backed mortgage. Today, the NFIP provides flood insurance to more than 5 million homeowners, renters, and business owners in over 20,000 participating communities.", "A significant policy reaction to the 1993 flood was passage of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994. The flooding revealed that most flooded homeowners did not have flood insurance. And mortgage lenders had been lax in checking if federally backed mortgages were being granted in flood-prone areas, as required by NFIP. The 1994 legislation aimed to improve compliance with NFIP's mandatory flood insurance requirement, and to pressure lenders to ensure that at-risk owners in a flood zone purchase insurance. The legislation also:", "Created the Increased Cost of Compliance program within the NFIP. This program gives money to insured owners of substantially damaged properties to meet the more expensive costs of rebuilding according to a local floodplain management ordinance.

The funds are distributed as grants to states for flood mitigation. Increased emphasis on floodplain mapping. Codified the Community Rating System (CRS) into the NFIP. The CRS is an incentive program to reduce communities' flood insurance premiums by exceeding the minimum flood risk reduction requirements of the NFIP.", "After the 1993 floods, Congress authorized FEMA to use a portion of federal disaster assistance to cover 75% of the cost to acquire, relocate or elevate homes and businesses; set aside flood insurance premiums to relocate flood-prone buildings; and tighten flood insurance purchase requirements. These actions signaled a shift toward hazard reduction away from reliance on levees and dams. Nonetheless, the potential consequences of floods are increasing as more people and investments are located in flood-prone areas.

Considerable concerns continue to be raised about the degree of subsidization under the NFIP and the financial foundation of the program. Numerous GAO studies have reviewed various aspects of the NFIP; some recommendations have been implemented. In 2006, an independent review working group released its evaluation of the NFIP; the recommendations are among other changes that have been considered, but not enacted.

It cites maps as central to anticipating, preparing for, and insuring against flooding. It found that current maps have significant uncertainties and do not necessarily represent current floodplain conditions. The Council concluded that these investments are needed and economically justified despite recent investments. From 2003 to 2008 at a cost of more than $1 billion, FEMA and local and state partners collected new flood data in unmapped areas, updated existing data, and digitized flood maps that were previously on paper.

Through reauthorizations and amendments to the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-532) and the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-348 ), Congress has tried to improve federal actions that support coastal resource protection.

Issues to be addressed include protecting concentrated urban populations, reducing risk to the nation's public and private economic infrastructure, reducing vulnerability by investing in natural buffers, and equity in protection for low-income and minority populations. A challenge for Congress is structuring federal actions and programs so they provide incentives to reduce flood risk without unduly infringing on private property rights or usurping local decision making.

Sections of communities with frequently flooded businesses or homes would become river-focused parks and recreation areas as former occupants relocated to safer areas on higher ground. In areas outside of these highly protected communities, where land elevation provided natural protection from floods, state and local officials would control new construction by requiring it to be at elevation well out of harm's way.

Therefore, regional stakeholders, particularly in Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri, may view plans, like Plan H and Plan M, as attractive investments. The majority of those regional economic benefits ($20.5 billion) are due to the increase in economic development behind the higher levees. Plan H potentially would open to development up to 215,775 acres. This potential for expanded economic development behind levees raises concerns regarding the residual risk behind levees and the evaluation of that risk in selecting Plan H as the preferred alternative. That is, it remains unclear the extent to which the flood risk reduction benefits of Plan H may be offset by the residual risk of more development behind levees. The methodology used in developing the study appears to be more similar to the traditional Corps flood damage reduction study, than a flood risk reduction study.", "As well as noting that Plan H has not been thoroughly vetted with the public and stakeholders, the UMRCP final report stated:", "There is likely to be limited Federal interest, based upon current guidance, in plan implementation by Federal agencies.\u2026 Regional or national oversight (e.g., the Mississippi River Commission) would be required to ensure the plan functions as a system over the implementation and operation phases of the project and project priorities are established to reflect the changing systemic needs.\u2026 The States of Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri need to agree on the plan and plan implementation to insure the plan is acceptable. The Corps could provide facilitation and technical support to this effort.", "In effect, the UMRBC final report is identifying that the states could choose to further develop then implement one of the alternatives studied without significant federal leadership or funding."], "subsections": []}]}}
