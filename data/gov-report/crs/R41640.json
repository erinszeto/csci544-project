The oil spill caused significant economic harm to the Gulf fishing industry because of fishery closures and consumer concerns related to the safety of Gulf seafood. Intermediate and long-term concerns are related to impacts on marine populations and degradation of fisheries habitat necessary for spawning, development of early life stages, and growth.", "The closing and opening of fishing grounds has involved a tradeoff between ensuring public safety and providing fishing opportunities to recreational and commercial fishermen. In addition to public health concerns, uncertainties related to Gulf seafood safety could further compromise the reputation of Gulf seafood. Most areas have been reopened and landings of commercial and recreational species are recovering. For Gulf waters re-opened through November 15, 2010, sensory analyses of seafood samples have found no detectable oil or dispersant odors or flavors, and results of chemical analyses have been well below levels of concern. However, some scientists and the public remain skeptical of claims that Gulf seafood is safe. This may inhibit the recovery of Gulf recreational and commercial fisheries.", "Under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), harmed individuals and businesses may make claims for economic injuries to the responsible party, in this case BP. Although many in the fishing industry have benefited from their damage claims and associated payments, ongoing issues include the legitimacy of some claims, lack of transparency in the claims review process, eligibility to make a claim, and level of payments. Other assistance to the fishing industry includes BP grants to states, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fishery disaster assistance, the BP Vessels of Opportunity Program, and Small Business Administration efforts.", "Environmental restoration of fisheries habitat and Gulf ecosystems would support the long-term recovery and productivity of Gulf fisheries. The federal government's role in restoration is defined in statute by OPA and in NOAA regulations, which require development of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA). NRDA restoration plans are currently being developed by state and federal trustees. The Obama Administration also has committed to developing a separate long-term Gulf of Mexico plan to restore the environment, economy, and public health of residents. Implementation of the plan will require sustained funding and a governance structure to oversee and coordinate restoration efforts.", "The 112th Congress may continue to conduct oversight of efforts to promote fishing industry recovery, adequate compensation to fishermen and businesses, and Gulf restoration. Ongoing efforts by federal agencies and states to ensure seafood safety and to regain and maintain the reputation of Gulf seafood are the most immediate challenges currently faced by the fishing industry. As the NRDA process moves from the planning to restoration phase, questions may arise regarding the level of the potential settlement and the types of restoration activities identified by the trustees. In contrast to NRDA, three bills have been introduced in the 112th Congress to address elements of the Administration's restoration plan. All three bills would establish a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Fund and require 80% of any amounts collected by the United States as penalties, settlements, or fines under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to be deposited into the fund. They would also establish a governing body to distribute funding and coordinate restoration efforts. Potential issues involve the allocation of funds, focus of restoration projects, and coordination with other restoration efforts."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Introduction", "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has caused significant socioeconomic injuries to the Gulf of Mexico fishing industry. Immediate economic injuries occurred because large areas of federal and state waters in or adjacent to the spill area were closed to fishing as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of seafood. Perhaps of greater concern are intermediate and long-term harm to Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. Seafood production is dependent on Gulf ecosystems for spawning areas, nurseries, and growth. ", "Over 84 days beginning on April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil well released over 200 million gallons (4.9 million barrels). During the spill, oil was dispersed through the application of 1.8 million gallons of surface and subsurface chemical dispersants. By June 2, 2010, the area of federal waters closed to fishing had grown to its maximum of 88,522 square miles or nearly 37% of federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. The maximum portions of state waters closed to fishing during the spill were Alabama (40%), Florida (2%), Louisiana (55%), and Mississippi (95%). Survey teams also have documented 1,053 total linear miles of oiled shoreline.", "At issue for Congress is whether current efforts will be sufficient to restore the fishery to pre-spill conditions. Congress may continue to conduct oversight of efforts to promote fishing industry recovery and Gulf restoration. Immediate issues are likely to focus on providing financial compensation to fishermen, ensuring seafood safety, and maintaining Gulf seafood markets. ", "Congress also may consider long-term efforts to restore the Gulf environment and related fishery productivity. In addition to restoration requirements defined in statute by the Oil Pollution Act (OPA, P.L. 101-380 ) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) regulations under OPA, the Administration has proposed a long-term plan to restore the Gulf region. The plan would redirect Clean Water Act penalty revenues for this purpose and establish a Gulf Restoration Council to coordinate restoration efforts. Congress may consider the Administration's proposal and related issues such as the allocation and use of restoration funds. ", "The primary objective of this report is to summarize information related to damages caused by the oil spill to Gulf fisheries and efforts to mitigate these damages. Many uncertainties exist because of the complexity and scale of Gulf fisheries and ecosystems that have been affected by the oil spill. Direct and indirect damages to fisheries and the Gulf environment are still being assessed and these efforts are likely to continue for years to come.", "Commercial and Recreational Fisheries", "Other than Alaska, historically, the Gulf region has produced the greatest amount of seafood by volume and value in the United States. In 2008, Gulf commercial fishery landings totaled 1,273 million pounds with a dock-side value of $697 million. When related processor, wholesale, and retail businesses are included, the seafood industry of the Gulf states supported over 213,000 full- and part-time jobs with related income impacts of $5.5 billion. The top commercial species by value were shrimp ($366 million), menhaden ($64 million), oysters ($60 million), and blue crab ($39 million). Table 1 provides commercial landings and revenue for major species by state in the Gulf of Mexico region.", "Recreational fisheries also make significant contributions to the region's economy by supporting businesses such as charters, bait and tackle shops, restaurants, and hotels. In 2008, 5.7 million Gulf recreational fishermen, both visitors and residents, took 24 million fishing trips. In 2008, recreational fishermen spent over $12.5 billion on durable equipment and trips in the Gulf region. Some of the main species targeted by recreational fishermen include snappers, several types of drum, sheepshead, and Spanish mackerel. Although recreational expenditures cannot be directly compared to commercial revenues, these figures provide an indication of the magnitude of economic activity related to these fisheries. Commercial and recreational fisheries are among the main activities supporting the economy and social well-being of many Gulf coastal communities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Impacts of the Oil Spill on Gulf Fisheries", "paragraphs": ["The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has directly harmed the fishing industry through closures and changes in seafood demand. Large areas of federal and state waters were closed to fishing as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of seafood. During the closures fisheries landings and associated revenues decreased significantly in central Gulf fishing ports. It is likely that demand for Gulf seafood has decreased because of changes in consumer perceptions related to the spill. The spill also has harmed the Gulf environment, resulting in mortality of organisms, eggs, and early life stages and harm to habitat and other elements of the Gulf ecosystem.

On the other hand, closures directly constrain recreational and commercial fishermen and delays in reopening areas are costly to the fishing industry. ", "On May 2, 2010, 12 days following the explosion and fire of the Deepwater Horizon, NOAA closed 6,817 square miles of the Gulf of Mexico to commercial and recreational fishing. The closure was implemented to ensure potentially contaminated seafood would not enter markets and pose a risk to human health. The closure grew to include portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida state waters. At the peak of the closure, 88,522 square miles, or nearly 37%, of all federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico were off-limits to fishing. The maximum proportions of state waters closed to fishing during the spill were Alabama (40%), Florida (2%), Louisiana (55%), and Mississippi (95%). Since the flow of oil from the well-head was stopped in July, most of Louisiana state waters and all of Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida state waters have been re-opened to fishing. As of January 24, 2011, only 1,041 square miles of federal waters immediately surrounding the well-head remain closed to commercial and recreational fishing.", "FDA, NOAA, and coastal states established a protocol to determine when areas may be re-opened to fishing. Once areas have been determined to be free of oil from the spill, re-opening has been considered on a species-by-species basis. Seafood samples of the species in question must pass both sensory and chemical analyses to ensure there are no harmful oil residues. For sensory testing, edible portions of the species are tested by a panel of experts who check samples for oil and dispersant odor and taste. If all tested samples for a given site pass the sensory test, additional samples undergo chemical analysis to test for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dispersants. All seafood samples from an area must pass both tests for the area to be reopened to fishing. ", "Some have criticized the testing protocols because they believe seafood sampling coverage has been insufficient, the setting of PAH levels of concern should have incorporated additional factors, and the list of toxic substances being tested is too narrow. ", "NOAA has collected samples from federal waters while state personnel have collected samples from state waters. On August 19, 2010, FDA officials stated the following in congressional testimony: ", "To date all samples have passed sensory testing for oil or dispersants and, as with the surveillance sampling, the results of all chemical analyses have shown PAH levels well below the levels of concern, usually by a factor of 100 to 1,000 below those levels, essentially at the same level as were seen before the spill.", "For federal waters reopened through November 15, 2010, sensory analyses have found no detectable oil or dispersant odors or flavors, and results of chemical analyses have been well below levels of concern. Further, NOAA and FDA sampling from commercial landing sites and markets have not found seafood contaminated by oil or dispersant. According to the FDA, \"fish and shellfish harvested from areas re-opened or unaffected by the oil spill are considered to be safe to eat.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impacts on Fisheries", "paragraphs": ["The areas affected by the closures are some of the richest fishing grounds in the Gulf for commercial species such as shrimp, menhaden, and oysters. Although many factors influence commercial landings, when compared to the same period in 2009 (January through December), total Gulf landings for all shrimp species in 2010 decreased by 35.6 million pounds (27%). On the state level, shrimp landings decreased by 32% in Louisiana, 60% in Mississippi, 56% in Alabama and nearly 15% in Texas, while increasing by nearly 15% for the Florida west coast. Menhaden landings in Louisiana also decreased by 171 million pounds (17%). The decreases in landings resulted in lower revenues in the harvesting sector. Immediate losses were dependent on target species, location, and alternative fishing opportunities. Landings information for other species and associated revenue information are not available at this time. ", "In addition to impacts resulting directly from oil, the oyster industry has been harmed by efforts to protect Louisiana estuaries from oil intrusion. Following the oil spill, the state of Louisiana released freshwater from the Mississippi River into estuaries in greater amounts than usual in an attempt to keep oil from reaching Louisiana's estuaries. The strategy may have had limited success in keeping oil offshore, but with unintended consequences. The freshwater releases decreased salinity on the oyster grounds below the level that oysters can tolerate and resulted in significant mortality of oysters, by some estimates 50% of Louisiana's annual oyster crop. Some of the oyster industry's immediate concerns are related to documenting damage caused by the spill and freshwater diversion and effects of the spill on consumer perceptions and oyster markets. Prior to the oil spill, long-term restoration proposals to divert the Mississippi River for wetlands restoration raised concerns because of likely impacts on the productivity of oyster grounds. Some in the oyster industry have questioned whether current restoration efforts may need to consider retiring oyster grounds and developing new areas that are less likely to be affected by river diversions associated with restoration activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impacts on Markets", "paragraphs": ["The Gulf oil spill has affected both the supply of Gulf seafood and the demand for Gulf seafood. Fishery closures constrained harvesters and disrupted seafood supplies for the region's processors, distributors, and buyers. The disruption of seafood supplies resulted in the loss of some of the region's seafood markets. Impacts on specific markets vary depending on the magnitude of changes in supply from the harvest sector, whether the market is local, regional, or national, and the availability of alternative supplies. The disruption in Gulf supplies is likely to have induced buyers to use substitutes such as products from other regions or imports. Many in the Gulf seafood industry are concerned that once seafood buyers switch seafood suppliers, it may be difficult to regain markets. ", "Many in the Gulf seafood industry fear it also will be difficult to regain consumer trust in their products. A study conducted by MRops, a marketing research company commissioned by the Louisiana Seafood Promotion Board, reported that 70% of consumers polled expressed some level of concern about seafood safety following the Gulf oil spill and 23% have reduced their consumption of seafood. This study implies that consumer concerns with safety have caused a decrease in demand for Gulf seafood and seafood in general.", "Supply effects on prices depend on the scale of the reduction in supply relative to the total market supply. The decrease in supply and related price increases are likely to have been greater for fresh markets near the area of the spill and for local specialties such as oysters. With regard to demand, concerns with seafood safety are likely to put negative pressure on prices. Initially, prices of some Gulf seafood products increased because supplies were constrained by fishery closures. On average, reported Gulf shrimp prices have remained higher in 2010 than during 2009. Oysters have also increased in price, likely in part because of the decrease in Louisiana production which is over 37% of national production and 62% of production in the Gulf region. As areas have been reopened and supply has rebounded, there have been some reports that prices of some products have decreased relative to previous years. In addition to the effects related to the oil spill, prices also depend on additional factors such as the availability of substitutes, consumer income, and consumer tastes and preferences. The length of time it will take to regain markets and consumer trust remains an open question.

Coastal areas are especially vulnerable because oil can be stranded in wetlands and other coastal ecosystems after being washed in by waves and tides. The uptake of dissolved components of oil is toxic for fish, shellfish, other invertebrates, and plankton. Oil also may coat small animals and plants that inhabit shoreline areas and suffocate them. Many scientists are concerned that oil suspended in the water column may have caused mortality of plankton, including eggs and larvae of many fish such as bluefin tuna. Oil also may have remained on or near the bottom of the Gulf and affected deep corals and other bottom-dwelling organisms. Sublethal effects reduce the overall health of organisms, resulting in decreased growth and reproduction. Initial harm to marine organisms, such as direct mortality and reduced health, decrease the reproductive capacity of marine populations and may reduce future abundance. ", "Early life stages of many species develop in coastal areas such as estuaries and wetlands and move offshore as they grow to their adult stage. As a result, the health of coastal areas can have long-term implications for the fishery industry. Ninety-seven percent of commercial fish and shellfish landings by volume are composed of species that depend on estuaries and wetlands at some point in the life cycle, and landings from the Louisiana coastal zone account for nearly one-third of the fish volume harvested in the continental United States. The presence of oil in the environment may alter migration patterns, decrease food availability, and disrupt life cycles. According to a study of oil impacts on Louisiana fisheries, populations of shrimp, crab, and menhaden are most likely to be harmed by the effects of oil on their eggs and larvae. ", "The impacts of oil in coastal areas affects more than individual fish species. The Gulf is composed of inter-related ecosystems that stretch from estuaries and coastal wetlands to the pelagic zone (open ocean). Species directly affected by the spill could affect other species because of ecological interactions. For example, oil in coastal areas has affected structure-forming organisms, such as marsh grasses and oysters. These organisms provide shelter and a surface for attachment by other marine organisms. Survey teams have documented 1,053 total linear miles of oiled shoreline in the Gulf. Robert Barham, Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary, has reportedly voiced concerns over long-term implications of the oil spill on Gulf wildlife, such as effects on the food web.", "Fisheries surveys from Dauphin Island Sea Lab, conducted after the oil spill off the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, have found that the abundance of some fish species appear to have increased in 2010. Some scientists have speculated that these populations have increased because of the oil spill-related fisheries closures and reduced harvest. Some scientists expressed concern that the effects of the fishing closures may make it difficult to determine the direct impact of the oil spill on marine populations.

If the party to whom the claim is presented denies all liability, or if the claim is not settled by payment within 90 days after the claim was presented, the claimant may elect either to initiate an action in court against the responsible party or to present the claim directly to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.", "In response to economic harm caused by the oil spill and to fulfill obligations as a responsible party, BP established a claims process and multiple claims centers. On May 3, 2010, BP began paying emergency compensation to individuals and businesses. BP stated that emergency payments would continue as long as individuals and businesses could show they were unable to earn a living because of injury to natural resources caused by the oil spill. Payments were based on one month of income and would be adjusted with additional documentation. On June 16, 2010, President Obama announced that BP had agreed to set aside $20 billion to pay economic damage claims caused by the oil spill. Some members of the fishing industry criticized BP's administration of the claims process because they maintained that the claims process was slow, some individual payments were inadequate, and required proof of past earnings might not reflect potential earnings (if the spill had not occurred) for 2010.", "On August 23, 2010, the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) took over the administration of claims from BP to address the issues with BP's claims process. Up until the change, BP had paid out $395.6 million, of which approximately $111 million went to the fisheries industry. Although still funded by BP, GCCF was established by the Administration and BP to provide an independent claims process. Some have argued that the process is not independent because the GCCF is directly financed by BP. GCCF provides information on how to file a claim, how to check the current status of a claim, and other general information concerning the process. GCCF offered emergency payments equivalent to six months of lost income to claimants until November 23, 2010. As of February 12, 2011, the GCCF had made emergency payments of approximately $751 million to individuals and businesses in the fishing industry. Some claimants have voiced concerns with the transparency of the claims process, the lack of information in GCCF responses to claims, and the adequacy of payments, but the actual proportion of unsatisfied fishing industry claimants is not known at this time. ", "Under GCCF procedures, claimants will have three years to estimate damages and submit claims for final payment. Acceptance of a final claim would resolve all claims by that party against BP including past and future alleged damages. Individuals and businesses that have received emergency payments from the GCCF are eligible for a quick payment final claim, which offers a fixed amount of $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for businesses. Those who do not choose or are not eligible for the quick payment may submit a full review final payment claim for all documented losses and damages. The alternative to a final payment is to make an interim payment claim for past damages that have not been compensated. Individuals and businesses receiving interim payments are not required to sign a release of liability and may file a final claim at a later date. For many in the fishing industry, their dilemma is related to uncertainty in determining the extent and duration of damages to fisheries resources. Some have questioned whether three years is a sufficient period to fully determine the damages of the oil spill. Many individuals and businesses are faced with the decision on whether to take a final settlement or, as many have already done, to file a lawsuit, which may present uncertainty as to payment size and timing. ", "On February 2, 2011, the GCCF released a draft proposal, Payment Options, Eligibility and Substantiation Criteria, and Final Payment Methodology , for public comment. The proposal establishes principles for governing final and interim claims for individuals and businesses. GCCF also released a report, An expert opinion of when the Gulf of Mexico will return to pre-spill harvest status following the BP Deepwater Horizon HC 252 oil spill , to provide supplemental information for the GCCF final payment methodology. The report predicts that regional catches for major Gulf fisheries will likely continue along the same harvest trends of recent years by 2011. However, the report recognized there may be exceptions for specific areas and fisheries, especially for some oyster beds that may not recover for 6 to 10 years. Furthermore, the report acknowledges that a definitive assessment of recovery time is impossible, and the true loss to ecosystems and fisheries may not be known for years or even decades.

They would also establish a governing body to distribute funding and coordinate restoration efforts such as a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force ( H.R. 56 and H.R. 501 ) or a Gulf of Mexico Recovery Council ( H.R. 480 ). In contrast to H.R. 56 and H.R. 501 , H.R. 480 would provide a formula for allocating funding among Gulf states, and establish and fund four Gulf of Mexico programs, including an observation system, a grant program for Sea Grant colleges, a seafood marketing program, and a clean energy program.
