It was established in 1948 as a forum in which the nations of the hemisphere could engage one another and address issues of mutual concern. Today, the OAS concentrates on four broad objectives: democracy promotion, human rights protection, economic and social development, and regional security cooperation. It carries out a variety of activities to advance these goals, often providing policy guidance and technical assistance to member states. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the OAS, providing an estimated $68 million in FY2017\u2014equivalent to 44% of the organization's total budget.", "U.S. Policy", "The United States historically has sought to use the OAS to advance economic, political, and security objectives in the Western Hemisphere. Although OAS actions frequently reflected U.S. policy during the 20th century, this has changed to a certain extent over the past 15 years. The organization's goals and day-to-day activities are still generally consistent with U.S. policy toward the region, but the U.S. government has struggled to obtain support from other member states on some high-profile issues, such as efforts to address the political crisis in Venezuela.", "As the OAS's decisions have begun to reflect the increasing independence of its member states, U.S. policymakers occasionally have expressed concerns about the direction of the organization. In recent years, some Members of Congress have criticized the OAS for failing to address the erosion of democratic institutions in Venezuela and other nations and have questioned whether the United States should continue to fund the organization. Others argue that the OAS remains an important forum for advancing U.S. relations with the other nations of the hemisphere and that U.S. policy should seek to strengthen the organization and make it more effective.", "Congressional Action", "The 115th Congress has continued to shape U.S. policy toward the OAS through its legislative and oversight activities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), provided funding for the U.S. assessed contribution (membership dues) to the OAS, as well as $14.5 million in voluntary contributions to support the organization's anticorruption, human rights, democracy, and development assistance programs. Congress has yet to conclude action on FY2018 appropriations, but the House and Senate Appropriations Committees both have recommended providing voluntary contributions to the OAS in the reports (H.Rept. 115-253 and S.Rept. 115-152) accompanying their respective FY2018 foreign operations appropriations bills (H.R. 3362, included as Division G of House-passed H.R. 3354, and S. 1780). In November 2017, the Multilateral Aid Review Act of 2017 (S. 1928) was reported in the Senate and a companion bill (H.R. 4502) was introduced in the House. The measures would establish a multilateral review task force to assess the effectiveness of U.S. investments in the OAS and other multilateral institutions.", "Congress also has held hearings to examine U.S. policy toward the OAS. On November 30, 2017, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing to consider President Trump's nomination of Carlos Trujillo to be the U.S. Permanent Representative to the OAS. The committee reported the nomination favorably, but Trujillo has yet to receive a confirmation vote from the full Senate.

In subsequent decades, OAS decisions often reflected U.S. policy as other member states sought to maintain close relations with the dominant economic and political power in the hemisphere. This was especially true during the early Cold War period, when the United States was able to secure OAS support for initiatives that were controversial in the region, such as a 1962 resolution to exclude Cuba from active participation as a result of its association with the communist bloc. OAS actions again aligned closely with U.S. policy in the 1990s following the end of the Cold War as a result of strong consensus among member states in support of initiatives designed to liberalize markets and strengthen democratic governance.", "According to many foreign policy analysts, the ability of the United States to exert authority and shape outcomes in the Western Hemisphere has declined over the past 15 years. This is the result of a number of trends. Citizens throughout Latin America and the Caribbean have elected ideologically diverse leaders, bringing an end to the post-Cold War policy consensus. At the same time, many countries in the region have enjoyed considerable economic growth, grown more confident in addressing their challenges, and diversified their commercial and diplomatic relations. These developments have enabled countries in the region to pursue more independent foreign policies that are less deferential to the United States.", "U.S. policymakers have responded to the United States' declining ability to advance its policy preferences within the OAS in a number of ways. Some Members of Congress, frustrated by the organization's inaction on the political crisis in Venezuela, contend that the OAS is failing in its mission to support democracy and human rights in Latin America. They have called on the U.S. government to use its influence in the organization to compel stronger action on these issues and occasionally have sought to withhold funding from the organization. Others argue that OAS actions continue to align closely with U.S. priorities in many cases and that the OAS should not be deemed ineffective solely based on its inability to resolve a few high-profile challenges. They have called for reforms to strengthen the organization.", "As Congress continues to debate the utility of the OAS for advancing U.S. policies and considers appropriations and other legislation related to the organization, it might examine OAS activities in the hemisphere and the extent to which those activities align with U.S. objectives.

The participating nations agreed to establish the International Union of American Republics, which was renamed the Pan American Union in 1910. In 1933, following the launch of President Franklin Roosevelt's \"Good Neighbor\" policy, the United States and other nations in the hemisphere signed the Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which formally recognized the equality of states and the principle of nonintervention in one another's internal affairs. Close cooperation during World War II considerably strengthened hemispheric ties, which were reinforced in the postwar period with the adoption of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) in 1947. The OAS Charter and American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man were signed a year later by the United States and 20 other countries in the region to legally codify the institutions and principles that had come to form the inter-American system.", "Although the OAS initially sought to address border disputes and collective security issues, it has expanded its activities into other areas over time. In 1959, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was created to carry out the provisions of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. During the 1960s, the OAS greatly expanded its economic, social, cultural, scientific, and technological programs, placing a strong emphasis on development following the 1961 launch of President Kennedy's \"Alliance for Progress.\" Abuses by authoritarian governments prompted the creation of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 1979, and growing concern over narcotics trafficking led to the establishment of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission in 1986. The OAS acknowledged the challenges posed by regional and international terrorism by creating the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism in 1999, and recognized the near-universal commitment to democracy in the region through the adoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter in 2001.", "According to the OAS Charter, as amended, the purpose of the organization is to", "strengthen the peace and security of the continent; promote and consolidate representative democracy, with due respect for the principle of nonintervention; prevent possible causes of difficulties and ensure the pacific settlement of disputes that may arise among member states; provide for common action on the part of those states in the event of aggression; seek the solution of political, juridical, and economic problems that may arise among them; promote, by cooperative action, their economic, social, and cultural development; eradicate extreme poverty, which constitutes an obstacle to the full democratic development of the peoples of the hemisphere; and achieve an effective limitation of conventional weapons that will make it possible to devote the largest amount of resources to the economic and social development of member states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Institutional Bodies", "paragraphs": ["The OAS is composed of a variety of councils, committees, and other institutional organs, some of which are autonomous.

The Regular Fund is financed through the assessed contributions, or membership dues, of OAS member states. Quota assessments are calculated based on each member state's gross national income, with adjustments for debt burden and low per capita income. Since 1997, the OAS has sought to supplement the Regular Fund by collecting Specific Funds\u2014voluntary contributions from member states and other international donors that are directed to specific projects or programs. Despite the addition of Specific Funds, the OAS has faced persistent strains on its budget (see \" Management and Budget Concerns \" below).", "The United States is the top source of funding for the OAS, contributing an estimated $68 million in FY2017, which was equivalent to 44% of the organization's approved budget. This figure included $50.4 million for the country's assessed contribution and an estimated $17.6 million in voluntary contributions to various Specific Funds (see Table 2 ). U.S. voluntary contributions are intended to advance U.S. strategic goals in the organization and region. In recent years, such contributions have funded democracy promotion and human rights protection efforts, OAS development assistance programs, humanitarian demining in Colombia, and security cooperation in the Caribbean, among other initiatives.

Member states approved a series of instruments designed to support democratic governance, culminating in the adoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter on September 11, 2001. The charter asserts that the peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it. The OAS has sought to uphold these commitments through a number of activities, which include support for, and observation of, elections; technical assistance and other programs to foster institutional development and good governance; and the coordination of collective action when democratic institutions are threatened. ", "Since it began observing electoral processes in 1962, the OAS has deployed more than 250 electoral observation missions in 27 countries. Over the years, the OAS has earned a reputation for impartiality and technical competence, playing an important role in the legitimization of electoral processes in many Latin American and Caribbean countries. The OAS observes several electoral processes every year, but each mission must be invited by the country holding the election and must solicit separate funding from the international donor community. Eight countries have invited the OAS to observe their elections in 2018, including Brazil, which has requested an observation mission for the first time as it prepares to elect a new president in the aftermath of widespread corruption scandals and a controversial presidential impeachment. Some analysts have been critical of OAS observation missions in certain instances, however, maintaining that the organization occasionally has offered legitimacy to flawed elections.", "The OAS also provides technical assistance to member states designed to strengthen institutions and improve good governance. In 1996, OAS member states adopted the Inter-American Convention against Corruption ( Treaty Doc. 105-39 ), which aims to improve government transparency by strengthening anticorruption laws and facilitating cooperation among member states. Under the follow-up mechanism on the implementation of the convention, member states submit themselves to a reciprocal review process that evaluates how well they are implementing the convention, formulates recommendations for improving anticorruption efforts, and facilitates the exchange of information to harmonize the region's anticorruption legal frameworks.", "Some countries have requested special OAS political missions to assist them with sensitive governance matters. In Colombia, for example, the OAS Mission to Support the Peace Process is providing verification and advisory support regarding the demobilization and reintegration of illegal armed groups. The OAS Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras is working with the Honduran government to develop a stronger anticorruption legal framework and investigate and prosecute high-profile corruption cases.", "The OAS has been less successful at mobilizing collective efforts to defend democracy. In many cases, the General Secretariat and other operational bodies of the OAS have highlighted threats to democratic governance but member states have been unwilling or unable to take action. For example, Secretary General Almagro and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have issued numerous reports detailing the collapse of democracy in Venezuela. The Secretary General also has repeatedly called on OAS member states to take whatever steps are necessary, including suspending Venezuela from the organization, to compel the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to restore the democratic order. Collective action has been stymied, however, by a small group of member states that are ideologically aligned with Venezuela and/or have received subsidized oil from the country. They have successfully exploited the organization's supermajority vote requirements to block nearly every resolution put forward by other member states that would condemn or pressure the Maduro government.", "The U.S. government and its allies also have been selective in their defense of democracy. An OAS electoral observation mission documented a series of irregularities during the November 2017 general election in Honduras and asserted that it could not be sure that the official results accurately represented the will of the Honduran people. Secretary General Almagro called for new elections to be held and requested a Permanent Council meeting to discuss the matter. OAS member states never collectively assessed the legitimacy of the elections, however, as the United States and several other nations opted to recognize the official results before a Permanent Council meeting could be convened.

Consequently, advocates maintain, the two bodies are able to take on the \"pivotal role of condemnation and early warning in response to situations that undermine the consolidation of democracy and rule of law\" in the hemisphere.", "The IACHR has a mandate to promote and protect human rights in the region. In the first decades after its 1959 inception, the IACHR's documentation of human rights violations brought international attention to the abuses of repressive regimes. Although the human rights situation in the hemisphere has changed considerably as a result of the spread of democracy, the IACHR continues to receive, analyze, and investigate more than 2,500 allegations of human rights violations annually. The IACHR also issues requests to governments to adopt \"precautionary measures\" in certain cases where individuals or groups are at risk of suffering serious and irreparable harm to their human rights. Additionally, the IACHR observes the general human rights situations in member states, conducts on-site visits to carry out in-depth analyses, publishes special reports when warranted, and notes in its annual report which countries' human rights situations deserve special attention, follow-up, and monitoring. In its most recent annual report (issued in April 2017 and covering 2016), the IACHR made special note of the human rights situations in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.

The Development Cooperation Fund supports efforts to strengthen institutions and build human capacity, with the majority of recent projects focused on social inclusion, social protection, and productive employment.

CICAD helps OAS member states strengthen their antidrug policies by developing and recommending legislation, providing technical assistance and specialized training, and conducting assessments of member states' progress. CICAD also helps build trust and establish common ground for cooperation between the United States and the rest of the hemisphere. For example, after several regional leaders expressed frustration with the results of U.S.-backed counternarcotics policies, the heads of government attending the 2012 Summit of the Americas called for the OAS to analyze the results of those policies and explore alternative approaches that may be more effective. CICAD prepared two reports, published in 2013, which suggested that member states could benefit from greater policy flexibility, potentially including decriminalization of marijuana.

Although observers have called on the OAS to invoke the collective action mechanisms of the charter on numerous occasions, member states have been reluctant to do so. Analysts have identified three inter-related factors that have limited the operational scope of the Democratic Charter:", "tension between the principle of nonintervention enshrined in the OAS Charter and the obligation to defend democracy through collective action, the lack of precise criteria for defining when a country has experienced a breakdown in the democratic order, and the inability of powers outside the executive branch to effectively access the OAS.", "OAS member states acknowledged that democratic breakdowns justify collective action when they adopted the Democratic Charter, but they also placed limits on the Democratic Charter's application to defend the principle of nonintervention. The OAS is not allowed to intervene in situations where democratic institutions appear to be threatened unless the country requests assistance and collective action without a member state's consent can only take place after a rupture in the democratic order has already taken place. In 2009, for example, polarization between governmental institutions in Honduras had been building for several months before then-president Manuel Zelaya was arrested by the military and forced into exile. The Honduran government did not request OAS assistance until shortly before the June 2009 ouster, however, and Zelaya was removed from office a day before an OAS special commission was due to arrive in the country to assess the situation. Consequently, member states were unable to take collective action in Honduras until the country was already in crisis. The unanimous decision to suspend Honduras from the OAS and subsequent diplomatic efforts were incapable of reversing the situation.", "The Democratic Charter's failure to define what constitutes \"an unconstitutional interruption of the democratic order or an unconstitutional alteration of the constitutional regime that seriously impairs the democratic order\" has further limited its application. In several countries in the region, democratically elected leaders have engaged in actions that generally follow constitutional procedures but eliminate checks and balances to consolidate power. Since the Democratic Charter is not clear about whether such actions are violations, member states have been unwilling to respond, deferring instead to the principle of nonintervention. For example, the IACHR documented the Venezuelan government's steady erosion of democratic institutions for more than a decade before Secretary General Almagro invoked the Democratic Charter in May 2016, requiring the Permanent Council to undertake a collective assessment of the situation. Although most member states now support OAS efforts to restore democratic governance in Venezuela, a small group of countries aligned with Venezuela has been able to block nearly every resolution on the matter.", "The composition of the OAS has served as a third barrier to applying the Democratic Charter. The members of the Permanent Council, who are charged with assessing democratic crises, represent their nations' executive branches. Accordingly, they have interpreted the Democratic Charter's requirement that the OAS receive consent from \"the government concerned\" prior to intervention to mean consent from the nation's executive power. As a result, other branches of government and civil society groups are effectively unable to invoke the Democratic Charter's collective action mechanisms. In December 2004, for example, then-president Lucio Gutierrez of Ecuador dissolved the Supreme Court. Although some within the country called for the Democratic Charter to be invoked, OAS member states took no action. It was only in April 2005, after the Ecuadoran Congress had removed Guti\u00e9rrez and the new President, Alfredo Palacio, requested OAS assistance, that member states sent a mission to the country.

", "The 115 th Congress has sought to utilize the OAS as part of its broader efforts to address the deterioration of democracy in Venezuela. For example, S.Res. 35 , which the Senate approved by unanimous consent in February 2017, expresses support for Secretary General Almagro's invocation of the Inter-American Democratic Charter, calls on the Permanent Council to undertake a collective assessment of the situation in Venezuela, and urges the President to support OAS efforts to promote democratic solutions to the political impasse. Similarly, H.Res. 259 , passed by the House in December 2017, recognizes Almagro's leadership in promoting democracy in Venezuela, urges OAS member states to push for free and fair elections and the release of all political prisoners, and encourages the President to work with partners at the OAS to impose targeted sanctions against individuals responsible for the deterioration of democratic institutions in Venezuela.", "Despite agreement among many Members of Congress that the OAS should apply the Democratic Charter more broadly, there appears to be little appetite in the region\u2014even among U.S. allies\u2014for such actions. Given the asymmetrical power relations and the long history of U.S. intervention in the hemisphere, many nations are wary of establishing precedents for foreign involvement in internal affairs. Indeed, they have often used the OAS to engage in defensive multilateralism designed to constrain unilateral U.S. action. Given this aversion to intervention, member states are unlikely to invoke the collective action mechanisms of the Democratic Charter in the near term except in cases of democratic breakdowns that resemble traditional coups d'\u00e9tat."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges to the Inter-American Human Rights System", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The inter-American human rights system, which is widely viewed as one of the most effective parts of the OAS, has faced a number of challenges in recent years. In 2011, for example, the Permanent Council established a special working group to examine the IACHR after the commission made a series of decisions that rankled governments in the region. During the review process, some member states called for far-reaching changes to the IACHR, including proposals to adopt more stringent criteria for granting precautionary measures, shift the focus of the IACHR's work away from individual cases toward general human rights promotion, remove the independent budget and staff of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, and end the practice of identifying countries that have human rights situations that deserve special attention in the IACHR's annual report. The IACHR ultimately rejected the most problematic recommendations and adopted a series of minor changes to its rules of procedure, policies, and practices. Although some member states have continued to push for more radical changes, they have been unsuccessful thus far.", "The inter-American human rights system also has struggled with a lack of resources. Roughly half of the IACHR's annual budget is drawn from the OAS Regular Fund, which is financed with member states' assessed dues. The remainder of the IACHR's budget depends on voluntary contributions from member states and international donors, which vary from year to year. In 2016, the IACHR was nearly forced to lay off 40% of its personnel and suspend a number of activities due to a sharp decline in voluntary contributions stemming from fiscal challenges among member states and a shift in priorities among European donors. The crisis ultimately was avoided after the IACHR received a late surge in donations. In 2017, the OAS General Assembly adopted a resolution to increase Regular Fund transfers to the IACHR and the Inter-American Court by 33% per year over the next three years, which will ensure that the inter-American human rights system is fully funded by 2020. This should place the system in a more sustainable financial position; however, it also could increase pressure on the rest of the OAS since member states did not pair the agreement with an increase in assessed contributions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Congress has expressed considerable support for the inter-American human rights system.

Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, which play important roles in providing access to justice for victims of crimes against humanity and other human rights violations and in defending freedom of the press.\" The committee recommended providing $5 million in voluntary contributions to the IACHR, including $500,000 for the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression.", "Nevertheless, some analysts argue that the United States lacks credibility in defending the human rights system given its unwillingness to ratify the hemisphere's human rights treaties. The United States signed the American Convention on Human Rights ( Treaty Doc. 95-21 ) in 1977, but the Senate has never provided its advice and consent to ratification. While some U.S. policymakers have expressed support for ratification, others have raised concerns about potential conflicts with U.S. law and international interference in U.S. domestic affairs. The reluctance of the United States and several other nations to ratify the American Convention has created a multitiered human rights system in the hemisphere that the IACHR and many OAS member states view as problematic.", "Beyond ratifying the American Convention, some observers argue that the U.S. government could demonstrate greater support for the inter-American human rights system by doing more to comply with the IACHR's recommendations for improving human rights in the United States. The IACHR has issued recommendations to the United States in 27 cases since 2001; as of 2016, the United States was in full compliance in one case, partial compliance in 10 cases, and noncompliance in 16 cases. Among other recommendations, the IACHR repeatedly has called on the United States to halt the use of capital punishment and ensure foreign nationals who are detained in the United States are informed of their right to consular assistance. Although the United States is currently subject to the jurisdiction of the IACHR under the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (adopted in 1948 alongside the OAS Charter), the U.S. government argues that the declaration does not create legally binding obligations.

At the same time, member states have required the OAS to provide annual cost of living increases to its employees and have continued to assign new mandates to the organization.
