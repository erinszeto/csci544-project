{"id": "R41770", "title": "Leasing and Selling Federal Lands and Resources: Receipts and Their Disposition", "released_date": "2011-04-14T00:00:00", "summary": ["Many laws have been enacted over the past century authorizing the sale or lease of lands or resources by the federal land management agencies\u2014the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service (NPS), and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Forest Service (USFS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The receipts from these leases and sales have been used for many purposes, including for local economic development, to recover some or all of the operating and capital costs, or to fund land management activities. In its legislative debates, Congress may consider how prices or fees should be set for the sale or use of federal lands and resources and whether and how the receipts from such sales or leases should be used to fund desired activities.", "The various resources sold or leased generate substantial federal revenues\u2014nearly $16 billion annually for FY2007-FY2009. Leases for oil and gas and other minerals have generated the vast majority of these receipts, averaging $10.3 billion from offshore leasing and $4.4 billion from onshore leasing, although the amounts fluctuate widely from year to year. Recreation ($253 million) and timber sales ($223 million) also generate significant receipts annually. Other resource sales and leases generate lesser amounts\u2014hardrock mining ($60 million), BLM land sales ($35 million), geothermal leasing ($30 million), and grazing ($17 million). Various other programs (e.g., special use fees) generated nearly $500 million in FY2009.", "The pricing mechanisms for the various land and resource sales and leases vary widely. For many leases and sales, the fees are determined administratively. This can be (1) to recover agency administrative costs, such as for hardrock mining and for mineral leasing permit fees; (2) to approximate a fair market value, such as for BLM land sales; or (3) to account for other factors established in law, such as for grazing and recreation. For some resource leases and sales, competitive bidding is used to establish prices for some resources, such as for timber and mineral leasing bonuses. In a few situations, prices are set in the legislative authorization for the lease or sale program. For mineral resources, multiple pricing mechanisms are used, often with a combination of administrative fees and competitive bids.", "Many of the receipts can be spent without further appropriation by Congress; these accounts have mandatory spending authority. Other receipts are deposited in designated accounts or the General Treasury, and cannot be spent without an annual appropriation.", "Many of the receipts are granted to state or local governments, generally as compensation for the tax-exempt status of federal lands and resources. The portion of receipts granted to state and local governments varies widely by the type of resource leased or sold and by the history of the lands, and ranges from 0% (for recreation) to 90% (for mineral leasing in Alaska). Other receipts are commonly deposited into designated accounts for particular agency activities, to recover the cost of administering the lease or sale program or to restore or enhance the affected lands and resources, with remaining receipts deposited in the General Treasury. For some sales or leases, the portion deposited in the General Treasury is fixed\u2014for example, 10% of onshore lease receipts, 37.5% of grazing receipts from certain lands, and 0% for recreation. For others, however, the deposits to many of the accounts vary, often being determined on each lease or sale, and thus the remaining portion deposited in the General Treasury, if any, fluctuates."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["A multitude of laws enacted over the past century authorize the lease or sale of federal lands and resources by federal agencies\u2014the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service (NPS), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) in the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Forest Service (USFS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

At a time of heightened fiscal concerns, the sale or lease of lands and resources presents opportunities to increase federal receipts and/or to use receipts to reduce the federal deficit, and ultimately the burden on federal taxpayers. On the other hand, a significant portion of receipts historically has been paid to state and local governments.", "In authorizing land and resource sales and leases, Congress can choose how fees or prices are to be established. Some sales and leases are offered and bid competitively, and thus the price is a value determined by the market. Other leases and sales are made at prices either specified in law or set administratively within statutory guidelines. Some administered prices are intended to estimate a fair market value, such as the appraisals for federal land sales. Other administered prices reflect other factors; for instance, grazing fees are to reflect sale prices of beef cattle, among other factors.", "In some instances, there has been considerable debate over the factors to be considered in setting fees. Some have raised concerns that administered fees differ from the prices that would occur in a competitive market. BLM and USFS grazing fees, for example, have been noted to be below the fees charged by other landowners. Critics argue that the low fees are a substantial subsidy to the ranching industry; others contend that the fees reflect that public land ranching is an economically marginal operation, and that higher grazing fees would drive many ranchers out of business. Similarly, hardrock mining fees recover at least some administrative costs, but return none of the value of the minerals extracted from the federal land; however, free access to the minerals has promoted economic development in many areas. ", "Congress can also choose how to allocate receipts from any of the land and resource sale or lease programs it creates or amends. One issue is whether to provide mandatory spending authority for the receipts. Proponents of mandatory spending for particular programs generally are seeking greater financial stability, as compared to the vagaries of the annual appropriations process. Opponents argue that all taxpayers should benefit from the sale or lease of public assets, and often desire the more intense oversight that comes with annual appropriations. Mandatory spending also can affect federal spending levels and the budget deficit.", "Another issue is how the receipts should be used. Some advocate using the fees to reduce the fiscal burden on taxpayers generally. However, some fees are intended to recover administrative costs, while others are intended to fund activities to restore lands and resources to pre-sale conditions. Other receipts are \"reinvested\" in federal land or resource management in some way. In general, users may be more likely to tolerate higher fees or prices if they see that the additional federal receipts are to be used for management programs that they benefit from, at least in the long run, if not immediately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Land Sales8", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Receipts", "paragraphs": ["Generally, only the BLM is authorized to sell lands that it administers.
