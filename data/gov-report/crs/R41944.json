Each component is subject to a number of adjustments to account for the characteristics of VA health care and the veterans who access VA's health care services. The EHCPM makes projections three or four years into the future based on data from the most recent fiscal year.

The Committee remains committed to providing the Department with every resource it requires to meet the needs of veterans, but it does not believe that the creation of a contingency fund, which takes control of medical resources out of the hands of the Department and places it within the jurisdiction of OMB, is prudent policy.
