Capacities range from tens to hundreds of megawatts, and the units can supply power to the grid for hours at a time. The primary form of centralized bulk power storage\u2014and in fact the only form of EPS of any type in commercial and widespread use\u2014is hydroelectric pumped storage (HPS). In an HPS system, pumps are used during off-peak periods, when surplus cheap electricity can be generated elsewhere on the power system, to move water to a reservoir at a higher elevation than the water source. During peak periods, when power is scarce and expensive, the water in the reservoir is released to move backward through the system, where it drives hydraulic turbines to produce electricity. About 70% of the power used to pump the water up into the reservoir is recovered when the process is reversed (see Figure 2 ).", "There are currently 37 operational HPS facilities in the United States with a total capacity of 19,696 MW. By comparison, total generating capacity in the United States is about 1 million MW. ", "Of the 37 operational HPS facilities, 34 plants with 89% of the total capacity were built prior to 1991. The last facility was completed in 1995. While plans have been discussed for additional projects it is unlikely that many more HPS facilities will be built. This is because the number of suitable sites is limited and there are environmental objections to the construction of large hydroelectric projects.", "The other form of centralized bulk power storage is compressed air energy storage (CAES). In this system compressors are used to inject air into a cavern developed within a salt dome or into another suitable geologic formation. To recover the power the compressed air is released, heated using a natural gas-fired combustion turbine, and used to help drive a turbine generator. A schematic of a CAES system is shown below ( Figure 3 ).", "Prototype CAES plants were built in 1978 in Germany (290 MW) and in 1991 in Alabama (the McIntosh plant, 110 MW). There are reportedly many sites in the United States suitable for construction of CAES units, and because the units have a relatively small above-ground footprint they may face less public opposition than HPS developments. New projects have been announced but construction has not started. The CAES technology is still evolving. For instance, the designers of the 1991 plant in Alabama are now seeking to build units using an improved \"second generation\" technology.", "One use of centralized bulk power storage systems is displacement of peaking generation. The cheap power captured in the facility during low-demand hours, such as the evening, can be used during the day to meet high loads in place of expensive-to-operate peaking power plants. An operationally related concept is price arbitrage, in which the cheap power stored at night is sold at a high price during the day.", "A new potential use for centralized bulk storage would be to compensate for the variability in output from wind and solar plants. For example, in some parts of the country the strongest and most consistent winds blow at night when demand is low. This surplus wind power can be captured in a storage facility and then used to meet demand during the day. Stored electricity (captured from any generating source) can also be used to backstop wind and solar power if weather conditions are unfavorable.

The project was funded in part by the Department of Energy (DOE). The battery was connected to the distribution system and is charged in the evening when demand is low; by providing power as needed during higher-demand daytime periods it alleviates an overloading problem and defers the need to build a new substation. In 2008 AEP installed two 1-MW batteries near Milton, WV, to relieve another distribution system overloading problem.", "Other existing or planned battery installations include:", "AES Energy Storage, an affiliate of the large power project developer AES Inc., has connected a 1-MW array of batteries carried in a truck trailer to the grid in Pennsylvania, and a similar 2-MW array at a wind farm it owns in California.

Xcel Energy, a Midwestern utility, is testing a trailer-carried 1-MW NaS battery at a wind farm it owns in Minnesota. The project has government and university partners. AEP installed three facilities of 2 MW each at sites in Ohio, West Virginia, and Indiana in 2008, and a 4-MW facility in Texas in 2009. The company reportedly aims to install 1,000 MW of battery capacity throughout its system by 2020. The New York Metropolitan Transit Authority installed a 1-MW NaS battery in January 2009.

The installation is a demonstration project funded in part by the state and federal governments and industry trade associations.", "Batteries can provide several different services to the power system. Depending on the technology, batteries can provide a local source of power for several hours, displacing or deferring the need for additional generating, transmission, or distribution capacity; provide a backup source of power to a local area if other parts of the grid fail (referred to as \"islanding\"); and provide grid \"regulation,\" a service described immediately below in the flywheel discussion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Flywheels", "paragraphs": ["A flywheel stores electricity in the form of mechanical energy in a spinning wheel or tube.

A 1-MW facility is being planned in conjunction with AEP for installation in Ohio.", "These projects are intended to provide regulation service to the power grid, a service which, as noted above, can also be provided by battery facilities. In this context \"regulation\" refers to the need for power grid operators to precisely match, moment to moment, the supply and demand for electricity. If supply and demand go too far out of synch, the power system can become unstable, consumer electrical equipment and appliances can be damaged, and ultimately the grid can fail. Because demand is constantly changing, the output of some power plants on a power system is constantly varied, up and down, to match demand. Because power plants generally operate most efficiently at a steady state, constant small-scale adjustments increase fuel costs and wear and tear on the generators.", "Although current flywheels can provide power for up to 15 minutes, regulation depends on their moment-to-moment ability to move power on and off of the grid. The need for regulation service may increase in the future as more wind and solar power with variable, weather-dependent output is connected to the power system. Regulation service from conventional generators has worked reliably for decades, but in principle a storage device such as a flywheel or battery could provide the service more efficiently. Flywheels and some types of batteries are EPS options for providing this capability. ", "Another service that is essential to maintaining the stability of the grid is reactive power supply. As explained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC):", "Almost all bulk electric power in the United States is generated, transported and consumed in an alternating current (AC) network. Elements of AC systems produce and consume two kinds of power: real power (measured in watts) and reactive power (measured in volt-amperes reactive, or var). Real power accomplishes useful work (e.g., running motors and lighting lamps). Reactive power supports the voltages that must be controlled for system reliability.", "Reactive power supply is essential for reliably operating the electric transmission system. Inadequate reactive power has led to voltage collapses and has been a major cause of several recent major power outages worldwide. And while the August 2003 blackout in the United States and Canada was not due to a voltage collapse as that term has been traditionally used, the final report of the U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force (April 2004) said that \"insufficient reactive power was an issue in the blackout.\" Dynamic capacitive reactive power supplies were exhausted in the period leading up to the blackout.", "Although generating plants produce real and reactive power, additional reactive power must be injected at various points throughout a power grid. This is currently accomplished by specialized devices, but flywheels are another potential option.

Photovoltaic power, probably the better-known technology, uses solar cells to directly convert sunlight to electricity. Solar thermal plants, also referred to as concentrated solar power (CSP), concentrate sunlight to heat a working liquid, such as water, to produce steam that drives a power-generating turbine. Several parabolic trough-type CSP installations have operated successfully in California since the 1980s, and the 64-MW Nevada Solar One plant began operating in 2007. ", "Several new solar thermal projects, with capacities in the hundreds of megawatts, are in development. A potential advantage of solar thermal systems is the ability to produce electricity when sunlight is weak or unavailable by storing solar heat, such as in the form of molten salt. In such a system the concentrated solar energy is used to melt salts (such as sodium and potassium chloride). A heat exchanger (also referred to as a steam generator) is used to capture heat from the salt to produce steam, which then drives a power turbine ( Figure 6 ). Reportedly up to 93% of the stored energy can be recaptured for steam production.", "Molten salt storage was used at the test Solar One/Two plant in the United States, and is being used now at the 50-MW Andasol 1 plant in Spain (a second 50-MW block is under construction and a third is planned). The Spanish plant can run at full load for 7.5 hours using stored heat. The disadvantage of adding molten salt storage to a CSP plant is the additional cost and complexity. For example, the developer of the 400-MW Ivanpah CPS project in California decided not to use molten salt storage in the project in order to reduce costs and make the project \"commercially viable by getting rid of the extras.\" The decision on whether to add storage to a project pivots on the balance between the incremental costs and the additional revenues available by being able to provide firm service over an extended operating day."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Residential Electricity Storage", "paragraphs": ["Batteries can be used to store electricity in individual homes, either in battery banks or in the battery packs of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), or at small sites serving a group of homes.

The idea is that surplus PV power generated during the day can be stored and used when less sunlight is available or home demand is high. With current battery technology these systems can be bulky, require power conversion electronics, and require significant maintenance and replacement time and expense. More advanced battery technology could reduce costs and improve performance.", "PHEVs have battery packs that can be charged through a home's power system. As with fixed in-home battery banks, the notion is to use off-peak power to charge the battery. These systems and the vehicles that would use them are still under development but have garnered a great deal of interest and government and industry attention. ", "The interaction between in-home storage and the power system is complex. The electricity stored in the batteries can be viewed as a resource only for and under the control of the homeowner. An alternative concept, which is closely tied to the notion of a smart grid (discussed below), is that the utility would have control over the operation of the batteries. For example, utility control of a large network of distributed batteries could allow the utility to rely on power stored in the batteries during off-peak hours, such as the evening, to meet daily peak demands. This approach requires less construction of transmission and generation facilities than with traditional utility methods. However, it also means that the utility and not the homeowner would have control over charging and discharge cycles.", "Utility control may be problematic in particular for PHEVs, since a homeowner planning a relatively long late afternoon trip may not want the utility taking power out of his or her vehicle's battery pack to meet mid-day system peaks. On the other hand, some degree of utility control and/or government regulation will be needed to prevent situations where homeowners try to charge PHEV batteries during peak periods, which would increase system costs and perhaps degrade system reliability.", "In-home storage also competes with the concept of \"net metering.\" Net metering provides for a utility to buy surplus power generated by the home PV system (or other generating system). The system owner then receives either a cash payment or electricity in kind when home demand exceeds PV output. Net metering arrangements vary by locality and may provide superior economics to home power storage.", "Multi-home electricity storage involves a small battery facility that would serve several homes, perhaps half-a-dozen, with several hours of storage. The facility would be owned, controlled, and maintained by the local utility, and would be used for peak shaving, as a backup power supply, and for power quality control. This kind of centralized facility would presumably benefit from economics of scale compared to individual home battery banks, but the homeowner would also lose control of the storage.

This type of storage is currently economical for commercial and industrial establishments, such as office buildings. Cooling storage is a commercial technology sold by several vendors.", "Cooling storage affects the power system by shaving peak demand and shifting load . As shown below in Figure 7 , by cutting air conditioning load during the day the cooling storage cuts peak demand. This reduces the need to operate, or even to build, some relatively high-priced natural-gas-fired peaking plants. However, the load is not eliminated, but shifted to the non-peak hours when the storage system makes ice.", "The effect of the load shifting and peak shaving is likely to be a reduction in total costs to consumers. This is for three reasons:", "The shifted load would be met in most utility systems by coal or natural gas combined cycle plants that are under-utilized in the evening. These are cheaper to operate than peaking plants. However, to the extent that carbon dioxide emissions are a concern, shifting more load to coal-fired plants may be an issue. In restructured markets, power prices for all generators are set by the price of the marginal\u2014that is, highest priced\u2014generating unit to operate during a certain time period, such as hourly. By reducing the peak load on generating units, and therefore the need to operate higher-cost peaking units, peak shaving can have a substantial impact on total power costs. Making ice during relatively cooler evening hours is somewhat more efficient than running air conditioning during the hottest daytime hours. This efficiency gain can essentially eliminate any power losses in the storage process.", "The economics of cooling storage can be improved by a load management \"aggregator.\" The aggregator is a kind of broker that combines the capacity of multiple cooling storage installations into a block that can be sold to a utility as a single, guaranteed load management resource.", "Cooling storage is limited to the cooling season and by the amount of capacity that can be installed, which is a function of the amount of air conditioning load in suitable buildings.

This is, roughly speaking, in the range of costs for building a new coal plant at the low end ($2.5 billion) and a new nuclear power plant at the high end ($4 billion). Perhaps even more important than the cost of HPS are the perceived environmental impacts, including flooding of valleys to create reservoirs and damage to wildlife habitats. Environmental objections to HPS are so severe that they have delayed the operation of completed plants. For example, an HPS facility at the Richard B. Russell Dam and Lake in Georgia was essentially completed in the mid-1980s, but did not enter service until 2002 due to environmental litigation and related testing. The HPS capacity at the Harry S. Truman Dam and Reservoir in Missouri has never been used commercially for environmental reasons.", "Other storage technologies do not have the same environmental issues as HPS (although issues may arise if storage systems become more common ), but they appear to share the HPS issue of high cost. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) capital cost estimates shown in Table 2 are roughly comparable to those of the current range of conventional fossil and nuclear generating technologies. However, the operating times of conventional power plants are, with the exception of peaking units, measured in days and months, rather than the hours and minutes of storage technologies. Also, storage systems generally return to the grid less power than they store. Consequently, storage devices have fewer kilowatt-hours of output to spread their costs over than conventional generators, which increases the cost per kwh. The Table 1 estimates, which EPRI is planning to update in a more comprehensive form by the end of 2009, also do not account for maintenance, battery replacement, and financing expenses.", "Storage technology continues to evolve and with more advanced systems and economies of scale from mass production the costs could decline.

This ruling was eventually upheld by FERC, \"effectively leaving [the] storage [project] in a state of limbo.\"", "It may seem odd that an HPS project, using the one storage technology with a long track record, should fall between the cracks in the regulatory system. However, HPS projects were for the most part constructed years ago in a different and much simpler regulatory environment, and although the technology has been used for decades the handful of HPS facilities has not produced an extensive or definitive set of regulatory precedents. The quandary is summarized by one analysis:", "Transmission owners with assets managed by independent system operators (ISO) can't put storage assets in their [regulated] rate base, because those assets also provide [deregulated] generation services. Similarly, distribution utilities frequently can't justify the cost of energy storage only on the basis of its distribution-system benefits. And generation companies struggle to make energy storage pay off, because the market hasn't yet developed bilateral contracts that value the full range of energy storage services.", "In 2008 and 2009, RTOs began to change their rules, procedures, and operating software systems to account for electricity storage. ISO New England, the New York ISO, and the Midwest ISO (MISO) have all adopted temporary or permanent rules changes to facilitate the use of EPS for regulation services. However, these changes do not address other storage services or the potential contribution of large-scale storage projects. For example, one power company has asked FERC to require MISO to begin discussing \"with stakeholders potential modifications to its Tariff or business practices to allow the incorporation of the long-term storage technologies.\" In a development that may prove significant, a FERC commissioner stated in July 2009 that the agency is exploring whether to adopt a national EPS pricing policy that would address such issues as the ability of storage devices to act as both generation and transmission facilities.", "Traditional markets, where rates for vertically integrated utilities are set for a bundle of services by state utility commissions, present a simpler but still problematic environment for storage projects. Because in these markets separate prices are often not exposed for individual services, such as spinning reserve, it can be difficult to decide how to value a storage project. EPS may also compare unfavorably with alternative technologies with more cost and technical certainty. For example, quick-start combustion turbines are a mature technology that can be used for spinning reserve, regulation, and black start. They do not have other capabilities that storage can provide, such as price arbitrage, but this may be outweighed in the eyes of utility commissions by the fact they are known commodities. One utility executive said that: ", "\"if the cost of that [electricity storage] solution for now is 30% higher than a traditional solution, then you've got to have a willingness on the part of regulators or governmental agencies to either go ahead and put things in rate base that are a little more expensive for now, knowing that what we're doing is incubating a new technology.\" Alternatively, incentives must be found \"that enable you to make up that cost differential\u2014in the case of storage it seems like it's coming up around 30%.\"", "On the other hand, utility commissioners may be reluctant to spend ratepayer money on what they view as technological experiments. Another consideration are the economic incentives utilities face in traditional markets. In these markets the allowed rate of return is in part a function of the size of the utility's \"rate base\"\u2014that is, the amount of capital invested in plant and equipment. Other things being equal, the larger a utility company's capital investments the more money it will be allowed to earn in rates. This incentive can make public utility commissions skeptical of utility plans to invest in expensive new technologies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transmission Planning as an Institutional Issue", "paragraphs": ["Many analysts have identified a need to expand the national transmission system. The objectives of system expansion include renewable energy development, transmission line congestion relief, and reliability improvement. Proposals for how to plan and implement transmission grid expansion can be categorized as follows:", "National transmission \"interstate highway\" system . This concept envisions multi-billion-dollar development of a new network of high-voltage transmission lines spanning the continent. Planning has not proceeded past general concepts. Major interregional projects . These projects involve long-distance, interregional transmission construction, though not at the scale of the national system discussed above. Regional development . This concept would rely on local and nearby renewable resources rather than distant resources. An example is serving Northeastern demand for renewable power with PV generation, off-shore wind farms, and hydroelectric power imports from Quebec. Integrated Solutions . This approach aims to give full attention to non-transmission and non-generation alternatives, in addition to large-scale transmission projects. These alternatives include small-scale transmission projects, local renewable resources, demand response and energy efficiency, and EPS. Although this is the most comprehensive planning approach, it also makes transmission planning into something much more akin to development of a complete electric system plan for a region. Integrated planning implies involvement of a large range of stakeholders, complex analyses, consideration of long-term economic objectives, and perhaps a time-consuming process.", "Electricity storage potentially fits into all of these approaches to transmission planning, but in perhaps different ways. For example, large centralized storage facilities might play a role in national or regional transmission projects intended to bring large amounts of wind power from the northern plains to cities; distributed storage could be used in the regional planning approaches. But one question is to what extent will EPS be considered at all.", "These varying approaches to transmission planning reflect major divides in views of the future of the power system. One divide is between those who believe that major, long-distance transmission development is unavoidable, largely to access new sources of renewable power, and the alternative view that local resource development can obviate much of the need for new transmission lines. A second, perhaps even more fundamental divide, is between traditional utility approaches to resolving power systems issues\u2014which focus on central station power plants and large transmission projects\u2014and new approaches which rely on diverse resources. EPS is an example of an alternative resource that does not fit easily into the traditional utility paradigm. This is in part because many storage technologies are distributed rather than centralized, and in part because single storage technologies can serve multiple purposes\u2014it is a peg that fits into several holes, round and square, of different sizes.", "Which transmission planning approach\u2014or approaches\u2014are ultimately adopted will be the result of policy decisions informed by many technical, cost, and political considerations. The degree to which EPS plays a role in these planning decisions and planning processes may be influenced in part by federal policy, as discussed in the next section of the report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, EPS faces regulatory, economic, and institutional barriers to widespread acceptance.

As noted above, this raises the question of how quickly and effectively the power industry and its federal and state regulators will be willing to pursue and deploy new approaches that are cost-effective. A DOE study sums up the adoption issue:", "A utility that is guaranteed [by regulators] to receive cost recovery of either a transmission or generation project, or both, may have little incentive to put an energy storage project in place. Rather than invest in energy storage technology, a utility may simply opt to construct a transmission and/or generation facility, the costs of which are more likely to be approved and recovered. In addition, state utility regulators may be reluctant to allow cost recovery for an innovative energy storage technology. State utility regulators may instruct the utility to rely on proven technology to address issues that could be solved through energy storage technology.", "As discussed above, efforts are underway at the state and federal level to address the regulatory issues.

In 2008 DOE published 20% Wind Energy by 2030: Increasing Wind Energy's Contribution to U.S. Electricity Supply , a major study that \"examines some of the costs, challenges, and key impacts of generating 20% of the nation's electricity from wind energy in 2030.\" A major issue in integrating large amounts of wind capacity into the power system is the variability of wind power. Large-scale wind integration requires steps to compensate for the times when wind power is either reduced or unavailable due to weather conditions. To date this has not been a major issue because few areas have sufficient wind power to create integration issues, but this is expected to change in the future.", "The conventional approach to wind integration is to install quick-start natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants to back up wind power. Other options that have been proposed include geographic dispersion of wind farms, improved wind power forecasting techniques, implementation of demand response and smart grid technologies and procedures, aggregation of utility control areas, and EPS. However, DOE's study essentially disregards the EPS option. ", "There is no unanimity of opinion on the extent to which EPS will be needed, if at all, to integrate large amounts of wind and other renewable power capacity into the grid. The American Wind Association, for example, believes that electricity storage is too costly and is unnecessary for wind integration. However, this opinion is not universally held. For example, a recent North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) study of renewable integration concluded that \"Additional flexible resources, such as demand response, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and storage capacity, e.g., compressed air energy storage (CAES), may help to balance the steep ramps associated with variable generation.\" A white paper issued by the American Society of Chemical Engineers concluded that large-scale electricity storage \"is the critical technology needed by renewable power if it is to become a major source of baseload dispatchable power to eventually replace fossil/nuclear plants.\" The chief of the PJM Interconnection, the operator of the power grid in much of the Middle Atlantic and Midwest, believes that 1,000 MW or more of CAES will be needed on the PJM system to support growing wind capacity, and two utilities in California have recently announced proposed CAES and battery projects to facilitate wind power integration. With this diversity of opinions, it is unclear why the DOE study would not take more cognizance of options like EPS and demand response as part of the suite of tools available to integrate wind into the power system.", "Another example of a perhaps narrow agency focus is a recent FERC study, A National Assessment of Demand Response Potential . In response to a mandate included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the report assesses the demand response potential, state by state, for the period 2010 through 2019. The estimates are made for several scenarios which incorporate varying levels of technological advancements and changes to rate structures, including:", "Dynamic rates, in which the rates charged for electricity vary daily or in real time to reflect wholesale power prices and scarcity in electricity supplies. This is a substantial departure from the average price rates typically charged to residential customers. Dynamic rates combined with \"enabling technologies\" that automatically respond to high power prices by reducing a home's electricity demand. Direct load control of consumer equipment, such as air conditioners, by the utility. Interruptible tariffs, in which large industrial and commercial customers agree to reduce demand under certain conditions in return for a financial incentive. Other programs aimed at reducing demand as needed from large industrial and commercial customers.", "Some of these approaches to demand response are currently routine or can be easily implemented, such as interruptible tariffs and direct load control. Dynamic rates, as noted, would represent a substantial change for residential customers and have been controversial. The enabling technologies that can augment dynamic rates have been pilot tested at a residential scale but not widely deployed. Depending on the scenario, the study assumes up to universal installation of smart meters, 60% to 70% customer participation in dynamic pricing, and 60% of customers using enabling technologies.", "A potential oversight issue is whether FERC has been unnecessarily restrictive in the choice of technologies and options it examined for reducing and shifting peak demands (a central goal of demand response programs). The report states that:", "Other examples [of currently high-cost options] include battery storage and thermal energy storage. Both items hold the potential to significantly reduce peak demand on a permanent basis by shifting it to off-peak periods. As in the case of photovoltaic arrays, cost is a significant barrier to their rapid market penetration today. Another example is behind-the-meter generation which includes a diverse set of technologies including small conventional generation units that are used as back-up generation during emergencies and cogeneration systems that combine heat and power, largely in industrial process applications.", "It is not clear why universal roll-out of smart meters (itself a multi-billion-dollar expense), widespread deployment of thermostats that respond to power prices, or large-scale implementation of dynamic pricing (a ratemaking approach currently almost unknown in the residential sector) would be more likely than deployment of EPS systems by 2019. Also unclear is the treatment of distributed generation\u2014which in the industrial and commercial sectors has been used routinely for decades \u2014as a developmental option.", "FERC perhaps had to limit the range of options it could consider in its demand response report, but this study and the DOE wind report also reflect the risks of not giving fuller attention to the full range of options available to meet power system needs.
