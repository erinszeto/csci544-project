However, until very recently, there has been little mention or visibility of potential shortages in the Army's officer corps. This problem is currently unique to the Army. While specific skill shortages and imbalances have been reported by the other services, only the Army is reflecting service-wide active component shortages.", "The Army currently projects an officer shortage of nearly 3,000 in FY2007, with the most acute shortfalls in \"senior\" captains and majors with 11 to 17 years of experience. For example, the Army considers any personnel \"fill rate\" (the number of officers available to fill requirements) of less than 85% a \"critical\" shortage, and projects a fill rate of 82.6% for majors in FY2007.", "The Army further projects an increased shortage of more than 3,700 officers the following year, and estimates that annual shortages in excess of 3,000 officers will persist through FY2013 unless accessions (the number of new lieutenants brought to active duty annually) can be increased and retention can be improved. It presently takes 10 years to \"grow\" a major (from lieutenant to promotion to major), and 14 years if that major is an academy or ROTC graduate. Therefore, the projected shortage appears to be a significant long-term challenge especially as the Army continues to transform and maintain a significant role in fighting the Global War on Terror (GWOT).", "This report analyzes a number of potential factors contributing to the shortfall, especially the impact of reduced officer accessions during and after the Army personnel drawdown of the early 1990s, and the significant increase in Army officer requirements caused by the Army force structure transformation to a modular, brigade-centric force through its Modular Force Initiative. At this time, the high deployment tempo associated with Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) does not appear to be associated with these shortfalls.", "Although the Army has already introduced several new programs to enhance officer retention, other possible options exist that could help address the Army's officer shortages.

This could result in 15% to 20% of all positions at the rank of major being vacant or filled by more junior and less experienced officers. While a number of potential causes are reviewed, this report will focus on two: reduced officer accessions (the number of new lieutenants brought to active duty annually) during and after the drawdown of the early to mid-1990s, and the significant increase in officer requirements as the Army transforms to a \"brigade-centric\" force, a key element in the Army's Modular Force Initiative.", "To at least partially address this situation, the Army has recently introduced several non-financial retention incentives that result in extended service obligations.

As a result, 82.6% of all requirements for the rank of major are projected to be filled, and the Army defines a personnel fill rate of 85% or less as a \"critical\" shortage.

This could have a negative impact on unit readiness or cause some officers to fill more than one position simultaneously. With the current operational and deployment tempo, this additional stress could result in higher attrition and, therefore, a worsening shortage situation. Other analysts, however, would argue that with an overall line officer population of approximately 52,000, a shortage of only 3,000 represents only a 6% shortfall and this is not a significant operational problem.

Accessing too many may necessitate voluntary and involuntary separation programs to sustain the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) promotion opportunity and timing for the cohort. This balance can be significantly impacted by relatively minor changes in historical patterns or trends such as attrition.", "During (1991-1996) and immediately following (1997-1999) the post-Cold War drawdown, the Army under accessed officers in an effort to meet congressionally mandated strength levels.

After a slight drop to 4,300 in FY2004, the accession target has stabilized at 4,600 in both FY2005 and 2006. In most of these years, the number of officers actually accessed has fallen slightly short of these targets, but never by more than 5%.", "Since Year Groups 1991 through 2002 represent the bulk of today's shortages, this appears to confirm that the Army under accessed during this period and thus ultimately contributed to the current problem.

If the structure requires more junior personnel, this can usually be corrected by increasing accessions. If, however, the structure requires more senior personnel, the problem is more difficult to correct and resolution is longer term.", "The Army's Modular Force Initiative, also known as \"modularity,\" has resulted in the active Army redesigning its current 10 active duty division force into a force of 42 or 43 brigade combat teams (BCT) to better meet current and future operational requirements. This conversion is scheduled to be completed in FY2007. The redesign has resulted in entirely new organizational structures and significantly changed officer requirements.", "Specifically, from 2001 to the present, Army \"line\" officer requirements have increased by 4,131 spaces due to the modular force initiative.

Therefore, most of the Army's shortage of captains and majors projected for FY2007 (2,708) and for FY2008 (3,716) can be attributed to the Army's increased requirements due to its transformation to modular BCTs.", "If these additional requirements at the grades of captain and major cannot be filled, some would argue that the conversion timeline should be extended, that fewer units should be converted, or that the Army should reassess the optimum structure of the BCTs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Attrition", "paragraphs": ["Attrition is defined as the percentage of officers who voluntarily or involuntarily separate during a fiscal year before achieving retirement eligibility.

Higher than anticipated attrition at this point will, over time, result in shortages of senior captains and majors.", "Historically, attrition for this cohort completing their service obligation has averaged 8.5% annually with only slight year-to-year variances. An increase in attrition among this cohort would certainly contribute to an officer shortage, and this would seem plausible given the high operational tempo experienced by the Army since 9/11, which some believe has a negative impact on retention in the military. However, this does not appear to be the case. From 2001 through 2005, attrition for this cohort averaged 7.8% and is projected at 8% for FY2006, all below the historical averages.", "Recently, there has been concern expressed regarding the somewhat higher attrition than expected from the USMA Class of 2000 which completed their service obligation in 2005.

But, as previously discussed, there has been no dramatic increase in attrition to date. However, analysts suggest the deployment tempo and attrition should be closely monitored because a recent survey of separating officers indicated that 48% were leaving due to lengthy family separations and 42.1% felt there were too many deployments.", "In summary, reduced accessions during and immediately following the drawdown in the 1990s and the increased officer requirements of the Modular Force Initiative appear to be the primary contributors to the current and projected shortage of captains and majors.

As a result, the active duty Army was reduced from approximately 777,000 service members to 495,000 during the period between 1989 and 1996 while the officer corps was downsized from 91,000 to 69,000.", "Beginning in 1991, annual officer accessions were reduced and many lieutenants on active duty were involuntarily separated through Lieutenant Retention Boards . Captains were permitted to voluntarily separate prior to completing their active duty service obligations (ADSO) and were later offered relatively robust financial incentives under the Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI) and Special Separation Benefit (SSB) programs. Officers opting for the VSI received an annual annuity for twice their number of years of service while SSB provided a lump sum payment. If these programs failed to generate sufficient reductions, the Army could have resorted to involuntary Reduction-In-Force (RIF), but this was never necessary for captains.The reduction in accessions and the separation of lieutenants and captains from 1991 to 1996 had a significant bearing on current officer shortages because many of these individuals would be majors today if they had remained in the Army. Other voluntary and involuntary programs were used to separate more senior officers.", "By the end of 1995, over 20,000 officers had been voluntarily or involuntarily separated or retired through one of the drawdown programs; a total of 1,681 lieutenants and 8,959 captains were included in this total.

Since 2001, the Army has exceeded the DOPMA promotion goals at every rank and almost every year as reflected in the table below.

Some analysts would argue that these unusually high promotion rates, combined with wartime strains and the emphasis on manning the modular units, may have diluted the overall quality of the Army officer corps.", "Closely linked to promotion opportunity is the role of Selective Continuation, the retention on active duty of officers who are twice nonselected for promotion to the next higher grade. For example, the DOPMA goal for promotion to major is 80%, which means that 20% of the captains would not be selected for promotion in any given year. If this 20% is again nonselected by the next promotion board, they would normally be involuntarily separated under the \"up or out\" promotion system. Selective continuation allows these two time \"non-selects\" to continue serving.", "However, the continuing Presidential Declaration of National Emergency has enabled the Army to exceed the DOPMA promotion goals and to expand the number of officers who are offered Selective Continuation. Those officers who are selectively continued may remain on active duty, will remain eligible for promotion consideration, and can generally continue to serve until their mandatory retirement date.

However, Congress, which had required 18 months in the grade of first lieutenant when DOPMA was passed in 1981, increased this requirement to 24 months effective October 1, 2005. Because of the Declaration of National Emergency discussed earlier, the Army has temporarily suspended the 24 month requirement and continued to promote to captain at the 38 month point.

How the Army Recruits and Manages the Officer Corps", "paragraphs": ["Management of the Army's commissioned officer corps is a dynamic, highly visible and complex system that is significantly influenced by law and policy. Historically, the Congress has been very interested in all aspects of officer management and supportive of enhancing the effectiveness and professionalism of the officer corps.", "A number of parameters frame and define the challenges of managing the Army's officer corps:", "Multiple Commissioning Sources. Army officers are commissioned by three primary sources: the U.S. Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, N.Y.; the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) located on 272 college and university campuses; and the Officer Candidate School (OCS) program at Fort Benning, GA. USMA and ROTC are generally four-year programs that result in a baccalaureate degree and commission followed by attendance at a basic branch course. OCS is a much shorter program\u201412 weeks\u2014which is also followed by attendance at a branch basic course. Historically, USMA and ROTC have been the primary sources of Army officers, with OCS providing a \"surge\" capability and advancement opportunity for talented enlisted personnel. While a college degree is not a prerequisite for OCS, by policy all officers must possess a degree to be eligible for promotion to captain. However, nearly 80% of recent OCS graduates have already earned a baccalaureate degree. Obligated Service. Officers enter active duty for an initial period of obligated service based on their source of commission. USMA graduates incur a five-year Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) while ROTC scholarship graduates have a four-year obligation and ROTC non-scholarship and OCS graduates incur a three-year obligation. Upon completion of this obligation, an officer may apply for voluntary separation or continue on active duty. Additional service obligations, of varying lengths, are required for certain reassignments and civil/military schools. \" Year Group \" (YG) Centric Officer Cohorts. All officers accessed to active duty during a fiscal year constitute a Year Group that will compete for promotion, school and command opportunities within the cohort as it progresses through a 30-year military career. For example, Year Group 2006 will enter active duty between October 1, 2005 and September 30, 2006. Of note for the discussion of officer shortages, a YG can be reduced after it is accessed, but it is difficult to enlarge it under the current system. Figure A-1 graphically depicts ideal or optimal Year Group management.", "Each of the vertical bars in Figure A-1 represents the projected strength of that Year Group with the shading indicating the proportion of the Year Group in a given rank. The sloping solid line represents the total number of officers required from each Year Group. Figure A-1 depicts the perfect personnel management situation where each YG is perfectly aligned with the requirements slope. Year Groups above the slope would be considered overstrength, while Year Groups below the slope would be understrength.", "\" Closed \" System. Officers usually enter the system at the lowest commissioned rank (second lieutenant) and will progress by promotion through as many as six officer ranks below general/flag officer . There is normally no lateral entry at a higher grade based on education or experience as would be found in an \"open\" system. (As an exception, lateral entry is permitted into the Medical Corps and Chaplain Corps.) \" Rank in Person. \" Rank or status is based on individual performance and competency, not the content or organizational position of a particular job. \" Up-or-Out \" Promotion System. The \"up\" represents promotion to the next higher grade; the \"out\" refers to the forced separation of those twice failing promotion to the next higher grade. This type of promotion system also supports a pyramid-shaped force structure which has a higher number of junior officer (company grade) requirements and fewer senior (field grade) requirements. Career Field Based Management. Officers are developed in only one basic branch and the branch remains primary for the first 10 years of an officer's career. Coincident with selection for promotion to Major, all Army Competitive Category officers are designated into one of four career fields-Operations , Information Operations , Institutional Support and Operations Support . Each Career Field brings together selected disciplines with associated functional expertise. Officers will then have repetitive assignments and compete for promotion within the career field. Only officers in the Operations Career Field and Army Acquisition Corps can compete for centrally selected command opportunities. Stable Career Paths. The Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1981 defined a general career path for all of the services by establishing limits or \"bands\" of promotion opportunity and promotion timing. This enables an officer to project whether a promotion is likely to occur and when. DOPMA promotion opportunity and timing are listed in Table A-1 , below.", "Short Careers. Compared to many in private industry and foreign militaries, U.S. officers have relatively short careers. They may retire at any age upon completion of 20 years of service and, unless promoted into the general officer ranks, will be mandatorily retired at 30 years. Maximum service is further defined by rank (lieutenant colonels at 28 years and colonels at 30 years ) and age (maximum age is 62 years )."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
