To accommodate the differing needs of such debtors, the Bankruptcy Code\u2014which is the primary source of bankruptcy law in the United States\u2014contains a variety of \"Chapters\" which create several different forms of bankruptcy proceedings. Although the end goal of each of those proceedings is to balance the conflicting interests of debtors, creditors, and other stakeholders, each Chapter has its own procedures, eligibility requirements, and forms of relief. Whereas some Chapters aim to liquidate the debtor, others attempt to reorganize the debtor so that it may continue to operate as a going concern, while still others adjust the debtor's debts.", "This report serves as a primer for Members and their staffs on the basics of U.S. bankruptcy law.

The Bankruptcy Code generally attempts to balance two competing policy concerns. On the one hand, bankruptcy aims to give honest debtors a \"fresh start\"\u2014that is, to grant debtors relief from certain debts they cannot repay\u2014so that they may \"reorder their affairs, make peace with their creditors, and enjoy 'a new opportunity in life with a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.'\" This fresh start generally comes in the form of a \" discharge \" of many forms of the debtor's debts, which consists of \"a legal right not to pay\" the discharged debts as well as \"safeguards against harassment by the creditor\" whose debt is discharged. At the same time, however, the bankruptcy system also attempts to maximize total creditor return by distributing a subset of the debtor's assets or income to creditors in an orderly, equitable, and efficient fashion. Thus, \"Congress and the judiciary are constantly striving to achieve a wise balance between\" offering \"a fresh start for debtors\" and ensuring \"fairness to creditors.\" To that end, Congress has frequently amended the Bankruptcy Code since its initial enactment in 1978 in an attempt to recalibrate that balance.", "Because recent estimates indicate that \"over a million people file bankruptcy every year,\" bankruptcy law is vitally important to Congress and the nation as a whole.

The remaining Chapters, which this report discusses below, create different types of bankruptcy proceedings for different types of debtors.", "The Bankruptcy Code is not, however, the only source of U.S. bankruptcy law. For one, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which are \"rules promulgated by the U.S. Supreme Court (on the recommendation of the U.S. Judicial Conference and its committees, and with the consent of Congress),\" \"provide a substantial set of procedural rules\" that govern bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Many courts have supplemented the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure by promulgating their own local procedural rules and orders that govern bankruptcy cases in their respective districts. The Judicial Conference of the United States has also promulgated official bankruptcy forms that litigants must use as templates when filing certain kinds of documents in a bankruptcy case.", "Other federal laws can impact bankruptcy cases as well. For example, both the U.S. Code and the U.S. Constitution restrict the types of issues that a bankruptcy judge may adjudicate.

The court may grant relief from the automatic stay \"for cause,\" as may exist when \"the hardship to the movant\" resulting from the enforcement of the automatic stay would outweigh \"the hardship to the debtor\" if the automatic stay were lifted, or when the debtor has filed bankruptcy in bad faith solely to prevent an impending foreclosure. Alternatively, the court may also grant relief \"with respect to a stay of an act against property\" if \"the debtor does not have an equity in such property\" and \"such property is not necessary to an effective reorganization\" of the debtor.
