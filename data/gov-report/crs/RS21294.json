The Navy plans to demonstrate the aircraft's suitability for carrier-based operations in 2013, and have it enter service in 2021 as a penetrating surveillance and reconnaissance system. The N-UCAS program was initiated as the UCAV-N program in conjunction with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In December 2002, the Department of Defense (DOD) decided to merge the Air Force and Navy UCAV programs into a Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) program. In October 2005, management of J-UCAS was transferred from DARPA, which had managed it since October 2003, to a joint Air Force-Navy office led by the Air Force. In February 2006, DOD announced that it was restructuring the J-UCAS program into a Navy-oriented UCAV program. The effort became a Navy program once again at the start of FY2007.

BAMS UAS is to work with the Navy's planned P-8 Multi-Mission Aircraft (or MMA\u2014the Navy's planned successor to the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft). Competitors for BAMS UAS include variants of the existing Global Hawk and Predator UAVs, and possibly an unmanned version of the Gulfstream 550. The Navy's FY2008-FY2013 aircraft procurement plan calls for procuring the first four BAMS UASs in FY2011, and four more each in FY2012 and FY2013. The first BAMSs are expected to enter service in 2013.
