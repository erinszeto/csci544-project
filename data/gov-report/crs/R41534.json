The South Korea-EU FTA (KOREU FTA) is the largest FTA in terms of market size that South Korea has entered into. The KOREU FTA reflects the EU and South Korean trade strategies to use FTAs to strengthen economic ties outside their home regions. It also builds upon the surge in trade and investment flows between South Korea and the EU over the past decade. On October 12, 2011, both houses of Congress passed implementing legislation for the U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS FTA), which the President signed into law (P.L. 112-41) on October 21. The KORUS FTA is expected to enter into force in early 2012.", "The KOREU FTA is very comprehensive. It would reduce and eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers in manufactured goods, agricultural products, and services and would also cover such trade-related activities as government procurement, intellectual property rights, labor rights, and environmental issues.", "Most studies done on the potential impact of the KOREU FTA estimate that the agreement will have a small but positive effect on the economies of the EU and South Korea as a whole and that the larger relative impact would be on the South Korean economy. The greatest economic impact of the KOREU FTA would be on specific sectors in each economy. EU services providers would be expected to experience gains from the agreement, especially in the areas of retail and wholesale trade, transportation services, financial services, and business services. In terms of trade in goods, EU exporters of pharmaceuticals, auto parts, industrial machinery, electronics parts, and some agricultural goods and processed foods would be expected to gain from the KOREU FTA's implementation. At the same time, South Korean manufacturers of cars, ships, wireless telecommunications devices, chemical products, and imaging equipment would be expected to increase their exports to the EU market.", "The KOREU FTA is similar to the KORUS FTA in many respects. Both agreements are comprehensive and both would eliminate tariffs on most trade in goods soon after they enter into force. However, they differ in other respects. Phase-out periods for tariffs on some manufactured goods differ. In addition, the KOREU FTA does not cover investment protection. Unlike the KORUS FTA, the KOREU FTA does not allow trade sanctions to be applied where violations of the workers' rights and environment provisions have been deemed to occur. In addition, the KORUS FTA covers a broader range of trade in services than does the KOREU FTA.

The KOREU FTA reflects the EU and South Korean trade strategies to use FTAs to strengthen economic ties outside their home regions. It also builds upon the surge in trade and investment flows between South Korea and the EU over the past decade, a period of time in which the 27 member states of the EU countries collectively passed the United States in economic importance to South Korea.", "The KOREU FTA is very comprehensive, generally mirroring the scope of the KORUS FTA, with some exceptions. As with the KORUS FTA, the KOREU FTA reduces and eliminates tariffs and other trade barriers in manufactured goods, agricultural products, and services and would also cover such trade-related activities as government procurement, intellectual property rights, labor rights, and environmental issues. However, the two agreements contain some basic differences in coverage, reflecting differing circumstances and priorities. For example, unlike the KORUS FTA, the KOREU FTA does not include a specific chapter on foreign direct investment and does not allow trade sanctions to be applied where violations of the labor and environment provisions have taken place. Differences also exist in how sensitive sectors such as automobiles are treated. For example, the KOREU FTA includes a duty drawback mechanism, while the KORUS FTA has added a special safeguard for motor vehicles in the event of a surge in South Korean automobile exports to the United States. The KOREU FTA has drawn the attention and interest of U.S. policymakers, including Members of Congress and the U.S. business community. The KOREU FTA could have an impact on U.S.-South Korean trade by possibly diverting some South Korean trade away from the United States to the EU and could provide the EU with a \"first mover\" advantage since it entered into force on July 1, 2011, and the KORUS FTA is expected to enter into force no earlier than early 2012. ", "This report is designed to shed some light on the KOREU FTA for Congress. It briefly reviews EU-South Korean economic ties and the respective EU and South Korean objectives regarding the KOREU FTA. It then discusses the KOREU FTA in general and examines some of its major provisions in more detail, with special focus on autos and some other manufacturing sectors, agriculture, services, and labor\u2014areas of particular interest to U.S. policymakers and the U.S. business community. The report does not attempt to determine if either the KORUS FTA or the KOREU FTA is better than the other. That determination can largely be subjective, since the priorities of the EU and the United States differed in some respects. In addition, the models used in measuring the quantifiable effects of the two agreements likely differ, leading to incompatible measurements. Nevertheless, where possible and relevant, the report draws general comparisons and contrasts with the KORUS FTA. Finally, the report analyzes the prospects for the KOREU FTA and the agreement's potential implications for the United States.

However, over the last decade, they both have not only been negotiating FTAs, but have done so at an accelerated pace. (See Table A-3 and Table A-4 for lists of EU and South Korean FTAs.)", "The EU was a pioneer in negotiating preferential trade arrangements (PTAs)\u2014a general term applied to an arrangement in which member countries agree to eliminate barriers to commerce among them. The EU itself is a single market, one of the most comprehensive PTAs, but has also used PTAs to anchor trade relations with neighboring countries, such as members of the European Free Trade Area (EFTA\u2014Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) and as a transition mechanism in trade relations with countries slated to accede to the EU. The EU has also employed PTAs to preserve preferential trade relationships with former colonies among developing countries. However, the EU imposed a moratorium on the formation of FTAs and other PTAs from 1999-2006 to focus attention on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations.", "The FTA with South Korea is part of a new wave of EU FTAs and part of an overall strategy\u2014referred to as Global Europe\u2014which the European Commission's Directorate General for Trade announced in 2006. The strategy was developed to respond to the challenges faced by EU members in a rapidly globalizing economy. An objective of that strategy is to work towards reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers in trade and to liberalize markets for foreign investment. The EU also places a priority on multilateral negotiations in the WTO and concluding the DDA to accomplish this objective.", "However, the EU also has determined that some barriers are currently too complex for multilateral negotiations or are otherwise beyond the purview of the WTO, for example, competition policy, regulatory issues, government procurement, and stronger intellectual property rights enforcement. As part of the Global Europe strategy, the EU has engaged in FTA negotiations with the objective that the FTAs are more appropriate vehicles to address these more complex issues and can serve as building blocks toward a more robust multilateral trading system. The Global Europe strategy sets down two main criteria for selecting FTA partners: (1) that the partner country offers sufficient market potential and (2) a sufficient level of growth opportunities that would result from the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers as a result of the FTA. Based on these criteria, along with the fact that South Korea had negotiated an agreement with the United States (a chief EU competitor) the European Commission identified South Korea as a priority country for an FTA. The EU has FTAs in force with Chile and Mexico and has been negotiating FTAs with Canada, India, and South Africa. (See Table A-3 .)

Both presented FTAs as necessary for advancing South Korea's economic well-being. Ongoing competitive pressure from Japanese firms, increased competition from Chinese enterprises, and the rapid ageing of the South Korean workforce have heightened the sense of urgency about boosting national competitiveness.

The KOREU FTA eliminates tariffs on virtually all manufactured goods in South Korea-EU bilateral trade within seven years and reduces or eliminates many nontariff barriers (NTBs). The agreement also establishes rules and procedures in trade in goods and services and addresses trade-related activities pertaining to intellectual property rights (IPR), labor rights, and environmental protection.", "Similar to the objectives of the KORUS FTA, the provisions in the pending KOREU FTA are intended to boost goods and services exports from the EU to South Korea by eliminating South Korean import duties and other barriers to trade in industries from autos and pharmaceuticals to consumer electronics and textiles and apparel. Exports from South Korea to the EU might increase in various manufacturing sectors but are not expected to surge since many EU tariffs are already relatively low and the EU's NTBs are for the most part not as significant as in South Korea.

The EU sought not only the elimination of South Korean tariffs on cars but also changes in regulations, including safety and emissions regulations, that EU manufacturers have complained are discriminatory and impede their access to the South Korean market, an issue that U.S. manufacturers constantly cite, that is addressed in the KORUS FTA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tariff Elimination on Passenger Cars and Trucks", "paragraphs": ["As shown in Table 2 , under the KOREU FTA, the EU and South Korea eliminate all of their tariffs on passenger cars and trucks over five years, including tariffs on electric vehicles.

But the 2010 supplemental agreement changed the original terms of the KORUS FTA. It now puts the U.S. and EU on roughly the same tariff elimination schedule, rather than abolishing them immediately. For instance, South Korea will eliminate its 8% tariff on U.S. passenger cars (including electric cars and plug-in hybrids) within five years following implementation. One exception is the U.S. truck tariff of 25%, which will remain for the first seven years following implementation and will then be phased out completely in year 10.", "Another difference is the 2010 KORUS FTA agreement added a special motor vehicle safeguard whereas the KOREU FTA offers protection in case of a sudden surge in imports via a general safeguard clause. The two agreements also diverge on rules of origin, which are used to verify that products are eligible for duty-free status under preferential trading programs. Under the KORUS FTA, automakers and most component manufacturers can use one of three options for calculating regional value content. The KOREU FTA requires importers of automotive products to use a different method for calculating regional vale content, the ex-works price method , than is allowed under the KORUS FTA. The foreign (non-originating) content level for autos under KOREU FTA should not exceed 45% of the ex-works price of the product, thus it follows that 55% of the content must come from either the European Union or South Korea. Administration experts assert that the regional value content requirements in the KORUS FTA and KOREU FTA are essentially equivalent since the KORUS FTA also requires that at least 55% of the value of the vehicle be comprised of content from South Korea or the United States.

Duty drawback allows an exporter to receive a rebate of any customs duties paid on imports that were integrated into the exported product. The KOREU FTA marks the first time the EU included such a provision in a bilateral or multilateral trading agreement.", "Duty drawback may be particularly important for automotive exports. Under this procedure, a South Korean car manufacturer could buy auto parts from manufacturers in low-cost countries such as China, import them into South Korea, and claim the duties back when the assembled vehicles are shipped to the European Union. As an example, Chinese radios could enter the EU duty-free as part of South Korean cars, whereas EU companies pay a 14% tariff when importing the same radios directly from China. ", "This duty drawback provision raises the question of whether the KOREU FTA will allow South Korean producers to relocate parts of their production chain to lower cost countries. European auto manufacturers have warned that the text could open the EU car market to autos with a significant percentage of Chinese components. The KOREU FTA includes a provision that could allow a Party to permanently cap refundable tariffs at 5% should there be a \"notable increase\" in foreign sourcing by South Korean manufacturers starting five years after the agreement goes into effect, but the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association has nonetheless strongly opposed the inclusion of the duty drawback provision in the KOREU FTA.

Foreign manufacturers wishing to sell in this market must meet South Korea's safety and environmental standards. This means foreign, including European and U.S., automakers must customize their vehicles for the South Korean market, which, these automakers claim, raises their costs and discourages imports. (Fewer than 61,000 foreign automobiles were sold in South Korea in 2009). U.S. car manufacturers, particularly Ford, consider South Korea's unique automobile standards a significant barrier to imports of U.S.-made cars to South Korea. Standards-related issues have been an important factor in holding up further consideration of the agreement in Congress. ", "EU negotiators also made automotive standards a priority in the negotiations on the KOREU FTA. NTB reforms on automotive trade include a regulatory convergence approach based on the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) standards, which commits South Korea to recognize as equivalents international automotive standards set upon implementation of the KOREU FTA. Another 29 safety standards related to such things as seat belts, passenger seats, headlamps, and rearview mirrors will be brought into line with UNECE standards over a five-year transitional period. All other standards not subject to harmonization or equivalence should be applied in a manner which does not limit market access. Any new standards would be based on UNECE standards, and going forward the KOREU FTA states new features and technologies should not hinder trade. ", "The KORUS FTA takes a different approach and includes a \"low volume seller exemption\" which would allow each U.S. automaker to sell up to 25,000 vehicles per year in South Korea built to U.S. safety standards without any additional modification. This is four times the level permitted in the 2007 KORUS FTA, which would have limited each U.S. automaker to 6,500 vehicles per year. Raising the level means U.S. carmakers will be able to build more cars to U.S. safety standards and export these automobiles to the smaller South Korea market without incurring any additional costs that alterations and adjustments to South Korean standards would require.

Tariffs on medical device exports will also be removed\u2014immediately for many products, phased in over three years for others, and over a longer period of time for a few selected products. The two FTAs tackle NTBs, as they are among the most important barriers to trade in pharmaceutical products and medical devices. The KOREU FTA also specifically provides that the South Korean authorities will introduce new rules to align their practices with international standards and a more secure regulatory environment will be introduced through a better recognition of the value of innovative products. In addition, the KOREU FTA also introduces detailed binding rules on transparency regarding decisions on reimbursement, and stipulates the possibility that pricing decisions can be reviewed by a court. The KOREU FTA provisions on pharmaceuticals also require that decisions on reimbursement and pricing be objective and clear. The pending KORUS FTA also includes NTB provisions which, among other things,\u00a0aim to improve transparency in the reimbursement process; put less complex regulatory policies in place; and ensure adequate enforcement of pharmaceutical patent rights to specifically protect proprietary data that manufacturers must submit for market approval. To further regulatory cooperation in the pharmaceutical and medical device sector, the KOREU FTA establishes a Working Group on Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices as would the KORUS FTA. Consumer electronics : Included in the KOREU FTA is a special annex on non-tariff barriers related to consumer electronics with an objective of addressing technical barriers, especially a lack of recognition of international standards. The KOREU FTA permits EU exporters to conduct safety testing in the EU, under certain conditions, effectively reducing their costs and cutting back on bureaucratic hurdles. In contrast, the KORUS FTA does not include separate provisions on standards, testing, and certification specifically for consumer electronics exports from the United States to South Korea. Textiles and apparel : Implementation of the KOREU FTA will result in the abolition of most tariffs on textiles and apparel, 92% of which will be eliminated immediately, with the others to be eliminated over five years. This is similar to the KORUS FTA. The KOREU FTA maintains the European Union's standard rules of origin with only a small number of exceptions. The KORUS FTA adopts a \"yarn forward\" rule, which means generally apparel using yarn and fabric from the United States and South Korea would qualify for preferential treatment.

However, both agreements differ slightly in how South Korea will be allowed to protect some of its more sensitive products. Because the EU is a smaller supplier of several such products compared to the United States, the size of many of the EU's preferential quotas in the Korean market may reflect this fact. For example, in year five, the EU's quota for natural honey will be 54 metric tons (MT), compared to the 225 MT quota granted to the United States. Further, South Korea's quotas for imports of three dairy products (non-fat dry milk, whole dry milk, and evaporated milk), natural honey, and seasonal oranges from the EU-27 will be indefinitely capped at the end of their respective transition periods. However, the size of the preferential quotas granted to the United States for these three same product categories will continue to increase 3% annually in perpetuity. Similarly, South Korea secured protection against import surges of nine agricultural products from the EU (compared to 30 products under the KORUS FTA). A \"safeguard\" will be automatically triggered when the quantity of a commodity entering the South Korean market exceeds a specified amount. When triggered, tariffs will temporarily revert to a higher level to give producers additional time to adjust to increased import competition.", "Though EU agricultural exports to South Korea are a small share of its total, observers note that the elimination of tariffs will particularly facilitate additional exports of pork products, wine, spirits, and processed foods.

Reflecting this objective, the EU in its FTA with South Korea secured protection for 162 GI-designated products (e.g., wines, spirits, cheeses, hams, and beers). South Korea secured GI recognition in the EU market for 64 of its GI-designated products (teas, spices, vegetables, rices, fruits, meats, among others). The U.S. dairy sector expressed concern that the GI-designation of various EU cheeses in the South Korean market could undercut the sale of U.S. generically labeled cheeses in that market with identical names. Accordingly, Members of Congress have urged the USTR to work with their counterparts to ensure that South Korean regulations drafted to implement the KOREU FTA do not impair the dairy market access concessions that the United States would receive under the KORUS FTA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Services Trade", "paragraphs": ["The EU made increased market access to the South Korean market for services a high priority, given the relative competitiveness of EU-based services providers and the openness of EU markets going into the negotiations compared to South Korean providers and markets. As WTO members, the EU-27 and South Korea adhere to and have made commitments under the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). However, competitive services providers, especially from the EU and the United States, view the GATS, that resulted from the Uruguay Round negotiations, as just a first step in establishing a multilateral framework on trade in services. As a result, its trade liberalizing commitments are far below what many WTO members consider necessary to effectively reduce barriers to trade in services. The KOREU FTA expands the commitments that the EU members and South Korea have made under the GATS.", "KOREU FTA addresses the overall rules for EU-South Korea trade in services, such as allowing for the establishment of a commercial presence by a service provider from one Party to the agreement through investment in the other Party, reaffirming rules established in the multilateral GATS. The KOREU FTA establishes the basic principles by which the two Parties would conduct bilateral trade in services covered by the agreement. These principles include non-discriminatory treatment\u2014both most-favored-nation treatment and national treatment and market access which proscribes government restrictions on trade in covered services but allows for exceptions for government restrictions for prudential objectives. Among other things, the chapter also calls for transparency in establishing regulations on services. ", "The KOREU FTA uses the \"positive list approach\" rather than the \"negative list approach,\" in laying out the schedule of these commitments. The positive list requires each Party to specifically identify the types of services for which it will provide national treatment and market access to providers from the other Party. By contrast, the KORUS FTA uses the negative list. ", "Notwithstanding the \"positive list,\" the EU-Korea FTA covers a broad range of services, including transportation services, telecommunications, finance, legal services, environmental services and construction, and largely mirrors coverage found in the KORUS FTA. South Korea obtained increased access to EU markets for architecture, engineering, urban planning, landscaping, printing and publishing, telecommunication, construction, finance, and transportation services. However, the KOREU FTA does not open markets for audiovisual services.", "Because South Korea's services market is much more restricted that the EU's, the EU had particular interest in obtaining increased market access in South Korea for its legal, financial, retail, transportation, and telecommunications services. In general, South Korea agreed to provide similar access for its markets for EU providers as would be given to U.S. providers under the KORUS FTA. According to the European Commission, the KOREU FTA provides the most comprehensive treatment of services trade of any EU FTA.", "For example, in the area of legal services, an EU priority during the negotiations was to secure South Korea's commitment to allow EU firms to increase their onsite presence. In that regard, by the date the agreement enters into force, EU-based law firms have been permitted to open representative offices in South Korea to advise foreign investors and local clients on non-Korean law. No later than two years after that effective date, EU law firms' representative offices will be able to enter into cooperative agreements with Korean law firms, and no later than five years after that date, they will be permitted to form joint ventures with Korean firms. The KORUS FTA contains similar provisions for U.S. law firms.", "In the area of telecommunication services, under the KOREU FTA, South Korea will allow a deemed foreign person owned or controlled by EU telecommunications providers to own 100% of the voting shares of Korean-based providers of facility-based public telecommunications services, except for the KT Corporation and SK Telecom Co., Ltd., for which the share of ownership will be limited to 49% or less. Under the KORUS FTA, U.S. telecommunications firms will have similar access to ownership. In addition, under the KOREU FTA, South Korea will allow EU satellite television providers' cross-border supply of television and radio signals transmission services without the need to have a business tie with a domestic telecom company. The EU views this as an important benefit to EU providers. The KORUS FTA does not appear to mention such operations; so it is not clear if U.S. satellite broadcasters will have similar access. ", "In general, the EU and South Korea agreed to provide access to their respective financial markets as the United States and South Korea agreed to under the KORUS FTA. Because of the positive list approach, EU commitments in services are member-specific, so not all of the 27 members may have committed to any specific trade liberalization measure. In insurance, 21 of the EU 27 countries and South Korea agreed to open up their respective markets for direct insurance in maritime shipping, commercial aviation, and space launching and in insurance for the international transport of goods. South Korea and some EU members will also open their markets for risk management services. In banking and other financial services, South Korea and 20 of the 27 EU members will allow financial institutions from each others' territories to provide and transfer financial information and data across their borders and to provide advisory and other auxiliary services. While the KOREU FTA appears to be cautious regarding financial services liberalization in some respects, it appears to be forward looking in other respects. For example, its provisions will apply to all financial services including new financial services.", "The KORUS FTA handles financial services somewhat differently. It distinguishes two broad categories of delivery of services. One category is services sold by a service provider located in one FTA partner country to residents in the other partner country through an affiliate located in the territory of the latter partner country (commercial presence). The second category is services sold by a provider located in one partner country to a national of the other partner country no matter the location of that national (cross-border trade).", "In the case of providers with a commercial presence, the KORUS FTA applies to all financial services. As with the KOREU FTA, it would also automatically cover any new financial service. In the case of cross-border trade, the KORUS FTA coverage is limited to those banking and insurance services listed in the agreement.

Under the KOREU FTA, both sides reaffirm their commitments to open up government procurement contracts to bidding by foreign providers under the GPA. Under the KOREU FTA (and the KORUS FTA) South Korea will apply the trade liberalization provisions to a larger number of public agencies than required under the GPA. Under the KORUS FTA, the United States and South Korea will lower the thresholds beyond those established under the GPA for eligibility of contracts for goods and services, thus potentially opening up more government procurement opportunities to bilateral trade. The EU-Korea FTA will adhere to the GPA thresholds. The KOREU FTA includes a special section that opens up build-operate-transfer (BOT) and public works contracts valued above 15 million SDRs (or about $22.5 million).

The agreement extends authors' rights to 70 years after the death of the author, the same as under the KORUS FTA.

In this respect, the treatment of labor rights and environmental issues under the KOREU FTA is similar to that under the KORUS FTA. However, the KORUS FTA provides for disputes under the labor and environmental chapter to be resolved through the agreement's dispute settlement mechanism, and thus the possibility of sanctions, if consultations do not resolve the dispute.

This conclusion logically follows from the fact that the South Korean economy is much smaller than the EU, more dependent on the EU market than is the opposite case, and has higher trade barriers than the EU; therefore, the effects of trade liberalization under the KOREU FTA would be greater in relative terms for South Korea. However, in both cases, the impact of the agreement on the overall economy on both sides will be small, reflecting the larger role played by other countries in their trade and also the larger impact that other economic activities\u2014domestic consumption, government spending, and business investment\u2014have in their economies.

Those having a comparative advantage vis-a-vis those in their other country are most likely to experience the greatest benefits while import-sensitive sectors will experience the least gains, if not losses, when the agreement is implemented. EU services providers will be expected to experience gains from the agreement, especially in the areas of retail and wholesale trade; transportation services; financial services; and business services. This conclusion follows from the fact that EU service providers are among the world's most competitive and EU markets the most open, while the South Korean services market is relatively closed. In terms of trade in goods, EU exporters of pharmaceuticals, auto parts, industrial machinery, electronics parts, and some agricultural goods and processed foods will be expected to gain from the KOREU FTA's implementation.
