If harnessed by the right technologies, renewable energy offers the possibility for achieving inexpensive, almost limitless electricity with minimal adverse environmental impacts.", "Much of the modern impetus for renewable energy development in the United States came from the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, and the resulting energy crisis. A focus on national security and energy independence emerged with a goal of reducing dependence on foreign supplies of oil. While petroleum is not a major fuel source for electric power generation, the importance of energy to the national economy was underscored. Energy security and independence concerns, combined with growing reliability and environmental concerns led to the development of the renewable energy research and development programs at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

When the wind is blowing at speeds which can be harnessed, electricity can be generated at prices nearly competitive with conventional fossil fuels. Since the wind doesn't blow all the time and varies in strength, average costs are higher and integration of large amounts of wind into an electricity grid has often been raised as an issue. Backup generation in the form of natural gas combustion turbines has been the standby choice in some instances. Energy storage (using batteries or other means) is often suggested as a potential answer to deal with intermittency concerns. Since many of the best wind resource areas in the United States are far from population centers where the electricity will be used, the development of transmission facilities to carry power to population centers has been discussed as a prerequisite for wider development. Given these factors, DOE projects (with a deliberate and sustained national effort) that as much as 20% of the nation's electrical supply could be provided by wind energy by 2030. This would require wind power capacity to reach 300 GW, or a growth of over 280 GW over the next 21 years.

Such policy initiatives can be described as \"market drivers\" since they can cause changes affecting decisions regarding energy supply and demand. Many believe that the United States' existing (mostly non-renewable) low-cost energy system limits market opportunities in the short term, despite potential opportunities in the longer term both domestically and abroad.

Even with generous tax incentives and resource growth potential, non-hydro renewable electricity constituted approximately 4% of U.S. electric power industry production as of 2009. If renewable electricity is to play a larger role in the electricity future of the United States, many maintain that federal action may be necessary.

Coal currently accounts for almost 45% of net electricity generation in the United States, and replacing even a portion of that generation with renewable energy would not be a small undertaking. Renewable energy sources are naturally occurring but variable, and harnessing the forces of nature is not easy or very efficient given the current state of technologies. Most of the best large-scale hydropower resources have already been developed, and the best areas for wind power and solar energy are often far from population centers where the electricity produced would be consumed. Even if energy efficiency and energy conservation measures were to lessen the need for building future power generation, replacing large centralized power stations with renewable energy would be a massive task. Deployment of wind power (the fastest growing U.S. renewable energy segment) on a large scale would likely require considerable investments to upgrade electric transmission line capacity and install back-up power due to the intermittency of wind.

Most of these plants burn coal or natural gas (i.e., fossil fuels) to generate electricity in base load operations. Efficiency of operation (the ratio of fuel input to energy produced) has been achieved from economies of scale, resulting in electrical power being generated fairly cheaply, but with a consequence of commensurately large GHG and other emissions.

The performance of these new technologies will need to be sufficiently \"disruptive,\" so that decommissioning and replacement of the old technology will be seen as the most cost-effective decision.", "The future global clean energy market has been estimated by 2020 to have sales as high as $2.3 trillion, and, as such, would be one of the world's biggest industries. Many nations are moving to secure a share of the expected rewards.

Companies choosing to serve global markets have a variety of drivers in the decision about where to locate manufacturing facilities. Often, the potential size of the local market is a key consideration, and the countries which established (and those establishing) competitive clean energy industries began by serving a strong, often protected, domestic market.

The NREL study suggests that an FIT can be a complementary strategy to an RES by focusing incentives on specific technologies.

Many of these existing programs seek to provide incentives to a particular technology (most often solar PV), or seek to nurture domestic renewable energy industries. A national FIT might seem unlikely for the United States quite simply due to the variability of renewable energy resources across the United States, and adoption of a FIT for one technology would inevitably favor specific regions. ", "While the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) holds sway over interstate energy transactions and commerce, there are 50 state governments involved with local electricity issues and regional energy markets. FERC issued a ruling in July 2010 that sets the stage for how FIT concepts may be considered under current U.S. law. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) wanted to implement a program under California state law establishing a FIT specifically for cogeneration systems under 20 MW. Several investor-owned utilities objected, maintaining that FERC alone had the authority to institute such a program. The CPUC asked FERC to clarify whether the Federal Power Act prevented the state from implementing the program. FERC concluded that the plan as proposed set wholesale rates in interstate commerce, which, as such, fell under federal jurisdiction. However, FERC went on to say that as long as cogenerators in this instance obtain \"qualifying status\" under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA , P.L. 96-617 ), and the rates set by the CPUC do not exceed the \"avoided cost\" of the utility purchasing the power, the proposal would not be preempted by PURPA or FERC regulations. California subsequently revised its FIT plans and proposed a new pilot program seeking to support 1 GW of renewable electric capacity. The plan requires the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power from renewable energy projects ranging from 1 MW to 20 MW through competitive auctions. Utilities are then required to award contracts with preference given to the lowest cost \"viable\" project, and then make subsequent awards to the next lowest cost project until MW requirements are reached. ", "FERC's decision suggests that FIT policies can be applied to qualifying facilities (over 20 MW capacity) under PURPA , and still be subject to FERC and avoided cost pricing requirements. The price of renewable electricity appears to be falling to levels more competitive with conventional fossil generation.
