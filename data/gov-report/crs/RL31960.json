The number of workers volunteering forvaccination was far smaller than the White House had anticipated. One frequently cited reason wasthe concern of health workers that they would not be compensated if they experienced adversereactions to the vaccine. Under the Administration's original plan, vaccinees who suffered adverseconsequences and sought redress had two options: apply to their state's workers' compensationprogram or sue the federal government for negligence.", "Some Members from across the political spectrum favored responding with legislation. While they differed on what should be in that legislation, there was bipartisan agreement that, given thePresident's request that health and safety workers volunteer for vaccination, the federal governmentshould guarantee to protect them against the possible adverse effects of smallpox vaccination. Somelegislators articulated a two-fold rationale: it is right to protect volunteers and, to recruit thosevolunteers, it is necessary.", "This report first presents the reasons some Members of Congress, health care worker organizations, and others felt legislation was necessary; summarizes the range of approaches thatCongress considered; and describes the smallpox vaccine injury compensation provisions Congressactually passed. Finally, it presents issues that Congress might consider if it revisits the newlegislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Need for Legislation", "paragraphs": ["On December 13, 2002, President Bush announced his decision to vaccinate military personneland front-line civilian health workers against smallpox. The Department of Defense began theprocess in early January 2003 and, as of March 31, 2003, has vaccinated over 350,000 militarypersonnel. (1) The civilian program, which is voluntaryin contrast to the military program, did notbegin until January 24, 2003, to coincide with the start of liability protections provided by Congressin the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ) to smallpox vaccine manufacturers and theinstitutions and individuals who administer the vaccine. The President had hoped to vaccinate500,000 civilians, but, by June 6, 2003, only 37,478 civilians had been immunized. (2)", "To explain the reluctance of many health workers to volunteer to be vaccinated, many, including Senator Gregg, (3) pointed to the absence ofa compensation program for people who areinjured by the vaccine. Until the mid-1970s when the World Health Organization announced theeradication of naturally occurring smallpox, it was accepted that, in the face of endemic infection,the side effects of the smallpox vaccine (4) are dwarfedby the benefits of immunization. It is difficultfor some, however, to accept the risks of vaccine-associated illness and death when the risk ofinfection is perceived as theoretical. The President, backed by many health and defense experts,sought an immunized core of first-responder and public-health personnel as a public good, allowingtreatment and vaccination of larger groups should smallpox infections appear. At the same time,many public health officials, infectious disease experts, lawyers, and health care personnel unionsnoted the need for a compensation mechanism.", "The Administration has said that it expected workers' compensation programs to cover claims for the rare but anticipated side effects of the smallpox vaccinations. (5) Soon, however, people noticedgaps in this approach. Other than the program that covers federal workers, workers' compensationin the United States is handled at the state level. Scope-of-employment and line-of-duty definitionsdiffer, as do rules of eligibility, coverage, and benefits. In general, courts have found that workers'compensation is available for injuries resulting from employment-related vaccination. (6) However,not all employees are covered by workers' compensation programs and not all first-response healthcare providers are employees. Workers' compensation programs, as their names indicate, cover theworker and not an individual whom the worker, because of the worker's injury, injures. This latteris a concern in planning for smallpox compensation because of the potential for secondarytransmission of vaccine-related infection to contacts of those vaccinated. Furthermore, even forworkers who do qualify for workers' compensation, the lost income benefit of most of theseprograms is two-thirds of income up to a yearly cap. Employers are the primary contributors toworkers' compensation funds and would be acquiring a new burden if called upon to cover smallpoxvaccine injuries. (7)", "Some suggested that the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ) provided access to compensation through the Federal Tort Claims Act, but it addresses only injuries associated withnegligence. Although necessary in certain circumstances, this coverage is not suitable for the injuriesanticipated from the nonnegligent administration of vaccine.

(p. 9)", "Many other groups weighed in with other options. The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the American Public Health Association (APHA), and the National Association ofCounty and City Health Officials issued a joint press release urging Congress to create a nationalprogram to protect individuals or their survivors from the costs of illness, disability, and deathassociated with vaccine injury. (10) In a March 2003press release, APHA specified the need forcompensation of medical costs, lost wages, a no-fault system that could provide quick compensation,health insurance, and the more basic assurance that health care would be available to those withouthealth insurance or with inadequate coverage. (11)", "In oral and written testimony to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee and in press releases, representatives of employee unions suggested numerouscomponents for Congress to consider in creating a smallpox vaccine injury compensation program.

(13) The Administrationbased its proposal on this structure.", "The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act ( P.L. 94-430 ) initially covered state and local law enforcement officers and firefighters. Subsequently, Congress added federal law enforcementofficers and firefighters; members of federal, state, and local public rescue squads and ambulancecrews; Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel; and state, local and tribal emergencymanagement and civil defense agency employees. (14) At its 1976 inception, PSOB provided only adeath benefit; in 1990, the program added the permanent, total disability benefit. (15) The Actestablished the payment level at $50,000 in 1976; in 1988, the benefit level was changed to $100,000pegged to increases in the Consumer Price Index (42 USC 3796). The total benefit payment -- foreither death or permanent, total disability -- allowed in 2003 is $262,100. Benefits are reduced forindividuals receiving certain other death or disability benefits; certain benefit programs reducebenefits if PSOB payment is received. PSOB benefits are not subject to federal income or estatetaxes. (16)", "The PSOB death benefit program \"was designed to offer peace of mind to men and women seeking careers in public safety and to make a strong statement about the value American societyplaces on the contributions of those who serve their communities in potentially dangerouscircumstances.\" (17) Congress, in keeping with thatintent, established the PSOB benefit as asupplement, rather than as an insurance or compensation program. PSOB manages claimsadministratively, rather than within a legal framework. Because the program does not include lost-income benefitsor long-term survivor support, it need not debate questions such as projectedearnings or other claims that might require review and appeal procedures. Although the smallpoxvaccine compensation program in P.L. 108-20 is based on the PSOB structure, the smallpox vaccineinjury compensation program does include longer term medical and lost income benefits and,therefore, will require a different structure to efficiently accommodate the complex determinationof the possible range of claims following smallpox vaccine injuries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program", "paragraphs": ["In response to public concerns about vaccine safety and manufacturer concern about liability, Congress enacted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986 ( P.L. 99-660 ).

VICP covers the vaccines that CDC, through the National Vaccine Program and theAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices, recommends for routine administration to allchildren in the United States. Although located in the Health Resources and Service Administration(HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), VICP administration is actuallyshared among HHS, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, and the U.S. Department of Justice. (19) Aproposal for smallpox vaccine injury compensation introduced as H.R. 865 byRepresentative Waxman based its plan on the VICP.", "The basic tool of the VICP is its Table of Injuries. For each covered vaccine, the table lists each specific injury and the time period, relative to vaccination, during which that injury must haveoccurred in order to be considered for compensation. If a person presents a claim that correspondsto a listed vaccine -- injury -- time-period item, VICP is to assume that that person's injury wascaused by that vaccination. In theory, this streamlines the entire claims process. Claims involvingother injuries from listed vaccines or any injury from other vaccines require proof that the vaccineaggravated or caused the condition.", "For vaccine-related injury, VICP allows reasonable compensation for past and future unreimbursable medical, custodial care, and rehabilitation costs; actual and projected pain andsuffering and emotional distress -- capped at $250,000; lost earnings; and reasonable attorneys' feesand costs. For a vaccine-related death, VICP awards $250,000 to the estate of the deceased, andreasonable attorneys' fees and costs.", "NCVIA authorized the use of federal tax dollars for compensation awarded for vaccination that occurred before the program began and authorized an excise tax on every dose of covered vaccineto cover compensation of future vaccine injuries. As of March 2003, \"an excise tax of 75 cents onevery dose of covered vaccine that is purchased\" goes to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund. (20)", "According to the VICP Monthly Statistics Report dated May 31, 2003, 8,813 petitions were filed since the program began (4,262 for pre-1988 vaccinations and 4,551 for post-1988vaccinations), resulting in 3,507 awards that total $1,428,300,000. Awards for post-1988vaccinations averaged $772,675 (73 cases) in FY2002 and $1,240,143 (48 cases) so far in FY2003.
