Moreover, by keeping the immigrant labor force supply at or slightly below market demand, a point system based upon economic theory might attempt to approximate a labor market equilibrium without the potential for severe adjustment costs (e.g., \"overheating\" housing market) or exogenous shocks to the labor market (e.g., large influx of foreign nationals). Classical economists would note that despite such governmental efforts at pinning down labor market demand for skill sets, the use of a government agency to determine market forces will incur the loss of efficiency. The most efficient outcome, classical economists argue, is always going to be achieved through the free flow of individuals in an open market (and thus by having open borders). Yet, scholars will also note that such inefficiency may serve as incentives in the marketplace for desirable economic change, such as technological innovation and wage growth.", "The objective to maximize the likelihood of immigrant assimilation might lead to a point system which values those social factors correlated to acculturation. Family ties and relatives residing in the United States might be highly valued for the community and social linkages they provide to the immigrant. Some factors (such as being within a certain age range, higher levels of education and language skills) might be chosen for social assimilation as well as economic reasons. If the societal goal is to increase the ethnic and racial diversity of the immigrant stream, then a point system might add credits for immigrants coming from countries that are traditionally under-represented in the migrant flow.", "Finally, a point system might be designed with a public policy underpinning to maximize public support. In theory, an immigrant selection system might be more efficacious with the public if it is one in which elected officials (rather than individual employers or families) are establishing priorities at the national level to choose new immigrants. One strand of recent research characterizes point systems as potentially inspiring public confidence by appearing to use universal, data-driven, and objective selection criteria that convey to the public that the government is being proactive in ways that put national economic interests first."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "International Point Systems", "paragraphs": ["Among the countries that currently employ a merit-based point system, the four highest profile systems are those of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

In the four different systems, those skilled immigration applicants with the most points according to various characteristics would immigrate ahead of applicants with lower point totals. In addition, each of these four countries employs a preference system for family-based immigration. They also employ quotas to determine levels of family and humanitarian immigration.

Achieving a maximum score without bonus points in the non employment offer categories (totaling 115 points) will not net an applicant a passing mark for skilled immigration. Thus, the distribution of points and the level of the passing mark for New Zealand's skilled immigration makes an employment offer or existing New Zealand employment a de facto requirement for skilled immigration.

Such a high passing mark ensures that applicants must receive high qualifying marks in most categories. New Zealand requires that an individual accumulates 48.2% of all available points. Yet, because the country offers a large number of bonus points for employment in rural and targeted areas, achieving a passing mark becomes more difficult for individuals who wish to settle outside these areas.
