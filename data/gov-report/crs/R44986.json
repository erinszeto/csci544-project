However, some of the operational changes authorized under the act have been implemented. Congress also has appropriated funding authorized for Reclamation (both for the CVP and for other projects) under the bill. CRS estimates that from FY2017 to FY2019, Congress appropriated a total of approximately $575 million for Reclamation projects and programs authorized under the WIIN Act.

Today, Reclamation manages hundreds of dams and diversion projects, including more than 300 storage reservoirs in those 17 western states. These projects provide water to approximately 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. Reclamation is the largest wholesale supplier of water in the West and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation.

The project delivers about 70% of its water to urban users, including water for approximately 25 million users in areas ranging from the South Bay (San Francisco Bay), to the Central Valley, to Southern California; the remaining 30% is used for irrigation. It is composed of 34 storage facilities, reservoirs, and lakes; 20 pumping plants; 4 pumping-generating plants; 5 hydroelectric power plants; and about 701 miles of open canals and pipelines.", "The SWP has been of interest to Congress because of its connection with federal CVP operations. Central to addressing water shortages in California from the federal and state perspective is the coordinated operation of the CVP and SWP, which affect much of the state. During a drought, water deliveries can be curtailed for CVP and SWP users. A key point of debate has been the extent to which delivery cutbacks are due to drought compared to other factors, some of which can be a function of state law or regulatory restrictions (e.g., environmental restrictions related to state water quality criteria and endangered species). Whereas the federal CVP serves mostly agricultural water contractors, the SWP serves largely urban or M&I contractors; however, both projects serve some contractors of both varieties. Complicating water deliveries of the CVP and SWP is a complex system of state water rights, in which some water deliveries are prioritized based on prior agreements with water rights holders that predate the CVP (e.g., Sacramento River Settlement Contractors and San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors).", "Two federal and state pumping facilities in the southern portion of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers' Delta (Bay Delta, or Delta) near Tracy, CA, are a hub for water deliveries to users of both systems, and are key to water availability south of the Delta (see Figure 2 ).

A primary factor was the multiyear drought in California, which began in 2012 and was ongoing at the time of consideration of the WIIN Act in 2016. The drought significantly reduced water allocations, including \"imports\" (i.e., pumping) to agricultural areas and municipalities south of the Delta that receive water from the CVP and the SWP. Historic CVP and SWP pumping levels relative to more recent levels are depicted in Figure 3 . For the most part, these levels have followed one another, with major peaks and troughs coinciding with high water years and droughts, respectively.", "The drought also increased interest in federal efforts to maximize available water supplies through other efforts, including encouraging and subsidizing water conservation, repairing existing infrastructure and constructing new surface water storage, and investing in alternative water supplies (desalination, water reuse/recycling, and aquifer storage/recharge, among other things). Some perceive a lack of federal investment in new water supplies as exacerbating the impacts of drought (both in California and in other areas) and thus have focused on legislative efforts to facilitate such investment.", "Debates related to restrictions on water availability stemming from species and water quality laws preceded the aforementioned drought, but were given added emphasis during congressional debates from 2012 to 2016 as a result of the aforementioned major water shortages. Most significant in the context of federal legislation were federal regulations under ESA, including biological opinions (BiOps) for the Delta smelt and Chinook salmon. These regulations are important in the context of California drought because both the CVP and the SWP are subject to BiOps on the operations of these projects. Under certain scenarios, they can be a factor contributing to limitations on pumping and water deliveries that are important to water users and related industries (see below box, \"Biological Opinions Under the Endangered Species Act\").

The gates are a controlled diversion channel downstream of Sacramento that diverts water from the Sacramento River into the Mokelumne River. The gates are significant because of their role in maintaining water quality in the Delta, their effect on species listed under ESA, and their redirection of flows to the Delta-Mendota and Contra Costa canals and pumping facilities. When the gates are open, they allow a greater amount of water to flow to SWP and CVP pumps and lower the salinity in the western Delta. When the gates are closed, salmon migration is improved but salinity can increase. Inflow - to - E xport R atio for W ater T ransfers . The inflow-to-export (I:E) ratio is the ratio of San Joaquin River water flowing or projected to flow into the Delta during certain times of year (inflow) to the amount of water exported (export) south at CVP and SWP pumping stations in the south Delta area.\u00a0The I:E ratio is used to manage the amount of water exported from the Delta through the pumps. Specific I:E ratios for different times of year are included in current BiOps for the coordinated operation of the CVP and SWP. A 1:1 ratio means that the entire river's inflow (measured at a certain point) can be exported out of the Delta. When a 2:1 ratio is in effect, only half the inflow may be exported. Actions to F acilitate W ater T ransfers . Several stakeholders have advocated the use of water transfers, or water marketing (i.e., the sale of water between users), as a mechanism to stretch water supplies during water shortages and to move water to high-value uses. CVP agricultural water users routinely transfer water within the CVP project area, sometimes transferring large quantities of water to urban agencies hundreds of miles away. Some contend that impediments exist for completing transfers in a timely manner. They note that water transfers are subject to lengthy environmental reviews and are limited to a specific period each year, from July 1 to September 30. Some have supported altering these restrictions to allow for more transfers. Others contend that reviews and a limited window for transfers are beneficial to the environment. Alterations to M onitoring and I ncidental T ake L imits . Coordinated operation of CVP and SWP pumping operations in the Delta are limited by, among other things, the amount of incidental take (referred to as the i ncidental t ake l imit , or ITL) of Delta smelt and other species listed under ESA.

Others argue that the current system is robust and sufficient for decisionmaking purposes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Summary of Changes", "paragraphs": ["Section 4001 of the WIIN Act authorizes the approval of temporary projects and operations that aim to maximize water supplies as quickly as possible while remaining consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

Section 4001(b)(1)(B) also authorizes the design and implementation of real-time monitoring capabilities for the operation of the Delta Cross Channel. Projects under this section may in some cases be approved within specific, accelerated deadlines pursuant to Section 4001(d) (discussed below).", "The law also authorizes the adoption of a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for increased flows resulting from the sale, transfer, or exchange of water supplies. This ratio is allowed unless the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce determine in writing that the ratio \"will cause additional adverse effects on listed salmonid species beyond the range of the effects anticipated to occur to the listed salmonid species for the duration of the salmonid biological opinion using the best scientific and commercial data available.\" The current BiOp allows a 1:1 ratio in \"critically dry\" years only. As water conditions improve, the BiOp allows for an increase in the ratio, up to 4:1 in \"wet\" years.", "The law also streamlines the approval process for water transfers to expedite water allocations.

The law also directs FWS and Reclamation to approve such transfers to \"maximize the quantity of water supplies available\" on the condition that actions associated with the water transfer comply with applicable federal laws (including regulations).", "Section 4001(d) specifies conditions under which the Governor of California may request the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce to implement expedited procedures to make a final decision on a project that would provide additional water supplies during emergency drought conditions in California (as defined in the law). The expedited procedures would require the head of the agency responsible for the project to convene a final project decision meeting with other federal agencies authorized to make some decision regarding the project (presumably cooperating agencies). Within 10 days of that meeting, the agency responsible for the project would be required to issue a final decision on the project, with the condition that the agency's approval must be for proposed new federal projects or operational changes pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this law and to the extent that the projects comply with applicable law.

", "The central authority in this section directs agencies to maximize water supplies for users through projects and actions. This authority could limit the discretion of water managers when operating the CVP, since they are required to pump at the maximum practicable level. Some contend that maximizing water supplies for users might not allow for a buffer to guard against unforeseen environmental circumstances that could adversely affect listed species. Further, some argue that maximizing water supplies for users in the present could have future consequences for species that might not be detected immediately or might not be addressed before the effects on the population are realized. These concerns could be tempered, in part, by provisions in the law that aim to increase real-time monitoring of species populations, which potentially could detect negative effects on species as soon as changes are implemented. Some others also contend that efforts should be made to maximize water to users and that mandating this directive in law will hold managers to task and provide them with legal cover for their actions. Similar to other areas of Subtitle J, the effectiveness of these provisions likely will hinge on how water managers interpret and implement policies under the law, and whether courts uphold those interpretations. ", "Another component of Section 4001 is accelerating and streamlining project decisionmaking. The law requires a final decision on proposed projects within a certain deadline. The effect of such directives is difficult to determine, as an agency might choose to deny the project request if it could not meet the 10-day deadline for a decision or to approve the request with potentially limited analysis of the project's costs and benefits. No provisions in the law explicitly waive existing NEPA requirements associated with the issuance of permits or grants of right-of-way for federal land. That is, the subtitle establishes procedures that Reclamation must implement to coordinate the environmental compliance process, but it does not explicitly direct DOI or the U.S. Department of Agriculture to change its own procedures for implementing NEPA or processing permit applications. Reclamation's interpretation of the directives in this section likely will determine how these directives may be integrated with existing DOI and other federal agency procedures and how any new project-coordination procedures will differ from the existing NEPA and permitting processes. The law appears to include some requirements that add steps to the project-approval process (e.g., requirements related to the preapplication process, preparation of a unified environmental document, and data monitoring and record keeping).", "An overarching question to consider for this section is whether the authority and direction to maximize water supplies within the context of existing laws and regulations can or will result in more water supplies for users than before. The authority to implement projects and operations to maximize water supplies appears to be broad and could involve a multitude of projects. However, the benefits of these projects and operational changes to water users will be tempered by constraints put on flows due to water quality and species considerations. Ultimately, the answer to this question may depend on available water supplies and how water managers and legal experts interpret the language of the section. ", "The WIIN Act also establishes a standard for measuring the effects of water operations on listed species. In Section 4001 and in several other places in Subtitle J, the law allows certain actions to go forward unless they are determined to cause \"additional adverse effects\" on listed species beyond the range of the effects anticipated to occur for the duration of the species BiOp.

Higher pumping levels result in higher negative flows, which in turn increase the probability of fish being drawn into the pumps (entrained). Thus, observers closely monitor negative flow rates.

Some of these conditions center on obtaining evidence from real-time monitoring and near-term forecasts using salvage models that show that the lower flow rate is necessary to avoid additional adverse effects to species beyond the duration of the BiOp. Further, the law lists several factors that are to be considered when making a decision to manage flows below the maximum. Some factors include the distribution of the listed species throughout the Delta, effects of potential entrainment of the species, and water temperature, among others. The justification for a lower flow rate is to be documented in writing under the law.

Further, some note that limitations on the flow rate could be implemented if effects on listed species are measured and reported according to the standard defined in the law. The justification to reduce flows would have to be in writing, which presumably would give stakeholders a chance to review the science and parameters used to make a decision to reduce flows.

For example, some note that the flow rate of -5,000 cfs in the law is at the high end of the allowable flows under the Delta smelt BiOp during certain times of the year and might have detrimental effects on Delta smelt and other species. They also contend that the approach of initially setting a high baseline for flows and then measuring its effect on smelt could harm the species in the short term, decreasing the chances of mitigating effects on the population in the long term. ", "Section 4002 of the WIIN Act implements a management strategy for maximizing flows for users. Under this strategy, the flow rate is at the high end of flows allowed under the existing BiOps. Consideration of the effects of this flow rate on listed species hinges on whether managers can determine if the flows adversely affect species beyond the range of effects expected over the duration of the BiOps. It is unclear how managers will evaluate these effects and measure them. Also unknown is how the short-term effects of this management regime on listed species will affect their long-term survival and conservation. Further, many different factors affect listed species in the Delta, and it could be challenging to model the long-term effects of flow rates on species over the duration of the BiOps. Another question is whether maximizing water flows under the BiOps will actually lead to additional flows for users considering limitations on flows due to water-quality concerns.

How such a program would award funds competitively while adhering to the legislation's requirement that projects be mentioned by name in enacted appropriations legislation is unclear and likely will depend on Administration guidelines for the new program.
