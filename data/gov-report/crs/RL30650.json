From 1789 to 1964, the Senate dealt individually with cases of disciplinary action against Members, often forming ad hoc committees to investigate and make recommendations when acts of wrongdoing were brought to the chamber's attention. Events of the 1960s, including the investigation of Secretary to the Majority Robert G. \"Bobby\" Baker, for alleged corruption and influence peddling, prompted the creation of a permanent ethics committee and the writing of a Code of Conduct for Members, officers, and staff of the Senate.", "The Senate Select Committee on Ethics was first established in 1964. This bipartisan, six-member committee investigates alleged violations of the rules of the Senate and recommends disciplinary actions. In the 95th Congress (1977-1978), the Senate expanded the committee's jurisdiction and altered its procedures to implement revisions to the Senate Code of Official Conduct. Also, to reflect these changes the committee was renamed the Select Committee on Ethics.", "This report briefly outlines the background of ethics enforcement in the Senate, including the creation of the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct and the subsequent renaming of the committee as the Select Committee on Ethics.

Former Senate historian Richard Baker observed that \"[f]or nearly two centuries, a simple and informal code of behavior existed. Prevailing norms of general decency served as the chief determinants of proper legislative conduct. \" During that time, Congress often dealt with ethics issues \"on a case-by-case basis, [and then] only with the most obvious acts of wrongdoing, those clearly 'inconsistent with the trust and duty of a member.

Following Mr. Baker's resignation, the Senate agreed to a resolution (S.Res. 212) to \"inquire into the financial and business interests of any officer, employee, or former employee of the Senate.\" The resolution directed the Committee on Rules and Administration to conduct an investigation into current and former officers' and employees' financial and business interests. The resolution stated,", "Resolved , That the Committee on Rules and Administration or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof is authorized and directed to make a study and investigation with respect to any financial or business interests or activities of any officer or employee or former officer or employee of the Senate, for the purpose of ascertaining (1) whether any such interests or activities have involved conflicts of interest or other impropriety, and (2) whether additional laws, rules, or regulations are necessary or desirable for the purpose of prohibiting or restricting any such interests or activities. The Committee shall report to the Senate at the earliest practicable date the results of its study and investigation, together with such recommendation as it may deem desirable.", "Pursuant to the S.Res. 212, the Committee on Rules and Administration held a series of hearings to investigate the general business interests and activities of Senate officials and employees. In the report issued following the hearings, the committee recognized that serious allegations had been made against a former employee, and that no specific rules or regulations governed the duties and activities of Members, officers, or employees of the Senate. The committee also concluded that many of Baker's outside activities were in conflict with his official duties and made several recommendations, including adoption of public financial disclosure rules and other guidelines for Senate employees.", "Following the investigation into Mr. Baker, additions to the Senate rules\u2014calling for public financial disclosure reports and more controls on staff involvement with Senate campaign funds\u2014were introduced to implement the committee's recommendations.", "Additionally, the Committee on Rules and Administration considered the creation of a separate ethics committee. In a committee report on proposed amendments to Senate rules, Senator John Sherman Cooper discussed an amendment he proposed, but which did not pass the committee, to create a select committee on standards and conduct.", "I regret that a resolution which I offered was rejected by the majority party representation on the committee. The resolution which I offered would have established a select committee on standards and conduct, composed of six members, three from each of the parties, to be appointed by the President of the Senate. This committee would be authorized to receive complaints of unethical, improper, illegal conduct of members, officers, or employees of the Senate, to make investigation of allegations of such conduct, to propose rules and regulations, to give advisory opinions, and to make recommendations to the Senate regarding disciplinary action if required.", "I believe the establishment of such a committee made up of distinguished Members of the Senate would act as a deterrent upon possible violations, and in the exercise of jurisdiction, would have the confidence of the Senate and the public. I do not consider that such a special select committee should be considered as a policing committee, but one which, as I have said, would deter possible violations and deal with them with utmost dispatch and fairness.", "On July 1, 1964, Senator B. Everett Jordan filed a resolution (S.Res. 338) to amend the jurisdiction of the Committee on Rules and Administration and allow the committee", "to investigate every alleged violation of the rules of the Senate, and to make appropriate findings of fact and conclusions with respect thereto after according to any individual concerned due notice and opportunity for hearing.

During debate, Senator Cooper proposed an amendment similar to his proposed amendment in the Committee on Rules and Administration. The amendment proposed to remove jurisdiction over ethical issues from the Committee on Rules and Administration and create a permanent, bipartisan Select Committee on Standards and Conduct. In proposing his amendment, Senator Cooper summarized why he thought the Senate should create a select committee instead of granting disciplinary authority to the Committee on Rules and Administration.", "First, in the event that an investigation into the affairs of a Member of the Senate or an employee becomes necessary, it is to give assurance that the investigation would be complete and, so far as possible, would be accepted by the Senate and by the public as being complete.", "Second\u2014and this is important to all Members and to all employees of the Senate\u2014it is to provide that an investigation, which could touch their rights and their offices as well as their honor, would be conducted by a select committee which by reason of its experience and its judgment, would give assurance that their right and honor would be justly considered.", "Senator Cooper's amendment was adopted by a vote of 50 to 33. Subsequently, the Senate agreed to S.Res. 338, as amended, to create a Select Committee on Standards and Conduct and for the first time created a continuing internal disciplinary body.

In a letter from Senator Howard Cannon, chair of the Select Committee on Standards, the ethics committee expressed opposition to this idea. In part, the letter read,", "The Select Committee on Standards and Conduct took note of the tentative decision of your Committee to recommend the consolidation of this Committee with the Committee on Rules and Administration. While we are mindful of the promised benefit of reducing the number of Committees which Senators must attend, we strongly believe that your decision would fatally damage any usefulness our Committee might have as well as to impugn any system of ethics in the Senate.", "By its very nature it is indispensable to an ethics committee of the Congress to be bipartisan in membership, to conduct any worthy investigation without control of its budget by any other committee, to be served by a nonpartisan staff, to advice and counsel with Senators, and to exercise prudent judgment in the conduct of its business. Consolidation of any ethics committee with a more-normal type of committee is likely to destroy all of these characteristics and to overwhelm any ethics identity. Unlike other committees, moreover, the Senate Committee on Standards and Conduct is mandated to directly assist the Senate in the discharge of a Constitutional responsibility.", "Subsequently, the temporary select committee recommended that the functions of the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct should be combined with the Committee on Rules and Administration.", "While no further action was taken by the 94 th Congress (1975-1976), the issue was readdressed during the 95 th Congress (1977-1978).

In remarks on the introduction of the resolution, Senator Morse defended Members' right to earn outside income, but believed that the American people were entitled to know about alternate income sources. Commenting on the resolution's purpose, Senator Morse stated,", "I may say that my resolution is bottomed upon the very sound philosophical principle enunciated by Plutarch that Caesar's wife must be above suspicion. Likewise, I feel that, so far as the public's evaluation of Members of the Senate is concerned, they must be above suspicion. Hence, I think my resolution which calls for the filing with the Secretary of the Senate of all sources and amounts of senatorial income is in keeping with the public's right to know what influences may possibly be brought to bear upon Members of the Senate in the performance of their legislative duties.", "No action was taken on Senator Morse's proposal.", "In 1958, Congress established the first Code of Ethics for Government Service (Code of Ethics).

In March 1968, the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct reported a resolution (S.Res. 266) making four additions to the Standing Rules of the Senate. After several days of debate, the Senate adopted a new code of conduct. The four areas covered by the new code of conduct were (1) outside employment of officers and employees, (2) raising and permissible uses of campaign funds, (3) political fund-raising activities of Senate staff, and (4) annual financial disclosures by senatorial candidates as well as Members, officers, and designated employees of the Senate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Formal Code of Conduct", "paragraphs": ["Following the Watergate scandal in the Nixon Administration, reforms \"such as electoral changes, designed to prevent the recurrence of the Watergate type of offense\" were initiated in the executive branch.
