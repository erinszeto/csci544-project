One effort to address these policy goals was to expand military-to-military contacts with the newly independent states of Central and Eastern Europe to promote subordination to civilian leadership, respect for human rights, and a defensively oriented military posture. At the time, most of these newly independent states had militaries that were based on the Soviet model and focused on countering threats from NATO nations. The United States European Command (USEUCOM) took the lead in this effort by establishing the Joint Contact Team Program (JCTP) in 1992. The JCTP was originally composed of active component personnel and included members of the special forces because of their language skills. However, when the JCTP began to engage the Baltic nations of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, senior defense officials insisted that National Guard and Reserve personnel play a leading role in any military liaison teams operating in those countries, apparently in response to those governments' desire to establish reserve-centric defense establishments and to assuage Russian concerns about U.S. expansion into its former satellites.", "In November 1992, Lieutenant General John Conway, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, and Brigadier General Thomas Lennon, head of the JCTP, visited the Baltics. A few months after their trip, in early 1993, the National Guard initiated the first state partnerships: New York-Estonia, Michigan-Latvia, and Pennsylvania-Lithuania. Additional partnerships were proposed later in 1993 for Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. The SPP benefited the JCTP by providing additional personnel, funding, and access to military personnel from U.S. ethnic-heritage communities who often had relevant language and cultural skills.", "Today, USEUCOM has 22 state partnerships. The SPP has also expanded beyond USEUCOM to other combatant commands (COCOMs) as shown in Figure 2 .", "United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) established its first partnership in 1995, between Arizona and Kazakhstan, and now has five partnerships. United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) established four partnerships in 1996\u2013Missouri-Panama, Louisiana-Belize, Kentucky-Ecuador, and West Virginia-Peru \u2013and today has 21 partnerships. United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) established a partnership with two states\u2013Guam and Hawaii\u2013and the Philippines in 2000. It currently has six partnerships. United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM) established its first partnership, New York-South Africa, in 2003, while much of Africa was still part of USEUCOM. It currently has eight partnerships. United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) has one partnership, Rhode Island-Bahamas.

A list of some common types of partnership activities are provided below, along with a brief summary and an illustrative example. According to NGB, the typical SPP event is a week-long subject matter expert exchange, with three to five National Guard subject matter experts participating, with an average cost of approximately $20,000.", "Subject Matter Expert Exchanges. During these events, National Guard personnel with expertise in a certain area share their knowledge with partner nation personnel. For example, in 2005 ", "[t]he Uruguayan Army's Infantry and Engineer units in Montevideo and Maldonado hosted the visit of U.S. Army National Guardsmen from Connecticut. During the [subject matter expert exchange], delegates visited Uruguayan Army units and discussed a wide range of topics to include peacekeeping and humanitarian de-mining operations, infantry and engineer training, as well as soldier and officer training at unit level.", "Familiarizations. These are demonstrations of certain capabilities that the Army or Air National Guard has, or discussions of policy issues related to those capabilities. For example, ", "in the late 1990s, the Pennsylvania National Guard was instrumental in assisting Lithuania with the development of their Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academy, which was modeled after the U.S. NCO Education System. A total of 26 Lithuanian officers participated in five train-the-trainer familiarization visits to Pennsylvania, with the focus on curriculum development for NCO course preparation at the newly created Lithuanian NCO Academy in Kaunas. These officers became acquainted with a diversity of topics such as medical specialist instructor course development; field artillery NCO course development; leadership; training management; democratic civil-military relations; NCO development; interoperability; and emergency operations.", "Senior Leader Visits. These are visits between senior leaders of the state National Guard, such as the adjutant general, and senior leaders of the partner nation's armed forces.

The high-level discussions focused on Defense Reform, the Georgia Guard State Partnership Program, the Georgia Border Security Program, and the Helicopter Program. Participants were also able to observe a B-1B bombing demonstration at Hunter Army Airfield and activities at the Georgia Air National Guard Combat Readiness Training Center.", "Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams. Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) provide mentoring and training for the Afghan National Army (ANA) and serve as liaisons between the ANA and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. They are composed of 13-30 personnel from one or more countries. National Guard personnel have embedded with their partner nation's OMLTs and accompanied them throughout their deployments to Afghanistan (they have also conducted similar embedded operations with partner nation forces in Iraq and Kosovo). One such deployment from 2010 is described as follows: ", "Eleven Colorado Army National Guard Soldiers will pair up with 90 Slovenian soldiers and deploy to Afghanistan this October to form an Operational Mentor and Liaison Team. Their combined mission will be to train and mentor an Afghan National Army infantry battalion, better empowering it in the use of infantry maneuvers and tactics, so the ANA can ultimately take control of its military operations ... The [Colorado National Guard] and the Republic of Slovenia have become strong allies over their 17-year collaboration through the National Guard's State Partnership Program.", "The focus of SPP activities varies depending on the needs of the partner nation, the capabilities of the state National Guard, the goals of the respective U.S. ambassador and the combatant commander, and statutory authorities and restrictions.

None of these authorities are specific to the SPP. They are authorities used generally by active and reserve component forces to conduct security cooperation activities. Accordingly, the SPP shares many similarities with other security cooperation activities carried out by the military. However, there are at least four factors that make the SPP unique."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enduring Relationships", "paragraphs": ["One unique aspect of the SPP is the ability to forge relationships between particular individuals over a long period of time. For active component personnel, a duty assignment that includes regular contact with the military of a foreign nation would typically last for about two to three years. At the end of the tour of duty, the U.S. servicemember would normally be reassigned as part of his or her career progression. In contrast, National Guard personnel participating in the SPP may well participate in engagements with partner nation military personnel repeatedly throughout their career. This is due to both the duration of the state National Guard and foreign nation partnership\u2014some of which have been in existence for nearly two decades\u2014and the frequency with which National Guard personnel serve their entire reserve careers within one state National Guard. Thus, for example, individuals who joined the Michigan National Guard in 1993 and continued to serve to the present would have had the opportunity to participate in SPP activities with Latvia numerous times over the past 18 years. In that time, both the Guard personnel and the foreign military personnel with whom they engaged will have been promoted to higher ranks, potentially providing for strong relationships between the now fairly senior National Guard and foreign military personnel. The ability to develop such long-term relationships are rare for active component personnel because of career assignment policies. An additional benefit of an enduring relationship is that it provides National Guard personnel with the opportunity to develop cultural knowledge, and potentially even language skills, based on their recurring contacts with the partner nation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Special Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["Another aspect of the SPP that distinguishes it from similar engagements by active component forces stems from the National Guard's dual status as both a state and a federal organization. In its federal status, the National Guard is a reserve component of the Army and the Air Force and is trained, organized, and equipped to conduct a wide spectrum of military activities. However, the National Guard is also the organized militia of each state and in that capacity it routinely operates under the control of its state governor, typically to respond to disasters and civil disorders. National Guard personnel in a \"Title 32 status\" have also conducted counterdrug, border security, and airport security missions. The practical expertise the National Guard has acquired in these areas may be complemented by the skills that National Guard personnel develop in their civilian occupations. For example, a National Guard soldier may serve as an infantryman in his Guard unit, but may be a state trooper, paramedic, or emergency dispatcher in his civilian job. ", "The expertise that National Guard units have acquired in conducting these types of operations are often in demand among foreign militaries, which frequently play a major role in their nation's disaster response plans, and which may play significant roles in their nation's border security, civil disorder, or counterdrug operations. Although active component forces have significant expertise in these areas\u2014as evidenced, for example, by the role played by active component personnel in responding to the earthquake in Haiti and the floods in Pakistan in 2010\u2014it is typically not exercised with the frequency of National Guard forces and, in certain cases, is intentionally limited by law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nations Engaged", "paragraphs": ["There is a limited supply of U.S. forces available to conduct security cooperation activities with foreign nations. Thus, combatant commanders target security cooperation activities toward foreign nations that they deem most important to engage at a given time. Some nations do not \"compete well\" in this process and are passed over for security cooperation activities. Combatant commanders target SPP activities toward their engagement priorities as well, but so long as a partnership exists a baseline level of roughly three SPP events per year are conducted even if the foreign nation is considered to be a comparatively low priority for engagement. From one perspective, this may be considered a long-term investment in nations that, while not currently priorities for engagement, may well become so in the future. From another perspective, this can be interpreted as a misallocation of limited resources; the National Guard assets might be better used engaging with higher priority nations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship with States", "paragraphs": ["A final area in which the SPP differs from active component security cooperation activities lies in the role of individual states in the relationship. Active component security cooperation activities are purely federal in nature; there is no connection with any U.S. state. SPP activities have both a federal and a state connection, and this latter relationship can be important from several perspectives. For the state and the foreign nation, the SPP provides a link between senior state and foreign nation officials. The adjutant general (the head of a state National Guard) is typically a senior official in his or her state government, normally heading up the state department of military affairs, and sometimes leading the state department of emergency management or homeland security. This can provide a conduit for the state and the foreign nation to develop relationships beyond that with the state National Guard\u2014for example, enhancing economic ties or conducting educational exchanges. From the federal perspective, a strong relationship between a state and a foreign nation could potentially contribute to a stronger relationship between the United States and the foreign nation.

While DOD has not yet submitted the required reports to Congress on civilian engagement activities, it appears that during 2009 and 2010, the SPP spent slightly more than $1 million per year on costs associated with U.S. and foreign civilians participating in SPP events, although it is unclear what proportion of these civilian engagements, if any, were not in compliance with statutory requirements. According to some DOD representatives, combatant commanders have recently been told to carefully examine programs to ensure that any foreign civilians participating in SPP activities are there at the request of the partner country's Ministry of Defense (MOD) and contribute to the MOD's ability to carry out its assigned mission.

However, if accurate, these comments might indicate the need for more robust and standardized event coordination procedures to ensure that the priorities of the combatant commander and the ambassador are incorporated throughout the SPP activity planning process.

In addition, DOD's use of humanitarian and civic assistance exercises has been criticized as at times inconsistent with or detrimental to long-term development goals in the countries where they are carried out. In many cases these experts argue, such activities should be conducted by military personnel under the aegis and funding of the State Department or USAID. The use of the National Guard for these activities may add further dimensions to the militarization debate.

This duty is exercised directly for the traditional education and training programs governed by Title 22 (Foreign Affairs) authorities. For Title 10 and other DOD authorities with a training and education aspect, as well as for other foreign assistance activities, specific requirements for the Secretary of State's concurrence or consultation are sometimes written into the law. In addition, the DOS has primary responsibility and authority for all foreign assistance activities. Nevertheless, Congress has increasingly authorized DOD, through Title 10 or annual legislation, to conduct security assistance and security cooperation programs. Some policymakers and analysts have viewed this trend as detrimental to coherent U.S. foreign policymaking and conduct over the long run. Others view security cooperation as an increasingly important \"core competency\" of the U.S. military and advocate a broader role for the Department of Defense in security assistance and security cooperation.", "SPP activities are currently conducted under Title 10, Title 32 and National Defense Authorization Act authorities.

Unlike some other DOD security cooperation activities, no one at the State Department is charged with the responsibility of overseeing all SPP programs. State Department involvement is focused at the embassy level, where the ambassador (or other chief of mission) must approve SPP proposals. At the State Department itself, country desk officers are informed of SPP activities. Issues arising from SPP missions are handled by the country desks and their regional bureaus.

From this perspective, a single statute could provide a clear, coherent, and permanent framework for the National Guard to conduct SPP activities, clarifying purposes and permitted events, standardizing interagency coordination, and regulating the use of funds. For instance, a dedicated SPP statute might be used to set a single standard for State Department input. It might also be used to mandate centralized oversight of the program. Currently, the NGB approves activities that it funds, and the COCOMs exercise approval over SPP activities that they fund. No single organization, however, is responsible for overseeing and standardizing all activities.

This expertise can be especially valuable to partner nations in which the military plays a leading role in responding to natural disasters, securing the nation's borders, or controlling civil unrest. Some supporters of the SPP argue that the program should be reshaped to recognize this unique niche that the National Guard can fill.
