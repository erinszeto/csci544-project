The Free Trade Agreement(FTA) will, with a phase-in period, eliminate tariffs on all goods traded between them, cover tradein services, and protect intellectual property rights. In July 2003, the House Ways and MeansCommittee, Senate Finance Committee, and House and Senate Judiciary Committees held mockmarkups on the draft implementing legislation.

Some of thespecific concerns raised deal with the restrictions on penalties for unresolvable disputes over laborand environmental issues, the Integrated Sourcing Initiative, potential capital controls, temporaryvisas, and access for U.S. exports of chewing gum. A basic policy issue with respect to the FTA iswhether the United States should pursue free trade and investment relations on a bilateral basis ratherthan maintaining existing trade and investment practices on both sides or pursuing more liberalizedtrade relations through other means. Also at issue is the extent to which the FTA language shouldbe used as a model for other agreements.", "Negotiations for the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement were launched under the ClintonAdministration in December 2000.

It continues the trend toward greater trade liberalizationand globalization, contains a new approach to imposing penalties for unresolvable environmentaland labor disputes; and may affect certain trade flows that would, in turn, affect U.S. businesses.", "Since Singapore is a relatively small economy, the economic effects of the U.S.-SingaporeFree Trade Agreement, by themselves, are not likely to be great. The debate over implementationof the FTA is falling between business and free trade interests who would benefit from moreliberalized trade, particularly in services, and labor or anti-globalization interests who oppose moreFTAs because of the overall impact of imports on jobs and the general effects of globalization onincome distribution, certain jobs, and the environment.

Qualifying information technology andmedical components manufactured on the Indonesian islands of Batam or Bintan, inparticular, and exported to the United States either in products assembled inSingapore or through that country would be considered to be of Singapore origin ifthey met the rules of origin requirement in the FTA. This initiative was included atthe request of the U.S. side and is designed to help American companies capture thecomplementarities between Singapore and its suppliers and to eliminate extrapaperwork, fees, and red tape.

In response to this concern, some language dealing with the ISI was deletedbefore the final agreement was signed. The draft language was in Article 3.2 of theagreement and referred to Annex II that in the final text is referred to as Annex 3B.

As for indirect expropriation, the FTA incorporates thetest used by the U.S. Supreme Court for regulatory taking. The Singapore FTAdiffers from the various clarifications to the North America Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA) in that it obligates Singapore and the United States to give investorstreatment in accordance with \"customary international law\" rather than in accordancewith \"international law.\" The latter was the formulation included in NAFTA whichhas been read by NAFTA panelists to include obligations under other internationalagreements such as the World Trade Organization. Such interpretations are explicitlyrejected in the Singapore FTA by inclusion of text which holds that a breach of otherprovisions of the FTA or of other international accords does not constitute a violationof the minimum standard of treatment. The FTA also incorporates language from theclarification of NAFTA that says the customary international law minimum standardof treatment of aliens is the standard that investors must be accorded and thatobligations in the agreement to provide \"fair and equitable\" treatment and \"fullprotection and security\" do not create substantive obligations over and above thatstandard.

Thisis to provide an impartial and transparent procedure for dispute settlement. Submissions to dispute panels and panel hearings are to be open to the public, andinterested parties are to have the opportunity to submit their views.

(Chapter 16) According to the U.S. Trade Representative, the protection ofcopyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets under the FTA goes farther thanprevious free-trade agreements. The FTA also enhances enforcement of intellectualproperty rights. Non-discrimination obligations apply to all types of intellectualproperty. The FTA ensures government involvement in resolving disputes betweentrademarks and Internet domain names (important to prevent \"cyber-squatting\" oftrademarked domain names). It also applies the principle of \"first-in-time,first-in-right\" to trademarks and geographical indicators (place-names) applied toproducts. This means that the first to file for a trademark is granted the first right touse that name, phrase or geographical place-name. It also streamlines the trademarkfiling process by allowing applicants to use their own national patent/trademarkoffices for filing trademark applications. ", "The FTA ensures that only authors, composers and other copyright ownershave the right the make their works available online. Copyright owners maintainrights to temporary copies of their works on computers. (This was aimed atprotecting music, videos, software, or text from widespread unauthorized sharing viathe Internet). Copyrighted works and phonograms are protected for extended terms,consistent with U.S. standards and international trends.

The FTAaddresses this potential problem with strengthened customs procedures.", "Bilateral FTAs, moreover, also play a role in the trade liberalizing process . Currently, markets are opened primarily through multilateral negotiations under theWorld Trade Organization, through organizations such as APEC, or by sectoralinitiatives. Given the slowness of the WTO multilateral negotiating process and thelack of further progress on sectoral trade liberalization following the InformationTechnology Agreement (50) in 1996, countries can do an \"end run\" around theWTO and liberalize trade with other like-minded countries. The trade diversioncreated by such FTAs, however, unleashes pressures for governments to either createFTAs of their own or join into existing FTA arrangements. Traditionallyprotectionist countries, such as China or Japan, now are actively seeking FTA-typearrangements with other nations.

At issue is the extent to which certain informationtechnology goods and medical equipment that trade duty free can be counted asSingaporean. Since the items already trade duty free, the ISI would allow them toavoid U.S. customs user fees of about 0.23% of the value of the import. Theinitiative was aimed at two Indonesian islands where many producers located inSingapore procure components. Indonesian manufacturers would not be covered bythe labor, environmental, and other provisions of the FTA. Indonesia also would notbe required to provide any reciprocal access to its markets. A concern was that othercountries, such as China, might also be able to use the provision to ship productthrough Singapore to the United States in order to avoid U.S. Customs Users fees. Some language dropped from the final text of the FTA appears to resolve this issue. In order for a third country to take advantage of the ISI, it would have to ship aqualifying product from the United States to Singapore to be incorporated into aproduct subject to the regional content requirement and then shipped back to theUnited States.", "Also at issue is the extent to which particular provisions of theU.S.-Singapore FTA would be used as a template for FTA negotiations with othernations . Of particular concern are current negotiations with five countries of CentralAmerica, the Southern African Customs Union, Morocco, and with Australia, as wellas the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas that would cover the Westernhemisphere. In many of these countries, labor and environmental standards areconsidered to be lower than those in Singapore.", "The U.S.-Singapore FTA states that both parties are to ensure that theirdomestic environmental laws provide for high levels of environmental protectionand are to strive to continue to improve such laws. The agreement also requires thatthe parties effectively enforce their own domestic environmental laws. With respectto labor standards , both parties also are to reaffirm their obligations as members ofthe International Labor Organization. They are to strive to ensure that their domesticlaws provide for labor standards consistent with internationally recognized laborprinciples. The agreement further requires the parties to effectively enforce their owndomestic labor and environmental laws. These obligations are to be enforceablethrough the agreement's dispute settlement procedures but with financial penalties(capped in amount) for non-compliance. Labor interests point out that while theSingapore agreement commits the signatories to enforce their domestic labor laws,it does not actually commit the signatories to have labor laws in place, or to ensurethat their labor laws meet any international standard or floor. (53) ", "In terms of U.S. security interests , the FTA would add a formal economiclink to the security relationship with Singapore. In 1990 and 1992, Singapore signedaccess agreements that provide for limited U.S. use of air and naval facilities inSingapore. This was partly a result of the U.S. withdrawal of forces from thePhilippines. The 1990 Access Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with theUnited States allows U.S. forces to operate resupply vessels from Singapore and touse the naval base and ship repair facilities at Sembawang port and the Paya Lebarmilitary airfield. A 1998 amendment to the MOU allows U.S. access to Singapore'snew deep-draft pier at Changi Naval Base. In 2001, the USS Kitty Hawk became thefirst foreign vessel to dock there. (54) While the FTA would not materially affect suchdefense cooperation, it could provide an economic rationale to maintain closerelations with Singapore on all fronts.", "As for the anti-terror campaign, as Al Qaeda has been driven fromAfghanistan, some radical Islamist activity has shifted to Southeast Asia. This wasmanifest in the October 12, 2002, bombings in a nightclub district in Bali frequentedby western tourists as well as other attacks on civilian and military targets inIndonesia and the Philippines. Some analysts fear that Southeast Asia with itswidespread Muslim populations could become a haven for terrorists, a hotbed fortraining radical Islamists, a source of finance for terror operations, and a primelocation for so-called \"soft terrorist targets,\" such as hotels, businesses, andtransportation facilities. In December 2001, the media reported that the Singaporeangovernment arrested members of a terrorist Jemaah Islamiah cell with extensive linksto Al Qaeda that allegedly was planning to blow up Western embassies, U.S. navalvessels, and a bus that transports American military service members. (55) Althoughthe FTA would not materially affect the anti-terror campaign, it would add a linkbetween Singapore and the United States that could enhance cooperation on certainissues (such as terrorist financing and customs inspections) and in determiningcourses of action on issues of interest to the United States in fora such as ASEAN,the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the Non-Aligned Movement. (56) ", "As a major shipping hub, Singapore also has taken measures to curb itspotential for becoming a transshipment point for illegal cargo bound for terroristbuyers, a loading point for hidden bombs in cargo containers, or a target point fordirect attacks on ships. As a member of the International Maritime Organization,Singapore already is implementing some of the anti-terrorism provisions of theInternational Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS) and the Amendments to theInternational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), (57) both dueto come into effect in July 2004. For example, gamma-ray scanners reportedly aresoon to be used to screen containers passing through Singapore ports. (58) ", "In summary, since Singapore is a relatively small economy, the overalleconomic effects of the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement are not expected tobe great. The U.S. electronics equipment and other machinery and equipment sectorspotentially may face increased imports from Singapore, although U.S. agriculturalexporters may gain from more exports. The agreement would allow greater accessto Singapore's service sector, and some see it as a standard for additional FTAs withother nations. The debate over implementation of the FTA fell between business andfree-trade interests who favor more liberalized trade, particularly in services, andlabor or anti-globalization interests who oppose more FTAs because of the overallimpact of imports on jobs and the general effects of globalization on incomedistribution, certain jobs, and the environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Activity", "paragraphs": ["House Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on Domestic andInternational Trade Policy, Trade, and Technology held a hearing entitled\"Opening Trade in Financial Services -- The Chile and Singapore Examples.\" April 1, 2003.", "House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade,and Consumer Protection held a hearing entitled \"Trade in Services andE-Commerce: The Significance of the Singapore and Chile Free TradeAgreements.\" May 8, 2003.", "House Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Trade held a hearingentitled \"Hearing on Implementation of U.S. Bilateral Free Trade Agreementswith Chile and Singapore,\" June 10, 2003.", "House Committee on International Relations, Subcommittee on Asia and The Pacificheld a hearing entitled \"U.S. Trade and Commercial Policy in Southeast Asiaand Oceania,\" June 25, 2003.", "S.Con.Res. 42 (Bond)/ H.Con.Res. 167 (Weldon).
