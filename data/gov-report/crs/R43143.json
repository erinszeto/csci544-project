These include a set of financial and technical programs known, variously, as cooperative threat reduction (CTR) programs, nonproliferation assistance, or, global security engagement. Congress has supported these programs over the years, but has raised a number of questions about their implementation and their future direction.", "Over the years, the CTR effort shifted from an emergency response to impending chaos in the Soviet Union to a broader program seeking to keep CBRN weapons away from rogue nations or terrorist groups. It has also grown from a DOD-centered effort to include projects funded by the Department of Defense (DOD), the State Department, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Together, these agencies sought nearly $1.67 billion for these programs in FY2016.", "Although initially focused on the former Soviet Union, these programs now seek to engage partners around the world. The United States has used its funding and expertise to help secure or destroy dangerous weapons and materials in nations that experience civil strife or regime collapse, such as in Libya, and to prevent their spread outside a conflict's borders, such as with Syria's neighboring countries. U.S. cooperation has nearly stopped, with many of the CTR projects in Russia winding down after the June 2013 expiration of the Memorandum of Understanding that governed DOD's cooperation with Russia. The two countries could continue to cooperate on some areas of nuclear security with a bilateral protocol under the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program in the Russian Federation Agreement (MNEPR).", "In its oversight of these programs, Congress has addressed questions about the coordination of and priority given to these programs, about partner nations' willingness to provide access to their weapons facilities, and about metrics used to measure progress. Congress has also reviewed efforts to engage nations around the world in cooperative threat reduction and security engagement activities. Some Members have actively encouraged the Obama Administration to expand these programs to the Middle East and North Africa.", "This report summarizes cooperative activities conducted during the full 20 years of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance. Many older programs have concluded their work, while more recent programs continue to expand their scope and their geographic reach.", "Several DOD and DOE programs have helped Russia and the other former Soviet states eliminate nuclear weapons delivery systems and secure nuclear warheads in storage. DOE has also helped Russia strengthen security and materials accounting at facilities that store nuclear materials. These agencies are seeking to expand this effort to other nations by sharing \"best practices\" with partner countries through Centers of Excellence. DOE is also working, through the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), to secure, protect, and in some cases, remove vulnerable nuclear and radiological materials at civilian facilities worldwide.", "DOD has also helped Russia secure and eliminate chemical weapons by supporting the design and construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye. DOD and the State Department also provide assistance to address concerns about the proliferation of pathogens that might be used in biological weapons. DOD's biological threat reduction program now accounts for nearly 60% in the FY2016 budget request. It also has grown from a program focused on dismantling the vast biological weapons complex in Russia into a tool used to promote \"best practices\" at biological laboratories with dangerous pathogens and to develop disease surveillance systems on several continents, particularly Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.", "The United States also supports global programs that are designed to prevent the smuggling or illegal export of CBRN materials and technology. The State Department and DOE have also developed programs that are designed to reduce the risk that the weapons scientists would sell their knowledge to nations seeking their own CBRN weapons. These programs seek to prevent terrorists from exploiting scientists, other personnel, or materials to develop these weapons. The programs also train not only scientists, but other lab personnel about international security standards and improve personnel reliability programs to address the \"insider threat.\"", "This report will be updated as needed."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Many experts have postulated that the threat of attack with chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) weapons represents one of the greatest threats to U.S. national security. There is widespread agreement\u2014within the U.S. government, among national security policy analysts, and across the political spectrum\u2014that the United States faces a growing threat from the potential use of these weapons by hostile nations and terrorist groups. Many in Congress have also expressed concerns about the potential terrorist use of CBRN weapons and have supported U.S. efforts to address and mitigate this threat.", "President George W. Bush highlighted this threat in his 2002 National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction. This report opened with the observation that \"weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\u2014nuclear, biological, and chemical\u2014in the possession of hostile states and terrorists represent one of the greatest security challenges facing the United States. We must pursue a comprehensive strategy to counter this threat in all of its dimensions.\" President Obama offered a similar warning in his 2010 National Security Strategy, when he noted that \"there is no greater threat to the American people than weapons of mass destruction, particularly the danger posed by the pursuit of nuclear weapons by violent extremists and their proliferation to additional states.\" ", "The United States uses a range of policy tools to address the threats posed by the potential spread of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons to hostile nations or non-state actors. These range from diplomatic engagement and economic sanctions to the threat of military intervention. One key set of tools is a set of financial and technical programs known, variously, as cooperative threat reduction programs, nonproliferation assistance, or, global security engagement. Through these programs, the United States seeks to work with other nations to help them secure and eliminate their CBRN weapons and material, to stem the flow of weapons and related knowledge and materials to hostile nations or non-state actors who might seek to develop their own weapons, and to develop training programs and share \"best practices\" to ensure that other nations can protect the materials and knowledge that remain in their countries.", "Many of the programs that are funded through these efforts evolved out of an initiative that Congress created in late 1991. After an August 1991 coup in Moscow led to concerns about the potential loss of control over Soviet nuclear weapons, Congress passed the Nunn-Lugar amendment and authorized the use of up to $400 million in funds in the Department of Defense (DOD) budget to help safely secure, transport, and eliminate Soviet nuclear weapons. This initiative grew over the years, such that the United States spent around $1.65 billion in FY2013 on programs that have sought to secure and eliminate nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and materials in the former Soviet states; enhance border security and export controls to deter and detect efforts to transport these materials across state lines; secure and eliminate nuclear, chemical, or biological materials in nations outside the former Soviet Union; and redirect weapons scientists in many nations around the world so that they will pursue programs with peaceful purposes. This funding has, however, begun to decline, falling to $1.59 billion in FY2014, $1.25 billion in FY2015, and a requested $1.4 billion in FY2016. In addition, these programs are now funded and administered by DOD, the Department of Energy (DOE), the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and several other U.S. agencies.", "Over the years, Congress has offered significant support to these efforts. It has not only authorized and appropriated increasing sums for these programs, it has generally agreed with the executive branch on the priorities and goals for them. Nevertheless, over the years, some Members have questioned the value of specific goals and the effectiveness of some projects. Congress has adjusted the profile of these programs over the years, sometimes reducing funds, sometimes increasing funds, and sometimes initiating new programs and project areas. The 113 th Congress is likely to continue to review the funding for these programs, consider the goals, and assess their effectiveness. Moreover, Congress may continue to raise questions about the future intent of these programs, the success of government-wide coordination in implementing them, and the extent of international cooperation in addressing these threats. These questions may be amplified in the future, as the United States and Russia conclude most of their cooperation.", "This report provides information on the wide range of programs that the United States is pursuing to secure and eliminate nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and materials and to prevent hostile nations and terrorist organizations from gaining access to these weapons or the knowledge and materials needed to manufacture and use them. It begins with a brief review of the evolution of these programs, demonstrating how the goals and objectives have changed over the years. It also reviews some of the issues that Congress may confront as it seeks to provide oversight of these programs and reviews budget requests for them. The report then provides information on individual programs that are designed to secure and eliminate nuclear weapons, secure and eliminate nuclear materials, secure borders and improve export controls, eliminate chemical weapons, secure biological pathogens, and redirect scientists with knowledge of CBRN weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Nunn-Lugar Amendment", "paragraphs": ["Congress initiated U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to the Soviet Union in November 1991. A failed coup in Moscow in August 1991 and the subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union had raised concerns about the safety and security of Soviet nuclear weapons. Consequently, Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar proposed an amendment to the implementing legislation for the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty ( P.L. 102-228 ). This amendment, titled the \"Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991,\" authorized the use of $400 million in FY1992 Defense Department (DOD) funds to assist the Soviet Union, and its \"successor entities\" with efforts to \"1) destroy nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons, 2) transport, store, disable, and safeguard weapons in connection with their destruction, and 3) establish verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of such weapons.\" This effort became known as the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Evolving Program", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Threat Reduction and Nonproliferation", "paragraphs": ["Initially, many in Congress saw U.S. assistance under the CTR program as an emergency response to impending chaos in the Soviet Union. Senators arguing in support of the program, including Senators Nunn and Lugar, noted that the disintegration of the Soviet Union created \"the danger that the ultimate disposition of nuclear weapons in the new political system will not be conducive to their safety or international stability.\" They warned of \"a danger of seizure, theft, sale or use of nuclear weapons or components\" and argued that \"any weakening of control over weapons and components could spill outside the territory of the former Soviet Union, fueling nuclear proliferation worldwide.\" Senator Nunn further warned that \"we are on the verge of either having the greatest destruction of nuclear weapons in the history of the world or the greatest proliferation of nuclear weapons, nuclear materials, and scientific know-how on how to make these weapons, as well as chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, even biological weapons the world has ever seen.\"", "Even after the sense of immediate crisis passed in 1992 and 1993, many analysts and Members of Congress remained concerned about the potential for diversion or a loss of control of Russia's nuclear and other weapons. Russia's economy was extremely weak and press accounts reported that nuclear materials from Russia were appearing on the black market in Western Europe. Consequently, many began to view CTR as a part of a long-term threat reduction and nonproliferation effort. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry referred to CTR as \"defense by other means,\" as the program helped eliminate Soviet weapons that had threatened the United States and contain weapons and materials that could pose new threats in the hands of other nations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonproliferation and Counterterrorism", "paragraphs": ["By the mid-1990s, many observers also began to view U.S. assistance to the former Soviet states as a part of the effort to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists. In 1996, experts testified to Congress that Russian nuclear and chemical facilities, with their crumbling security and lack of accounting procedures, could provide a source for terrorists seeking nuclear or chemical materials. In response, Congress expanded the programs that provided security at facilities with nuclear materials and suggested that more attention be paid to security at facilities with materials that could be used in chemical or biological weapons. ", "In January 2001, a task force sponsored by the Department of Energy stated that \"the most urgent unmet national security threat to the United States today is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or weapons-usable materials in Russia could be stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation states and used against American troops abroad or citizens at home.\" Since September 11, 2001, virtually all analysts who follow U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance have argued that, by helping Russia protect its weapons, related materials, and knowledge, the United States could make it more difficult for terrorists to acquire CBRN weapons.", "The George W. Bush Administration clearly considered U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in the former Soviet states to be a part of U.S. efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists, explaining, in early 2003, that it had \"expanded the strategic focus of the CTR program\" to support the war on terrorism. In its budgets presented in the years after FY2004, the Administration increased funding for several export and border control programs, for programs designed to stem the leakage of knowledge out of the former Soviet Union, and for an effort to find and recover \"radiological sources\"\u2014a type of device that could provide terrorists with nuclear materials for use in a \"dirty bomb.\" ", "All of these initiatives focused more on stemming proliferation than on eliminating nuclear weapons in the former Soviet states. But the programs did not completely lose the initial focus. During a February 2005 summit in Bratislava, Presidents Bush and Vladimir Putin agreed to accelerate some of the efforts to secure Soviet-era nuclear weapons. This agreement shifted additional funding into some of the DOD CTR projects and hastened the completion of some warhead storage and security efforts. As a result, in the years leading up to the 2013 expiration of the agreement governing these programs, U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in Russia completed much of the work focused on eliminating retired Soviet-era nuclear weapons delivery systems, transporting and securing nuclear warheads, and paving the way for the destruction of Soviet-era chemical weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Global Security Engagement", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs have expanded beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union, as the United States has sought to secure and eliminate nuclear, chemical, and biological materials around the world by working with a diverse set of countries to build capacity on nuclear security, biological pathogen security, and border security. This is done through a combination of training programs and equipment, the majority of which is provided to non-nuclear-weapon states. ", "The Obama Administration endorsed the expansion of these programs, noting that they could help contain proliferation and reduce the threat from terrorists who might seek CBRN weapons. According to Administration officials, these programs are designed to keep these weapons \"out of the hands of terrorists and states of concern, [to lock down] dangerous nuclear and biological materials, [to eliminate] chemical weapons, [to destroy] legacy weapons, and [to build] capabilities and conduct operations to prevent acquisition, contain and roll back threats, and respond to [CBRN] crises.\" President Obama specifically placed a priority on securing vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide, and has both engaged international partners through the Nuclear Security summit process and accelerated funding for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) with this goal in mind. ", "Funding requests have demonstrated the new priorities, with support for programs that move beyond the program's historical base in the former Soviet Union. Nations in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia can now participate in cooperative programs supported by this funding. According to the Obama Administration, by 2013, DOD was \"now funding roughly as much work outside of the former Soviet Union as we are inside the former Soviet Union.\" Its goal is to increase \"the flexibility of the program to be successful as a global effort.\" This shift in funding has continued in recent years, as much of the cooperation with Russia has concluded.", "While many in Congress now support this global expansion of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs, Congress took several years to approve this new authority. For example, during the debate over the FY2003 Defense Authorization Bill, the Senate approved an amendment, proposed by Senator Richard Lugar, that would allow DOD to use up to $50 million in FY2003 CTR funds \"outside the states of the former Soviet Union\" to resolve \"critical emerging proliferation threats and to take advantage of opportunities to achieve long-standing United States nonproliferation goals.\" The Bush Administration supported Senator Lugar's proposal but the House objected and the language was removed in conference. The Bush Administration requested the same authority the following year and the Senate again offered its unqualified support, but many in the House again objected. The conference committee included the authority to spend $50 million in CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union in the FY2004 Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 108-136 ), but, indicated that this funding could be used only for short-term projects. The Bush Administration exercised this authority for the first time in mid-2004, when it provided assistance to Albania for the elimination of chemical weapons.", "Congressional support for the expansion of these programs had grown more wide-spread by the end of the Bush Administration. For example, in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 110-181 , \u00a71306), Congress indicated that CTR should be \"strengthened and expanded, in part by developing new CTR initiatives.\" It suggested that these new initiatives could include \"programs and projects in Asia and the Middle East; and activities relating to the denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\" Congress added $10 million to the CTR authorization to fund these programs, streamlined the process of identifying and approving projects, and eliminated the requirement that limited the program to short-term projects that addressed sudden, emergency proliferation concerns. Congress also mandated that the National Academy of Sciences conduct a study \"to analyze options for strengthening and expanding the CTR Program.\" When it released the required report in 2009, the National Academy recommended that the United States use a new, broader CTR program to engage nations around the world in a global effort to secure dangerous weapons and materials. It also suggested that Congress authorize DOD to accept funds from other nations for use in CTR efforts. The FY2010 Defense Authorization Bill included this provision. The Obama Administration supported these efforts and its budget request for FY2011 included funds for this purpose in several program areas.", "Some Members of Congress actively encouraged the Obama Administration to expand cooperative threat reduction efforts in the Middle East and North Africa. Senator Jeanne Shaheen introduced the \"Next Generation Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2013\" ( S. 1021 ) and Representative Jeff Fortenberry introduced the Cooperative Threat Reduction Modernization Act ( H.R. 2314 ). Both of these bills direct the Administration to provide a strategy for the expansion of CTR programs in the Middle East and North Africa. Similar provisions were part of both House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act of FY2014 ( H.R. 1960 , \u00a71304; S. 1197 , \u00a71326) which became P.L. 113-66 ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Future of Cooperation with Russia", "paragraphs": ["While the United States has broadened and deepened its nonproliferation and security engagement with nations outside the former Soviet Union, it has scaled back, and, in some cases, concluded, programs of cooperation with Russia. Some of these changes have occurred because ongoing projects were completed or because Russia had the resources to manage the programs on its own. However, more significant changes to the future of U.S.-Russian nonproliferation cooperation derive from the June 17, 2013, expiration of the long-standing Memorandum of Understanding, known as the \"umbrella agreement,\" that has governed these programs since 1992. This agreement provided the legal framework that allowed for program implementation. ", "Reports indicate that the United States presented Russia with a draft extension of the umbrella agreement in mid-2012. This draft contained most of the same provisions as the original agreement, which was signed at a time when Russia lacked the financial resources and political will to secure its nuclear weapons and materials on its own. Russia is not only able to finance many of these programs itself now, but according to some observers, is more than willing to do so. Moreover, Russian officials seemed to be unwilling to allow U.S. contractors access to sensitive Russian military facilities, even if that meant that Russia would no longer have access to U.S. financial resources. As a result, in early October 2012, Russian officials indicated that they were prepared to allow the agreement to lapse and to conclude the programs. In a report for Congress prepared in March 2013, the Pentagon indicated that, without adequate legal protections in a new agreement, the United States would have to begin to shut down some of the ongoing projects.", "After the United States and Russia failed to reach an agreement on the extension of the original umbrella agreement, they agreed to continue cooperation under a bilateral protocol to the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) Agreement. The MNEPR was negotiated to allow European partners to give funds to nonproliferation and radiological clean-up projects in Russia under the G-8 Global Partnership. The United States signed the MNEPR agreement in 2003, but did not sign the associated Protocol on Claims, Legal Proceedings and Indemnification, since the preexisting CTR umbrella agreement covered those issues already. Nine countries as well as several European institutions have used this protocol for liability protection and tax exemption for threat reduction assistance in Russia for the past decade. These protections apply to the United States now, since it signed such a MNEPR protocol with Russia on June 14, 2013.", "In a fact sheet released on June 19, 2013, the State Department noted that the United States and Russia will continue to cooperate \"in a broad array of nuclear security and nonproliferation areas.\" These will include, but are not limited to", "improving security of nuclear and radiological material; customs control of nuclear and radioactive material; recovery and securing of radioactive sources; consolidation of nuclear material and conversion of excess highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU); conversion of HEU research reactors to operate with LEU; and nuclear submarine dismantlement.", "Russia's Ministry of Defense will not participate in projects under this agreement, and, as a result, the United States and Russia will no longer cooperate on projects that eliminate strategic offensive arms or transport and secure nuclear warheads. According to the State Department fact sheet, \"Russia will now take full responsibility over this mission.\" Projects in both areas were already winding down after many years of successful cooperation. At the same time, the United States will continue to monitor Russia's deployed strategic offensive forces under the 2010 New START Treaty. The United States and Russia also will not continue ongoing projects designed to eliminate chemical weapons, although the State Department indicated that the United States and Russia \"continue to discuss potential technical cooperation on chemical weapons destruction outside the new framework.\" ", "The Department of Energy, however, expected that it would continue to cooperate with its counterpart in Russia, Rosatom, to secure Russian nuclear facilities and materials. As is noted below, DOE programs that enhance security at Russian warhead storage facilities had already concluded, in part because of the conclusion of the work and in part because of the lapse in cooperation with Russia's Ministry of Defense. However, the expectation that remaining programs would continue proved false. In late 2014, Russia informed the United States that it would no longer accept U.S. assistance in securing weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. ", "Even before Russia suspended cooperation, some in Congress had questioned whether the remaining projects should continue in light of Russia's aggression against Ukraine during 2014. The House version of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 4435 , Secs. 1303 and 3120) specified that neither DOD nor DOE could spend funds authorized for threat reduction and nonproliferation cooperation in Russia until the Secretaries of Defense or Energy certified that Russian forces were no longer occupying areas of Ukraine and that Russia was in full compliance with its arms control obligations under the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. The final version of the FY2015 NDAA that became law ( P.L. 113-291 ) did not include these certification requirements. Section 3122 allowed the programs to continue, but stated that material protection, control and accounting activities in the Russian Federation should be completed no later than 2018 (except for activities under the Plutonium Management Disposition Agreement). ", "The FY2016 version of the NDAA ( S. 1356 , Sec. 3121), however, does contain limitations on U.S. threat reduction cooperation with Russia. The legislation states that \"none of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act \u2026 for defense nuclear nonproliferation activities may be obligated or expended to enter into a contract with, or otherwise provide assistance to, the Russian Federation.\" The legislation does contain a waiver, allowing the Secretary of Energy to waive the prohibition and enter into contracts after notifying Congress that the waiver is in the national security interest of the United States and providing the justification for the waiver."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Threat Reduction After Regime Collapse", "paragraphs": ["The United States government has grown increasingly concerned about its ability to address the security of stocks of weapons of mass destruction and the facilities that produce them in the event of a regime collapse in countries where such capabilities exist. This scenario presented itself during regime transitions in Libya and Iraq, and, more recently, in the international efforts to remove chemical weapons from Syria. North Korea has also been discussed as a possible future scenario should its regime collapse, or should the current government agree to disarmament measures. The concern over loss of control of WMD during conflict or regime change is the same concern that motivated the original CTR programs in the former Soviet Union. Providing assistance in these cases can be difficult, primarily because CTR and related nonproliferation programs are not designed work in a non-cooperative environment; they require the agreement of the host country.", "Libya and Iraq provide two examples of CTR during a time of transition. In Libya, the dismantlement process after Libya became a party to the Conventional Weapons Convention (CWC) in 2004 was initially cooperative with the agreement of the regime. In 2011, after the fall of the Qaddafi regime, the chemical stocks were first secured by forces aligned with the United States. Later, the new government in Libya agreed to work with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), to complete the destruction of CW stocks. In Iraq, much of the dismantlement work had been accomplished by the United Nations inspectors prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, and stockpiles and capacity turned out to have been overestimated. As described above, a major focus of CTR and nonproliferation programs in both Iraq and Libya has been engaging former WMD weapons scientists in civilian projects to prevent the proliferation of their expertise. ", "The Syrian case may be the first time the international community has faced a protracted civil war in a state with a known stockpile of chemical weapons. Due to the threat of access to these weapons by unauthorized groups including terrorists, the United States government had been preparing for scenarios to secure the weapons in the event of the loss of control by the Assad regime. U.S. officials, however, noted the extreme difficulty of accomplishing that goal, which would have probably required ground troops. Therefore, instead the United States focused on working with neighboring countries to bolster their border controls to prevent proliferation of these weapons and materials from Syria. ", "After the Syrian government made the decision in September 2013 to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy its chemical weapons programs, the United States provided technical and financial support to the international community to destroy Syrian chemical weapons stocks under international supervision. This is a unique case for the CTR program since the primary U.S. threat reduction work\u2014destruction of Syrian chemical weapons\u2014was done outside of the country of origin.

Key steps include more effectively ensuring alignment of resources with our national security strategy, adapting the education and training of national security professionals to equip them to meet modern challenges, reviewing authorities and mechanisms to implement and coordinate assistance programs, and other policies and programs that strengthen coordination.\" This challenge was also highlighted in the 9/11 Commission's report, the report of the Commission on the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism, as well as oversight hearings.", "In response to concerns about program coordination, the Obama Administration designated a new director on the NSC staff who would serve as the coordinator for the prevention of WMD proliferation and terrorism. This NSC director had a deputy director who focused specifically on threat reduction efforts, and sought to coordinate the threat reduction and nonproliferation programs across agencies. This director did not, however, have direct control over the budgets of the participating agencies. Nevertheless, officials in the Obama Administration have indicated that the Administration has succeeded in coordinating program implementation across agencies.

The \"global\" architecture is to be guided by DNDO. However, DNDO was given authority to implement this architecture in the United States, while the Departments of Defense, State, and Energy were to continue their activities related to nuclear detection internationally. This has resulted in DNDO performing a coordinating function where the other agencies submit lists of activities that DNDO then places in its overall framework to assess where gaps or duplication might occur.

Officials have told CRS that this kind of coordination happens on a daily basis without need for formal mandates, for example on specific threat reduction initiatives in a foreign country.

President Bush followed this pattern during his Administration, when he and President Putin agreed at Bratislava to accelerate warhead and materials security programs.

Some analysts outside government argue that these reductions will undercut the programs and reflect a change in Administration priorities. ", "There are a number of reasons why funding and the pace of effort in these programs may have declined. For example, these programs require cooperation from partner countries, and that cooperation often comes through detailed, written agreements. Delays in reaching these agreements can slow the start of a program, which can reduce the required level of funding in subsequent years. Moreover, as some in the Administration have noted, a decline in funding can be an indicator of a program's success. This is the case for many of the early CTR programs, such as strategic offensive arms elimination, through which Russia and Ukraine have nearly completed the elimination of strategic weapons limited by arms control agreements.", "Overall, the decline in some major programs such as DOE's IMPC&A and some DOD work, such as CW destruction, generally reflects a wrapping up of major construction projects in the Russian Federation. New areas of work related to facilitate security and border control training may be less expensive than past projects. In some areas, DOD and State Departments budgets have remained steady, as is seen in Appendix A . Arguably, the DOE budget has been reduced in areas where existing program goals have been accomplished. However, some critics of reductions point out that funding should remain at least at the same level so that the agencies can identify and work against new threats and in new geographical areas.

In the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 ( P.L. 111-84 ) Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement metrics to measure the impact and effectiveness of DOD's CTR activities. ", "For many of the DOD's CTR programs, measuring success has been a relatively straightforward exercise. Senator Lugar often referred to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's CTR Scorecard to describe the numbers of nuclear weapons and delivery systems that were no longer actively deployed in Russia's nuclear arsenal. DOD and DOE have also reported the numbers of nuclear weapons transported to secure storage locations and the numbers of storage locations for nuclear warheads and nuclear materials that received upgrades to their security systems. Other examples of successes that are measurable are the removal of weapons-usable material and nuclear enrichment technology from Libya, the destruction of chemical munitions and chemical weapons agents in Libya, and the dismantlement of biological weapons infrastructure in Iraq.", "As the United States has expanded its threat reduction assistance to nations outside the former Soviet states, and as the programs have emphasized cooperative engagement, capacity-building, and best practices instead of weapons dismantlement and facility security, the problem of measuring progress has grown more complicated. As the National Academy of Sciences noted in its 2012 report, \"It is complex and challenging to develop metrics for the partner's capabilities and the personal and institutional relationships established.... \" While participants in the program may be confident in their ability to share knowledge and build cooperative relationships, they may be less confident in their ability to measure the relationship between funding and progress in cooperation. ", "However, most of the threat reduction assistance currently underway is more difficult to quantify. In many cases, progress is evident in access to decision makers and operators, and success is reflected in the growth of relationships. In some cases, however, it may be possible to devise metrics to measure progress. For example, the State Department's EXBS program uses a Rating Assessment Tool with a 419-point survey to score a country's licensing, enforcement, industry outreach, and nonproliferation regime adherence. According to the State Department, this tool allows the program \"to determine weaknesses in each partner country's strategic trade control system, ascertain effectiveness of prior bilateral EXBS assistance activities, and pinpoint areas where limited assistance dollars can achieve the greatest impact.\" This tool is also used to measure how the EXBS assistance has improved the country's strategic trade controls over time.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 ( P.L. 111-84 ) also mandated that DOD contract with the National Academy of Sciences to review the report developed by DOD. The National Academy completed this review, and published its report, Improving Metrics for the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs , in 2012. This report specifically addressed the challenges of measuring the success of programs focused on capacity-building or scientist engagement. It noted that it is not only difficult to measure progress in these programs, but also difficult to identify how these programs reduce threats to U.S. national security. As a result, the NAS report indicates that before measuring whether or not the programs are successful, the U.S. agencies responsible for the programs should identify clear, measurable objectives and outline how those objectives relate to U.S. national security goals. The report also notes that the effort to measure progress in some programs may be further complicated by the fact that both the objectives and the steps taken to reach these objectives can change over time. In addition, regardless of how precise the metrics or how well the measures of success are related to addressing threats to U.S. national security, the process of measuring success may find it difficult to capture the value of newly developed personal relationships and a more cooperative atmosphere. Moreover, the programs are choosing partner countries and projects on the basis of their proliferation risk (the assessment of which varies somewhat by agency) before starting a project. Identifying threats and prioritization of work based on risk appears to be becoming increasingly important in program management. ", "As the United States continues to shift its focus from \"threat reduction\" to \"global security engagement,\" with the programs doing more to build capacity than eliminate weapons, Congress may continue to question how to measure progress and identify success.

Russia, however, in some cases, sought to limit access and transparency to protect sensitive facilities and information from foreign inspection. For example, Russia did not provide complete information about or access to facilities in its biological weapons complex, which limited the implementation of cooperative biological engagement programs. In addition, it did not provide the United States with access to many facilities in Russia's nuclear weapons complex, leaving large holes in the U.S. understanding of the potential security challenges regarding security for the nuclear materials at those facilities.", "Press reports indicate that Russia cited its concerns about U.S. demands for access and transparency in the 2012 and 2013 discussions on the future of the CTR umbrella agreement. According to some reports, Russian officials argued that the provisions that provide the United States with extensive access to Russian facilities and Russian strategic forces, without offering Russia similar access to U.S. nuclear facilities and forces, are inequitable and unfair. Russian officials have indicated that a future agreement, if it exists, should provide for a more balanced approach.", "Some U.S. analysts have indicated that they do not think Russia was being unreasonable in seeking changes, and more balance, in the CTR umbrella agreement. They note that times had changed in the 20 years since the programs began. Russia's financial position had improved and Russia expected to be treated as more of a partner, rather than an aid recipient, when pursuing cooperative security programs. There were limits, however, to how much the United States could alter the access and transparency provisions in the umbrella agreement. DOD contracting rules, for example, obligate the recipient to allow DOD access to confirm that the equipment is used correctly and operating properly. Moreover, although Russia's interest in protecting secret details about its nuclear weapons programs may be understandable, this secrecy, and the resulting delays in program implementation, served to undermine support in the United States for threat reduction work in Russia.", "As the United States expands it threat reduction and nonproliferation programs to a growing number of countries around the world, it may face additional questions about the level of access and transparency required for these programs. The dynamics of this problem are different in countries that do not possess WMD. Therefore, working with states that possess nuclear weapons such as India, Pakistan, and China, the access and transparency challenges will be greater than with other partners. The majority of partner countries at present do not have WMD, and the \"cooperative engagement\" model seems to presume that partner countries will willingly open their facilities to U.S. experts so that they can work to improve security and share \"best practices\" when handling dangerous materials. But these programs may still encounter legal or procedural barriers to implementation, particularly if officials in other countries view U.S. interest in their programs as a sign of U.S. concern about threats emanating from those countries.

The Global Partnership does not rely on a single coordinating body to either identify new projects or set priorities among competing projects. Each nation allocates its own funds to those programs that it views as high-priority endeavors. Partners then share experiences and project information in a working group and through the annual publication of the GP Annex, which lists all projects by donor country. This document shows continuing interest in nuclear security and the disposition of fissile materials, chemical weapons destruction, and the decommissioning of Russia's nuclear submarines.

This funding was intended to accelerate the program, in response to agreements that President Bush reached with Russia's President Putin. As Table 3 below indicates, funding has declined to $10 million-$20 million per year in recent years, after DOD completed many of the projects that had been accelerated earlier. In its FY2014 budget request for the CTR programs, DOD indicated that it would continue to help Russia \"build capacity to sustain security at 18 nuclear weapons storage sites and 5 rail transfer points.\" However, this effort transitioned to the Russian Ministry of Defense in June 2013 after the MOU governing the CTR program expired."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Warhead Security and the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": ["Through its International Materials Protection and Cooperation program, the Department of Energy implemented programs that \"secure nuclear weapons and weapons-usable nuclear materials by upgrading security at nuclear sites, by consolidating these materials to sites where installation of enhanced security systems have already been completed.... \" This effort is known as the Materials Protection, Control and Accounting Program (MPC&A).
