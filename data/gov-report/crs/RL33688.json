Military commissions pursuant to the M.O. began in November 2004 against four persons declared eligible for trial, but proceedings were suspended after a federal district court found that one of the defendants could not be tried under the rules established by the Department of Defense (DOD). The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in Rumsfeld v. Hamdan, but the Supreme Court granted review and reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals. To permit military commissions to go forward, Congress approved the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), conferring authority to promulgate rules that depart from the strictures of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and possibly U.S. international obligations. DOD published regulations to govern military commissions pursuant to the MCA.", "The Court of Military Commissions Review (CMCR), created by the MCA, issued its first decision on September 24, 2007, reversing a dismissal of charges based on lack of jurisdiction and ordering the military judge to determine whether the accused is an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" subject to the military commission's jurisdiction. The CMCR rejected the government's argument that the determination by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) that a detainee is an \"enemy combatant\" was a sufficient basis for jurisdiction, but also rejected the military judge's finding that the military commission was not empowered to make the appropriate determination.", "This report provides a background and analysis comparing military commissions as envisioned under the MCA to the rules that had been established by DOD for military commissions and to general military courts-martial conducted under the UCMJ. After reviewing the history of the implementation of military commissions in the \"global war on terrorism,\" the report provides an overview of the procedural safeguards provided in the MCA. The report identifies pending legislation, including H.R. 267, H.R. 1585, H.R. 2543, H.R. 2826, S. 1547, S. 1548, H.R. 1416, S. 1876, S. 185, S. 576, S. 447, H.R. 1415 and H.R. 2710. Finally, the report provides two tables comparing the MCA with regulations that had been issued by the Department of Defense pursuant to the President's Military Order with standard procedures for general courts-martial under the Manual for Courts-Martial. The first table describes the composition and powers of the military tribunals, as well as their jurisdiction. The second chart, which compares procedural safeguards required by the MCA with those that had been incorporated in the DOD regulations and the established procedures in courts-martial, follows the same order and format used in CRS Report RL31262, Selected Procedural Safeguards in Federal, Military, and International Courts, by [author name scrubbed], to facilitate comparison with safeguards provided in federal court and international criminal tribunals."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Rasul v. Bush , issued by the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of its 2003-2004 term, clarified that U.S. courts do have jurisdiction to hear petitions for habeas corpus on behalf of the approximately 550 persons then detained at the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in connection with the war against terrorism, establishing a role for federal courts to play in determining the validity of the military commissions convened pursuant to President Bush's Military Order (M.O.) of November 13, 2001. After dozens of petitions for habeas corpus were filed in the federal District Court for the District of Columbia, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), revoking federal court jurisdiction over habeas claims, at least with respect to those not already pending, and creating jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to hear appeals of final decisions of military commissions. The Supreme Court, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , overturned a decision by the D.C. Circuit that had upheld the military commissions, holding instead that although Congress has authorized the use of military commissions, such commissions must follow procedural rules as similar as possible to courts-martial proceedings, in compliance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). In response, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) to authorize military commissions and establish procedural rules that are modeled after, but depart from in some significant ways, the UCMJ.", "The Department of Defense has issued regulations for the conduct of military commissions pursuant to the MCA. One detainee, David Matthew Hicks of Australia, was convicted of material support to terrorism pursuant to a plea agreement. Trials began for two other defendants, but were halted after the military judges dismissed charges based on lack of jurisdiction, finding in both cases that the defendants had not properly been found to be \"unlawful enemy combatants.\" The prosecutors appealed the cases to the Court of Military Commissions Review (CMCR), which reversed the dismissal of charges in one case and remanded it to the military commission for a determination of whether the accused is an \"unlawful enemy combatant.\" The CMCR decision rejected the government's contention that the determination by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) that a detainee is an \"enemy combatant\" was a sufficient basis for jurisdiction, but also rejected the military judge's finding that the military commission was not itself empowered to make the appropriate determination."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Military Commissions: General Background", "paragraphs": ["Military commissions are courts usually set up by military commanders in the field to try persons accused of certain offenses during war. Past military commissions trying enemy belligerents for war crimes directly applied the international law of war, without recourse to domestic criminal statutes, unless such statutes were declaratory of international law. Historically, military commissions have applied the same set of procedural rules that applied in courts-martial. By statute, military tribunals may be used to try \"offenders or offenses designated by statute or the law of war.\" Although the Supreme Court long ago stated that charges of violations of the law of war tried before military commissions need not be as exact as those brought before regular courts, it is unclear whether the current Court would adopt that proposition or look more closely to precedent.", "The President's Military Order establishing military commissions to try suspected terrorists was the focus of intense debate both at home and abroad. Critics argued that the tribunals could violate any rights the accused may have under the Constitution as well as their rights under international law, thereby undercutting the legitimacy of any verdicts rendered by the tribunals. The Administration established rules prescribing detailed procedural safeguards for the tribunals in Military Commission Order No. 1 (\"M.C.O. No. 1\"), issued in March 2002 and amended in 2005. These rules were praised as a significant improvement over what might have been permitted under the language of the M.O., but some continued to argue that the enhancements did not go far enough and called for the checks and balances of a separate rule-making authority and an independent appellate process. Critics also noted that the rules did not address the issue of indefinite detention without charge, as appeared to be possible under the original M.O., or that the Department of Defense may continue to detain persons who have been cleared by a military commission. The Pentagon has reportedly stated that its Inspector General (IG) looked into allegations, made by military lawyers assigned as prosecutors to the military commissions, that the proceedings are rigged to obtain convictions, but the IG did not substantiate the charges.", "President Bush determined that twenty of the detainees at the U.S. Naval Station in Guant\u00e1namo Bay were subject to the M.O., and 10 were subsequently charged for trial before military commissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hamdan v. Rumsfeld", "paragraphs": ["Salim Ahmed Hamdan was captured in Afghanistan and charged with conspiracy for having allegedly worked for Osama Bin Laden. He challenged the lawfulness of the military commission under the UCMJ and claimed the right to be treated as a prisoner of war under the Geneva Conventions. A ruling in his favor at the district court was reversed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which, while rejecting the government's argument that the federal courts had no jurisdiction to interfere in ongoing commission proceedings, agreed with the government that the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable; that even if they were, Hamdan was not entitled to their protections; and that in any event, the military commission would qualify as a \"competent tribunal\" for challenging the petitioner's non-POW status. The appellate court did not accept the government's argument that the President has inherent authority to create military commissions without any authorization from Congress, but found such authority in the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF), read together with UCMJ arts. 21 and 36.", "The Supreme Court granted review and reversed. Before reaching the merits of the case, the Supreme Court dispensed with the government's argument that Congress had, by passing the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), stripped the Court of its jurisdiction to review habeas corpus challenges by or on behalf of Guantanamo detainees whose petitions had already been filed. In addition, regardless of whether the Geneva Conventions provide rights that are enforceable in Article III courts, the Court found that Congress, by incorporating the \"law of war\" into UCMJ art. 21, brought the Geneva Conventions within the scope of law to be applied by courts. Further, the Court found that, at the very least, Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies, even to members of al Qaeda, according to them a minimum baseline of protections, including protection from the \"passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\"", "The Court concluded that, although Common Article 3 \"obviously tolerates a great degree of flexibility in trying individuals captured during armed conflict\" and that \"its requirements are general ones, crafted to accommodate a wide variety of legal systems,\" the military commissions under M.C.O. No. 1 did not meet these criteria. In particular, the military commissions were not \"regularly constituted\" because they deviated too far, in the Court's view, from the rules that apply to courts-martial, without a satisfactory explanation of the need for such deviation. Justice Scalia, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, dissented, arguing that the DTA should be interpreted to preclude the Court's review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Military Commissions Act of 2006", "paragraphs": ["In response to the Hamdan decision, Congress enacted the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (\"MCA\") to grant the President express authority to convene military commissions to prosecute those fitting the definition under the MCA of \"alien unlawful enemy combatants.\" The MCA eliminates the requirement for military commissions to conform to either of the two uniformity requirements in article 36, UCMJ. Instead, it establishes a new chapter 47A in title 10, U.S. Code and excepts military commissions under the new chapter from the requirements in article 36. It provides that the UCMJ \"does not, by its terms, apply to trial by military commissions except as specifically provided in this chapter.\" While declaring that the new chapter is \"based upon the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under [the UCMJ],\" it establishes that \"[t]he judicial construction and application of [the UCMJ] are not binding on military commissions established under this chapter.\" It expressly exempts the new military commission from UCMJ articles 10 (speedy trial), 31 (self-incrimination warnings) and 32 (pretrial investigations), and amends articles 21, 28, 48, 50(a), 104, and 106 of the UCMJ to except military commissions under the new chapter. Other provisions of the UCMJ are to apply to trial by military commissions under the new chapter only to the extent provided therein."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["The President's M.O. was initially criticized by some as overly broad in its assertion of jurisdiction, because it could be interpreted to cover non-citizens who had no connection with Al Qaeda or the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as well as offenders or offenses not triable by military commission pursuant to statute or the law of war. A person subject to the M.O. was amenable to detention and possible trial by military tribunal for violations of the law of war and \"other applicable law.\" M.C.O. No. 1 established that commissions may be convened to try aliens designated by the President as subject to the M.O., whether captured overseas or on U.S. territory, for violations of the law of war and \"all other offenses triable by military commissions.\" The MCA largely validates the President's jurisdictional scheme for military commissions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Personal Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["While many observers agreed that the President is authorized by statute to convene military commissions in the \"Global War on Terrorism,\" some believed the President's constitutional and statutory authority to establish such tribunals does not extend beyond Congress' authorization to use armed force in response to the attacks. Under a literal interpretation of the M.O., however, the President could designate as subject to the order any non-citizen he believed had ever engaged in any activity related to international terrorism, no matter when or where these acts took place.", "The M.O. was not cited for the authority to detain; instead, the Department of Defense asserted its authority to be grounded in the law of war, which permits belligerents to kill or capture and detain enemy combatants. The Department of Defense defined \"enemy combatant\" to mean \"an individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners,\" including \"any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces.\"", "The MCA applies a somewhat broader definition for \"unlawful enemy combatant,\" which includes", "(i) a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents who is not a lawful enemy combatant (including a person who is part of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces); or", "(ii) a person who, before, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense.", "Thus, persons who do not directly participate in hostilities, but \"purposefully and materially\" support hostilities, are subject to treatment as an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" under the MCA. Citizens who fit the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" are not amenable to trial by military commission under the MCA, but may be subject to detention.", "The MCA does not define \"hostilities\" or explain what conduct amounts to \"supporting hostilities.\" To the extent that the jurisdiction is interpreted to include conduct that falls outside the accepted definition of participation in an armed conflict, the MCA might run afoul of the courts' historical aversion to trying civilians before military tribunal when other courts are available. It is unclear whether this principle would apply to aliens captured and detained overseas, but the MCA does not appear to exempt from military jurisdiction permanent resident aliens captured in the United States who might otherwise meet the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant.\" It is generally accepted that aliens within the United States are entitled to the same protections in criminal trials that apply to U.S. citizens. Therefore, to subject persons to trial by military commission who do not meet the exception carved out by the Supreme Court in ex parte Quirin for unlawful belligerents, to the extent such persons enjoy constitutional protections, would likely raise significant constitutional questions.", "The MCA did not specifically identify who makes the determination that defendants meet the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant.\" The government sought to establish jurisdiction based on the determinations of Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs), set up by the Pentagon to determine the status of detainees using procedures similar to those the Army uses to determine POW status during traditional wars. The CSRTs, however, are not empowered to determine whether the enemy combatants are unlawful or lawful, which recently led two military commission judges to hold that CSRT determinations are inadequate to form the basis for the jurisdiction of military commissions. One of the judges determined that the military commission itself is not competent to make the determination, while the other judge appears to have determined that the government's allegations did not set forth sufficient facts to conclude that the defendant, Salim Hamdan, was an unlawful enemy combatant. The Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) reversed the dismissal in the first case. While it agreed that the CSRT determinations are insufficient by themselves to establish jurisdiction, it found the military judge erred in declaring that the status determination had to be made by a competent tribunal other than the military commission itself.", "In denying the government's request to find that CSRT determinations are sufficient to establish jurisdiction over the accused, the CMCR interpreted the MCA to require more than establishing membership in Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The CMCR found", "no support for [the government's] claim that Congress, through the M.C.A., created a \"comprehensive system\" which sought to embrace and adopt all prior C.S.R.T. determinations that resulted in \"enemy combatant\" status assignments, and summarily turn those designations into findings that persons so labeled could also properly be considered \"unlawful enemy combatants.\" Similarly, we find no support for [the government's] position regarding the parenthetical language contained in \u00a7 948a(1)(A)(i) of the M.C.A.\u2014\"including a person who is part of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces.\" We do not read this language as declaring that a member of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces is per se an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" for purposes of exercising criminal jurisdiction before a military commission. We read the parenthetical comment as simply elaborating upon the sentence immediately preceding it. That is, that a member of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents will also qualify as an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" under the M.C.A. (emphasis added [by the court]).", "The CMCR further explained that executive branch memoranda defining \"enemy combatant\" status were implemented solely for purposes of continued detention of personnel captured during hostilities and applicability of the Geneva Conventions. By contrast,", "Congress in the M.C.A. was carefully and deliberately defining status for the express purpose of specifying the in personam criminal jurisdiction of military commission trials. In defining what was clearly intended to be limited jurisdiction, Congress also prescribed serious criminal sanctions for those members of this select group who were ultimately convicted by military commissions.", "Further, because detainees could not have known when their CSRT reviews were taking place that the determination could subject them to the jurisdiction of a military commission, the CMCR suggested that the use of CSRT determinations to establish jurisdiction would undermine Congress's intent that military commissions operate as \"regularly constituted court[s], affording all the necessary 'judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples' for purposes of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.\"", "As a consequence of the decision, the Department of Defense will not have to institute new status tribunals, but the prosecution has the burden of proving jurisdiction over each person charged for trial by a military commission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subject-Matter Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["The MCA provides jurisdiction to military commissions over \"any offense made punishable by this chapter or the law of war when committed by an alien unlawful enemy combatant....\" Crimes to be triable by military commission are defined in subchapter VII (10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 950p - 950w). Offenses include the following: murder of protected persons; attacking civilians, civilian objects, or protected property; pillaging; denying quarter; taking hostages; employing poison or similar weapons; using protected persons or property as shields; torture, cruel or inhuman treatment; intentionally causing serious bodily injury; mutilating or maiming; murder in violation of the law of war; destruction of property in violation of the law of war; using treachery or perfidy; improperly using a flag of truce or distinctive emblem; intentionally mistreating a dead body; rape; sexual assault or abuse; hijacking or hazarding a vessel or aircraft; terrorism; providing material support for terrorism; wrongfully aiding the enemy; spying; contempt; perjury and obstruction of justice. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950v. Conspiracy (\u00a7 950v(b)(28)), attempts (\u00a7 950t), and solicitation (\u00a7 950u) to commit the defined acts are also punishable.", "Military commissions under M.C.O. No. 1 were to have jurisdiction over crimes listed in M.C.I. No. 2, Crimes and Elements for Trials by Military Commission, which appears to have served as a basis for the MCA list. The list of crimes in M.C.I. No. 2 was not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it was intended as an illustration of acts punishable under the law of war or triable by military commissions, but did not permit trial for ex post facto crimes.", "Although many of the crimes defined in the MCA seem to be well-established offenses against the law of war, at least in the context of an international armed conflict, a court might conclude that some of the listed crimes are new. For example, a plurality of the Supreme Court in Hamdan agreed that conspiracy is not a war crime under the traditional law of war. The crime of \"murder in violation of the law of war,\" which punishes persons who, as unprivileged belligerents, commit hostile acts that result in the death of any persons, including lawful combatants, may also be new. While it appears to be well-established that a civilian who kills a lawful combatant is triable for murder and cannot invoke the defense of combatant immunity, it is not clear that the same principle applies in armed conflicts of a non-international nature, where combatant immunity does not apply. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has found that war crimes in the context of non-international armed conflict include murder of civilians, but have implied that the killing of a combatant is not a war crime. Similarly, defining as a war crime the \"material support for terrorism\" does not appear to be supported by historical precedent.", "Part IV of the Manual for Military Commissions (M.M.C.) sets forth the elements of crimes defined by the MCA. There are few substantive differences between the M.M.C. definitions and those previously set forth in M.C.I. No. 2. The M.M.C. definition of \"Aiding the Enemy\" incorporates the element of wrongfulness added by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950v(26), necessitating a new finding that the accused owed some form of allegiance to the United States at the time the conduct took place. Two crimes, \"mutilation or maiming\" and \"causing serious injury,\" were altered to remove the element that required that the victim was in the custody or control of the accused. The new definitions appear to clarify that combat activities, including attacks against combatants, are covered when the accused lacks combatant immunity. The crime \"murder by an unprivileged belligerent\" was broadened in the definition of \"murder in violation of the law of war\" to include not just killing, but also deaths resulting from an act or omission of the accused, where the accused intended to kill the victim or victims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Temporal and Spatial Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["The law of war has traditionally applied within the territorial and temporal boundaries of an armed conflict between at least two belligerents. It traditionally has not been applied to conduct occurring on the territory of neutral states or on territory not under the control of a belligerent, to conduct that preceded the outbreak of hostilities, or to conduct during hostilities that do not amount to an armed conflict. Unlike the conflict in Afghanistan, the \"Global War on Terrorism\" does not have clear boundaries in time or space, nor is it entirely clear who the belligerents are.", "The broad reach of the M.O. to encompass conduct and persons customarily subject to ordinary criminal law evoked criticism that the claimed jurisdiction of the military commissions exceeded the customary law of armed conflict, which M.C.I. No. 2 purported to restate. The MCA provides jurisdiction to military commissions over covered offenses \"when committed by an alien unlawful enemy combatant before, on, or after September 11, 2001.\" However, certain definitions used in describing the offenses triable by military commissions would seem to limit many of them to conduct occurring in an armed conflict.", "A common element among the crimes enumerated in M.C.I. No.2 was that the conduct \"took place in the context of and was associated with armed conflict.\" The instruction explained that the phrase required a \"nexus between the conduct and armed hostilities,\" which has traditionally been a necessary element of any war crime. However, the definition of \"armed hostilities\" was broader than the customary definition of war or \"armed conflict.\" According to the M.C.I., \"armed hostilities\" need not be a declared war or \"ongoing mutual hostilities.\" Instead, any hostile act or attempted hostile act might have had sufficient nexus if its severity rose to the level of an \"armed attack,\" or if it were intended to contribute to such acts. Some commentators have argued that the expansion of \"armed conflict\" beyond its customary bounds improperly expanded the jurisdiction of military commissions beyond those that by statute or under the law of war are triable by military commissions. The elements of crimes set forth in the M.M.C. also include a nexus to an armed conflict, but neither the manual nor the MCA contains a definition. The Supreme Court has not clarified the scope of the \"Global War on Terrorism,\" but has not simply deferred to the President's interpretation.", "In enacting the MCA, Congress seems to have provided the necessary statutory definitions of criminal offenses to overcome previous objections with respect to subject matter jurisdiction of military commissions. However, questions may still arise with respect to the necessity for conduct to occur in the context of an armed conflict in order to be triable by military commission. There is no express requirement to that effect in the MCA. The overall purpose of the statute together with the elements of some of the crimes arguably may be read to require a nexus.", "The definition for \"Enemy\" provided in M.C.I. No. 2 raised similar issues. According to \u00a7 5(B), \"Enemy\" includes", "any entity with which the United States or allied forces may be engaged in armed conflicts or which is preparing to attack the United States. It is not limited to foreign nations, or foreign military organizations or members thereof. \"Enemy\" specifically includes any organization of terrorists with international reach.", "Some observers argued that this impermissibly subjected suspected international criminals to the jurisdiction of military commissions in circumstances in which the law of armed conflict has not traditionally applied. The distinction between a \"war crime,\" traditionally subject to the jurisdiction of military commissions, and a common crime, traditionally the province of criminal courts, may prove to be a matter of some contention during some of the proceedings. The MCA does not define \"enemy.\" Military commissions trying persons accused of spying or aiding the enemy, for example, face the challenge of determining whether the conduct assisted an \"enemy of the United States\" as required under the MCA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Composition and Powers", "paragraphs": ["M.C.O.

The rules also permitted the appointment of persons temporarily commissioned by the President to serve as officers in the armed services during a national emergency. The presiding officer was required to be a judge advocate in any of the U.S. armed forces, but not necessarily a military judge.", "The MCA provides for a qualified military judge to preside over panels of at least five military officers, except in the cases in which the death penalty is sought, in which case the minimum number of panel members is twelve. Procedures for assigning military judges as well as the particulars regarding the duties they are to perform are left to the Secretary of Defense to prescribe, except that the military judge may not be permitted to consult with members of the panel outside of the presence of the accused and counsel except as prescribed in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 949d. The military judge has the authority to decide matters related to the admissibility of evidence, including the treatment of classified information, but has no authority to compel the government to produce classified information.", "Like the previous DOD rules, the MCA empowers military commissions to maintain decorum during proceedings. M.C.O. No. 1 authorized the presiding officer \"to act upon any contempt or breach of Commission rules and procedures,\" including disciplining any individual who violates any \"laws, rules, regulations, or other orders\" applicable to the commission, as the presiding officer saw fit. Presumably this power was to include not only military and civilian attorneys but also any witnesses who had been summoned under order of the Secretary of Defense pursuant to M.C.O. No. 1 \u00a7\u00a05(A)(5). The MCA, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950w authorizes the military commissions to \"punish for contempt any person who uses any menacing word, sign, or gesture in its presence, or who disturbs its proceedings by any riot or disorder.\" It is unclear whether this section is meant to expand the jurisdiction of military commissions to cover non-enemy combatant witnesses or civilian observers, but the M.M.C. provides for jurisdiction over all persons, including civilians, and permits military judges to sentence those convicted with both fines and terms of confinement. The UCMJ authorizes other military commissions to punish contempt with a fine of $100, confinement for up to 30 days, or both. The M.M.C. does not set a limit on punishment for contempt.", "The MCA provides that military commissions have the same power as a general court-martial to compel witnesses to appear in a manner \"similar to that which courts of the United States having criminal jurisdiction may lawfully issue.\" However, rather than providing that the trial counsel and the defense are to have equal opportunity to compel witnesses and obtain evidence, the MCA provides the defense a \"reasonable opportunity\" to obtain witnesses and evidence. The M.M.C. provides the trial counsel with responsibility for producing witnesses requested by the defense, unless trial counsel determines the witness's testimony is not required, but the defense counsel may appeal the determination to the convening authority or, after referral, the military judge.", "Under article 47 of the UCMJ, a duly subpoenaed witness who is not subject to the UCMJ and who refuses to appear before a military commission may be prosecuted in federal court. This article is not expressly made inapplicable to the military commissions established under the MCA. The M.M.C. provides the military judge or any person designated to take evidence authority to issue a subpoena to compel the presence of a witness or the production of documents. As is the case with general courts-martial, the military judge may issue a warrant of attachment to compel the presence of a witness who refuses to comply with a subpoena.", "One of the perceived shortcomings of the M.O. had to do with the problem of command influence over commission personnel. M.C.O. No. 1 provided for a \"full and fair trial,\" but contained few specific safeguards to address the issue of impartiality. The President or his designee were empowered to decide which charges to press; to select the members of the panel, the prosecution and the defense counsel, and the members of the review panel; and to approve and implement the final outcome. The President or his designees had the authority to write procedural rules, interpret them, enforce them, and amend them. Justice Kennedy remarked in his concurring opinion that the concentration of authority in the Appointing Authority was a significant departure from the structural safeguards Congress has built into the military justice system.", "The MCA, by providing requirements for the procedural rules to guard against command influence, may alleviate these concerns. In particular, the MCA prohibits the unlawful influence of military commissions and provides that neither the military commission members nor military counsel may have adverse actions taken against them in performance reviews. Many of the procedural rules are left to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense or his designee, more so than is the case under the UCMJ. Rule 104 of the Rules for Military Commissions (R.M.C.) prohibits command influence in terms similar to those in the Manual for Courts-Martial, except that they apply more broadly to \"all persons\" rather than only to \"all persons subject to the [UCMJ].\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedures Accorded the Accused", "paragraphs": ["M.C.O.

Without explicitly recognizing that accused persons had rights under the law, the M.C.O. listed procedures to be accorded to the accused, but specified that these were not to be interpreted to give rise to any enforceable right, benefit or privilege, and were not to be construed as requirements of the U.S. Constitution.

The inadequacy of an indictment in specifying charges could raise double jeopardy concerns. If the charge does not adequately describe the offense, another trial for the same offense under a new description is not as easily prevented. The MCA requires that charges and specifications be signed under oath by a person with personal knowledge or reason to believe that matters set forth therein are true. The charges must be served on the accused written in a language he understands. There is no express requirement regarding the specificity of the charges in the MCA, but the Rules for Military Commission provide that the charge must state the punitive article of the act, law of war, or offense as defined in the Manual for Military Commissions that the accused is alleged to have violated. A specification must allege every element of the charged offense expressly or by necessary implication. The Rules for Military Commissions make the trial counsel responsible for causing the accused to be served a copy of the charges in English and another language that the accused understands, where appropriate. After the accused is arraigned, the military judge may permit minor changes in the charges and specifications before findings are announced if no substantial right of the accused is prejudiced, but no major changes may be made over the objection of the accused without a new referral.", "The M.O. also left open the possibility that a person subject to the order might be transferred at any time to some other governmental authority for trial. A federal criminal trial, as a trial conducted under the same sovereign as a military commission, could have double jeopardy implications if the accused had already been tried by military commission for the same crime or crimes, even if the commission proceedings did not result in a final verdict. The federal court would face the issue of whether jeopardy had already attached prior to the transfer of the individual from military control to other federal authorities. The MCA does not expressly prohibit trial in another forum.", "Conversely, the M.O. provided that the President may determine at any time that an individual is subject to the M.O., at which point any state or federal authorities holding the individual would be required to turn the accused over to military authorities. If the accused were already the subject of a federal criminal trial under charges for the same conduct that resulted in jurisdiction over the accused under the MCA, and if jeopardy had already attached in the federal trial, double jeopardy could be implicated by a new trial before a military commission. The MCA does not explicitly provide for a double jeopardy defense under such circumstances, but the Rules for Military Commissions provide the accused a waivable right to move to dismiss charges on the basis that he has previously been tried by a federal civilian court for the same offense."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Proposed Legislation", "paragraphs": ["A number of bills have been introduced in the 110 th Congress to amend the MCA. For additional legislation pertaining to detainees and habeas corpus, see CRS Report RL33180, Enemy Combatant Detainees: Habeas Corpus Challenges in Federal Court , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed].", "H.R. 1585 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (as passed by the House of Representatives on May 17, 2007), would require a report within 60 days after enactment that contains a plan for the transfer of each individual presently detained Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who is or has ever been classified as an \"enemy combatant.\" It would also require a report identifying detainees who are charged with crimes, those who are eligible for release, and those who are not charged but ineligible for release, supplemented by a list of \"actions required to be undertaken, by the Secretary of Defense, possibly the heads of other Federal agencies, and Congress, to ensure that detainees who are subject to an order calling for their release or transfer from the Guantanamo Bay facility have, in fact, been released.\" Section 1057.", "H.R. 2543 , the Military Commissions Revision Act of 2007, would redefine \"unlawful enemy combatant\" to mean \"a person who has engaged in, attempted, or conspired to engage in acts of armed hostilities or terrorism against the United States or its co-belligerents, and who is not a lawful enemy combatant.\" It would permit the admission into evidence of statements obtained by a degree of coercion less than torture in military commission only if the military judge finds that", "(1) the totality of the circumstances indicates that the statement possesses probative value to a reasonable person;", "(2) the interests of justice would best be served by admitting the statement into evidence; and", "3) the interrogation methods used to obtain the statement do not amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.", "The bill would also repeal 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 948d(c) so that CSRT determinations would no longer be dispositive for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction of military commissions, and would restore habeas corpus for persons detained as 'enemy combatants' for more than two years and have not been charged with a crime.", "S. 1547 and S. 1548 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 5 and June 9, respectively), would make CSRTs mandatory for all detainees and would require the Secretary of Defense to provide procedural rules in some ways similar to those prescribed by the MCA for military commissions. Section 1023. Specifically, detainees would have a right to an attorney for CSRT proceedings, would be entitled to obtain evidence and witnesses under rules consistent with those that apply to military commissions, and the detainee's counsel would have an opportunity to view classified evidence, including evidence to be admitted against the detainee and any potentially exculpatory evidence, consistent with the procedures for the protection of classified information in section 949d(f) of title 10, U.S. Code. The detainee would be entitled to have access to all unclassified evidence and \"an unclassified summary of the classified evidence admitted against the detainee that is sufficiently specific to provide the detainee a fair opportunity to respond, with the assistance of counsel, to such evidence.\" Information obtained through torture would not be admissible into evidence before a CSRT. Information obtained through lesser forms of coercion would be admissible under the same standards as in military commissions, amended as described below.", "With respect to military commissions, the bills would define \"unlawful enemy combatant\" to include any alien who has been a \"knowing and active participant in an organization that engaged in hostilities against the United States.\" They would also prohibit the use of information acquired through coercion not amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment unless the statement is found to be reliable and probative; its admission would best serve the interests of justice; and either", "1) the tribunal determines that the alleged coercion was incidental to the lawful conduct of military operations at the point of apprehension;", "2) the statement was voluntary; or", "3) the interrogation methods used to obtain the statement do not amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment prohibited by section 1003 of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000dd).", "The rules for the admission of hearsay evidence would be amended to eliminate the reference to the requirements and limitations applicable to the disclosure of classified information.\" Rather than requiring the party opposing admission to demonstrate that the evidence is unreliable or lacking in probative value, the bills would make the military judge responsible for determining whether \"the totality of the circumstances render the evidence more probative on the point for which it is offered than other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts, taking into consideration the unique circumstances of the conduct of military and intelligence operations during hostilities.\"", "H.R. 2710 would restore habeas corpus for detainees. It would eliminate the CSRT review procedure, but retain the DTA provision for appealing military commission decisions, in addition to habeas corpus. H.R. 1416 and S. 185 , the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007, would remove habeas corpus restrictions on detainees and clarify that habeas corpus is available to challenge military commission decisions. H.R. 1416 would also strike the prohibition in section 5 of the MCA on the use of the Geneva Conventions as a source of rights in habeas corpus and other court actions against the United States or its officers and employees. H.R. 2826 would amend 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(e) to allow habeas corpus actions and requests for injunctive relief against transfer, except in cases of detainees held in an active war zone where the Armed Forces are implementing the Prisoner of War (POW) regulation, AR 190-8, but would prohibit all other court actions by detainees. However, it would also amend the MCA in such a way as to maintain the current limited appeal of military commission decisions, in addition to habeas corpus. H.R. 267 , the Military Commissions Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007, would eliminate restrictions on habeas corpus in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(e), but would eliminate jurisdiction over all other actions, except for DTA challenges of CSRT determinations and military commission decisions.", "S. 1876 , the National Security with Justice Act of 2007, would redefine \"enemy combatant\" to mean a person who is not a lawful enemy combatant who has engaged in hostilities against the United States; or has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States (other than hostilities engaged in as a lawful enemy combatant). It would expressly exclude from the definition of \"enemy combatant\" U.S. citizens and aliens lawfully within the United States who are taken into custody there. Section 201. The bill would eliminate the MCA provision for exclusivity of its appeals provisions, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950g, and would eliminate the provision in the DTA for appeals of status determinations, but would extend a statutory right of habeas corpus to detainees, giving the D.C. Federal District Court jurisdiction to hear challenges to detention and challenges of final decisions of military commissions. Section 301. Habeas corpus challenges would not be permitted by persons detained in a foreign zone of military operations where the Secretary of Defense certifies that the United States is implementing its detainee regulations, Army Regulation 190-8, or any successor regulation.", "S. 576 and its companion bill, H.R. 1415 , the Restoring the Constitution Act of 2007, would redefine \"unlawful enemy combatant\" to mean an individual who is not a lawful combatant who \"directly participates in hostilities in a zone of active combat against the United States,\" or who \"planned, authorized, committed, or intentionally aided the terrorist acts on the United States of September 11, 2001,\"or harbored such a person. The bills would also expressly limit the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" for use in designating individuals as eligible for trial by military commission.", "The bills would require procedural and evidentiary rules for military commissions to conform to the UCMJ except where expressly provided otherwise, and would limit the Secretary of Defense's authority to make exceptions to commission procedures and rules of evidence to those made necessary by unique circumstances of military or intelligence operations during hostilities.", "The bills would repeal the authority for civilian attorneys to act as trial (prosecution) counsel in a commission proceeding, but would permit civilian attorneys to act as defense counsel, with the assistance of detailed defense counsel. An accused who elects to represent himself would be authorized to obtain the assistance of civilian counsel in addition to detailed defense counsel.", "The bills would modify the evidentiary requirements of the MCA in several respects. The provision for permitting evidence acquired without a warrant would not apply to evidence acquired within the United States. The responsibility for determining the reliability of hearsay evidence would fall on the military judge, on motion of counsel, rather than requiring the party opposing the evidence to demonstrate its lack of reliability. All statements obtained through coercion would be inadmissible before a military commission, except against a person accused of coercion. The military judge would have the authority to order trial counsel to disclose to defense counsel the sources, methods, or activities by which witnesses or evidence against the accused was obtained, if he determines that that information might reasonably tend to affect the weight given to the out of court statement by the members of the military commission. The prosecution could withdraw the evidence in lieu of compliance with such an order. If the military judge were to determine that substitute information describing evidence of an exculpatory nature insufficiently protected the accused's opportunity for a fair trial, the judge could dismiss some or all of the charges or specifications or take such other action as he deemed necessary in the interest of justice.", "Habeas corpus would be available to detainees to challenge their detention, but other causes of action would be eliminated. The bills would route appeals of military commissions to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces rather than the Court of Military Commissions Review. They would also eliminate the MCA provision excluding Geneva Conventions as a \"source of rights,\" 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0948b(g), replacing it with a provision stating that military commission rules that are determined to be inconsistent with the Geneva Conventions are to have no effect. The MCA would expressly state that the President's authority to interpret the Geneva Conventions is subject to congressional oversight and judicial review. The bills would provide for expedited challenges to the MCA in the D.C. district court.", "S. 447 , the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 2007, would eliminate the death penalty for crimes triable by military commissions in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950v(b).", "The following tables provide a comparison of the military tribunals under the regulations issued by the Department of Defense, standard procedures for general courts-martial under the Manual for Courts-Martial, and military tribunals as authorized by the Military Commissions Act of 2006.
