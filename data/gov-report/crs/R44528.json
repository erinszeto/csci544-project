The term serves as a useful catch-all when discussing the complex financing structure currently underlying federal funding for child care. The CCDF encompasses several funding streams, including ", "federal discretionary child care funds authorized by the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act, federal mandatory child care funds authorized by Section 418 of the Social Security Act (sometimes referred to as the Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES)), state maintenance-of-effort (MOE) and matching funds associated with the Child Care Entitlement to States, and federal funds transferred to the CCDF from states' Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grants.

Instead, appropriations to the CCDF represent the minimum level of federal investment in child care. The CCDF (through the CCES) also sets minimum expectations regarding state investments in child care.

It briefly describes the legislative evolution of these funding streams, with particular emphasis on the welfare reform law of 1996. This law largely established the current federal landscape, setting up a formal infrastructure for child care programs through the CCDF, while giving states the option to provide additional child care investments with TANF funds. In doing this, the 1996 law set up an interesting dynamic: the federal government determines basic program rules and minimum spending levels for the CCDF, while state governments determine whether TANF funds will be spent on child care and, if so, what basic program rules will apply. Following this discussion, the report presents detailed historical expenditure data across funding streams, as well as data on children served (where possible). The report concludes with some brief observations about what these spending trends may mean for the current child care landscape, with particular consideration given to the substantial nature of TANF contributions to total child care spending, as well as implications of the CCDBG reauthorization law enacted in November 2014.

Spending for that year totaled $14.0 billion in nominal dollars and nearly $15.0 billion in constant dollars. This historical peak was primarily driven by the influx of $2.0 billion in additional discretionary appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). ", "Federal vs. State Share: Federal spending accounted for roughly 70% of all expenditures over this period, with state contributions making up the remaining roughly 30%.

Notably, these TANF-direct dollars are not subject to CCDBG Act rules.", "TANF Contributions: Total federal and state spending on child care originating in TANF programs represented more than one-third (between 36% and 48%) of all child care expenditures for each of FY2000 to FY2012. These totals include TANF transfers, which are subject to CCDBG Act rules and are generally treated as discretionary CCDF expenditures.

The AFDC Child Care and Transitional Child Care programs were both open-ended federal entitlements, while the At-Risk Child Care program was a \"capped entitlement\" to states.

", "The fourth pre-1996 child care program for low-income families was the CCDBG, which was established by the CCDBG Act of 1990 as a component of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( P.L. 101-508 ). The CCDBG was designed to support child care for low-income families who were not connected to the AFDC welfare system. Unlike the AFDC-related programs, the CCDBG was funded with annual discretionary appropriations. States were not required to match the federal funding they received from the discretionary CCDBG.

Like cash welfare, child care was no longer an individual entitlement to welfare families. Instead of the three separate welfare-related child care programs, the new law created a consolidated block grant of mandatory funding under Section 418 of the Social Security Act, the Child Care Entitlement to States. Like the three earlier programs, this new block grant was mostly targeted toward families receiving welfare, transitioning off of welfare, or at risk of receiving welfare (now TANF). However, the law called for these mandatory funds to be combined with discretionary CCDBG allotments at the state level and to be spent according to CCDBG rules.", "The 1996 welfare reform law also reauthorized and amended the CCDBG Act. The law established five CCDBG Act goals, largely focused on flexibility for states in designing child care programs and flexibility for parents in selecting child care. It also modified a number of CCDBG program rules. For instance, the law increased the federal income eligibility threshold from 75% to 85% of state median income. (The law maintained existing eligibility criteria requiring a participating child's parent or parents to be working or attending job training or educational programs, unless the child is receiving or in need of protective services.) ", "Ultimately, the child care provisions in the 1996 law were designed to achieve several purposes. As a component of welfare reform, the child care provisions were intended to support the overall goal of promoting self-sufficiency through work. However, separate from the context of welfare reform, the legislation attempted to address concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of existing child care programs. The four separate child care programs existing at that time (the original CCDBG and the three AFDC programs) had different rules for eligibility, time limits on the receipt of assistance, and work requirements. The child care provisions in welfare reform were intended to create a seamless system, where child care subsidies would \"follow the parent\" as they moved from welfare to work. This was to be achieved by streamlining the federal role, reducing the number of federal programs with conflicting rules, and increasing the flexibility provided to states. The result was to be a single consolidated block grant that would simplify the delivery and administration of child care programs at both the state and federal levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TANF in the Context of Child Care", "paragraphs": ["The 1996 law replaced AFDC with a new welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).

Specifically, states were authorized to", "transfer up to 30% of their TANF block grants to the CCDF, and/or provide child care services directly within state TANF programs.", "When TANF funds are transferred to the CCDF, they are treated as CCDF dollars and must be spent according to CCDF rules. As such, TANF transfers to the CCDF augment the single consolidated child care program that was established by the welfare reform law. ", "By contrast, expenditures on child care within state TANF programs (commonly called \"TANF-direct\" child care) are not subject to CCDF rules. This means, for instance, that TANF-direct funds may be spent on child care services that do not meet minimum health and safety standards or eligibility criteria required by the CCDF. Consequently, states providing TANF-direct child care may have multiple sets of child care program rules, rather than the seamless system ostensibly envisioned by the 1996 welfare reform law.", "Of course, child care is only one of many allowable uses of TANF funds. States may use TANF funds in any manner that is \"reasonably calculated\" to achieve TANF's statutory purpose, which is to increase the flexibility of states in meeting four statutory goals: (1) provide assistance to needy families so that children may remain in their homes; (2) reduce dependency of needy parents on government benefits through work, job preparation, and marriage; (3) reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and (4) promote the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. ", "Over time, states have used TANF funds to support a wide range of benefits and services. For instance, in addition to providing cash assistance and child care services, states use TANF funds for pre-kindergarten programs, child welfare services, and various work support initiatives. Notably, the dollar amount of the basic TANF block grant\u2014and its distribution among the states\u2014has remained flat since the program was first established.

Using this methodology, it appears that TANF transfers have totaled between $1.370 billion and $2.305 billion in nominal dollars in each fiscal year examined in this report. TANF transfers have generally declined over these years, in part because the number of states transferring funds has decreased from 43 in FY2000 to 29 in FY2012.", "In general, there is no expenditure deadline for funds provided to states under the basic TANF block grant.
