The Fund is a financing vehicle, not an implementing agency. The origins of the Fund as an independent entity to fight the three diseases lie partly in a French proposal made in 1998, in ideas developed in the 106th Congress, and in recommendations made by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in April 2001. Though the Global Fund was established in January 2002, President Bush pledged $200 million to such a fund in May 2001.", "As of July 17, 2008, donors have pledged more than $20.2 billion to the Fund, of which more than $10.2 billion has been paid. The fund has approved support for more than 500 grants totaling some $10 billion for projects in 136 countries. Each year, the Fund awards grants through Proposal Rounds. The Fund launched its eighth Round on March 3, 2008. In 2005, the Fund approved Round 5 grants in two tranches, because initially there were insufficient donor pledges to approve all the recommended proposals. The Fund approved the first group of Round 5 proposals in September 2005 and the second in December 2005, after donors pledged to make additional contributions. The Global Fund only approves proposals if it has sufficient resources on hand to support the first two years of a proposed project. This policy is designed to avoid disruptions to projects due to funding shortages. Funding lapses can cause interruptions in treatment regiments, which could lead to treatment-resistant strains of the diseases or death.", "The United States is the largest single contributor to the Global Fund. From FY2001 through FY2008, Congress has made available an estimated $3.6 billion to the Fund, including $840.3 million in FY2008, the single largest U.S. contribution to date. Of those funds, $545.5 million would come from the State Department, and $294.8 million from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The President requested $500 million for a FY2009 contribution to the Global Fund.", "There has been some debate about the level of U.S. contributions to the Fund. Some critics argue that the United States should temper its support to the Fund, because the Fund has not demonstrated strong reporting and monitoring practices; because contributions made to the Fund in excess of the President's request are provided at the expense of U.S. bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs; and because they maintain that the Fund needs to secure support from other sources, particularly the private sector. Supporters of current funding levels counter that the Fund has improved its reporting and monitoring practices, greater U.S. contributions to the Fund parallel increases in U.S. bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, and the Fund has attempted to raise participation of the private sector through the launching of Product Red\u2122.

Nineteen Board seats are rotated among seven donor countries, seven developing countries, and one representative from each of a developed country non-governmental organization (NGO), a developing country NGO, the private sector, a foundation, and affected communities.

Financial delays can cause people to miss treatments, potentially leading to drug-resistance, susceptibility to secondary diseases, or death.", "The Fund distributes grants through a performance-based funding system. Under this system, the Fund commits to financially support the first two years (Phase I) of approved grants, though it disburses the funds quarterly if grants meet their targets. As the end of Phase I approaches, the Fund reviews the progress of the grant to determine if it should support the third through fifth years (Phase II).", "In November 2006, the Board established the Rolling Continuation Channel (RCC). This funding channel, which began in March 2007, permits Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) to request additional funding for grants that are performing well but set to expire. The application process for the RCC is not as rigorous as the Round process. RCC-approved grants can receive support for up to an additional six years, with the funds being awarded in three-year intervals.

After undertaking audits of the grants, the Fund reportedly discovered evidence of \"misuse of funds at several levels and the lack of satisfactory capacity by the Principal Recipient and sub-recipients to manage the Global Fund's resources.\" In August 2007, the Fund announced that it had lifted the suspension, \"after a series of investigation and negotiations between the Global Fund and national authorities ... and after efforts and strong commitment of all relevant stakeholders which guaranteed that the issues have been addressed and better systems with clarified responsibilities will be put in place. As part of the [Global Fund's] mitigation\u2014besides other measures\u2014a fiduciary agent will guarantee for an interim period of 12 months adequate financial monitoring and accounting for our grants.\"", "The Fund might discontinue support for grants in Phase II if it finds that they did not sufficiently meet their targets. Countries whose grants have been discontinued can apply and have secured funding in subsequent Rounds (see Nigeria below). In extreme cases, the Fund will immediately cancel financial support. If funds are immediately revoked, the Fund might invoke its continuity of services policy, which ensures that life-extending treatment is continued for suspended or cancelled grants or for those whose terms have expired until other financial support is identified.

Press accounts quote a Global Fund representative explaining that it had become difficult to measure how the loveLife prevention campaign was contributing to the reduction of HIV/AIDS among young people in South Africa. Additionally, the representative reportedly stated that the Board had repeatedly requested that loveLife revise its proposals and address concerns regarding performance, financial and accounting procedures, and the need for an effective governance structure. A Global Fund spokesman was quoted as saying that \"loveLife is extremely costly, there are programs that have been very effective, which cost a fraction of what loveLife costs. It would be irresponsible of the Global Fund to spend almost $40 million without seeing results.\"", "LoveLife officials were reportedly surprised that the Global Fund ultimately decided to discontinue funding the grant, particularly since there were some reported differences of opinion regarding the matter between the Fund's Technical Review Panel (TRP), Secretariat, and the Board. Additionally, loveLife officials reportedly argued that the decision was politically motivated and influenced by U.S. emphasis on abstinence in HIV prevention efforts. One press account quoted a loveLife official as saying, \"Obviously the strength of conservative ideologies is spilling over into the field of HIV and HIV prevention and it has direct impact on programs like loveLife.\" According to a loveLife press release, the decision to discontinue support for the program will substantially curtail South Africa's efforts to prevent HIV infections among young people, because the Global Fund's grant supported one third of the program's budget.

Development Program (UNDP), the Fund decided to terminate its grant agreements with Burma effective August 18, 2005. The Fund stated that while it was concerned about the extensive humanitarian needs in Burma, travel restrictions imposed by the country's government prevented the Fund from effectively implementing grants. According to the Fund, travel clearance procedures that the Burmese government instituted in July 2005 prevented the PR, implementing partners, and Global Fund staff from accessing grant implementation areas. The Fund indicated that the travel restrictions coupled with new procedures that the government established to review procurement of medical and other supplies \"prevented implementation of performance-based and time-bound programs in the country, breached the government's commitment to provide unencumbered access, and frustrated the ability of the PR to carry out its obligations.\"", "The Global Fund's decision to discontinue those grants in Burma sparked a larger debate about providing humanitarian assistance in countries that are politically unstable or governed by dictatorial regimes. Some were disappointed that the Fund terminated its assistance, citing the significant humanitarian needs in the country.

GAO also indicated that the Fund's documents had not consistently explained why it provided additional funds for grants or why it denied disbursement requests. In October 2006, the Center for Global Development (CGD) Global Fund Working Group reported similar findings and made a number of recommendations, including strengthening the performance based funding system.", "In an effort to strengthen oversight of the Fund's grants, Congress included a provision in Section 525 of P.L. 109-102 , FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations, that required 20% of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund be withheld until the Secretary of State certified to the Appropriations Committees that the Fund had undertaken a number of steps to strengthen oversight and spending practices. The act allows the Secretary to waive the requirement, however, if she determines that a waiver is important to the national interest. At a March 2007 hearing on TB held by the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, Representative Adam Smith expressed his reservations about the Fund's oversight capacity, stating that", "The information and accountability that Congress has come to take for granted through bilateral programs are not available through the Global Fund, and that many of the primary recipients of the Global Fund grants are governments with a history of corruption and fraud and/or limited capacity to properly manage large sums of money in their health sectors. One could argue that the absence in the Global Fund of a robust reporting and monitoring mechanism, at both the primary and sub- recipient levels, is an open invitation for waste in these countries and a tragic loss of opportunity to save lives. The implementation of a system that provides accountability and transparency would seem vital, absolutely necessary, in my view, to continue the expanded donor support of the Global Fund in the future.", "GAO re-evaluated the Fund and released a report in May 2007, which acknowledged that the Fund had improved its documentation of funding decisions, but also determined that the process needed improvement. The report indicated that while each grant that GAO reviewed included an explanation of associated funding decisions, the explanations did not detail what criteria the Fund used to determine whether to disburse funds or renew support, as it had found in 2005.

There is some debate about whether the 33% provision should be interpreted as the amount the United States should provide to the Fund or as the maximum amount the United States can contribute. Supporters of the Fund contend that Congress instituted the 33% mandate in recognition of the moral responsibility that the United States holds as one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Opponents of this idea assert that if U.S. contributions to the Fund were to reflect its share of the global economy, then U.S. contributions would and should range from 20% to 25% of all contributions.", "Some Global Fund advocates who disparage the 33% restriction argue that the differing fiscal cycles of the Fund and the United States complicate efforts to leverage support. Opponents to the 33% restriction contend that the requirement is harmful to the Fund, because the U.S. fiscal year concludes some three months before the Fund's. Critics most often point to FY2004 to substantiate their position. In that fiscal year, nearly $88 million of the U.S. contribution was withheld from the Fund to prevent the funds from exceeding 33%. Advocates of the restriction assert that the 33% cap was intended to suspend portions of U.S. contributions, where necessary. Proponents of the cap note that the Fund was not significantly affected, as the withheld portion was released at the end of the calendar year, when the Fund secured sufficient funds to match the U.S. contribution. Supporters of the provision contend that the Fund benefits from the policy, because it encourages other donors to increase their contributions, as happened in FY2004 ( Table 4 ).", "Debate on the 33% contribution cap has also focused on the limited amount of support that the private sector and others have provided to the Fund ( Table 5 ).
