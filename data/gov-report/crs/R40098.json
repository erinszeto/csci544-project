Water quality problems are diverse, ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ranches, city streets, and other diffuse or \"nonpoint\" sources, to toxic substances discharged from factories and sewage treatment plants.", "There is little agreement among stakeholders about what solutions are needed and whether new legislation is required to address the nation's remaining water pollution problems. For some time, efforts to comprehensively amend the CWA have stalled as interests have debated whether and exactly how to change the law. Congress has instead focused legislative attention on enacting narrow bills to extend or modify selected CWA programs, but not any comprehensive proposals.", "For several years, the most prominent legislative water quality issue has concerned financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects. House and Senate committees have approved bills on several occasions, but, for various reasons, no legislation has been enacted. At issue has been how the federal government will assist states and cities in meeting needs to rebuild, repair, and upgrade wastewater treatment plants, especially in light of capital costs that are projected to be as much as $390 billion. In the 111th Congress, interest in increased investment in public works infrastructure\u2014including wastewater\u2014in order to stimulate the faltering U.S. economy brought greater attention to water infrastructure issues. Acting quickly, in February 2009, Congress passed and the President signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5). Among its provisions, the legislation appropriated $4.0 billion in additional CWA assistance for wastewater projects. In addition, in March 2009, the House passed legislation to reauthorize the CWA's State Revolving Fund (SRF) program to finance wastewater infrastructure and several related provisions of the act (H.R. 1262). A companion bill was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (S. 1005). No legislation was enacted.", "Programs that regulate activities in wetlands also have been of interest, especially CWA Section 404, which has been criticized by landowners for intruding on private land-use decisions and imposing excessive economic burdens. Environmentalists view this regulatory program as essential for maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems, and they are concerned about court rulings that narrowed regulatory protection of wetlands and about related administrative actions. Many stakeholders desire clarification of the act's regulatory jurisdiction, but they differ on what solutions are appropriate. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved a bill that sought to clarify but not expand the CWA's geographic scope (the Clean Water Restoration Act, S. 787). A companion bill was introduced in the House (H.R. 5088). Because some stakeholders believe that the bills would expand federal jurisdiction\u2014not simply clarify it\u2014the bills were controversial, and no legislation was enacted.", "The 111th Congress considered a number of water quality issues through oversight and legislation. Two bills amending the CWA were enacted and are discussed. One dealt with extending a moratorium for CWA permitting of certain vessels (P.L. 111-215), and the other dealt with ensuring that federal agencies and departments pay localities for reasonable costs associated with managing stormwater pollution from federal properties (P.L. 111-378)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Although much progress has been made in achieving the ambitious goals that Congress established more than 35 years ago to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters, long-standing problems persist, and new problems have emerged. Water quality problems are diverse, ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ranches, city streets, and other diffuse or \"nonpoint\" sources, to \"point\" source discharges of metals and organic and inorganic toxic substances from factories and sewage treatment plants.", "The principal law that deals with polluting activity in the nation's streams, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters is the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (P.L. 92-500, enacted in 1972), commonly known as the Clean Water Act, or CWA. It consists of two major parts: regulatory provisions that impose progressively more stringent requirements on industries and cities to abate pollution and meet the statutory goal of zero discharge of pollutants; and provisions that authorize federal financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction. Both parts are supported by research activities, plus permit and enforcement provisions. Programs at the federal level are administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); state and local governments have major day-to-day responsibilities to implement CWA programs through standard-setting, permitting, enforcement, and administering financial assistance programs.", "The water quality restoration objective declared in the 1972 act was accompanied by statutory goals to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters by 1985 and to attain, wherever possible, waters deemed \"fishable and swimmable\" by 1983. Although those goals have not been fully achieved, considerable progress has been made, especially in controlling conventional pollutants (suspended solids, bacteria, and oxygen-consuming materials) discharged by industries and sewage treatment plants.", "Progress has been mixed in controlling discharges of toxic pollutants (heavy metals, inorganic and organic chemicals), which are more numerous and can harm human health and the environment even when present in very small amounts\u2014at the parts-per-billion level. Moreover, efforts to control pollution from diffuse sources, termed nonpoint source pollution (rainfall runoff from urban, suburban, and agricultural areas, for example), are more recent, given the earlier emphasis on \"point source\" pollution (discharges from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants). Overall, data reported by EPA and states indicate that 45% of river and stream miles assessed by states and 47% of assessed lake acres do not meet applicable water quality standards and are impaired for one or more desired uses. In 2006 EPA issued an assessment of streams and small rivers and reported that 67% of U.S. stream miles are in poor or fair condition and that nutrients and streambed sediments have the largest adverse impact on the biological condition of these waters. Approximately 95,000 lakes and 544,000 river miles in the United States are under fish-consumption advisories (including 100% of the Great Lakes and their connecting waters), due to chemical contaminants in lakes, rivers, and coastal waters, and one-third of shellfishing beds are closed or restricted, due to toxic pollutant contamination. Mercury is a contaminant of growing concern\u2014as of 2003, 45 states had issued partial or statewide fish or shellfish consumption advisories because of elevated mercury levels.", "The last major amendments to the law were the Water Quality Act of 1987 ( P.L. 100-4 ). These amendments culminated six years of congressional efforts to extend and revise the act and were the most comprehensive amendments since 1972. Authorizations of appropriations for some programs provided in P.L. 100-4 , such as general grant assistance to states, research, and general EPA support authorized in that law, expired in FY1990 and FY1991. Authorizations for wastewater treatment funding expired in FY1994. None of these programs has lapsed, however, as Congress has continued to appropriate funds to implement them. EPA, states, industry, and other citizens continue to implement the 1987 legislation, including meeting the numerous requirements and deadlines in it.", "The Clean Water Act has been viewed as one of the most successful environmental laws in terms of achieving its statutory goals, which have been widely supported by the public, but lately some have questioned whether additional actions to achieve further benefits are worth the costs. Criticism has come from industry, which has been the long-standing focus of the act's regulatory programs and often opposes imposition of new stringent and costly requirements. Criticism also has come from developers and property rights groups who contend that federal regulations (particularly the act's wetlands permit program) are a costly intrusion on private land-use decisions. States and cities have traditionally supported water quality programs and federal funding to assist them in carrying out the law, but many have opposed CWA measures that they fear might impose new unfunded mandates. Many environmental groups believe that further fine-tuning is needed to maintain progress achieved to date and to address remaining water quality problems.", "Initially following enactment of amendments in 1987, no major CWA legislative activity occurred. In the 104 th Congress (1995), the House passed a comprehensive reauthorization bill that was opposed by the Clinton Administration and environmental groups; it was not enacted. Since then, no comprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced, but beginning in the 106 th Congress, a number of bills dealing with specific water quality issues in the law have been enacted\u2014especially, legislation to reauthorize several existing CWA programs. Since the 107 th Congress, one of the dominant CWA issues has been water infrastructure financing\u2014that is, extension and modification of provisions of the act authorizing financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects. House and Senate committees have approved bills and the House passed bills in the 110 th and 111 th Congresses, but none has been enacted.", "The remainder of this report discusses CWA issues of particular interest in the 111 th Congress, beginning with discussion of two issues that were prominent\u2014water infrastructure funding, and regulatory protection of wetlands. It then describes several other issues that also received attention. It concludes with a discussion of water quality appropriations and water infrastructure as part of economic stimulus legislation in 2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Issues in the 111th Congress", "paragraphs": ["The year 2007 marked the 35 th anniversary of passage of the Clean Water Act and 20 years since the last major amendments to the law. While, as noted, there has been measurable clean water progress as a result of the act, observers and analysts agree that significant water pollution problems remain. However, there is less agreement about what solutions are needed and whether new legislation is required. Several key water quality issues exist: evaluating actions to implement existing provisions of the law, assessing whether additional steps are necessary to achieve overall goals of the act that have not yet been attained, ensuring that progress made to date is not lost through diminished attention to water quality needs, and defining the appropriate federal role in guiding and paying for clean water infrastructure and other activities. For some time, efforts to comprehensively amend the act have stalled as interests have debated whether and exactly how to change the law. Many issues that might be addressed involve making difficult tradeoffs between impacts on different sectors of the economy, taking action when there is technical or scientific uncertainty, and allocating governmental responsibilities among federal, state, local, and tribal entities for implementing the law.", "These factors partly explain why Congress has recently favored focusing legislative attention on narrow bills to extend or modify selected CWA programs, rather than taking up comprehensive proposals. Other factors also have been at work. These include a general reluctance by most members of Congress to address controversial environmental issues in view of the slim majorities held by political parties in the House and the Senate; and a lack of presidential initiatives on clean water issues (neither the Clinton nor the Bush Administration proposed CWA legislation). In addition, for some time after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress was more focused on security, terrorism, and Iraq war issues than on many other topics, including environmental protection.", "As a result of the 2006 mid-term elections and changed congressional leadership beginning in 2007, many observers expected that the 110 th Congress would pursue oversight of clean water and other environmental programs. Greater interest in environmental issues was apparent, but no comprehensive legislation was enacted. A particular legislative focus was water infrastructure financing legislation, specifically reauthorization of the act's financial aid program (discussed next in this report). Also on the congressional agenda was consideration of the geographic reach of the Clean Water Act over the nation's waters and wetlands, in light of court rulings\u2014including two Supreme Court decisions\u2014that have narrowed the law's regulatory jurisdiction, but in ways that are somewhat unclear.", "The 2008 election encouraged many policymakers and stakeholders to anticipate much greater attention to environmental issues, including clean water, by the 111 th Congress and the Obama Administration. During the 2008 presidential campaign, candidate Obama supported several issues, including preservation of wetlands, Great Lakes restoration legislation, water conservation, regulation of large animal feeding operations, and full funding of clean water infrastructure assistance programs. Funding for water infrastructure projects, discussed next in this report, received early attention in the 111 th Congress in light of interest in utilizing increased investment in public works projects\u2014including wastewater\u2014in order to stimulate the faltering U.S. economy, but the Obama Administration did not present specific legislative proposals concerning water quality. As discussed below, the 111 th Congress considered a number of water quality issues through oversight and legislation. Two bills amending the CWA were enacted and are discussed. One dealt with extending a moratorium for CWA permitting of certain vessels ( P.L. 111-215 ), and the other dealt with ensuring that federal agencies and departments pay localities for reasonable costs associated with managing stormwater pollution from federal properties ( P.L. 111-378 )."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Authorization of Water Infrastructure Funding", "paragraphs": ["Meeting the nation's needs to build, upgrade, rebuild, and repair wastewater infrastructure is a significant element in achieving the Clean Water Act's water quality objectives. The act's program of financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction is a key contributor to that effort. Since 1972 Congress has provided more than $85 billion to assist cities in constructing projects to achieve the act's requirements for secondary treatment of municipal sewage (equivalent to 85% reduction of wastes), or more stringent treatment where required by local water quality conditions. State and local governments have spent more than $25 billion of their own funds for construction, as well. Federal funds can be used only for construction purposes (e.g., new plants or upgrades), but not for operation and maintenance of facilities.", "Still, funding needs remain very high: an additional $298 billion, according to the most recent Needs Survey estimate by EPA and the states, released in June 2010, a 17% increase above the estimate reported four years earlier. This current estimate includes $187.9 billion for wastewater treatment and collection systems ($26.7 billion more than the previous report), which represent more than 60% of all needs; $63.6 billion for combined sewer overflow corrections ($1.4 billion less than the previous estimate); $42.3 billion for stormwater management ($17 billion more than the previous estimate); and $4.4 billion to build systems to distribute recycled water ($700 million less than the previous estimate). ", "EPA reported several reasons for increased total needs for wastewater treatment, which were $23 billion higher than in the previous report: improvements needed to meet more protective water quality standards, rehabilitation of aging infrastructure, and expanding capacity to meet population growth. Needs for stormwater management increased by $17 billion and were mostly due to emerging needs to provide \"green\" infrastructure, according to EPA. The estimates do not explicitly include funding needed to address security issues, or funding possibly needed for treatment works to adapt to climate change impacts.", "In September 2002, EPA released a study called the Gap Analysis that assessed the difference between current spending for wastewater infrastructure and total funding needs (both capital and operation and maintenance). In that report, EPA estimated that, over the next two decades, the United States needs to spend nearly $390 billion to replace existing wastewater infrastructure systems and to build new ones. Funding needs for operation and maintenance (not eligible for Clean Water Act funding) are an additional $148 billion over the next two decades, the agency estimated. According to the Gap Analysis, if there is no increase in investment, there will be about a $6 billion gap between current annual capital expenditures for wastewater treatment ($13 billion annually) and projected spending needs of approximately $19 billion. The study also estimated that, if wastewater spending were to increase by 3% annually (essentially meaning a doubling of rates paid by ratepayers), the gap would shrink by nearly 90% (to about $1 billion annually). At issue has been what the federal role should be in assisting states and cities, especially in view of such high projected funding needs.", "In the 111 th Congress, recognition of significant remaining funding needs for water infrastructure merged with consideration of legislation that would use federal government spending to stimulate recovery of the U.S. economy (see discussion of \"Economic Stimulus\" below, page 25 ).", "Debate over the nature of the nation's efforts regarding wastewater infrastructure was a central and controversial part of the 1987 amendments to the act. The amendments extended through FY1990 the traditional Title II program of grants for sewage treatment project construction, under which the federal share was 55% of project costs. The 1987 law initiated a program of grants to capitalize State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs), which are loan programs, in a new Title VI. States are required to deposit an amount equal to at least 20% of the federal capitalization grant in the Fund established under Title VI. Under the revolving fund concept, monies used for wastewater treatment construction are repaid by loan recipients to the states (repayment was not required for grants under the Title II program), to be recycled for future construction in other communities, thus providing an ongoing source of financing. The expectation in 1987 was that the federal contributions to SRFs would assist in making a transition to full state and local financing by FY1995. Although most states believe that the SRF is working well, early funding and administrative problems and continuing large funding needs have delayed the anticipated shift to full state responsibility, even as loans are being repaid to states. Thus, SRF issues have been prominent on the Clean Water Act reauthorization agenda in recent Congresses.", "SRF monies may be used for specified activities, including making loans for as much as 100% of project costs (at or below market interest rates, including interest-free loans), to buy or refinance cities' debt obligation, or as a source of revenue or security for payment of principal and interest on a state-issued bond. SRF monies also may be used to provide loan guarantees or credit enhancement for localities. Loans made by a state from its SRF are to be used first to assure progress towards the goals of the act and, in particular, on projects to meet the standards and enforceable requirements of the act. After states achieve those requirements of the act, SRF monies also may be used to implement nonpoint pollution management and national estuary programs. Since the SRF program began, states have used $2.6 billion to assist more than 8,650 nonpoint management projects; none has gone to estuary management activities.", "All states have established the mechanisms to administer the new loan programs and have been receiving SRF capitalization funds under Title VI. Many have complained that the SRF program is unduly complicated by federal rules that are intended in part to provide accountability for federal dollars, even though Congress had intended that states were to have greater flexibility. Congressional oversight has examined the progress toward reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities needed to achieve the act's water quality objectives, while newer estimates of future funding needs have drawn increased attention to the role of the SRF program in meeting such needs. Although there has been some criticism of the SRF program, and debate continues over specific concerns, the basic approach is well supported. Congress used the clean water SRF as the model when it established a drinking water SRF in 1996 ( P.L. 104-182 ).", "Although the initial intent was to phase out federal support for this program, Congress has continued to appropriate SRF capitalization grants to the states, providing an average of $1.35 billion annually in recent years. Table 1 summarizes wastewater treatment funding under Title II (traditional grants program) and Title VI (capitalization grants for revolving loan programs) since the 1987 amendments. This table does not include appropriations for congressionally earmarked special project grants in individual cities, which in recent years have represented about 15% of appropriated water infrastructure funds.", "One issue of continuing interest is impacts on small communities. These entities in particular have found it difficult to participate in the SRF loan program, since many are characterized by narrow or weak tax bases, limited or no access to capital markets, lower relative household incomes, and higher per capita needs. They often find it harder to borrow to meet their capital needs and pay relatively high premiums to do so. Meeting the special needs of small towns, through a reestablished grant program, other funding source, or loan program with special rules, has been an issue of interest to Congress.", "Because remaining clean water funding needs are still so large nationally, at issue is whether and how to extend SRF assistance to address those needs, how to allocate SRF funds among the states, and how to prioritize projects and funding. Additionally, there is concern about the adequacy of SRF or other funding specifically for high-cost projects dealing with problems of overflows from municipal combined and separate sewers which can release partially treated or untreated wastewaters that harm public health and the environment. EPA estimates that the cost of projects to control sewer overflows, from combined and separate sanitary sewer systems, and manage stormwater runoff, is nearly $64 billion nationwide\u2014nearly twice the total of SRF capitalization grants appropriated since 1987. And more recently, wastewater utilities have sought assistance to assess operational vulnerabilities and upgrade physical protection of their facilities against possible terrorist attacks that could threaten the water infrastructure system.", "During the Bush Administration, EPA officials took the position that infrastructure funding needs go beyond what the federal government can do on its own, and the President's budget for several years advanced the concept that federal funding would cease after 2011 and that state and local self-financing would occur thereafter. Although saying that federal and state funding can help water utilities meet future needs, EPA's principal water infrastructure initiative during that time was to support other types of responses to help ensure that investment needs are met in an efficient, timely, and equitable manner. In particular, EPA worked with water utilities to promote strategies based on concepts of better management, full-cost pricing, efficient water use, and watershed approaches to protection. EPA also has encouraged consumers to use water-efficient products (e.g., residential bathroom products), with the intent of reducing national water and wastewater infrastructure needs through conservation measures by reducing projected water demand and wastewater flow, thus allowing deferral or downsizing of capital projects. ", "The Obama Administration's EPA likewise supports sustainable practices to reduce the potential gap between funding needs and spending. Building on concepts similar to those supported by the Bush Administration and on a request in the President's FY2010 budget, in October 2010 EPA issued a \"Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Sustainability Policy\" addressing management and pricing of infrastructure funded through SRFs to encourage conservation and provide adequate long-term funding for future capital needs. EPA will work with water utilities to promote planning processes that reflect not only public health and water quality, but also conservation of natural resources and innovative treatment. Further, EPA will work with states to target SRF assistance to projects that focus on system upgrade and replacement in existing communities, reflect full life cycle costs of infrastructure assets, and conserve natural resources or use alternative approaches."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Responses", "paragraphs": ["Congress has considered water infrastructure funding issues several times since the 107 th Congress.

Davis-Bacon requires, among other things, that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to workers employed, under contract, on federal construction work \"to which the United States or the District of Columbia is a party.\" Critics of Davis-Bacon say that it unnecessarily increases public construction costs and hampers competition, while supporters say that it helps stabilize the local construction industry by preventing competition that would undercut local wages and working conditions. Under the original SRF program authorization enacted in 1987, the Davis-Bacon Act applied to so-called \"first use\" monies provided by a state from its SRF (that is, loans made from initial federal capitalization grants, but not to subsequent monies provided from repayments to the SRF).

Often the excess flow that contains raw sewage, industrial wastes, and stormwater is discharged untreated. Many combined sewer systems are found in coastal areas where recreational areas, fish habitat and shellfish beds may be contaminated by the discharges. To manage CSOs, cities are subject to a policy issued by EPA in 1994 that requires implementation of nine minimum controls that generally are based on combinations of management techniques (such as temporary retention of excess flow during storm events) and structural measures (such as construction of separate storm sewer systems).", "One issue that concerns some cities is the problem of overflows from municipal separate sanitary sewers (SSOs) that are not CSOs because they transport only sanitary wastes. Discharges of untreated sewage from these sewers can occur from manholes, broken pipes and deteriorated infrastructure, and undersized pipes, and can occur in wet or dry weather.

A TMDL is essentially a pollution budget, a quantitative estimate of what it takes to achieve standards, setting the maximum amount of pollution that a waterbody can receive without violating standards.

Supporters of the legislation, which included several state, county, and local government organizations, said that the bill addressed an issue of equity, that is, that the federal government bears a proportional responsibility for addressing pollution originating from its facilities and should participate actively in improving the nation's water quality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Relationship Between CWA and FIFRA", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, federal courts have held that aerial application of a pesticide over and into U.S. waters requires a CWA permit, even when the pesticide use meets other requirements of federal law, including the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). These decisions drew the attention of many pesticide applicators, including public health entities such as mosquito control districts, concerned with how the rulings might affect their need to control pests associated with diseases such as the West Nile virus. In November 2006, EPA finalized a rule seeking to resolve the conflict over the regulatory scope of the CWA and FIFRA related to pesticide use, in light of the recent litigation, by promulgating clarifying circumstances under which a CWA permit is or is not required for activities carried out pursuant to FIFRA. But in January 2009, a federal court rejected EPA's argument that residual and excess pesticides from aerial applications that impact U.S. waters do not require an NPDES permit because they are adequately regulated by FIFRA, and the court vacated the rule. In the 109 th Congress, prior to issuance of the now-vacated rule, legislation intended to affirm that a CWA permit is not required for use of FIFRA-approved pesticides was introduced, but it was not enacted. In June 2009, the federal court granted an EPA request for a two-year delay in the effective date of the court's ruling. During this time, EPA plans to work with states and other affected parties to develop general CWA permits for pesticide applications covered by the ruling. EPA proposed the general permit in June and still expects to finalize the permit by April 9, 2011, as required by the court. Industry groups requested a Supreme Court review of the case, but in February 2010, the Court declined the request. Legislation intended to nullify the 2009 federal court ruling was introduced in the 111 th Congress ( H.R. 6087 / S. 3735 and S. 6273 ), but there was no further action on any of the bills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA's Water Transfer Rule", "paragraphs": ["Clean Water Act permitting issues also were raised in other litigation. In 2004, the Supreme Court held that the transfer of polluted water from one waterbody to another may require a permit, notwithstanding that no new pollutant is added in the process of transfer. The decision raised concerns in agricultural areas where such transfers often occur in supplying irrigation water, presently without a permit. Congress has not held oversight hearings on impacts of the Court's decision, and legislation that might address the ruling has not been introduced. In response to the Court's ruling, in June 2008, EPA promulgated a rule defining categories or types of water transfers that the agency believes do not require NPDES permits. The rule, which supports EPA's long-standing legal interpretation of the CWA, was quickly challenged in federal courts by the Miccosukee Indian Tribe of Florida and environmental advocates. A ruling in that litigation has not been issued. ", "However, in a related case, a federal appeals court ruled that pumping polluted water from canals in the Everglades into Lake Okeechobee without a permit does not violate the CWA. In its ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11 th Circuit (the same court that is hearing the direct challenge to EPA's water transfer rule) cited the rule and said that EPA's regulation is a reasonable, and thus permissible, construction of the language of the statute. Environmental group plaintiffs in the case who oppose the EPA rule petitioned the 11 th Circuit court for an en banc rehearing, and in October 2009 EPA officials told the court that the agency plans to reconsider the water transfer rule because of concerns about the water quality impacts of some water transfers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responding to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill", "paragraphs": ["On April 20, 2010, an explosion and fire occurred on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. This resulted in 11 worker fatalities, a massive oil release, and a national response effort in the Gulf region by the federal and state governments as well as the oil company BP. Since the explosion of the rig, public and private efforts have focused on multiple response efforts to cap the undersea well and capture and contain the oil in order to prevent as much as possible of it from reaching shorelines. Congress has examined the response activities, events that preceded the explosion and spill, and policies that comprise the federal framework for responding to oil spills generally.", "The federal government's oil spill response framework is found in the National Contingency Plan, which contains the government's procedures for responding to oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) was established administratively in 1968, after U.S. policymakers observed the response to a 37-million-gallon oil tanker spill (Torrey Canyon) off the coast of England and saw the need for a coordinated approach to cope with potential spills in U.S. waters. Subsequent laws have broadened the NCP, including the Clean Water Act in 1972; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund, 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) in 1980; and the Oil Pollution Act (OPA, 33 U.S.C. 2701 note) in 1990. Thus, the statutory framework for responding to an oil spill derives principally from two laws: section 311 of the CWA established requirements for oil spill reporting, response, and liability, and established the NCP to coordinate the national response strategy; and OPA establishes liability limits (or caps) for oil spill removal costs and a range of other costs, such as injuries to natural resources. OPA consolidated the existing federal oil spill laws under one program, expanded the existing liability provisions within the CWA, and created new free-standing requirements regarding oil spill prevention and response. A number of other federal laws also are relevant, such as the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which provides a system for regulating offshore oil and gas exploration, leasing, and ultimate development (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 et seq.).", "Multiple committees in Congress considered a large number of bills that were introduced after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. A wide range of issues were addressed, such as increasing existing liability limits for an oil spill (e.g., H.R. 5355 and S. 3305 ), streamlining claims assistance authority (e.g., S. 3375 ), expanding oil spill research programs to help develop cleanup technologies or prevent spills (e.g., H.R. 2693 ). The only bill enacted during the 111 th Congress was a measure to advance monies from the existing Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to pay costs related to oil spill removal ( P.L. 111-191 ).", "Many of the bills would have amended OPA, which is the primary domestic authority in this area, but several addressed CWA provisions, as well. For example, H.R. 5629 , which was approved by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on July 1, 2010, was a comprehensive bill that would among other provisions have raised OPA's liability limits, revised NCP procedures under the CWA to regulate chemical dispersants that may be used to mitigate a spill, and clarified federal agency responsibility under the CWA for oil spill response. (Provisions of H.R. 5629 were included in a broader measure, the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act ( H.R. 3454 ) that the House passed on July 30.) Another bill, H.R. 5608 , would have required the President to revise the NCP to ensure that it incorporates consideration of worst case discharges; Area Contingency Plans, which are specific response plans for individual geographic areas, would similarly have been required to plan for worse case discharges. A third proposal, H.R. 5677 , would have, among its provisions, required EPA to begin water quality monitoring within 48 hours of a spill in order to provide information about impacts on aquatic and other resources. It also would have required the President to update the NCP at least every five years. ", "Another bill, S. 3466 , dealt with penalties and enforcement, but it would not have modified the CWA. It would have amended the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 to add criminal offenses under the CWA to the statutory list of violations for which mandatory restitution of victims is required. It also would have directed the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which develops sentencing guidelines for federal prosecutors, to provide for compensation of victims for criminal violations of the CWA.

Among the options that were under discussion, many favored making accelerated investments in the nation's public infrastructure in order to create jobs while also meeting infrastructure needs. Legislative focus centered on providing supplemental appropriations for a wide range of government programs, including the clean water SRF program.", "Because of the urgency of responding to the economic downturn, emphasis was on providing funds for projects that could move to construction quickly, which are often referred to as \"shovel ready\" or \"ready to go\" projects. To support arguments for generous spending levels in a stimulus bill, interest groups came forward with lists and estimates of \"ready to go\" projects. For example, state and local water agencies reportedly identified from $9 to $20 billion in wastewater treatment projects that are \"ready to go.\" Legislators moved quickly on these issues, because President Obama urged passage of economic stimulus legislation by mid-February 2009.", "On January 28, 2009, the House passed H.R. 1 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, providing supplemental appropriations for a number of existing federal infrastructure and other programs, including $6 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants.

President Obama signed the bill into law on February 17 ( P.L. 111-5 ).", "Clean Water SRF funds provided in the bill were distributed to states according to the existing CWA state-by-state formulation that applies to regular SRF appropriations, but the bill waived the CWA requirement that states provide a 20% match to the federal capitalization grant. Also, the legislation allowed states to provide assistance to communities in the form of negative interest loans, principal forgiveness, grants, or a combination. States were to give preference to activities that can start and finish quickly, with a goal that at least 50% of the funds go to activities that could be initiated within 120 days of enactment. Further, states were to give priority to wastewater projects that could proceed to construction within 12 months of enactment, and EPA was directed to redistribute any SRF capitalization grant funds that were not under contract or construction within that time. The legislation also directed states to use at least 20% of their capitalization grants to fund projects that address green infrastructure, water or energy efficiency improvements, or other environmentally innovative activities.", "The supplemental clean water SRF funds provided by P.L. 111-5 were nearly six times larger than funds appropriated to states in the regular FY2009 appropriations act. Most state and local government officials welcomed the help provided by the stimulus funds in addressing long-standing infrastructure needs, but they noted that significant funding needs will remain even after the stimulus money has been spent.
