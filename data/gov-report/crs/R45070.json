The FCC has stated that it gets more than 200,000 complaints about unwanted telemarketing calls each year. These statistics, as well as complaints to congressional offices, have spurred Congress to hold hearings and introduce legislation on the issue in an effort to protect consumers. Congressional policymakers have proposed a number of changes to existing law and regulations to address the problem of illegal robocalls under the TCA, many of which are intended to defraud.

The trial was considered a success by the Strike Force and the FCC, reducing calls associated with one particular scam by about 90% in the third quarter of 2016.", "In November 2017, the FCC promulgated rules on the creation and use of the DNO Registry.

Technological solutions, including robust call-blocking technology, likely will also be required. The DNO Registry, a technology solution that has been proven to significantly decrease robocalls, is supported by most stakeholders, but concerns remain with legitimate telemarketers who fear it may negatively impact them.

For VoIP services, some of these options may be \"cloud-based,\" meaning they are managed from a remote location rather than on-site. ", "Consumers and businesses with a small number of lines may employ a third-party blocking service. One such example is Nomorobo, a winner of the 2013 Robocall Challenge hosted by the FTC. (See Appendix B for information about the Robocall Challenge.) Nomorobo is a cloud-based solution that uses \"simultaneous ringing,\" which routes incoming calls to a second telephone line managed by Nomorobo. In the Nomorobo solution, this second line would identify and hang up on the illegal robocall before it can ring through to the user. Nomorobo uses a database of known robocallers compiled with the help of the FTC, user reports, and its own \"honeypots.\" If a call gets a match in the Nomorobo database, the call is not allowed to reach the intended recipient. If there is not a match, the call is allowed to go through.

The company developed and deploys patented \"Phoneprinting\" technology that can identify, locate, and authenticate phone devices just from the call audio, thereby detecting fraudulent calls as well as verifying legitimate callers. The service is used globally by banks, insurers, brokerages, and retailers. The company states that its service succeeds in detecting over 80% of fraud\u2014even against first-time callers.", "Third-Party Mobile Phone Applications", "Both consumers and businesses can download software applications (\"apps\"), often free, to their mobile phones to filter out calls from unidentified callers and/or numbers not in the person's contact list. One app is YouMail. While YouMail is primarily used for voicemail transcriptions, it also provides protection against robocalls. The data the company collects through the app is used to calculate the Robocall Index. Another app requires a caller to enter the first two letters of the recipient's last name for the call to go through. Users of Apple's iPhone can download and use the Nomorobo app for a monthly fee.

Table A-1 , Table A-2 , and Table A-3 contain details of the offerings of each type of provider, as reported by Consumer Reports. An October 2016 Consumer Reports examination found that the quality of these services varied greatly among carriers. Overall, this examination found that consumers using internet-based phone services have the best call-blocking options and that most phone companies are not providing strong protection to their traditional landline and wireless customers.", "Call-Blocking Devices", "Businesses and consumers can install devices to stop robocalls. These devices work with traditional and VoIP landlines with Caller ID. There are at least four such devices available. These devices generally use a \"blacklist\" or a \"whitelist.\" The former blocks all calls in the list (all others are allowed), while the latter only allows calls that are on the list (all others are blocked). Some devices use both types of lists. One example of a device that uses both a blacklist and a whitelist is the Digitone Call Block Plus (see Figure A-1 ).

Recent Law Enforcement Actions Against Robocallers", "One of the most enduring and harmful methods used in an attempt to defraud people is the \"IRS Scam.\" It has been perpetrated by numerous entities since about 2013. This scam involves callers who claim to be employees of the IRS, using fake names and bogus identification. The callers may even know details about their targets and they usually use spoofed telephone numbers. Potential victims are told they owe money to the IRS and are threatened with arrest. They are also told that the amount owed must be paid immediately using gift cards or a wire transfer. Potential victims may not even be safe if they do not answer the phone: if the phone isn't answered, the scammers often leave an \"urgent\" message demanding a return call. Some scammers have even used video relay services to try to scam deaf and hard of hearing individuals. In another variation of the scam, recent immigrants with limited knowledge of English are approached in their native language. In these cases, victims are threatened with deportation. Phone scams of this kind have been on the IRS's \"Dirty Dozen\" list of scams since 2014. The IRS believes that the scam is responsible for over $54 million in losses to victims.", "Appendix C.

There were two winners: Aaron Foss for Nomorobo and Serdar Danis for \"Robocall Filtering System and Device with Autonomous Blacklisting, Whitelisting, Graylisting and Caller ID Spoof Detection.\"", "Both winning entries work by intercepting and filtering out robocalls using technology to blacklist robocaller phone numbers and whitelist numbers associated with acceptable incoming calls. Both proposals also filter out unapproved robocallers by employing a CAPTCHA-style test to prevent illegal calls from ringing through to a user.

In this challenge, security experts were asked to build tools that investigators could use to track and minimize illegal robocalls. The challenge had three phases:", "The Creator Phase challenged contestants to build a honeypot that identifies inaccurate information in incoming calls, such as spoofed caller IDs, or determines which calls are likely robocalls. The winning entry used a combination of an audio CAPTCHA filter, call detail analysis, and recording and transcription analysis to determine the likelihood that an incoming call was a robocall. The Attacker Phase challenged contestants to circumvent an existing honeypot and prevent it from collecting information on incoming calls. The winning entry, \"Droid Rachel,\" circumvented the honeypot by employing a four-step targeting process that screened out phone numbers potentially connected to a honeypot, and optimized Droid Rachel's ability to send robocalls using unsuspecting consumers' Android phones. The Detective Phase challenged contestants to analyze call data from an existing honeypot and develop algorithms to predict which calls were likely robocalls. The winning solution focused on metrics such as the number of calls made, whether the number called was a toll-free number, and the time of the call to identify likely robocalls.", "Robocalls: Humanity Strikes Back", "The third challenge, Robocalls: Humanity Strikes Back, was held in 2015.

In just one week in July 2012, the complaint states, the defendants made more than 1.3 million illegal robocalls to consumers nationwide, 80% of which were to numbers listed on the DNC Registry. From 2014 through 2016, Ramsey continued his unlawful telemarketing through his new company, Prime Marketing. During April and May of 2016, Ramsey and Prime Marketing initiated at least 800,000 calls to numbers in the DNC Registry.

Seven of the nine individual defendants, and corporate defendant Local Lighthouse Corp., agreed to court orders that settled the FTC's charges in January.", "All Us Marketing LLC", "There were numerous defendants in this case, together doing business as All Us Marketing LLC (previously known as Payless Solutions). These individuals were responsible for thousands of calls to consumers nationwide making false claims about bogus debt relief services. After convincing consumers to provide their credit card information, the defendants charged them between $300 and $4,999 up front, but provided nothing in return. In some cases, the defendants used consumers' personal information to apply for new credit cards.
