Concern over these large deficits, as well as the long-term trajectory of the federal budget, resulted in significant debate during the 112th Congress over how to achieve meaningful deficit reduction and how to implement a plan to stabilize the federal debt. Numerous expiring provisions, across-the-board spending cuts, and other short-term considerations having a major budgetary impact, were scheduled to take effect at the very end of 2012 or in early 2013. This combination of policies, estimated by CBO to reduce the deficit by $502 billion between FY2012 and FY2013, was referred to by some as the \"fiscal cliff.\" Had these policies taken effect, CBO projected that the economy would likely have returned to recession in FY2013.", "On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240), which addressed many of these tax and spending policies. As a result of the changes in ATRA which are set to increase spending and decrease revenue, the deficit is projected to rise relative to the current law baseline. The provisions of ATRA were estimated by CBO to increase the budget deficit by $330 billion in FY2013 and nearly $4 trillion over the FY2013-FY2022 period.", "ATRA addressed several revenue provisions that had been set to expire at the end of 2012. These included the \"Bush-era tax cuts,\" provisions related to the estate tax, certain tax provisions enacted or expanded as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and a number of temporary tax provisions (also known as \"tax extenders\"). ATRA permanently extended a modified version of the \"Bush-era tax cuts\" and the estate tax, as well as a permanent AMT patch. The law also temporarily extended the ARRA tax provisions and a variety of \"tax extenders.\" ATRA did not extend the two-percentage-point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax, which expired at the end of 2012, or delay the Affordable Care Act (ACA) taxes on higher-income tax filers, which are scheduled to take effect in 2013. Combined, these provisions were estimated by CBO and JCT to increase the deficit by $280 billion in FY2013 and $3.93 trillion over the FY2013-FY2022 period.", "In addition to these revenue provisions, ATRA also addressed several spending policies that were scheduled to reduce spending beginning in FY2013. It extended the federal share of extended benefit payments for unemployment and postponed the expiration of the authorization for temporary emergency unemployment benefits through 2013. It delayed a reduction in payments to Medicare physicians under the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system through 2013. It eliminated the first two months of the automatic spending cuts enacted as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25), postponing their onset from January 2 to March 1. It extended the 2008 farm bill through 2013. These provisions, some of which were offset, were estimated by CBO to increase the deficit by $48 billion in FY2013 and $34 billion over the FY2013-FY2022 period.", "Despite the enactment of ATRA, many policy issues affecting the federal budget remain unresolved. Specifically, in early 2013, Congress will likely consider a debt limit increase, additional actions related to the postponed BCA automatic spending reductions, and appropriations for the final six months of FY2013.

Therefore, how government operations will be funded after that date needs to be determined. In addition, under current fiscal policy, an increase to the debt limit would be required in early 2013 to meet existing obligations.

Second, taxpayers subtract a basic exemption amount from their AMT tax base. Third, a two-tiered rate structure of 26% and 28% is assessed against the AMT tax base to determine tax liability.

However, nearly half of those revenues are to be derived from taxes on high-income taxpayers that will be effective in 2013. These include a Medicare payroll tax and a tax on unearned income. According to CBO, these two taxes are projected to raise $18 billion in revenue in 2013.", "Under current law, employers and employees each pay a payroll tax of 1.45% to finance Medicare Hospital Insurance (Part A). ACA includes additional hospital insurance taxes on high-income taxpayers. Specifically, ACA imposes an additional payroll tax of 0.9% on high-income workers with wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers effective for taxable years after December 31, 2012. The additional payroll tax only applies to wages above these thresholds. Thus, the hospital insurance portion of the payroll tax will increase from 1.45% to 2.35% for wage income over the threshold amounts. These revenues will be credited to the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Part A). ", "ACA as amended also imposes an additional tax on net investment income.

Current fiscal policy would require an increase to the debt limit in early 2013 to meet existing obligations. Treasury Secretary Geithner indicated in a December 26, 2012 letter to Congress that the current debt limit would be reached on December 31, 2012. After that time, certain extraordinary measures can be taken which would be able to extend headroom under the debt limit by for roughly two additional months. Negotiations on this issue in 2011 led to the passage of the BCA, which included a debt limit increase and deficit reduction provisions shortly before the limit was reached. Some in Congress have expressed a desire to see a similar agreement accompanying the next debt limit increase. The debt subject to limit will generally continue to rise as long as the budget remains in deficit or trust funds remain in surplus. Further, seasonal fluctuations could still require Treasury to sell debt even if the annual level of federal debt subject to limit does not increase.

However, making significant changes to reduce the deficit at this time may be harmful to the ongoing economic recovery. Some economists believe that the uncertainty surrounding the \"fiscal cliff\" was holding back the recovery as individuals, businesses, and state and local governments did not know what they would be facing in January 2013, leading some to reduce or delay purchases of goods and services.

CBO recently projected that the economy will not return to full employment until FY2018. Though ATRA is likely to increase economic growth in the short-run relative to what growth would have been if the policies of the \"fiscal cliff\" had taken effect, ongoing large budget deficits could dampen economic growth over the long-run.", "Many policy issues affecting the federal budget over the next decade and beyond remain unresolved. Increases in mandatory spending due to rising healthcare costs and the aging of the population are expected to begin taking effect towards the end of the decade. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP, or approximately at its historical average, and leaving fiscal policies unchanged, according to CBO projections, would require drastic reductions in all spending other than that for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, reining in the costs of these programs, or some combination of the two. Putting the budget on a sustainable path would require less spending, increases in revenue collections, faster-than-average economic growth, or a combination of these things. Increasing levels of debt require interest payments that can strain budgets if debt levels and interest rates are high. High debt levels could limit the government's flexibility in meeting its obligations or in responding to emerging needs of its citizens. "], "subsections": []}]}}
