The Delta provides water to more than 25 million people and habitat for various species, including the threatened delta smelt and endangered chinook salmon.

In order to provide water to the various users, two major water projects were created: the federal Central Valley Project and the State Water Project. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of the regulation of these projects and the Delta waters generally, both to meet the needs of water users and to avoid environmental impacts to water quality and species. Specifically, in late 2007, a federal judge ordered a reduction in the amount of water pumped out of the Delta in order to preserve the habitat of endangered fish in the Delta, meaning less water would be available for areas that depend on the water projects for their water supply. In 2008, those restrictions were continued under a newly issued biological opinion, and another judicial decision was issued that indicates similar restrictions may be required for other species. Furthermore, Governor Schwarzenegger declared a state of drought for the entire State of California in June 2008 and declared a state of emergency in California due to drought in February 2009. These events pose significant impacts on California's water supply. As a matter of overseeing the impacts of water flow and water management in the Delta, the House Natural Resources Committee held a subcommittee hearing on the effect conditions in the Delta have on the endangered species there in 2008.", "This report provides a summary of California's dual system of water rights, which includes riparian and prior appropriation doctrines, and regulation of those rights by the state. In particular, the report discusses considerations used in the process of regulating water usage, including the public trust doctrine, the rule of beneficial use, and the no injury rule.

Numerous categories of stakeholders have an interest in water flowing through the Delta, including agricultural, urban, industrial, environmental, and recreational interests. In 2007, a federal court ordered flow restrictions on the Delta water projects to prevent the negative effect water diversions were having on species in the Delta ecosystem until the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service completed consultations and issued a new biological opinion in late 2008. This decision required federal and state entities to reduce pumping water in two large water projects and therefore has had significant effects on the water supply of California.

Under the riparian doctrine, a person who owns land that borders a watercourse has the right to make reasonable use of the water on that land. Under the prior appropriation doctrine, a person who diverts water from a watercourse (regardless of his location relative thereto) and makes reasonable and beneficial use of the water acquires a right to that use of the water.

With regard to appropriative rights, the person's right that was appropriated first is considered superior to later appropriators' rights to the water.

As discussed above, certain federal actions have led to decreased flows in the rivers of the Delta. For example, in the early 1990s, Endangered Species Act consultations regarding the newly threatened winter-run chinook salmon and delta smelt resulted in Reclamation pursuing alternative management of the CVP to avoid jeopardy to the species. At the same time, Congress enacted the Central Valley Project Improvement Act which amended the project's authorization to include consideration of fish and wildlife preservation and allocated 800,000 acre-feet of water for fish and wildlife purposes (sometimes referred to as \"b2 water\"). These events resulted in allocations being reduced by up to half in some years for some water contractors, which a federal court held was fair under the terms of the contract. Additionally, the question of how to account for the b2 water has been a recurring issue in litigation.", "In other cases, courts have addressed reductions due to environmental conditions. One federal district court held that Reclamation did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it reduced the amount of water released in response to a drought. When Trinity County sued Reclamation in the late 1970s, it claimed that operation of the Trinity River Division of the CVP in response to drought conditions was in violation of federal Reclamation law, specifically that the reduced flows would not adequately preserve fish and wildlife. Noting that the decision to reduce flows could be overturned only if it was found to be arbitrary and capricious, the court held that Reclamation appeared to consider the relevant factors and made a decision that seemed reasonable given the context of the situation. Reclamation law required the Secretary of the Interior to adopt \"'appropriate measures' for fish conservation,\" and the measures that had been adopted were appropriate in light of drought conditions, according to the court. The statutory provision requiring consideration of measures for the preservation of wildlife could not be interpreted \"in isolation from the management practices of the CVP as a whole.\"", "In 2007, the federal district court for the Eastern District of California addressed the issue of threatened species in the Delta by issuing an interim order that required specified water flows for management of the Delta's resources to protect the delta smelt. That order (often referred to as the 2007 Wanger decision) placed limits on the amount of water that could be pumped out of the Delta, and thus would affect water users downstream. The restrictions imposed by the interim order remained in place until the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) completed new consultations in light of the decision and issued a new biological opinion. The new biological opinion issued in December 2008 effectively applies the same restrictions ordered by the court. In 2008, the same district court addressed the issue of another species in the Delta. In that case, which is ongoing, the court has indicated that restrictive measures may be imposed to protect another species in the Delta, but the court has not yet issued an order regarding what remedy might be appropriate.", "In times of water reductions, the Exchange Contractors are put in a unique situation. This is because their contracts differ from the general CVP contracts. As discussed above, because the Exchange Contractors had rights predating the CVP, their contracts provide a guarantee that they receive the entire share from Reclamation or that they could exercise their reserved rights to acquire that share.

The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1937 that reauthorized the CVP typically regulates navigation and flood control. As discussed above, application of federal legislation has led to federal action in recent decades to protect environmental interests in the Delta. Congress may take a role in the current situation to redirect Reclamation's authority in CVP operations or management.
