The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, addressed each of these concerns. Through amendments to both the patent law and the food and drug law, the Hatch-Waxman Act established several practices intended to facilitate the marketing of generic pharmaceuticals while providing brand-name firms with incentives to innovate.", "The Hatch-Waxman Act established an expedited pathway for generic drug companies to obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for their products. It also created a statutory \"safe harbor\" that shields generic applicants from charges of patent infringement until such time as they request approval to market their products from the FDA.", "The legislation also encourages brand-name firms to identify to the FDA any patents that cover their products. If they do so, the patents are listed in the \"Orange Book\"\u2014a publication that identifies approved drugs and the intellectual property rights associated with them. When a generic firm seeks marketing approval from the FDA, it must account for any Orange Book-listed patents\u2014typically by delaying marketing of its products until they expire, or by asserting that the patents are invalid or do not cover the generic's proposed product. This latter assertion exposes the generic drug company to charges of patent infringement by the brand-name firm.", "The Hatch-Waxman Act also created periods of \"regulatory exclusivity\" that protect an approved drug from competing applications for marketing approval under specified conditions. These FDA-administered regulatory exclusivities typically operate alongside patents to block generic competition for a period of time. Generic firms may sell their own versions of brand-name drugs once these intellectual property rights expire.", "Several issues relating to the Hatch-Waxman Act remain of interest to Congress. One of them pertains to the legitimacy of \"authorized generics,\" pharmaceuticals that are marketed by or on behalf of a brand-named drug company, but are sold under a generic name. Although authorized generics may be pro-consumer in that they potentially increase competition and lower prices, some observers argue that such products may discourage independent generic firms both from challenging drug patents and from selling their own generic products.", "In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Act requires generic drug companies to prove that their proposed products are bioequivalent to the brand-name drug. Bioequivalence testing therefore requires that the generic firm use the brand-name product as a basis for comparison. Some generic firms have expressed concerns, however, that certain brand-name firms have refused to sell them samples of their drugs for use in developing competing products.", "Cases litigated under the auspices of the Hatch-Waxman Act have often ended with a settlement between the parties. In some of these cases, a generic firm agrees to neither challenge the brand-name company's patents nor sell a generic version of the patented drug for a period of time. In exchange, the brand-name drug company agrees to compensate the generic firm, often with substantial monetary payments over a number of years. Because the payment flows counterintuitively, from the patent owner to the accused infringer, this compensation has been termed a \"reverse\" payment. While some observers believe that this outcome results from the structure of the Hatch-Waxman Act, others believe that these settlements are anti-competitive and harmful to consumers."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress continues to focus attention upon both medical innovation and the growing cost of health care.

The nonobviousness requirement is met if the invention is beyond the ordinary abilities of a skilled artisan knowledgeable in the appropriate field.", "In order to be awarded a patent, an inventor must file a patent application with the USPTO.

A showing that a new drug is sufficiently safe and effective to allow it to be marketed ordinarily requires manufacturers to conduct clinical investigations of drugs. Such investigations generally occur over several stages, commencing with preclinical evaluation. The testing process begins in the company's laboratory, where scientists perform preliminary tests to determine whether the drug has any effect on a disease or its symptoms. ", "For those compounds that merit further consideration following preclinical evaluation, the next step is the filing of an Investigational New Drug application (IND), at the FDA. The FDA evaluates the pre-clinical data and the proposed clinical trial design to determine whether to allow the IND and testing in humans. Clinical trials are ordinarily carried out in three phases that gather further evidence of the drug's safety and effectiveness.", "Once a new drug's clinical testing is complete, the sponsor prepares a New Drug Application (NDA) and submits it to the FDA for evaluation. An NDA includes the clinical trial results along with a description of the drug's manufacturing process and facilities. The agency considers three broad questions when reviewing an NDA:", "Whether the drug is safe and effective in its proposed use(s), and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Whether the drug's proposed labeling (package insert) is appropriate, and what it should contain. Whether the methods used in manufacturing the drug and the controls used to maintain the drug's quality are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity.", "As the agency has explained, an NDA \"is supposed to tell the drug's whole story, including what happened during the clinical tests, what the ingredients of the drug are, the results of the animal studies, how the drug behaves in the body, and how it is manufactured, processed and packaged.\" FDA approval of an NDA allows the drug to be marketed to the public.

Bolar Litigation", "paragraphs": ["The award of marketing approval by the FDA and the grant of a patent by the USPTO are formally distinct events that depend upon different criteria. For example, the USPTO could issue a patent on a drug that the FDA ultimately decides not to approve for marketing due to deleterious side effects. As well, the FDA could grant marketing approval to a safe and effective drug that was already described in the published literature and therefore not patentable. However, because brand-name firms ordinarily seek both marketing approval and patent protection, the practical relationship between these procedures was the subject of policy debate for many years. ", "Many observers believe that the 1984 judicial decision in Roche Products, Inc. v. Bolar Pharmaceutical Co . hastened the pace of discussion in Congress. As noted previously, patent proprietors possess the right to exclude others from practicing the patented invention. Accused infringers may offer several defenses to avoid liability for patent infringement. ", "One potential patent infringement defense consists of the so-called experimental use privilege. One nineteenth century court explained that it was \"well-settled that an experiment with a patented article for the sole purpose of gratifying a philosophical taste, or curiosity, or for mere amusement is not an infringement of the rights of the patentee.\" Most patent attorneys observe that few infringers have successfully pled an experimental use defense, however. As a practical matter, infringement charges are only rarely brought against philosophers or amusement seekers.", "The venerable experimental use defense suggested an interesting possibility with the advent of marketing approval procedures before the FDA. When a competitor grew interested in marketing the generic equivalent of a drug patented by another, it might have wished to commence clinical trials and other procedures needed to obtain commercial marketing approval during the term of the other's patent. This procedure would allow the generic firm to market the drug as soon as possible\u2014and ideally upon the date the patent expired. Whether the regulatory compliance activities of a generic drug manufacturer amounted to patent infringement or were exempted by the experimental use defense was an open legal question for many years.", "The 1984 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Roche v. Bolar resolved this question conclusively in favor of a finding of patent infringement. In that case, Roche Products, Inc. (Roche) marketed a prescription sleeping pill and owned a patent covering its active ingredient. During the term of Roche's patent, Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. (Bolar) began using the active ingredient to obtain data needed to file an NDA with the FDA.", "When Roche brought a patent infringement suit, the federal courts agreed that Bolar should be enjoined from using the active ingredient until Roche's patent expired. The courts explained that:", "Bolar's intended \"experimental\" use is solely for business reasons and not for amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for strictly philosophical inquiry. Bolar's intended use ... to derive FDA required test data is thus an infringement of the [Roche] patent. Bolar may intend to perform \"experiments,\" but unlicensed experiments conducted with a view to the adaptation of the patented invention to the experimentor's business is a violation of the rights of the patentee to exclude others from using his patented invention. It is obvious here that it is a misnomer to call the intended use de minimis . It is no trifle in its economic effect on the parties even if the quantity used is small. It is no dilettante affair.... We cannot construe the experimental use rule so broadly as to allow a violation of the patent laws in the guise of \"scientific inquiry,\" when that inquiry has definite, cognizable, and not insubstantial commercial purposes.", "The ruling in Roche v. Bolar , in combination with the requirement of marketing approval for new drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, was perceived as leading to two distortions of the statutory patent term. First, patent term would continue to run whether or not the FDA had approved the claimed pharmaceutical for marketing. As a result, the period of time that the proprietor of a patent claiming a regulated drug actually could enjoy exclusivity could be quite significantly reduced. In effect, each day of delay associated with the FDA approval process amounted to a lost day of patent term. Second, under Roche v. Bolar , competitors that commenced activities necessary for regulatory approval before a patent had expired could be enjoined as patent infringers. This possibility was seen as a de facto period of exclusivity that the patent proprietor enjoyed beyond the actual term of the patent.

The new law was subsequently codified in Titles 15, 21, 28, and 35 of the U.S. Code.", "The Hatch-Waxman Act includes elaborate provisions governing the mechanisms through which a potential generic manufacturer may obtain marketing approval on a drug that has been patented by another. Although the Hatch-Waxman Act is a complex statute, observers have frequently noted that it presents a fundamental trade-off: In exchange for permitting manufacturers of generic drugs to gain FDA marketing approval by relying on safety and efficacy data from the brand-name firm's NDA, the brand-name firms receive a period of regulatory exclusivity and patent term extension.

The result was that a would-be generic drug manufacturer had to file its own NDA in order to market its drug. Some generic manufacturers could rely on published scientific literature demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug. Because these sorts of studies were not available for all drugs, however, not all generic firms could file these so-called paper NDAs. Further, at times the FDA requested additional studies to address safety and efficacy questions that arose from experience with the drug following its initial approval. The result is that some generic manufacturers were forced to prove independently that the drugs were safe and effective, even though their products were chemically identical to previously approved drugs.", "Some commentators believed that the approval of a generic drug was a needlessly costly, duplicative, and time-consuming process prior to the Hatch-Waxman Act. These observers noted that although patents on important drugs had expired, manufacturers were not moving to introduce generic equivalents for these products due to the level of resource expenditure required to obtain FDA marketing approval. As the introduction of generic equivalents often causes prices to decrease, the interest of consumers was arguably not being served through these observed costs and delays.", "The Hatch-Waxman Act created a new type of application for market approval of a pharmaceutical. This application, termed an \"Abbreviated New Drug Application\" (ANDA), may be filed at the FDA. An ANDA may be filed if the active ingredient of the generic drug is the bioequivalent of the approved drug. An ANDA allows a generic drug manufacturer to rely upon the safety and efficacy data developed by the original manufacturer. The Hatch-Waxman Act also continued the FDA's earlier \"paper NDA\" practice by establishing what has come to be known as a Section 505(b)(2) application. Such an application relies, at least in part, upon safety and efficacy data that the applicant did not itself develop, but rather is available in the published literature.", "ANDAs and Section 505(b)(2) applications may allow a generic manufacturer to avoid the costs and delays associated with filing a full-fledged NDA.

The FDA considers those drugs with an \"A\" code to be therapeutically equivalent, while those with a \"B\" code have a documented bioequivalence problem. The Orange Book provides physicians, pharmacists, and patients with information to help them decide when therapeutically equivalent generic drugs can be substituted for brand-name products.", "The Orange Book also plays a role in the resolution of patent disputes. The Hatch-Waxman Act requires each holder of an approved NDA to list pertinent patents it believes would be infringed if a generic drug were marketed before the expiration of these patents. Would-be manufacturers of generic drugs must then engage in a specialized certification procedure with respect to Orange Book-listed patents. An ANDA applicant must state its views with respect to each Orange Book-listed patent associated with the drug it seeks to market.", "In particular, the generic applicant must either file a so-called section viii statement or a patent certification.

Two years earlier, Congress had approved the Orphan Drug Act in order to encourage firms to develop pharmaceuticals to treat rare medical conditions. Such drugs are called \"orphan\" drugs because firms may lack the financial incentives to \"adopt,\" or sponsor, products to treat small patient populations. The Orphan Drug Act established a seven-year term of market exclusivity for drugs determined to treat rare disease and conditions. Orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another marketing approval application for the same drug and same orphan indication.", "Expanding upon this concept, the Hatch-Waxman Act established a five-year exclusivity that is available to drugs that qualify as a new chemical entity (NCE). A drug is judged to be an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved that drug's active ingredient. During that five-year period of NCE exclusivity, the FDA may accept neither a Section 505(b)(2) application nor an ANDA for a drug product containing the same active moiety protected under the NCE exclusivity.

New clinical study exclusivity may be awarded with respect to either an NDA or a supplemental NDA that contains reports of new clinical studies conducted by the sponsor that are essential to FDA approval of that application. In contrast to NCE exclusivity, new clinical study exclusivity applies only to the use of the product that was supported by the new clinical study.

Some sources refer to authorized generics as \"branded,\" \"flanking,\" or \"pseudo\" generics.", "Authorized generics may be pro-consumer in that they potentially increase competition and lower prices, particularly in the short-term. They have nonetheless proven controversial. Authorized generics ordinarily enter the market at about the time the brand-name drug company's patents are set to expire. Some observers argue that such products may decrease the value of the potential 180-day market exclusivity for the first approved generic. This in turn may discourage independent generic firms both from challenging drug patents and from selling their own generic products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competitor Access to Medications", "paragraphs": ["The Hatch-Waxman Act requires generic drug companies to prove that their proposed products are bioequivalent to the brand-name drug. Bioequivalence testing therefore requires that the generic firm use the brand-name product as a basis for comparison. Some generic firms have expressed concerns, however, that certain brand-name firms have refused to sell them samples of their drugs for use in developing competing products. ", "The Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act of 2016, S. 3056 , addresses access to reference product samples when a brand-name product is subject to limited distribution channels\u2014either voluntarily or via FDA-imposed \"Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS)\" procedures. The bill would allow a generic or biosimilar firm to commence litigation in federal court in order to obtain a sample of a drug or biologic that is subject to a restricted distribution scheme so that it may obtain FDA approval of its competing product."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parallel Importation", "paragraphs": ["At least six bills have been introduced in the 114 th Congress that would allow individuals to import lower-cost prescription drugs from foreign jurisdictions.

H.R. 2623 , the Personal Drug Importation Fairness Act, would allow U.S.-approved drugs to be imported from Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, South Africa, a member state of the European Union, or a country in the European Economic Area, as well as any other country determined by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to have safety and efficacy standards at least as protective as the United States.

In the 114 th Congress, the Curb Opioid Misuse By Advancing Technology (COMBAT) Act of 2016, H.R. 5127 , would extend the three-year new clinical study exclusivity by 12 months if the new study was related to clinical abuse potential and the product's labeling characterized the drug's abuse-deterrent potential. The COMBAT Act would similarly extend the 180-day generic exclusivity by 60 days in such circumstances. On the other hand, the period of biologics exclusivity would be reduced from 12 to 7 years by the Price Relief, Innovation, and Competition for Essential Drugs (PRICED) Act, introduced as both H.R. 5573 and S. 3094 . ", "Over the past 35 years, FDA-administered regulatory exclusivities have been growing in numbers, scope, complexity, and duration. The long history of congressional lawmaking has given rise to three types of patents: utility patents in 1790, design patents in 1842, and plant patents in 1930. In contrast, since 1982 Congress has established 15 sorts of regulatory exclusivity. ", "Encouraging innovation through regulatory exclusivities, rather than through the patent system, arguably possesses certain advantages. The large number of industries affected by patents may make patent reform politically difficult. Fine tuning drug regulation rules may be more feasible. In addition, U.S. membership in the World Trade Organization requires that \"patents shall be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the ... field of technology....\" This requirement of technological neutrality appears to prevent discrimination both against and in favor of drug patents. On the other hand, increasing reliance upon regulatory exclusivities may require greater legislative oversight and hold less regard for the public domain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reverse Payment Settlements", "paragraphs": ["Cases litigated under the auspices of the Hatch-Waxman Act have often ended with a settlement between the parties. In some of these cases, a generic firm agrees to neither challenge the brand-name company's patents nor sell a generic version of the patented drug for a period of time. In exchange, the brand-name drug company agrees to compensate the generic firm, often with substantial monetary payments over a number of years. Because the payment flows counterintuitively, from the patent owner to the accused infringer, this compensation has been termed a \"reverse\" payment.", "For over two decades, a number of courts of appeal have been called upon to analyze the antitrust implications of patent settlements between brand-name and generic firms within the shadow of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Facing somewhat different case specifics, the courts developed varying approaches to the issue. These distinctions were laid to rest by the 2013 Supreme Court opinion in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc . The watershed Actavis decision ushered in a new era for antitrust review of reverse payment settlements. There, the Court held that the legality of reverse payment settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach. However, the Court declined to hold that such settlements should be presumptively illegal under a \"quick look\" analysis. The Actavis opinion resolves a long-standing circuit split regarding the approach that should be taken toward settlement of pharmaceutical patent cases under the antitrust laws. The lower courts have now been left with the potentially complex task of applying the rule of reason to reverse payment settlements going forward.", "In the 114 th Congress, a number of bills deal with reverse payment settlements. The Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 131 , would make a number of changes to the Hatch-Waxman Act in order to discourage reverse payments settlements. In particular, S. 131 would grant any generic firm the right to share the 180-day regulatory exclusivity if it wins a patent challenge in the district court or is not sued for patent infringement by the brand company. The legislation would also oblige generic firms to abide by any deferred entry date agreed to in their settlements with brand-name firms, even if relevant patents were struck down previously. Finally, brand-name firms would be required to make a decision to enforce their patents within 45 days of being notified of a patent challenge by a generic firm under the Hatch-Waxman Act.", "Another bill, S. 2019 , the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, would declare that certain reverse payment settlements constitute acts of unfair competition. In particular, that bill would amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to provide that an agreement \"shall be presumed to have anticompetitive effects and be unlawful if\u2014(i) an ANDA filer receives anything of value; and (ii) the ANDA filer agrees to limit or forego research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the ANDA product for any period of time.\" Certain exceptions apply\u2014for example, the payment of reasonable litigation expenses not exceeding $7.5 million would not be unlawful. That \"quick look\" presumption would not apply if the parties to the agreement demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the procompetitive benefits of the agreement outweigh the anticompetitive effects of the agreement. S. 2019 includes a list of factors to be weighed by the courts in such circumstances.", "A third bill, S. 2023 , the Prescription Drug Affordability Act of 2015, would act similarly to S. 2019 . It would also create a presumption that reverse payment settlements violate the Federal Trade Commission Act, subject to certain exceptions. However, unlike S. 2019 , the parties to the agreement would not be able to overcome this presumption by showing that its procompetitive benefits outweigh the anticompetitive harms."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
