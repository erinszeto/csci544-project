Others, however, asserted that DACA involves a valid exercise of the executive's prosecutorial or enforcement discretion, is consistent with the INA, and has ample historical precedent.

Previously, delays in processing applications for immigrant visas resulted in some visas going unused (less than 5% of all available immigrant visas in recent years). This, in turn, prompted calls for Congress or the executive to \"recapture\" unused visas (i.e., to identify unused visa numbers from earlier years and make them available for current use). The Obama Administration's November 20, 2014, action does not purport to recapture previously unused visas. However, it can be seen as an attempt to avoid the perceived need for visa recapture in the future by ensuring that all immigrant visas available for issuance in a year are used. Relatedly, the Administration proposes as-yet-unspecified steps to \"improve the system for determining when immigrant visas are available to applicants during the fiscal year,\" as well as consideration of \"other regulatory or policy changes\" to \"better assist and provide stability\" to be beneficiaries of employment-based immigrant visa petitions, including by ensuring that visa petitions remain valid when the alien beneficiary of the petition seeks to change employers or jobs.", "Another action involves expanding the duration of any \"optional practical training\" (OPT) engaged in by foreign nationals studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at institutions of higher education in the United States on non-immigrant F-1 student visas, as well as \"expand[ing] the degree programs\" eligible for OPT.

Regulations promulgated in 2008 permitted students in STEM fields to request an additional 17 months of OPT, for a total of 29 months of OPT. However, only students in STEM fields are eligible for this 17 month extension, and these students can participate in OPT for no more than 29 months. Because any expansion of OPT can be seen, at least by some, as affecting employment opportunities for U.S. persons, the Administration also proposes to \"improve\" the OPT program by requiring \"stronger ties\" to degree-granting institutions, and \"tak[ing] steps\" to ensure that OPT employment is consistent with U.S. labor market protections.", "Other actions announced by the Obama Administration include", "making greater use of provisions in INA \u00c2\u00a7203(b)(2)(B), which permit aliens with advanced degrees or \"exceptional ability\" to obtain an immigrant visa without a sponsoring employer\u00e2\u0080\u0094as is generally required for immigrants who are not sponsored by family members\u00e2\u0080\u0094if their admission is in the \"national interest.\" using the authority granted to the Executive in INA \u00c2\u00a7212(d)(5)(A) to \"parole\" aliens into the United States when there is a \"significant public benefit\" to permit some inventors, researchers, and founders of start-up enterprises to enter and lawfully remain in the United States without a visa (or counting against the visa caps). clarifying and standardizing the meaning of \"specialized knowledge\" for purposes of the L-1B visa program, which allows companies to transfer certain employees who are executives or managers, or have \"specialized knowledge\" of the company or its processes, to the United States from the company's foreign operations. clarifying what is meant by the \"same or similar job\" for purposes of INA \u00c2\u00a7204(j), which provides that employment-based immigrant visa petitions remain valid when the alien employee changes jobs or employers so long as the new job is in the \"same or similar occupational classification\" as the job for which the petition was filed. reviewing the so-called PERM program, whereby the Department of Labor (DOL) certifies that the issuance of an employment-based immigrant visa will not displace U.S. workers, or adversely affect the wages or working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers, to identify methods for aligning domestic worker recruitment requirements with demonstrated occupational shortages and surpluses.

Arguably key among these is the expansion of a preexisting Obama Administration program that provides for \"provisional waivers\" of the 3- and 10-year bars on the admission of aliens who have accrued more than 180 days of unlawful presence in the United States. Initially, this program reached only spouses, sons, or daughters of U.S. citizens. It will now be expanded to include qualifying relatives of LPRs. ", "As a general matter, unlawfully present aliens whose spouses or parents are U.S. citizens or LPRs may be eligible for an immigrant visa and adjustment to legal status. Obtaining such an immigrant visa typically requires the alien to leave the United States so that his/her visa application can be processed by U.S. consular officers overseas. However, leaving the country generally triggers the application of the 3- and 10-year bars if the alien has been unlawfully present in the United States for more than 180 days (as most unlawfully present aliens have been). These bars can be waived if denial of the alien's admission would result in \"extreme hardship\" to the alien's spouse or parents. However, the time required to obtain a waiver after leaving the country and triggering the bar has historically kept many unlawfully present aliens who could \"legalize their status\" under current law (see \" Does granting deferred action to unlawfully present aliens legalize their\u00c2\u00a0status? \") from doing so. In 2013, the Obama Administration began allowing spouses or children of U.S. citizens to request and obtain provisional waivers of the 3- and 10-year bars to their admission while they are in the United States (they generally still must travel outside the United States for processing). However, the spouses and children of LPRs were ineligible for such provisional waivers until the 2014 actions.", "Other actions announced in November 2014 include certain personnel reforms involving immigration and customs officers; promoting naturalization by eligible LPRs; establishing an interagency task force on \"New Americans\" to \"increase meaningful engagement\" between immigrants and the communities where they settle; and establishing an interagency working group to address the interplay of immigration and employment law.

This is arguably consistent with prior actions in the field of immigration and, particularly, prior exercises of discretion in enforcing federal immigration law. For example, the 1990 \"Family Fairness\" program, discussed below\u00e2\u0080\u0094which gave certain unlawfully present aliens temporary relief from deportation (later known as removal)\u00e2\u0080\u0094was announced in a memorandum from the head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to regional officials.

Section 274A(h)(3)'s definition describes an unauthorized alien as an alien who is not \"authorized to be ... employed ... by the Attorney General [currently, the Secretary of Homeland Security].\" The immigration agencies have relied upon this definition in promulgating regulations that permit aliens granted deferred action to receive EADs upon showing \"an economic necessity for employment.\" ", "Other actions that would appear to involve express delegations of statutory authority include (but are not limited to) (1) paroling into the United States some inventors, researchers, and founders of start-up enterprises on public interest grounds (INA \u00c2\u00a7212(d)(5)); (2) granting provisional waivers of the 3- and 10-year bars upon the admissibility of aliens who have accrued more than 180 days of unlawful presence in the United States (INA \u00c2\u00a7212(a)(9)(B)(v)); and (3) permitting aliens with advanced degrees or \"exceptional ability\" to obtain an immigrant visa without a sponsoring employer if their admission is in the \"national interest\" (INA \u00c2\u00a7203(b)(2)(B)).

The Obama Administration's November 20, 2014, actions can be seen to address all of these \"gaps,\" as well as others not specifically noted here. ", "Any construction advanced by the executive must, however, constitute a \"permissible\" and \"reasonable\" interpretation of the underlying statute in order to be afforded deference by the courts, as previously noted.

As previously noted, the executive branch is understood to have substantial discretionary authority to determine when and whether to pursue sanctions against apparent violators of federal law, an authority generally referred to as prosecutorial or enforcement discretion. Prosecutorial discretion is most closely associated with executive enforcement of federal criminal law. But the concept of prosecutorial or enforcement discretion is often applicable in civil contexts as well, including with respect to immigration officers' decisions regarding whether to seek the removal of aliens who have entered or remained in the United States in violation of federal immigration law.", "A decision not to pursue sanctions against a particular individual is generally understood to be largely shielded from judicial review. Nonetheless, there are recognized limitations to the scope of this discretionary authority. As an initial matter, a general enforcement policy that is promulgated by an agency may not enjoy the same degree of immunity from judicial review as individual determinations not to pursue sanctions in a particular case. Moreover, courts have recognized that agency action must be consistent with congressional objectives underlying the statutory scheme it administers. When adopting a general enforcement policy, an agency may not rely on factors \"which Congress has not intended it to consider\" and substitute its own policy judgment for that which has been made by Congress. In particular, a general policy of non-enforcement by an agency could potentially be reviewable by a court and found to be an impermissible \"abdication\" of the agency's statutory responsibilities. ", "Whether the Obama Administration's November deferred action initiatives constitute a permissible exercise of enforcement discretion will be the subject of heated debate. This debate will likely center upon the Administration's identification of large numbers of unlawfully present aliens as non-priorities for removal, as well as the expansion of its earlier deferred action initiative to additional aliens. On one hand, it could be argued that aspects of these initiatives functionally constitute a blanket policy of non-enforcement of federal immigration statutes, and that this non-enforcement policy represents an abdication of DHS's statutory responsibilities to enforce federal immigration law. The INA contains several grounds of removal which are potentially applicable to aliens who may receive deferred action under the Administration's initiative. Moreover, while federal statute grants immigration authorities the power to provide some unlawfully present aliens with relief from removal, these statute-based forms of relief are limited in scope. It could be argued that the Administration's decision to focus enforcement resources almost exclusively on certain categories of removable aliens, while declining to pursue the removal of a substantial portion of the unauthorized population which does not fall within those categories, constitutes an abdication of its responsibilities under the INA. It might also be argued that, by enabling a sizeable portion of the unlawfully present population to request deferred action (a form of relief that is not expressly authorized by federal statute, except in narrow circumstances ) and work authorization, the executive branch is impermissibly substituting its own judgment as to whom should be legally allowed to remain in the United States for that of Congress.", "On the other hand, it could be argued that resource constraints preclude DHS from pursuing the removal of all unlawfully present aliens in the United States, and that the decision to focus resources primarily upon the removal of those who have engaged in criminal activity, pose a threat to public safety, or recently entered the United States is consistent with applicable statutory enactments. Additionally, while the Administration's initiative would grant some unlawfully present aliens legal permission to remain in the United States for a specified period, it would not provide them with legal immigration status, or enable them to acquire benefits they are statutorily barred from receiving. The executive might further dispute arguments that the initiative constitutes a blanket policy of non-enforcement, and note that immigration officers retain ultimate discretion to grant deferred action on a case-by case basis, and that they are not barred from seeking the removal of unlawfully present aliens who have not been identified by DHS as enforcement priorities. It might also be argued that, particularly in light of the long-standing executive practice of granting deferred action and other forms of relief from removal, that Congress has implicitly signaled its approval or acquiescence to the executive's use of these forms of administrative relief, and the INA should not be interpreted to preclude the executive from granting such relief in certain instances. Accordingly, it could be argued that the executive branch's action, while affecting a substantial number of unlawfully present aliens, does not constitute a legally impermissible abdication of its statutory duties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What other legal issues might be raised by the Administration's actions?", "paragraphs": ["In some cases, specific actions taken by the Obama Administration could potentially be seen to run afoul of the provisions of the INA, in which case the executive action could be found to be impermissible (provided a plaintiff with standing to challenge the executive action were found (see \" Who has standing to challenge the Administration's initiatives? \")). For example, one federal district court recently found that DACA is contrary to three purportedly \"interlocking provisions\" in INA \u00c2\u00a7235 which some assert require that unlawfully present aliens be placed in removal proceedings. These provisions state that", "1. any alien present in the United States who has not been admitted shall be deemed an applicant for admission; 2. applicants for admission shall be inspected by immigration officers; and 3. in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for removal proceedings. ", "Thus, the district court concluded that DACA runs afoul of the INA because many of the aliens granted deferred action through DACA had never been placed in removal proceedings as required, in the court's view, by INA \u00c2\u00a7235. (This same court, however, later ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over the case.

This is, in part, because one Congress cannot bind future Congresses. Thus, despite PRWORA's restrictions upon the receipt of public benefits by aliens who are not included within its definition of \"qualified aliens,\" subsequent Congresses have enacted legislation that provides for aliens' receipt of public benefits that is inconsistent with\u00e2\u0080\u0094and does not use the language of\u00e2\u0080\u0094PRWORA. For example, Section 214 of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) gives states the option to provide Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage to otherwise eligible children and pregnant women \"who are lawfully residing in the United States,\" a phrase which has been taken to include aliens granted deferred action. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 similarly permits persons who are \"lawfully present\" to participate in certain health care programs established under the act. However, while lawfully present for purposes of ACA has generally been construed in the same way as lawfully residing for purposes of CHIPRA, those granted deferred action through DACA have been deemed ineligible for certain benefits under ACA. (As of the date of this report, the Administration does not appear to have formally addressed how aliens granted deferred action through the November initiatives will be treated for purposes of ACA.)

Numerous states have exercised this authority to enact legislation that makes at least some state or local public benefits available to either unlawfully present aliens or aliens who are not qualified aliens for purposes of PRWORA.", "In addition, it is important to note that PRWORA's definition of public benefit is limited to", "(A) any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license provided by [a government] agency ... or by appropriated funds ...; and ", "(B) any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by [a government] agency ... or by appropriated funds.

In the case of the ICE officers who challenged DACA, the reviewing district court found that the plaintiffs had standing because of the possibility of such discipline. However, because such discipline constitutes an adverse employment action, the same court subsequently found that the plaintiffs' case is within the jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), not the court's.

However, the shared name given to such actions can mask important differences in the legal basis for particular grants of discretion, among other things. For example, not all grants of parole to aliens in the 1960s should be seen as exercises of prosecutorial or enforcement discretion since Congress enacted legislation in 1960 that temporarily provided the executive with express statutory authority to parole \"refugees\" into the United States. Likewise, in some cases, Congress has expressly adopted legislation encouraging the executive to exercise particular forms of prosecutorial or enforcement discretion in certain cases, which could potentially be said to indicate congressional \"approval\" of the executive's exercise of this authority.", "The temporary relief from removal granted to unlawfully present aliens that some have asserted most closely resembles the Obama Administration's deferred action initiatives \u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly in terms of the percentage of the unauthorized alien population affected\u00e2\u0080\u0094are the so-called \"Family Fairness\" initiatives of 1987 and 1990.

The Obama Administration's 2014 deferred action initiatives can be likened to the Family Fairness initiatives in that they involve the granting of temporary relief from removal and work authorization to certain unlawfully present aliens based, in part, on humanitarian factors. However, certain differences could also be noted between the current and earlier initiatives, including that (1) the Reagan and Bush Administrations did not establish a centralized process whereby aliens could apply for relief from removal, instead permitting regional officials to grant relief; (2) some aliens who were denied relief through the Family Fairness initiatives were reportedly placed in removal proceedings, something that has not been reported with DACA; and (3) the Family Fairness initiatives were preceded (and followed) by the enactment of legislation legalizing certain unlawfully present aliens, whereas Congress has enacted no such legislation here.
