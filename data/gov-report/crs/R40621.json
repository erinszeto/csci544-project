This report responds to those concerns by addressing the linkage between farm and retail food prices. Retail food price inflation is addressed in CRS Report R40545, Consumers and Food Price Inflation.", "Price is the primary mechanism that links raw farm commodities through the various levels of the market system to the retail food product. The nature of price transmission between farm and retail levels depends, in general, on the size of the farm share of the retail price and the degree of market competition at each stage of the marketing chain. For example, the farm share represents nearly 58% of the retail value of a dozen eggs. Similarly, it ranges from 30% to 50% for most fresh meat retail product prices. In contrast, the farm share is only about 8% of cereal and bakery product prices.", "An array of costs is layered on top of the price of a raw agricultural commodity at each stage of the marketing chain as it moves to the consumer. As a result, the farm share of a food product's price declines as it moves to the retail outlet. Since 1950, the average farm share has been declining as a share of total consumer food expenditures, falling from about 41% in 1950 to 17.4% in 2013. This has important implications for farm-to-retail price linkages because the smaller the share of farm value in the retail product, the smaller will be the effect of a change in farm price on the retail price.", "Economic analysis of farm-to-retail price transmission leads to three generalizations: first, causality usually runs from changes in farm prices to changes in retail prices; second, time lags in retail price response to farm price changes are generally months in length, even for perishables like milk, meat, and fresh fruits and vegetables; and third, retail prices appear to respond asymmetrically, with adjustments to increases in farm prices occurring faster and with greater pass-through than adjustments to decreases in farm prices. This last generalization is often referred to as \"sticky\" retail food prices\u2014that is, retail prices follow commodity prices upward rapidly, but fall back only slowly and partially when commodity prices recede.", "\"Sticky\" retail price behavior is supported by empirical evidence; however, economic theory does not fully explain the observed phenomenon.

However, corn is also processed into a large number of food and industrial products, including corn oil, starch, high fructose corn syrup, corn flour, grits, corn meal, beverage alcohols, and ethanol. The demand for corn at the farm level is derived from the demand for each of these uses, each of which trades in its own market subject to its own set of economic conditions.

The portion of non-food uses has expanded rapidly in recent years with the emergence of agriculture-based biofuel production as a new source of demand for raw agricultural commodities. These multiple sources of demand weaken the price linkage between the price for any single retail product and its related farm commodity price.", "Another emerging factor that weakens the direct farm-to-retail price linkage is the evolution of the U.S. food distribution network, which has experienced a substantial expansion in the number and type of outlets in recent decades. This includes the growth of big box discount stores, the integration of ready-to-eat foods and/or deli sections at grocery stores, mini-marts, gas stations, pharmacies, other non-traditional outlets, and online food delivery services. As a result of this dynamic evolution in commodity markets and food retailing, simple pricing structures have increased in complexity, and the link between farmers and consumers is gradually becoming more diffuse, especially for highly processed products.", "A prime example of this is how, in response to changing consumer preferences, grocery stores have been expanding consumer convenience by offering prepared entrees and side dishes ready for the oven, microwave, or even the dinner table. Many grocery store chains now include ready-to-eat food buffets and deli sections where made-to-take meals are prepared.

Most of the pass-through occurs during the fourth and fifth months, followed by a very gradual sixth month of decline. In this later example, the magnitude of pass-through is (10%)/(50%) = 20% with a six-month lag (M1 to M7).", "The implication of asymmetric price transmission as portrayed by these examples is that consumers at the retail level would not fully benefit from a price reduction at the farm level.

A retail store's perception of menu cost and its influence is also related to consumers' price responsiveness for a particular food item. For example, if the increase in sales generated by the lower price would fail to offset the cost associated with re-marking price labels, then a retail store would likely not lower its prices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Market Uncertainty", "paragraphs": ["Market price uncertainty regarding whether a price shock is permanent or temporary may influence retail price strategy, as firms are generally reluctant to chase temporary price movements. Such uncertainty may contribute to asymmetry in retail and farm price movements. For example, during periods when commodity and energy prices are particularly volatile (as in 2008), retailers may be reluctant to lower prices if there is a significant probability that their costs may turn around and rise quickly thereafter. ", "Volatile commodity prices generally translate into higher retail prices as dealers try to lock in profit margins in the face of uncertain costs. Subsequent \"sticky\" retail prices mean that consumers benefit only partially when commodity prices recede and are left with the perception (if not the reality) of paying for higher retail profit margins. In contrast, farm prices respond quickly to market conditions because most agricultural markets are highly competitive and because, unlike retailers, farmers have little say in the price at which they sell their products, only in the timing of such sales."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Incidence of a Change in Marketing Costs", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the timing and pass-through aspects of price transmission, policymakers and market participants have also expressed concern over the incidence of an increase in the price of an input to the retail food production process (such as an increase in energy costs). Who bears the added cost? Is it: ", "passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, passed back to farmers in the form of lower prices, or absorbed by food processors in the form of lower revenues? ", "Most economists would agree that the time period under consideration is critical when evaluating the incidence of a change in a marketing input cost. Economic theory suggests that the price of the average food product will be more sensitive to an input price change in the short run than in the long run due to the time needed for price-induced behavioral adjustments to occur. For some commodities there may be a substantial time lag for food processors and consumers to adjust their behavior in response to a change in retail prices that result from a change in the price of a retail food product input. This may hold irrespective of the source of the input\u2014e.g., whether an input purchase or technology adjustment in the case of food processors; an adjustment to inventories held by wholesalers or retailers; or a different consumption choice in the case of a consumer.", "In the long run, both firms (food producers) and consumers have more time to adjust their behavior to relative input price changes, thereby mitigating the effects on consumer food prices. Some firms may exit the industry, while others may adjust their input mix by finding a cheaper alternative input or by altering the food processing technology so as to use less of the more expensive input or perhaps switch to a different input entirely. Finally, some firms seek out increased supplies of the more expensive input via imports or expanded domestic production (which would require a new growing cycle).", "Similarly, in the long run, consumers have more time to substitute among food products in favor of obtaining their nutritional needs at the lowest cost. In so doing they shift their demand among individual food products.", "In the short run, the time period is sufficiently short that wholesalers and retailers are unable to adjust their behavior or their technology or to acquire additional lower-cost supplies of the relevant marketing input. Then, food producers and consumers are limited in their response to an unexpected input price change. Under these conditions, a larger portion of an input price increase is usually passed along to consumers in the form of higher retail prices. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extenuating Circumstances for Farm-to-Food Price Linkages", "paragraphs": ["Certain characteristics of individual farm commodities can play an important role in determining the price transmission between the farm and the retail consumer. For example, livestock production tends to have a cyclical pattern driven by biological constraints in the gestation-birth process that limit producer response to market conditions. As a result, meat and dairy product prices are influenced by the long lag time involved in farm (or ranch) production adjustments to input (feed costs) or output price changes.", "Annual crops tend to have seasonal patterns, although this pattern is strongly influenced by the storability of the individual commodity. Perishable products have a shorter shelf life and often require greater handling. As a result, prices for perishable products tend to show strong seasonal patterns; they are vulnerable to volatile swings as near-term conditions change; and long-term price formation is less correlated with current supplies and more correlated with producer behavior. In contrast, storable commodities (e.g., grains) can be moved in bulk and stored for several years at a time such that current supplies are an important factor in determining price volatility as well as both current and long-term price formation. ", "On the demand side, many food products have strong seasonal patterns of demand. For example, meat demand tends to rise in the summer months when grilling activity is at a maximum, and the demand for turkey is strongly correlated with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.

The retail grocery business is highly competitive, making it unlikely that such activity could occur either on a large scale or for a sustained period of time. Sometimes consumers tend to focus on a single highly visible item that is purchased routinely (such as milk) to draw their conclusions about retail price responsiveness and market power, without fully understanding the time lag involved in a farm-to-retail price response for most commodities.", "Another retail marketing consideration that may cloud retail price perceptions by consumers (about whether asymmetric price transmission has occurred) is the use of \"loss leader\" items, whereby a retail outlet sets the price for highly visible consumer items at below cost as a marketing strategy to attract consumers into the store. Supplementary consumer purchases of other goods with normal retail markups would then offset the loss on the leader items. Consumers may be easily confused when neighboring stores use different products as loss leaders, particularly in a period of volatile prices.", "This final section uses national average price data to examine the farm-to-retail price linkages for several major commodities since 2006 when volatile prices characterized many agricultural markets.
