{"id": "R40990", "title": "International Forestry Issues in Climate Change Bills: Comparison of Provisions of S. 1733 and H.R. 2454", "released_date": "2009-12-22T00:00:00", "summary": ["Deforestation releases substantial amounts of carbon dioxide, about 17% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Legislation has been proposed for U.S. targets to reduce GHG emissions. The two primary bills, H.R. 2454 and S. 1733, include provisions that would reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; these activities are referred to as REDD. Both bills would use allowances to build capacity in developing countries and supplement U.S. emissions reductions; both would allow offsets for U.S. industries; and both contain a reserve to stabilize carbon prices.", "The bills are generally similar on allowances for REDD activities, but significant differences exist. H.R. 2454 would rely on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for implementation; S. 1733 would use the U.S. Agency for International Development. H.R. 2454 contains eligibility criteria and implementation standards for the supplemental emissions reductions, and identifies the types of activities that could be funded. S. 1733 would rely on federal agencies to issue regulations for these details. H.R. 2454 also contains more details on monitoring and reporting.", "The bills are similar on REDD offsets, although H.R. 2454 generally contains more details for implementation. Both would limit the quantity of international offsets\u20141 gigaton or billion metric tons (GtCO2) in H.R. 2454, and 0.5 GtCO2 in S. 1733\u2014but would allow some additional international offsets if domestic offsets are insufficient. Both contain guidelines that require agreements with the developing country, and national baselines and strategic forest plans by the developing country. However, neither defines the types of REDD activities that qualify. Both would allow project level and state or regional level REDD offsets, and both would phase-out such offsets to encourage national level REDD offsets, but neither bill describes how the transition from project level or state level REDD offsets to national offsets is to proceed. Both bills also address the rights and needs of indigenous peoples and forest-dependent communities, requiring due regard to indigenous and local rights and directing consultations with and the participation of indigenous peoples and forest-dependent communities.", "There are several concerns about REDD allowances in the bills. H.R. 2454 provides significant details for supplemental emissions reductions, but eligible forests are undefined and the criteria and standards might be insufficient for effective implementation. The bills contain no penalties or consequences for failures to achieve the overall anticipated reductions in carbon release or to measure and monitor the activities. Both bills would use allowances for building capacity (e.g., personnel and equipment) to measure, monitor, and enforce REDD activities in developing countries, but neither bill defines capacity-building activities that could be funded, nor allocates funds between capacity building and supplemental emissions reductions.", "There are also concerns about REDD carbon offsets. There are issues for carbon offsets generally\u2014their verification (measuring, monitoring, and reporting carbon sequestration), their additionality (activities not already occurring or required), their permanence, and leakage (merely shifting deforestation to other locations). These issues are exacerbated for REDD offsets, because many developing countries do not have the capacity to address these concerns. In addition, many are concerned that REDD offsets may inhibit developing countries from committing to GHG reductions and from evolving to low-carbon economies."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Efforts to mitigate climate change have focused on reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions into the atmosphere. Some of these efforts focus on reducing deforestation, since deforestation is a significant source of CO 2 emissions. Deforestation releases about 1.6 GtCO 2 (gigatons or billion metric tons of CO 2 ) annually, about 17% of all annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, discussions and negotiations on international climate change mitigation policies, such as in Congress and at the 15 th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen in December 2009, typically include reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).", "The two primary climate change bills in the 111 th Congress, S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 , include REDD activities as part of a strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Both S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 seek to reduce U.S. GHG emissions, among other things. Both would establish \"cap-and-trade\" systems, where emissions from many economic sectors (accounting for about 85% of U.S. GHG emissions) are capped, with the emissions cap declining over time.", "The cap would establish the total quantity of annual allowances. Capped, or covered, entities would be required to acquire allowances to fulfill their compliance obligations. Congress may choose to distribute emission allowances at no cost to capped (or covered) sources or to non-capped entities, or to sell the allowances through auctions. Because allowances to non-covered entities can be sold by the recipients to covered entities, they effectively provide funding to the recipients, generally called allowance value. In both bills, many allowances would be allocated to various entities at no cost; others (especially from the reserves) would be auctioned by the government to covered entities. Both bills would allocate 5% of the allowances to finance REDD activities in developing countries (although the bases for allocating allowances differ); the funding that this would generate depends on the market value of those allowances.", "Offsets are GHG emissions reductions by a non-covered entity (including other countries) that can be purchased by covered entities and used to meet their compliance obligations under the emissions cap. REDD activities could be a major source of offsets, because deforestation in tropical countries is a major source of emissions. Both bills would authorize international offsets from REDD activities in developing countries, within limits.", "In addition to allocated allowances and offsets, both bills would establish allowance reserves. The primary purpose of the reserves is for allowance sales to stabilize market prices for allowances. If carbon prices are too high or rise too quickly, reserve allowances could be sold, expanding supply and moderating prices. The proceeds from reserve allowance sales could (under S. 1733 ) or must (under H.R. 2454 ) be used for additional REDD activities, thus providing a third source of funding to reduce deforestation.", "Advocates support REDD activities to reduce GHG emissions because it will not require new technology, and thus can be implemented quickly, providing time for longer-term solutions that involve the energy sector. Further, some contend that reducing deforestation is a low-cost strategy to reduce GHG emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that the opportunity for U.S. firms to get credits from international offsets reduces the permit price by 89% under one climate bill, and that nearly 60% of the international offsets will come from REDD activities.", "Critics object to relying heavily on REDD for GHG reductions. They are concerned that flooding carbon markets with REDD offsets will detract from other critical GHG-reducing activities, such as developing and implementing new technologies to lower emissions. Other concerns are that REDD projects might not be sustainable in developing countries for long periods of time and that use of REDD in developing countries may inhibit both developed and developing countries from reducing their own emissions.", "This report summarizes, compares, and analyzes provisions related to international REDD in H.R. 2454 (as passed the House) and S. 1733 (the revised Chair's mark of 10/30/09). This includes a discussion of major differences between bills and potential issues associated with selected provisions. Three aspects of the bills address international REDD activities: (1) allowances for capacity-building and emissions reductions; (2) international REDD offsets; and (3) allowance reserves."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Allowances and Emissions Reductions from REDD", "paragraphs": ["S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 both would allocate 5% of allowances for REDD activities in developing countries. The aim under both bills is to use the allowance value to reduce deforestation in developing countries. The allowance value could be used in two ways: (1) to build capacity (e.g., develop a deforestation baseline and acquire monitoring technology) for countries to reduce deforestation and to participate in markets for international offset credits, and (2) to directly reduce deforestation emissions and supplement emissions reductions from non-REDD activities.", "Supplemental emissions reductions from REDD activities are expected to help the United States reach emission reduction goals, particularly in the first 10-15 years of the program. Under both bills, supplemental emissions reductions from REDD activities are expected to reduce GHG emissions in developing countries by at least 720 million tons of CO 2 in 2020 (a one-year target quantity for 2020), and a cumulative quantity of 6 GtCO 2 by 2025. This is in addition to the U.S. emissions reductions targets from covered sources that the bills aim to achieve by 2020, which could be achieved in part through international offsets including REDD activities. (See below.)", "Some contend that the supplemental emission reduction targets in both bills might be unrealistic, due to the lack of readiness and unwillingness of some developing countries to participate in the program. They argue that, in the early years of the program, funds from allowances might have to flow largely to capacity-building activities rather than emission-reducing activities, thus delaying progress toward the emission reduction targets. Supporters counter that an abundance of emission reduction opportunities are ready to be funded, and that sub-national or program-level projects are the first steps toward reducing emissions. H.R. 2454 (\u00a7754(b)) would allow sub-national deforestation activities and pilot programs that aim to reduce GHG emissions; S. 1733 does not specify that these activities would be allowed under this program, although the regulations required by S. 1733 could include them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "REDD Allowance Provisions in the Bills", "paragraphs": ["The bills contain several conditions on the use of allowance values for implementing REDD to build capacity and reduce emissions in developing countries.

In general, and as discussed below, H.R. 2454 contains more explicit requirements for REDD allowances than does S. 1733 . The more explicit requirements and conditions under H.R. 2454 might take several years for countries and projects to qualify, and suggest that S. 1733 could potentially be implemented in less time.

EPA's mission includes enforcing domestic compliance with various environmental regulatory provisions, including air and water pollution control and solid waste disposal. EPA has experience in measuring and monitoring emissions and in enforcing pollution reduction programs. EPA is a larger organization than USAID, with an annual budget of about $10 billion.", "In contrast, USAID was created to administer international economic and humanitarian assistance programs; international environmental programs were added later to the agency's mission. USAID currently administers foreign assistance projects, including forestry and forest protection projects, in many countries.

S. 1733 does not specify eligibility factors for developing countries; instead it would direct USAID to develop a program within two years to reduce GHG through REDD activities in developing countries. This would provide some flexibility for USAID to develop criteria for including and prioritizing countries that can participate in the program.", "H.R. 2454 includes a set of eligibility criteria for developing countries to participate in the supplemental emission reduction program. EPA, in consultation with USAID, would be required to determine that the developing country is experiencing deforestation or forest degradation, or has standing forests that might be at risk of deforestation or degradation. In addition, the country must have entered into a bilateral or multilateral agreement with the United States establishing conditions for its participation in the program. S. 1733 contains similar requirements for carbon offsets, but not for supplemental emissions reductions.", "Neither bill defines what constitutes a forest, making it difficult to understand the type, location, and extent of forested land that might be eligible for REDD activities. S. 1733 does define deforestation and forest degradation, but without a definition of forest or forested land, the implications of these definitions are uncertain. There are several published definitions of a forest, usually reflecting the concerns or interests of various entities. Definitions commonly define the percent tree (canopy) cover in a forest or some minimum level of tree or woody biomass growth.", "In both bills, emissions reduction activities funded under this section would not be eligible for international offset credits. The intent might be to prevent funding the same project twice, once from allowances and a second time as an offset. However, REDD activities funded by allowances could later become offsets.

For example, national sovereignty became an issue in Bolivia in 1987 when a conservation organization was reported to have obtained title to forested lands; there was a public outcry and ensuing political crisis when the Bolivian people thought a large part of their country had been given to a foreign organization.

Developing this capacity could delay the distribution of emissions allowances under this program. The United Nations REDD Programme (UNREDD) is assisting countries to implement REDD activities and has 33 participating countries. Few countries have submitted progress reports and implemented REDD-ready activities (e.g., developing a national baseline and monitoring strategies). H.R. 2454 further requires countries to enter into a bilateral or multilateral agreement establishing the condition of its participation, further delaying implementation, depending on the conditions of the agreement. Before distribution of emission allowances, concurrence from the Secretary of State is required. It is unclear if the Secretary of State will be evaluating countries based on political criteria, similar to other programs such as debt-for-nature swaps under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA, P.L. 105-214 ; 22 U.S.C. \u00a72431). For activities that generate supplemental emissions reductions, compensation from allowances will be granted only after the emissions have been achieved and verified. This would require funding from the developing country to implement the activity, and implies that the country has a national deforestation baseline and the capacity to measure and monitor GHG emissions reductions.

Monitoring foreign assistance activities is difficult because the United States has no jurisdiction to enforce laws and policies in foreign countries. Neither bill directly addresses enforcement of activities in countries receiving allowances under this program or discusses potential consequences if guidelines are not met. This issue could be addressed, in part, through reporting and monitoring. H.R. 2454 does contain requirements for reporting and reviewing REDD activities under this program. For example, in \u00a7754(f), H.R. 2454 would authorize a publicly accessible registry of supplemental emissions reductions achieved through this program annually, and \u00a7755 would require an annual report on the quantity of supplemental emissions reductions and description of the REDD activities implemented and allowances distributed. S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 (\u00a7731(d) of both bills) also would require a scientific review of offsets and supplemental emissions reductions activities at five-year intervals.

(There are provisions that discuss penalties for offset reversals.) Nor do the bills establish an environmental justice mechanism where disputes or claims can be heard, discussed or settled. Some U.S. environmental initiatives that provide international development assistance related to the environment have approached enforcement and oversight in different ways. For example, under the TFCA, a fund that provides grants to local non-governmental organizations is overseen by an independent board.

The TPA requires that both Parties adopt laws and measures to fulfill each Party's obligations under multilateral environmental agreements, such as Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Further, the TPA requires the Parties to enforce their own environmental laws and establishes a policy mechanism to address public complaints that a Party is not effectively enforcing its environmental laws, whether or not the failure is trade related.

They contend that capturing carbon in forests may be the only way to reduce carbon emissions significantly in the short term, until a technological solution emerges. Further, they contend that some REDD activities might have long-term consequences, such as the need to implement new forest governance systems and facilitate sustainable forestry management activities.

Each bill, however, has a different limit on the number of international offsets that can be generated.

Under S. 1733 , not more than one-quarter of offsets (i.e., 0.5 GtCO 2 ) can come from international offset credits. Both bills specify conditions under which these limits can be modified. Specifically, if the estimated use of domestic offsets are expected to be below 0.9 GtCO 2 annually, limits on the use of international offsets can be modified. Under H.R. 2454 , the ceiling on international offset credits can be increased by the amount that the estimated domestic offset usage falls below 1 GtCO 2 , up to an additional 0.5 GtCO 2 .

Extensions could allow the program to last up to 13 years in both bills.", "Without proper monitoring and protections, sub-national and project or program activities could cause \"leakage\" to neighboring areas within the host country or to neighboring countries. For this reason, some contend that all REDD activities should be measured against a national baseline, rather than one developed for an individual project or state. Measuring at the national level might also reduce concerns about permanence of GHG emissions reductions at the project level, since GHG emissions reductions would be aggregated among projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Indigenous Peoples and Forest-Dependent Communities", "paragraphs": ["Addressing the rights of indigenous and local people is a recurring theme throughout both bills. Some are concerned that funds from REDD offsets will be disproportionately given to wealthier landowners who have large holdings, access to funds, and a secure title to their land. Rural and poor landowners might not benefit from REDD activities and could be at a disadvantage in some cases. For example, REDD might lead to conflicts in efforts to secure title, and therefore would likely favor those with more resources. Furthermore, a majority of land in developing countries is owned by the government, thus putting local people at risk of displacement. REDD activities could also depress local economies by taking away land used to produce agricultural commodities and wood and other forest products and by eliminating the associated infrastructure.", "Under the offset program, both bills would direct EPA to ensure the establishment and enforcement of legal regimes, processes, standards, and safeguards that (1) give due regard to the rights and interests of local communities, indigenous peoples, forest-dependent communities, and vulnerable social groups; (2) promote consultations with, and full participation of, forest-dependent communities and indigenous peoples during the design, planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of activities; and (3) encourage equitable sharing of profits and benefits derived from international offset credits with local communities, indigenous peoples, and forest-dependent communities. Ensuring that these provisions are adhered to in foreign countries could be challenging. One approach could be establishing a dispute resolution mechanism in the offset agreement with the host country. This would allow a third-party to oversee disputes related to offsets and their implementation. The decision-making authority of this entity could be specified in the agreement as well. This type of policy mechanism has been used in some free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and more recently in the Central American Free Trade Agreement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Issues Affecting REDD Offsets in Both Bills", "paragraphs": ["There are numerous concerns about REDD offsets. These concerns include verifiability (measuring, monitoring, and reporting), additionality, leakage, and permanence. Other concerns relate to REDD projects more specifically, and are similar to the concerns about REDD allowance implementation, discussed above.", "Some developing countries may not have the capacity to address concerns about REDD offsets\u2014particularly the ability to enforce laws and land tenure (ownership), to prevent illegal logging and other activities, and to measure and monitor forest carbon levels. While the REDD allowances described above can be used to build capacity, allowance funding might be focused on achieving the supplemental emissions reductions, and not provide sufficient funding to build governance capacity in developing countries to allow them to participate in the REDD offset markets.", "A related concern, discussed briefly above, is the transition in developing countries from the REDD supplemental emissions reductions program to the REDD offset markets. While the bills clearly anticipate this transition, with the phase-out of supplemental emissions reductions, the pathway for the transition is not clear. In addition, the bills phase-out the project/ program and regional/state REDD offsets, with a transition to national REDD offsets, but the pathway for this transition is also unclear. In particular, it is unclear how near-term failures (e.g., carbon emissions from wildfires) in the supplemental program and in project or state REDD offsets might affect the national deforestation baseline and other criteria necessary for a national REDD offsets.", "Another issue is the long-term participation of developing countries in global efforts to reduce GHG emissions. If developing countries participate actively in the REDD offset market, it might prevent those countries from using REDD to offset emissions from domestic development. This might prevent economic growth and continue the impoverished state of many developing countries.", "Finally, host nations might act strategically, establishing a national deforestation baseline to create the most favorable conditions or maximum opportunities for REDD offsets. Entities that develop offsets (e.g., offset aggregators) have similar incentives to minimize pre-existing carbon baselines so as to maximize the carbon sequestration that can be sold. However, where offset projects will likely require independent, third-party verification of carbon changes from the baseline conditions, there is no comparable independent review of the national deforestation baselines for REDD offsets. Because of the bilateral or multi-lateral agreements needed for REDD offsets, the baselines might be determined, or at least influenced by political considerations, rather than objective standards, raising questions about the reality of additional carbon sequestration from REDD activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Allowance Reserve Auction", "paragraphs": ["A third source of money for REDD activities might come from the expenditure of proceeds from the auction of allowances in a strategic reserve. Under both bills, a portion of the allowances would be deposited in a strategic reserve ( H.R. 2454 ) or market stability reserve ( S. 1733 ). The purpose of the reserve is to provide a supply of allowances that can be auctioned off to stabilize prices if allowance markets become highly volatile. Reserve allowances would be auctioned separately from quarterly auctions of other allowances.", "Under H.R. 2454 , EPA would use the proceeds from each strategic reserve auction to purchase international offsets from REDD activities. These offsets would be converted back into emissions allowances (with 1.25 offsets needed for each 1 allowance) and placed in the strategic reserve account to refill the reserve to its size before the auction. Once the reserve is replenished, additional allowances from international offsets (to some extent) would be allocated and auctioned as part of the normal allowance auction in a future year. For each of the first five years, EPA may auction up to 5% of the emissions allowances established for each year. The percentage increases incrementally during each five years.", "Under S. 1733 , the expenditure of proceeds from the Market Stability Reserve (similar in function to the Strategic Reserve under H.R. 2454 ) could be used to purchase either domestic or international offset credits. This could enhance the domestic offset credit sector, since domestic offsets are expected to be available sooner than international offsets. Further, S. 1733 would not limit purchases to international REDD offsets, and therefore other types of international offsets could presumably be purchased. When the offsets are converted back into emissions allowances, it would be at a one-to-one ratio under S. 1733 .", "The Strategic Reserve under H.R. 2454 and the Market Stability Reserve under S. 1733 have the potential to generate large sums of funds for REDD offsets. This potential depends on the price of offsets in the market and how that compares to the price of reserves. REDD activities would likely benefit more under H.R. 2454 since proceeds can only be used to purchase international REDD offsets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Deforestation is a significant source of global CO 2 emissions. The two primary climate change bills, H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 , generally include similar processes to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). Both would use allowances for capacity building in developing countries and for supplemental emissions reductions. Both would allow international REDD offsets for covered entities in the United States. Both contain a reserve to stabilize carbon offset prices and possibly supplement REDD efforts. H.R. 2454 generally contains more details on the implementation of these programs; S. 1733 leaves more of the details to be determined in regulation. H.R. 2454 would use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the primary federal administrator of these REDD-related programs; S. 1733 would rely substantially on the U.S. Agency for International Development for implementation.", "Allowances for REDD activities could include both capacity building and supplemental emissions reductions. The pending legislation provides significant details on the supplemental emissions reductions, although \"forest\" is undefined and concerns about the effectiveness of implementation for supplemental reductions will persist until countries can demonstrate their capacity. The bills do not identify how to balance funding between supplemental emissions reduction and capacity building, although developing country capacity for implementing REDD is critical to both the supplemental reductions and REDD offsets. Furthermore, the activities included in \"capacity building\" are ill-defined.", "Carbon offsets from REDD activities offer a substantial opportunity to reduce global CO 2 emissions. However, concerns persist about offsets generally and about REDD offsets in particular. Many developing countries do not have the ability (personnel and equipment) to verify (to measure, monitor, and report on) avoided deforestation, and may have difficulty acquiring or developing the ability. Because of existing forest protection programs, many question whether REDD activities would merely substitute for efforts that a country would undertake anyway. Furthermore, avoiding deforestation in one location may merely displace it to another location (leakage). Many also question the capacity of developing countries to provide permanence in avoided deforestation. In addition, the bills allow for project level or state level REDD activities, with a transition to national programs, but the process for making the transition is largely undefined. Many also question whether REDD offsets in developing countries might undermine global efforts to get all nations to participate in reducing GHG emissions and might inhibit those countries from developing low-carbon economies."], "subsections": []}]}}
