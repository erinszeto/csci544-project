Over the last year, the Trump Administration, Congress, state governments, and the private sector have all taken action to address prescription drug abuse. Initiatives range from state and private health care initiatives, such as limiting the number of pills in a prescription, to major legislation, such as the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA; P.L. 114-198 ), which included many provisions to address prescription drug abuse.

Unlike prescription pain relievers, however, heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act and has no accepted medical use in the United States.

PDMP information can aid medical professionals and those in law enforcement in identifying patterns of prescribing, dispensing, or receiving controlled substances that may indicate abuse.

In 2002, Congress established the Harold Rogers PDMP grant, administered by the Department of Justice (DOJ), to help law enforcement, regulatory entities, and public health officials analyze data on prescriptions for controlled substances. Three years later, Congress and the President enacted the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of 2005 (NASPER) requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to states to establish or improve PDMPs.

This may best be understood by viewing PDMPs in comparison to earlier, paper-based programs called multiple-copy prescription programs. For example, in 1914 a New York state law required physicians to use state-issued, serialized, duplicate prescription forms for certain drugs. Similarly, California began a multiple-copy prescription program using triplicate forms for specified narcotics in 1939; it expanded to monitor all schedule II narcotics in 1972 and schedule II non-narcotics in 1981. Studies of multiple-copy prescription programs found that many prescribers did not order the required prescription forms, rendering them unable to prescribe specified controlled substances even when medically appropriate. In addition, the ability to check a patient's prescription history using an electronic PDMP might give prescribers more confidence when considering the use of drugs with high risk of abuse and prevent the prescribing of contraindicated medications.

The author concluded that PDMPs reduce \"doctor shopping,\" change prescribing behavior, and reduce prescription drug abuse. For example, a 2006 federally funded study (included in the 2012 review article) found that PDMPs\u2014especially ones that issue reports proactively\u2014change prescriber behavior in a way that reduces the per capita supply of prescription pain relievers and stimulants, which in turn reduces the likelihood of abuse.

Almost all PDMPs are statewide programs; thus, researchers look for outcome measures for which statewide data are available. Some outcomes that have been measured in research on PDMP effectiveness are shipments and sales of controlled substances, benzodiazepine use in a Medicaid population, opioid consumption, substance abuse treatment admissions, drug overdose mortality, and multiple provider episodes (i.e., doctor shopping). One drawback of using opioid consumption as an outcome measure is that it includes both nonmedical use of opioids and medically appropriate use of opioids to manage pain. A limitation of using a count of substance abuse treatment admissions is that it fails to capture substance abuse that goes untreated. Each of these measures presents only a portion of the picture of prescription drug diversion and abuse. ", "Studies that compared states with and without PDMPs and/or before and after implementation of a PDMP vary in the degree to which they account for differences among PDMPs. For example, despite evidence that proactive PDMPs are more effective than reactive PDMPs, most studies do not distinguish between proactive and reactive PDMPs. Another difference that may influence PDMP effectiveness is which drugs are required to be reported to the PDMP, ranging from only those prescription drugs with the highest potential for abuse to all prescription controlled substances plus other drugs of concern. Research generally focuses on those controlled substances that are included in all of the PDMPs being examined. Differences in PDMPs over time may also influence effectiveness. For example, some states have transitioned from paper-based systems for monitoring prescriptions for controlled substances to the electronic PDMPs used today. Effectiveness studies have generally not accounted for such transitions over time, classifying two different systems as the same PDMP. Accounting for these and other differences between PDMPs may shed light on factors that influence effectiveness.", "Researchers also contend with factors that may confound study results, both when comparing outcomes across states and when comparing outcomes over time. For example, the baseline rate of prescription drug abuse may vary across states. The authors of a previously referenced study noted that the likelihood of abuse was actually higher in states with PDMPs than in states without PDMPs, but that proactive PDMPs inhibited the rate of increase in prescription drug abuse. A PDMP may be part of a larger effort to reduce prescription drug diversion and abuse, in which case other initiatives may be responsible for any change in the outcome.

Studies of paper-based prescription monitoring programs that preceded the electronic PDMPs found that many prescribers did not order the required prescription forms, rendering them unable to prescribe specified controlled substances.

The American Medical Association (AMA), a professional association of more than 200,000 physicians, supports the use of PDMPs and recommended that PDMPs be housed in health-related agencies (rather than law enforcement agencies). AMA further recommends that information from PDMPs \"be used first for education of the specific physicians involved prior to any civil action against these physicians.\" The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), one of several national medical specialty societies under the AMA umbrella, likewise expresses concern about the use of PDMP data for purposes other than health care: \"[L]aw enforcement, the judiciary, corrections professionals, employers, and others outside of the health care system should not be granted access to PDMP data except via the means available to them to secure access to other personally identifiable health information.\" The fact that PDMPs contain personally identifiable health information raises concerns about privacy and data security. Both AMA and ASAM stress the need to subject PDMP information to the same standards applied to other patient records.

The CSA contains a provision, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7876, that authorizes the DEA to issue administrative subpoenas (without prior court approval) to obtain documents that the agency finds are \"relevant or material\" to an investigation involving controlled substances. The DEA may also seek judicial enforcement of such subpoenas \"to compel compliance\" with the requests for evidence. In 2012, the Oregon Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the DEA in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that, pursuant to state law, the DEA must obtain \"a valid court order\" in order to access patient and physician records contained in the Oregon PDMP. The DEA argued that the CSA's administrative subpoena provision preempts Oregon's statutory requirement. Agreeing with the DEA, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the CSA preempted the Oregon law because the provisions are in \"positive conflict ... so that the two cannot consistently stand together.\" ", "In another federal case, a Utah district court upheld the DEA's exercise of its administrative subpoena power to access the state's PDMP database, despite a Utah state law requirement that law enforcement officers may obtain such information only \"pursuant to a valid search warrant.\" Though the court first observed that the Supremacy Clause resolves the conflict between the conflicting federal and state laws at issue, Utah asserted that the DEA's use of the CSA's administrative subpoena provision is not a \"valid exercise of national power\" because the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable search and seizure require a search warrant to access the PDMP data. The court disagreed with the state, ruling that the DEA's subpoena authority is a valid exercise of national power \"that does not offend the Fourth Amendment\" because the pharmaceutical industry is a highly regulated one in which \"physicians and patients have no reasonable expectation of privacy from the DEA\" in the records stored in Utah's PDMP.

The rule describes multiple situations in which covered entities may use or disclose PHI, while all uses and disclosures of PHI by covered entities or business associates that are not expressly permitted under the rule require the individual's prior written authorization. Generally, covered entities may share PHI between and among themselves for the purposes of treatment, payment or healthcare operations, with few restrictions (and specifically, without out the individual's authorization). Certain other uses and disclosures (e.g., sharing PHI with family members and friends) are permitted, but require the covered entity to give the individual the opportunity to object or agree to the PHI's use or disclosure.

For this reason, the rule lists a number of \"national priority purposes\" for which covered entities may disclose PHI without an individual's authorization or opportunity to agree or object. PDMPs can receive PHI from covered entities under authority of one or more of these exceptions. Relevant exceptions include disclosures required by law\u2014in this case, state PDMP laws; disclosures for public health activities; or disclosures for health oversight activities.

The requirement for consent may be a logistical deterrent to the submission of this information to PDMPs. In addition, since PDMPs are designed to share information with registered users, the \"Part 2\" rule's prohibition on re-disclosure without patient consent discourages federally assisted substance abuse programs from contributing to PDMPs' information about controlled substances dispensed for the treatment of opioid addiction (i.e., methadone or buprenorphine) due to concerns that authorized re-disclosures of the data could not be prevented."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Role in Interstate Information Sharing and Interoperability", "paragraphs": ["Federal policymakers have repeatedly emphasized the importance of enhancing interstate information sharing and the interoperability of state systems.
