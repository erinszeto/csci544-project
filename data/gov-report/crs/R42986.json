This expansion, however, has prompted questions about the potential impacts of natural gas systems on human health and the environment, including impacts on air quality.", "The natural gas supply chain contributes to air pollution in several ways, including (1) the leaking, venting, and combustion of natural gas in the course of production operations; and (2) the combustion of other fossil fuel resources or other emissions during associated operations. Emission sources include pad, road, and pipeline construction; well drilling, completion, and flowback activities; and gas processing and transmission equipment such as controllers, compressors, dehydrators, pipes, and storage vessels. Pollutants include, most prominently, methane (i.e., the principal component of natural gas) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)\u2014of which the natural gas industry is one of the highest-emitting industrial sectors in the United States\u2014as well as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and various forms of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).", "Federal Air Standards for the Sector", "Under the Obama Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated air standards for several source categories in the crude oil and natural gas sector on August 16, 2012. These standards revise previously existing rules and promulgate new ones to regulate emissions of VOCs, SO2, and HAPs from many production and processing activities that had never before been covered by federal standards (including, most notably, VOC controls on new hydraulically fractured natural gas wells). In an extension of these regulations, and in conjunction with the Obama Administration's Climate Action Plan, EPA promulgated additional rules on June 3, 2016, \"to set standards for methane and VOC emissions from new and modified oil and gas production sources, and natural gas processing and transmission sources\" not covered by the 2012 rule. Further, the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), promulgated a \"Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation\" rule on November 18, 2016, to target natural gas emissions on federal and Indian lands as a potential waste of public resources and loss of royalty revenue.", "In a direct response to the Obama-era standards, and in line with his campaign promises, President Trump signed Executive Order 13783 on March 28, 2017.

Section 7 of the order specifically directs the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of the Interior to review several regulations related to domestic oil and gas development, including EPA's 2016 methane standards and BLM's 2016 waste prevention rule. In June 2017, both EPA and BLM announced plans to postpone the compliance dates for certain sections of the standards, pursuant to the Clean Air Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), while the agencies work through the reconsideration process. On July 3, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated EPA's administrative stay of the 2016 methane standards. On October 4, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled against BLM's delay.

Recent expansion in natural gas production, primarily as a result of new or improved technologies (e.g., hydraulic fracturing) used on unconventional resources (e.g., shale, tight sands, and coalbed methane), has made natural gas an increasingly significant component in the U.S. energy supply. While the practice of hydraulic fracturing is not new, relatively recent innovations have incorporated processes such as directional drilling, high-volume slick-water injection, and multistage fractures to get to previously unrecoverable resources. As a result, the United States has again become the largest producer of natural gas in the world. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects natural gas to account for nearly 39% of U.S. energy production by 2050, with shale gas and tight oil plays projected to grow. In addition, some analysts believe that by significantly expanding the domestic gas supply, the exploitation of new unconventional resources has the potential to reshape energy policy at national and international levels\u2014altering geopolitics and energy security, recasting the economics of energy technology investment decisions, and shifting trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. ", "Many in both the public and private sectors have advocated for the increased production and use of natural gas because the resource is domestically available, economically recoverable, and considered a potential \"bridge\" fuel to a less polluting and lower GHG-intensive economy. Natural gas is cleaner burning than other fossil fuels, emitting, on average, about half as much carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as coal and one-quarter less than oil when consumed in a typical electric utility plant. Further, natural gas combustion emits no mercury\u2014a persistent, bioaccumulative neurotoxin\u2014virtually no particulate matter or sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and less nitrogen oxides, per unit of combustion, than either coal or oil. For these reasons, pollution control measures in natural gas systems have traditionally received less attention relative to those in other hydrocarbon industries. However, the recent increase in natural gas production, specifically from unconventional resources, has raised a new set of questions regarding environmental impacts. These questions centered initially on water quality issues, including the potential contamination of groundwater and surface water from hydraulic fracturing and related production activities. They have since incorporated other issues, such as water management practices (both consumption and discharge), land use changes, induced seismicity, and air pollution. These questions about hydraulic fracturing in unconventional reservoirs have led, in part, to the rise of various grassroots movements, some political opposition, and calls for additional regulatory actions, moratoria, and/or bans on the practice at the local, state, and federal levels.", "Currently, the development of natural gas in the United States is regulated under a complex set of local, state, and federal laws that addresses many aspects of exploration, production, and distribution. State and local authorities are responsible for virtually all of the day-to-day regulation and oversight of natural gas systems. The organization of this oversight within each gas-producing jurisdiction varies considerably. In general, each state has one or more regulatory agencies that may permit wells\u2014including their design, location, spacing, operation, and abandonment\u2014and may regulate for environmental compliance. With respect to pollution controls, state laws may address many aspects of water management and disposal, air emissions, underground injection, wildlife impacts, surface disturbance, and worker health and safety.", "Furthermore, several federal statutes address pollution control measures in natural gas systems, and, where applicable, these controls are largely implemented by state and local authorities. For example, the Clean Water Act regulates surface discharges of water associated with natural gas drilling and production as well as contaminated storm water runoff from production sites. The Safe Drinking Water Act regulates the underground injection of wastewater from crude oil and natural gas production and the underground injection of fluids used in hydraulic fracturing if the fluids contain diesel fuel. The Clean Air Act (CAA) limits emissions from associated engines and gas processing equipment as well as some natural gas extraction, production, and processing activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Natural Gas Systems and Air Pollution", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Industry", "paragraphs": ["Natural gas is a nonrenewable fossil fuel that is used both as an energy source (for heating, transportation, and electricity generation) and as a chemical feedstock (for such varied products as plastic, fertilizer, antifreeze, and fabrics). The natural gas that the nation uses\u2014to heat homes and to fuel electric utilities\u2014is the product of a long process beginning with the exploration and extraction of the resource and leading to its treatment in processing facilities, transportation to distributors, and eventual delivery through a long network of pipelines to consumers. Raw natural gas is commonly recovered from geologic formations in the ground through drilling and extraction activities by the oil and gas industry. This industry includes operations in the production of crude oil and natural gas as well as the processing, transmission, and distribution of natural gas. For both operational and regulatory reasons, the industry is commonly separated into four major sectors: (1) crude oil and natural gas production, (2) natural gas processing, (3) natural gas transmission and storage, and (4) natural gas distribution. This report uses these basic categories to track the various activities in natural gas systems, including the operations, emissions, and regulations discussed below. While the focus of this report is on the production sector, it also highlights air quality issues in other sectors, where appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Resource", "paragraphs": ["Raw natural gas is primarily a mixture of low molecular-weight hydrocarbon compounds that are gaseous in form at normal conditions. While the principal component of natural gas is methane (CH 4 ), it may contain smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, propane, and butane, as well as heavier hydrocarbons. These nonmethane hydrocarbons include types of VOCs, classified as ground-level ozone (i.e., smog) precursors, as well as, in some cases, hazardous (i.e., toxic) air pollutants (HAPs). Nonhydrocarbon gases\u2014such as CO 2 , helium, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), nitrogen, and water vapor\u2014may also be present in any proportion to the total hydrocarbon content. The chemical composition of raw natural gas varies greatly across resource reservoirs, and the gas may or may not be \"associated\" with crude oil resources. When natural gas is found to be primarily methane, it is referred to as \"dry\" or \"pipeline quality\" gas. When natural gas is found bearing higher percentages of heavier hydrocarbons, nonhydrocarbon gases, and/or water vapor, it is commonly referred to as \"wet,\" \"rich,\" or \"hot\" gas. Similarly, quantities of VOCs, HAPs, and H 2 S can vary significantly depending upon the resource reservoir. VOC and HAP compositions typically account for only a small percentage of natural gas mixtures; however, this ratio increases the \"wetter\" the gas. Natural gas mixtures with a higher percentage of H 2 S are generally referred to as \"sour\" or \"acid\" gas. These varying characteristics may cause both industry operations and regulatory oversight to differ across resource reservoirs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Emissions", "paragraphs": ["Natural gas systems release air emissions in several different ways. This report categorizes these emissions into three types: fugitive , combusted , and associated .", "1. Fugitive refers to the natural gas vapors that are released to the atmosphere during industry operations. Fugitive emissions can be either intentional (i.e., vented) or unintentional (i.e., leaked). Intentional emissions are releases that are designed specifically into the system: for example, emissions from vents or blow-downs used to guard against overpressuring or gas-driven equipment used to regulate pressure or store or transport the resource. Conversely, unintentional emissions are releases that result from uncontrolled leaks in the system: for example, emissions from routine wear, tear, and corrosion; improper installation or maintenance of equipment; or the overpressure of gases or liquids in the system. Fugitive emissions can contain several different kinds of air pollutants, including methane, VOCs, and HAPs. 2. Combusted refers to the byproducts that are formed from the burning of natural gas during industry operations. Combusted emissions are commonly released through either the flaring of natural gas for safety and health precautions or the combustion of natural gas for process heat, power, and electricity in the system (e.g., for compressors and other machinery). The chemical process of combusting natural gas releases several different kinds of air pollutants, including CO 2 , carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and trace amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and particulate matter (PM). 3. Associated refers to secondary sources of emissions that arise from associated operations in natural gas systems. Associated emissions may result from the combustion of other fossil fuels (i.e., other than the natural gas stream) to power equipment, machinery, and transportation as well as the associated release of dust and PM from construction, operations, and road use. Associated emissions have the potential to contribute significantly to air pollution. ", "The focus of this report is on fugitive and combusted natural gas emissions. Notwithstanding the additional emissions from associated sources, the primary focus of this report is on air quality issues related to the resource itself (i.e., the fugitive release of natural gas and its combustion during operations). It is this release of natural gas\u2014and the pollutants contained within it\u2014that makes air quality considerations in the crude oil and natural gas sector unique from other manufacturing-, construction-, and transportation-intensive sectors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sources of Emissions", "paragraphs": ["Natural gas systems include many activities and pieces of equipment that have the potential to emit air pollutants.", "Production s ector ( u pstream). Production operations include the wells and all related processes used in the extraction, production, recovery, lifting, stabilization, separation, and treating of oil and/or natural gas. Production operations span the initial well drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and well completion activities and include not only the \"pads\" where the wells are located but also the sites where oil, condensate, produced water, and gas from several wells may be separated, stored, and treated as well as the gathering pipelines, compressors, and related components that collect and transport the oil, gas, and other materials from the wells to the refineries or natural gas processing plants. Emissions of fugitive gas can be released both intentionally and unintentionally from many of these activities and pieces of equipment. Since production operations occur upstream from gas processing, any fugitive release of gas may include quantities of VOCs, H 2 S, HAPs, and other pollutants at concentrations found within the reservoirs. Further, as some of these operations involve the initial removal of wastes and byproducts from the natural gas stream, the types and quantities of emissions may be dependent upon how the wastes are managed (e.g., venting, flaring, separation, and storage). Historically, the greatest concern over air emissions from the production sector has focused on leaks from equipment and pipelines as well as combustion exhaust from compressor stations. Recently, however, concern has incorporated other activities such as drilling, hydraulic fracturing, well completions, and workovers. Processing s ector ( m idstream). Processing operations are used to separate out the byproducts and wastes from raw natural gas in order to produce \"pipeline quality\" or \"dry\" natural gas for consumption. Due to the many and varied activities involved in these operations, natural gas processing plants have the potential to release significant quantities of air pollutants. These emissions result from the combustion of natural gas and other fossil fuels in compression engines as well as from the fugitive release of VOCs, SO 2 , and HAPs from separators, dehydrators, and sweetening units used to extract byproducts and wastes from the natural gas stream. Transmission, s torage, and d istribution s ectors ( d o wnstream). After processing, dry natural gas enters pipelines in the transmission, storage, and distribution sectors for delivery to utilities and consumers. Nationwide, natural gas systems consist of thousands of miles of pipe, including both mains and customer service lines, as well as compressors, storage facilities, and metering stations, which allow companies to both move and monitor the natural gas in the system. Due to the extensive network of pipelines, valves, pumps, and other components within the transmission, storage, and distribution sectors, fugitive releases of gas collectively can be a significant source of emissions. However, because these activities generally occur after processing, VOC, H 2 S, and HAP content can be minimal, with methane remaining the primary component."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pollutants", "paragraphs": ["Air pollutants associated with natural gas systems include, most prominently, methane and VOCs\u2014of which the crude oil and natural gas sector is one of the highest-emitting industrial sectors in the United States\u2014as well as NO x , SO 2 , and various forms of HAPs.", "Methane. Methane\u2014the principal component of natural gas\u2014is both a precursor to ground-level ozone formation (i.e., \"smog\") and a potent GHG, albeit with a shorter climate-affecting time horizon than CO 2 . Every process in natural gas systems has the potential to emit methane. EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-201 6 (released April 12, 2018) estimates 2016 methane emissions from \"Natural Gas Systems\" (i.e., the natural gas supply chain) to be 6,541 gigagrams (Gg) (equivalent to 339.6 billion standard cubic feet [bscf], or 1.2% of the industry's marketed production that year). In 2016, natural gas systems represented nearly 25% of the total methane emissions from all domestic sources and accounted for approximately 2.5% of all GHG emissions in the United States. Natural gas systems are currently the second-largest contributor to U.S. anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) methane emissions. Because of methane's effects on climate, EPA has found that it, along with five other well-mixed GHGs, endangers public health and welfare within the meaning of the CAA. VOC s \u2014 a g round- l evel o zone p recursor. The crude oil and natural gas sector is currently one of the largest sources of VOC emissions in the United States, accounting for approximately 20% of man-made VOC emissions nationwide (and representing almost 40% of VOC emissions released by stationary source categories). VOCs\u2014in the form of various hydrocarbons\u2014are emitted throughout a wide range of natural gas operations and equipment. The interaction among VOCs, NO x , and sunlight in the atmosphere contributes to the formation of ozone (i.e., smog). Ozone exposure is linked to several respiratory ailments. NO x \u2014 a ground-l evel p recursor. Significant amounts of NO x are emitted at natural gas sites through the combustion of natural gas and other fossil fuels (e.g., diesel). This combustion occurs during several activities, including (1) the flaring of natural gas during drilling and well completions, (2) the combustion of natural gas to drive the compressors that move the product through the system, and (3) the combustion of fuels in engines, drills, heaters, boilers, and other production, construction, and transportation equipment. In addition to its contribution to ozone formation, NO x exposure is linked to several other respiratory ailments. SO 2 is emitted from crude oil and natural gas production and processing operations that handle and treat sulfur-rich, or \"sour,\" gas. SO 2 exposure is linked to several respiratory ailments. Hazardous Air Pollutants ( HAP s ). HAPs, also known as air toxics, are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive diseases, or birth defects. Of the HAPs emitted from natural gas systems, VOCs are the largest group and typically evaporate easily into the air. The most common HAPs in natural gas systems are n-hexane and the BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes). Further, some natural gas reservoirs may contain high levels of H 2 S. HAPs are found primarily in natural gas itself and are emitted from equipment leaks and from various processing, compressing, transmission, distribution, or storage operations.

It is released every three years and is based primarily upon data provided by state, local, and tribal air agencies for sources in their jurisdictions and supplemented by data developed by EPA.

Research (from academia and state-level environmental agencies) attributes the rise in industry-related VOC emissions primarily to increased traffic, combustion exhaust, and local emissions from oil and gas development activities. However, others note that the presence of VOCs in the atmosphere is only one of the many factors that contribute to ground-level ozone formation. Several other surveys of air quality in these regions have shown increases in ozone values due to effects such as stratospheric ozone intrusions as well as drops in ozone values due to mitigating circumstances such as reductions in NO x concentrations and changes in weather patterns (e.g., the Fort Worth and Uinta Basins). Several local, state, and national health agencies have expressed concerns about the health impacts of HAPs and other emissions from natural gas facilities, including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), the New York State Department of Health, and the Colorado School of Public Health, among others. These investigations were spurred by community health complaints in regard to natural gas operations such as strong odors, dizziness, nausea, respiratory problems, and eye and skin irritation, and more severe concerns including cancer. Some of the reports identified, on average, slightly elevated cancer risks at some sites. Most recommended further investigation into HAP emissions and risks at all sites. Finally, a variety of studies have examined the impacts\u2014both positive and negative\u2014of GHG emissions from natural gas systems. Many observe that the combustion of natural gas is less carbon-intensive than other fossil fuels (i.e., on a per-unit-of-energy basis) and claim that fuel switches to natural gas would benefit the climate by reducing overall CO 2 emissions. Other studies, however, focus on the potential impacts of fugitive methane releases.

Due to this unique linkage, pollution abatement has the potential to translate into economic benefits for the industry, as producers may be able to offset some compliance costs with the value of natural gas products recovered and sold. To capitalize on these incentives, many recovery technologies have been incorporated into industry practices. Whether product recovery is profitable for producers may depend upon a number of factors, including the nature and extent of the release, the technology available for capture, and the market price for the recovered products. Because these factors vary significantly over time and place, incentives to control for emissions based solely on market forces have been inconsistent.", "Both EPA and BLM considered the costs and the benefits of their respective rulemakings on the crude oil and natural gas sector. These considerations were conducted as required by statute (e.g., CAA, MLA) and by executive orders and guidance (e.g., Executive Order 12866, \"Regulatory Planning and Review\"; Executive Order 13563, \"Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review\"; and Circular A-4 from the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]). Neither the CAA nor the MLA requires that the regulatory agency set the level of control based on a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). However, executive orders require developing and considering CBA, as well as producing a RIA and other administrative addenda. Specifically, the executive orders encourage agencies to \"propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs.\" As such, to the extent allowed by law, the agencies have generally sought options that yield only net benefits (i.e., that are worth more to society than they cost).", "In their respective analyses, the agencies calculated regulatory compliance costs for the affected industry to include initial capital costs and annualized engineering costs. These calculations incorporated estimates for new technology investment, increased monitoring and reporting requirements, and the adoption of additional management or workplace practices. Costs were then adjusted for the estimated revenues generated from the recovered natural gas and other products that would otherwise have been vented or flared. ", "The agencies calculated regulatory benefits in both monetized and nonmonetized terms. Monetized benefits included those from reductions in methane emissions, which were valued using the social cost of methane (SC-CH 4 ). Nonmonetized benefits included estimates for improvements in ambient air quality and reductions in negative health effects associated with exposure to hazardous air pollutants, ozone, and particulate matter, which the agencies determined could not be adequately monetized with the data currently available. In addition to these health improvements, nonmonetized benefits included improvements in visibility, ecosystem effects, and additional natural gas recovery.

At the time, EPA reported the potential environmental benefits of the 2012 standards as follows: VOC reductions of 190,000 tons annually, air toxics reductions of 12,000 tons annually, and methane reductions of 1.0 million tons annually. The agency estimated that the equipment and the activities required to comply with the 2012 standards would cost producers about $170 million per year but that incorporating the sale of recovered products into the cost would result in an estimated net gain of about $11 million to $19 million per year. The industry disagreed with these estimates and countered with compliance costs at more than $2.5 billion annually. Third parties, such as Bloomberg Government, projected a net cost between $316 million and $511 million.

The agency estimated that the total annualized engineering costs of the 2016 NSPS would be $530 million in 2025 (2012 dollars), but it calculated that incorporating the sale of recovered products into the cost would recover approximately $30 million of this total. Using SC-CH 4 metrics, the rule was estimated to yield climate benefits of $690 million in 2025. Industry sources contend that EPA exaggerated the benefits of the 2016 rule, stating that rather than net benefits of more than $100 million, net costs could be $150 million in 2020 and $290 million to $400 million in 2025. Third parties, such as researchers at Stanford University, estimated that the 2016 standards would cost about a third less than what the agency reports but may not lead to the expected emissions reductions.", "BLM estimated that the 2016 waste prevention rule would avoid 175,000-180,000 tons of methane emissions per year and yield total benefits from $209 million to $403 million per year, outweighing the costs of $110 million to $275 million per year. BLM estimated annual royalties to the federal government, tribal governments, states, and private landowners to increase by $3 million to $10 million per year.

They argue that natural gas is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, with fewer emissions of CO 2 , NO x , SO 2 , PM, and mercury than other fossil fuels (e.g., coal and oil) on a per-unit-of-energy basis. For these reasons, many have looked to natural gas as a \"bridge\" fuel to a less polluting and lower GHG-intensive economy. However, the recent expansion in natural gas production in the United States has given rise to a new set of concerns regarding human health and environmental impacts, including impacts on air quality.

Further to this, organizations such as the State Review of Oil and Natural Gas Environment Regulations (STRONGER) are available to help states assess the overall framework of environmental regulations supporting oil and gas operations in their regions.

Additionally, BLM has promulgated rules to reduce potential waste of public resources and loss of royalty revenue. The federal standards focus primarily on the production and processing sectors of the industry and were drawn, in part, from existing requirements found in the codes of states such as Colorado and Wyoming. These federal standards are currently under reconsideration by the Trump Administration. BLM rescinded many of the novel requirements of its rule on September 28, 2018.", "Further, many producers in the crude oil and natural gas sector have set forth a series of recommended practices. These practices are sustained by the economic incentives provided by capturing the fugitive releases of natural gas and its byproducts to be sold at market. Several voluntary partnerships sponsored by various federal and international agencies also serve to facilitate recommended practices for emissions reductions in the oil and gas industry. EPA's Natural Gas STAR Program, the Global Methane Initiative (formerly the Methane to Markets Partnership), and the World Bank Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership are three such programs. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposed eliminating the Natural Gas STAR Program and the Global Methane Initiative \"as part of the Administration's commitment to return EPA to its core work.\"", "Debate continues over the regulation of methane, VOC, SO 2 , and HAP emissions from the crude oil and natural gas sector. Information and technology are rapidly evolving. Conflicts between federal and state governments remain, and the argument that environmental regulations hinder economic growth continues to be made. Complicating this debate is the fact that a comprehensive national inventory of fugitive emissions from natural gas systems does not exist due to many factors, including costs and technical uncertainties. For these reasons, the choice of policy that returns the most efficient, flexible, cost-effective, and environmentally sound emissions controls on the sector has remained an open question.
