Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), an important focus of U.S. global health assistance, may come under scrutiny as the 112th Congress debates spending levels for ongoing global health programs. NTDs are a group of 17 diseases that are found primarily among the poorest people in 149 countries and territories. Estimates indicate that some 2 billion people are at risk of contracting an NTD, of whom more than 1 billion people are afflicted with one or more. Roughly 534,000 people are believed to be killed by an NTD annually.", "Although these diseases are concentrated among the world's poor, population shifts and climate change increase the vulnerability of the United States to some of these diseases, particularly Chagas disease and dengue. While blood centers test for Chagas, some health experts believe that several cases remain undiagnosed in the United States and that Chagas stands as an undetected cause of heart disease and stroke. Some observers are concerned about scientists' expectations that mosquitoes capable of spreading dengue fever are gradually spreading across the United States, particularly because no vaccine or treatment exists for this disease. In addition, travelers from industrialized countries are increasingly contracting NTDs such as schistosomiasis while engaged in tourism. These cases are usually identified once tourists develop severe, acute infection or other unusual problems.", "Proponents support funding research on and treatment for NTDs because it is a cost-effective way of making a significant health impact. Roughly 90% of all NTDs are easy to treat with drugs that cost less than $2 per dose and need to be taken only once or twice annually. This means that all people at risk of contracting an NTD worldwide can be treated for less than $2 billion over the next five years. With consistent treatment and control, several NTDs are being eliminated in various parts of the world, especially in Latin America, and guinea worm disease is on the cusp of eradication, meaning there is no risk of contracting the disease.", "Some groups argue that the United States should increase funding for NTD programs to improve global health and advance domestic capacity to detect NTD cases that may arise, particularly for diseases like dengue and Chagas. Other groups maintain that countries like Brazil, China, and India that have received support for eliminating NTDs should play a greater role in addressing the health challenge, particularly as their own economies exhibit strong growth. The 112th Congress may debate funding much of the President's FY2011 budget, which includes $155 million for the NTD Program, as well as upcoming FY2012 budget levels. The 112th Congress will likely weigh calls for greater spending on NTDs with other challenges, such as streamlining foreign and global health assistance to make them more effective and efficient, particularly in light of efforts to reduce federal spending.

", "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have become an important part of U.S. global health assistance, particularly since 2006, when Congress made available $15 million to combat such diseases and President George W. Bush launched the NTD Program. NTDs comprise a group of 17 diseases found mostly among the poorest in 149 countries and territories, primarily in areas with unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and limited health services. (See Appendix C for a description of NTDs, including their symptoms and prevalence; Appendix D displays their images). The list is not exhaustive of all illnesses found among this population, but it accounts for those being targeted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners. ", "Some diseases are transmitted by people; others are spread by vectors like snails, flies, or mosquitoes; and several others are found in contaminated sources (like infested soil or water). At the same time that NTDs afflict primarily the impoverished, some studies indicate that NTDs exacerbate poverty. People crippled by lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), for example, often cease to be employable or capable of engaging in income-producing activities. Children afflicted with soil-transmitted helminths (STH) have reduced cognitive functions, poorer health and nutrition, and lower school attendance rates. All of these factors reduce lifetime earning potential. ", "In 2003, WHO convened a meeting to discuss challenges in addressing a host of tropical diseases that were widely viewed to be receiving inadequate attention and worsening poverty. Though efforts to address these diseases preceded the meeting, up until that point, national governments and global health groups had focused on each of the diseases separately. Following the meeting, WHO and other health experts dubbed a group of 17 infections \"neglected tropical diseases\" because data showed that people tended to be infected with more than one of these maladies at once. At least 100 countries face two endemic NTD disease burdens, for example, and 30 countries carry six or more NTD endemic disease burdens ( Figure 1 ). ", "Though NTDs are a group of distinct diseases, they share three key characteristics. Specifically, NTDs", "are long-standing health problems that have afflicted human beings for centuries, have virtually disappeared in industrialized countries, and have continued to primarily affect the world's poorest populations; cause chronic conditions that have relatively low mortality rates but may bring long-lasting deformities, which are irreversible in some cases, and impair health, quality of life, and earning potential; and could benefit from greater research and development (R&D). Additional research could identify second-line treatments that could be used should the diseases become resistant against drugs. R&D could also identify treatments for incurable ailments like dengue fever and buruli ulcer. For other NTDs like sleeping sickness, innovative research could be used to develop medicines that could supplant commonly used drugs that are toxic, have complex treatment regimens, and carry significant side effects (including death). For all of the NTDs, R&D could be used to identify a vaccine and develop improved diagnostic tools that could be easily used in low-resource settings.", "Health experts reconvened in 2005 and developed a framework for implementing an integrative approach to controlling NTDs, which focused on three key strategies:", "Preventive Chemotherapy through mass drug administration (MDA)\u2014administering treatments to an affected population irrespective of individual disease status.

Uncertainty regarding the number of people suffering from NTDs is rooted in several issues. The majority of people living with NTDs live in marginalized communities that lack sufficient health care, possibly obscuring a diagnosis. The full extent of the global NTD burden may also be hidden behind the symptoms that NTDs cause. Schistosomiasis, for example, can cause anemia and bladder cancer. Additionally, weak health systems may fail to document the true burden of NTDs. One study estimates that one NTD case is reported for every 40 occurrences. ", "In addition, health information systems in many developing countries are in poor condition and are not equipped to provide precise data on disease prevalence. As such, disease assessments in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are often based on projections extrapolated from household surveys rather than medical records establishing a diagnosis. Disease prevalence mapping for NTDs has reportedly been improving, however, as the international community boosts investments in addressing NTDs. According to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), by the end of 2009, the NTD burden of the seven most common NTDs had been identified in most districts throughout the countries supported by the United States ( Figure 2 ).", "Of the 14 most common NTDs, roughly 80% are caused by STH\u2014a group of three parasitic worms (roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms) that are contracted through contact with tainted soil or ingestion of eggs found on produce grown in tainted soil ( Figure 3 ). More than 1 billion people are afflicted with STH worldwide, of whom children are the most vulnerable and tend to carry more than one type of worm at a time.", "NTDs independently cause high levels of illness and worsen the health of those plagued with other diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB).

Through ratification of several World Health Assembly resolutions through WHO and implementation of numerous public-private partnerships, the international community has agreed to prioritize combating, eliminating, and eradicating NTDs. Well over 100 groups are engaged in fighting NTDs, including academia, the private sector, global development and health organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), foundations, and national governments ( Table 2 ). Some initiatives focus on one NTD, while others tackle a group of NTDs ( Appendix F ). ", "Among the 17 NTDs, 7 account for roughly 90% of the global NTD burden. These are the three soil-transmitted helminthes, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filiariasis, trachoma, and onchocerciasis. Drugs used to treat these seven diseases are donated by pharmaceutical companies or sold at subsidized prices ranging between $0.02 and $1.02, and are taken once or twice annually (depending on the concentration of the disease). At such prices, some 500 million people can be treated for these seven afflictions at roughly $400 million annually. When correctly used, these drugs can be used to control and, in some cases, eliminate some of the NTDs. ", "Historically, countries attempted to address each of these diseases in distinct programs. Within the past decade, WHO and other health experts found that national responses to these seven diseases could be integrated to improve the efficacy and reduce costs. Specifically, health experts found that", "medicines used to treat each of the seven NTDs could be safely administered to people co-infected with other NTDs (in most cases); one drug could treat more than one disease; individual diagnosis would not be necessary and entire communities could be safely treated, usually once per year, irrespective of each person's disease status; non-health workers, including teachers and community volunteers, could dispense the treatments in non-clinical settings (like schools) rather than in health facilities (which are often poorly resourced and in limited supply in remote areas); and the integration of drug delivery enabled resources to be pooled.", "By integrating drug delivery for these seven diseases, countries and their partners have reduced some of the costs related to treating the diseases separately. After integrating mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns, USAID documented cost-efficiencies up to 41% and a 30% reduction in training costs. USAID attributed these savings to streamlining program management, social mobilization, drug supply chains, and trainings. ", "The remaining 10 NTDs must be treated individually and can be more difficult and costly to manage. No cures exist for some of the NTDs in this group and for others available treatments can carry significant side effects. Additionally, access to diagnostic tools for some of these diseases may be limited, and treatment tends to be more costly because the medicines often need to be administered by trained health practitioners in health settings for prolonged periods. For some of these diseases, namely Chagas disease, dengue, human African trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis, early detection and treatment are vital to avoid irreversible disability or death."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Global NTD Plan", "paragraphs": ["The global response to NTDs comprises complex mechanisms.

By 2009, only 3,190 cases were reported, and as of September 2010, WHO counted 1,613 cases ( Figure 4 ). Today, guinea worm disease is endemic in only four countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, and Sudan (accounting for about 90% of all cases). Prolonged conflict in Sudan has slowed efforts to eradicate guinea worm disease, though health experts remain optimistic about prospects that the illness could be the first infectious diseases to be eradicated since smallpox in 1979.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), for example, reports that lymphatic filiariasis is no longer transmitted in three of seven Latin American countries where the disease was endemic. Likewise, aggressive MDA campaigns have interrupted the transmission of onchocerciasis (river blindness) in one-third of areas where the disease was endemic and eliminated the disease from Colombia.

The use of this term has helped to raise awareness about these long-standing health challenges, but it risks simplifying a complicated health challenge. Since all of these diseases are mostly rooted in poverty and the poor infrastructure that is usually found in destitute areas, the enduring solution to these illnesses is economic development. Industrialized countries, including the United States, have eliminated these diseases in their territories by combining drug treatment with the construction and use of latrines, modernization of agricultural practices, and utilization of improved water systems. Certainly, increased investments in NTD treatments have ameliorated the suffering of millions. More than 80% of NTDs, however, cannot be eliminated by drug delivery alone.

In contrast, the annual cost of first-line antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa averages about $95 per capita. When antiretroviral treatments become less effective, the second-line treatments are considerably more expensive. These are not equally comparable, however, because HIV is always fatal if not treated, and only some NTDs are lethal when untreated. Also, HIV treatments must be taken daily, while treatments for the seven most common NTDs are usually taken once or twice annually.

There is not yet a consensus on which diseases should be considered NTDs. WHO classifies 17 diseases, excluding HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, as NTDs. Yet some groups consider these three diseases to be neglected as well. With no agreement on which diseases constitute NTDs, investments in and analysis on this topic can be skewed and disjointed. Evaluating reliance on MDA. Although MDA campaigns have reduced disease prevalence and interrupted transmission, several limitations to MDA remain. For example, countries must have plans for continuing treatment after foreign aid ends, mismanagement and wider use of NTD treatments can result in disease resistance, and MDA does not interrupt transmission cycles of all NTDs. Integrating development and health efforts and strengthening health information systems. Depending on how development projects are implemented, they can exacerbate or decrease NTD infection rates. For instance, irrigation schemes could provide breeding grounds for vectors that spread NTDs, new transport infrastructure could facilitate the spread of parasites and vectors, and population resettlement may introduce parasite carriers to new areas. Funding research and development (R&D). Observers debate whether ongoing R&D efforts meet demands for NTD-related vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tools.

Other health experts counter that these issues should not inhibit application of life-saving and health-enhancing measures that have led to the elimination of some NTDs. Additional issues at the heart of this debate include", "the capacity of countries to sustain MDA; the inability of MDA to break the transmission cycle of diseases such as STH; and application of preventive measures and disease surveillance.

Such progress, however, can be compromised if there is no effective long-term plan in place, particularly for NTDs like schistosomiasis and STH, which dwell in water and soil and have complicated life cycles that cannot be interrupted with MDA alone. In such cases, MDA campaigns must be sustained until the parasites are eliminated from the water or soil. At present, the U.S. NTD Program does not support vector management or other strategies that would interrupt the transmission of these diseases (such as latrine construction and improved water supply).", "In Mali, for example, WHO and its partners launched a 10-year MDA campaign, which significantly reduced the prevalence of schistosomiasis. In 1992, the Malian government assumed full financial control of the program. The government was not able, however, to consistently procure drugs, maintain drug delivery, or reduce exposure of people to contaminated water. Evaluators felt the treatment campaign that focused exclusively on schistosomiasis burdened the health system and diverted resources from routine health care. After a decade of inconsistent MDA, prevalence rates had rebounded and reflected those seen before the campaign was initiated. In 2004, donors returned and supported the launch of another MDA campaign. This time, however, Mali and its partners launched an integrated treatment campaign that focused on more than one NTD and consolidated health management resources (see \" Control and Treatment Strategies \").", "In addition to raising questions about the sustainability of some MDA programs, the Mali case also raises a long-standing debate about the extent to which donors should invest directly in health systems. Some development organizations encourage the United States and other donors to reduce their reliance on contractors and channel more health assistance through local governments and organizations. One official from the Ugandan Ministry of Health urges USAID to fully fund its NTD Program through the national health ministry rather than RTI International (an organization contracted to administer the U.S. NTD Program). He is concerned that the ministry will not have the capacity to sustain the program once the financial support ceases since Ugandan stakeholders are not included in all aspects of project management and coordination. ", "One study evaluating the first three years of the U.S. NTD Program, written in part by USAID officials, appears to contradict the assertion of the Ugandan official, indicating health system strengthening is an integral part of U.S. support. Specifically, the article highlights how resources provided through the NTD program were used to train more than 220,000 people, primarily community-based health workers and drug distributors, during the first three years of the program. The authors assert, \"[t]raining is designed to empower these communities to treat NTDs within their own populations.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capacity to Sustain MDA: Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Several actions by the Obama Administration indicate an effort to enhance country ownership of global health programs. For example, country ownership has been highlighted as a key goal of the Global Health Initiative, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah has made public statements endorsing country ownership, and the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) advocates applying a \"Partnership Framework\" to HIV/AIDS programs funded through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The Partnership Framework outlines the role of the United States and recipient governments and describes how country ownership will ultimately assume full control of the programs. In Nigeria, for example, the government commits to funding half of the PEPFAR program by 2015. According to one USAID official, key components of the NTD Program are to measure and document recipient country contributions to NTD responses; develop clear funding plans that outline the role of the donors and recipient country; and require commitments from participating countries to sustain and/or expand national financing of NTD control, including ensuring duty-free import of NTD drugs and dedicating at least one staff person to manage the NTD programs. ", "Although USAID reportedly requires NTD focus countries to demonstrate political commitment to sustaining NTD plans, Congress might encourage or require the President to apply the Partnership Framework or similar approaches more broadly across all U.S. global health programs, including those aimed at NTDs and implemented in non-GHI or -NTD focus countries. Though it is too early to evaluate the Partnership Framework, the plan appears to include some of the processes that the Mali NTD program lacked: a clear strategy for preparing countries to assume full ownership of health projects, an outline of roles and responsibilities, alignment with national health plans, and investment in the national health system. ", "Several health and development experts argue that health systems of recipient countries must be strengthened if NTD programs supported by donors are to be sustained. One consortium of aid organizations recommends that donors allocate 15% of their budgets aimed at specific diseases to health system strengthening. Should the 112 th Congress support this idea, it could encourage or require that a portion of funds for the NTD Program (or other U.S. health programs like PEPFAR) be used on health system strengthening. The 112 th Congress might also consider legislation similar to the Global HEALTH Act ( H.R. 4933 ), which was introduced in the 111 th Congress. The bill called for addressing some of the issues related to broad-based health training, and directed the President to develop a five-year global health strategy that emphasizes country ownership, integrated and coordinated U.S. global health assistance, and funding based on performance. ", "Other groups argue that concerns about the capacity of recipient countries to sustain NTD programs are unfounded for several reasons. First, donors are supporting plans developed largely by endemic countries. As such, countries receiving support have already prioritized and allocated some of their own resources to combating the diseases. Second, NTD treatment programs aimed at the seven most common NTDs pose little burden to health systems, as they can be administered by non-health workers (like teachers) outside of clinical settings. This community-based approach, some argue, bolsters weak health systems because it reaches people living in remote areas that usually have little access to health services, and increases demand for health services and awareness of health conditions in marginalized regions. Finally, budgets for treating the seven most common NTDs can be decreased as the diseases are eliminated. MDA cannot be independently applied to eliminate STH, however, which accounts for 80% of the NTD disease burden.

Strategies used to alleviate poverty can also help to prevent, eliminate, or eradicate these diseases. For example, development activities related to agricultural irrigation, dam construction, and forest clearance can facilitate the interruption of disease transmission. At the same time, if such projects are implemented without identifying disease prevalence through health impact assessments and integrating certain health measures, they can offer breeding grounds to several disease-carrying vectors, such as mosquitoes, and accelerate disease transmission. Examples abound of development projects facilitating the spread of vector-born diseases. In Tanzania, for example, abandoned and poorly maintained sanitation projects have been identified as breeding grounds for mosquitoes carrying malaria or lymphatic filariasis. Dam projects have led to the increase or introduction of schistosomiasis in Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Namibia, Senegal, and Sudan. ", "Development experts need access to reliable data, however, to know where these diseases exist. Available data in most poor countries, however, are often outdated and based on small household surveys (see \" Prevalence \"). If managers of large-scale development programs worked with health practitioners to ensure that disease prevalence surveys are conducted, then the inadvertent spread of disease during development projects could be avoided. At the same time, health practitioners could gain a better understanding of disease prevalence, which could help in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of health initiatives. ", "The process of combating diseases through an approach that combines responses by practitioners across sectors, particularly those related to health, agriculture, water, construction, and waste disposal, is known as integrated vector management (IVM). WHO calls for an intersectoral approach to controlling NTDs that is based on five areas: MDA; intensified case-management; vector control; safe water, sanitation, and hygiene; and veterinary public health (that is, applying veterinary sciences to ensure the health and well-being of humans). Most countries, including the United States, that have successfully eliminated NTDs have utilized an IVM approach, particularly in the areas of water and sanitation. Experts at the CDC assert that water and sanitation improvement should be a central component of any effective and sustainable approach to controlling NTDs. One estimate indicates that improved sanitation and water safety can reduce the prevalence rates of schistosomiasis by 75% and blinding trachoma by 25%. Water and sanitation improvement are particularly important when addressing pathogens that cannot be eliminated by drugs alone, such as STH and schistosomiasis.

China is reportedly modeling the program after its own schistosomiasis control methods, which have led to interrupted transmission cycles in several regions across the country.

USAID found, however, that countries did not always use prevalence data to estimate drug quantities or follow WHO treatment guidelines. This led to inefficiencies, including drug overstocks in some areas and shortages in others. In the third year, USAID developed a new procurement system that improved drug management and forecasting processes. After improving the drug management system, USAID found that fewer drugs needed to be procured.

Proponents assert the community networks that provide NTD drugs could also distribute insecticide-treated bednets and treatments against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Conversely, bednets used in malaria programs could also help to prevent people from contracting lymphatic filariasis.

The act authorized the President to develop an integrated strategy for improving water and sanitation worldwide. According to a 2010 report to Congress, the Administration has developed strategies for 34 countries, which include all NTD focus countries. The United States might also consider sharing resources provided through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) for water and sanitation programs. Although MCC water programs tend to emphasize reducing diarrheal-related deaths, populations suffering from diarrhea are often afflicted with other water-borne diseases like schistosomiasis (though the diseases may not be detected).

While acknowledging duplication in some areas of U.S. health aid, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton contended GHI aims to address this challenge. Nonetheless, with little available documentation on GHI, not much is known on the extent to which the initiative is curbing such practices. USAID also maintained these criticisms do not apply to U.S.-supported NTD programs because they support national NTD plans. Where possible, ambassadors in recipient countries could ensure that USG agencies implementing health and development projects operate from joint working agreements and align their activities (including training, reporting, funding, and target populations), especially in non-GHI focus countries.

The existence, efficacy, and availability of tools to diagnose, cure, and control each disease vary. Progress in controlling, eliminating, and eradicating NTDs also varies among the geographical locations. The seven most common NTDs that account for 90% of all NTD cases can be treated with relatively inexpensive drugs that are effective in low-resource settings. Through massive treatment programs, two of these seven diseases, onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, have been nearly eliminated in some settings. People living in areas endemic with two other NTDs (schistosomiasis and STH) that account for 80% of all NTD cases, however, must be treated indefinitely if other public health measures are not taken (e.g., building and using latrines and ensuring proper use of purified water). Other NTDs, like dengue and buruli ulcer, have no known cure. Another NTD, human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), is always fatal if not treated; another, leishmaniasis, is treated with drugs that are extremely toxic and difficult to administer. To address these challenges, several health advocates call for greater investments in R&D in four key areas: ", "Drug and vaccine development \u2014While donor funding has led to an unprecedented capacity to treat NTDs, some analysts are concerned about drug resistance and urge prudence in drug administration, particularly for diseases that cannot be eliminated through MDA. Others argue that these concerns should not hinder the provision of drugs that alleviate human suffering and save lives. Several experts also call for researchers to develop vaccines that can prevent people from contracting NTDs and to create innovative treatments for diseases with no cure, or for which available drugs are toxic or carry complicated regimens (both in terms of the complexity of administering the medicine and the duration of treatment). Vector Control\u2014 For most NTDs, there are no vaccines to prevent infection and MDA programs cannot independently eradicate the pathogen. In such circumstances, vector control often plays a vital role. However, several peer-reviewed articles highlight challenges related to vector control, including growing pesticide resistance caused in part by improper application or overuse. Diagnostic Tools\u2014 Disease monitoring and surveillance are critical for detecting drug resistance and treatment-related complications, identifying interruptions in disease transmission, determining when MDA can be ceased, and identifying disease resurgence (especially after a disease has been eliminated). However, available diagnostic tools may not be useful in low-resource settings that lack sufficient quantities of laboratory equipment and trained health practitioners. As such, some epidemiologists are concerned that poorer countries may not be able to assume full control of disease surveillance tasks. Operational Research \u2014Some health experts encourage further consideration of factors that might affect drug efficacy or safety, such as co-application of traditional remedies and treatments for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Some evidence indicates, for example, that the vaccine against TB is less effective among people infected with schistosomiasis. More research could also be useful to study the impact of NTD treatments on those infected with other NTDs. Researchers found, for example, that people co-infected with onchocerciasis and loaisis should not be treated with a drug (ivermectin) commonly used to cure onchocerciasis, as they could experience serious side effects or death. Observers also call greater attention to factors related to NTDs that are more complicated to treat, such as maintaining drug efficacy without refrigeration. These issues buttress calls for bolstering research and development in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. ", "The weak medicine regulatory authorities (MRAs) in several developing countries also warrant consideration. In order to ensure the safety and efficacy of a proposed drug, MRAs need access to fully functioning laboratories and well-trained technicians capable of testing samples and determining whether medicines meet quality criteria. In a 2007 WHO study, almost all high-income countries reported having a quality management system in place to monitor adverse drug reactions (ADRs), while only 50% of low-income countries reportedly evaluated medicines to detect ADRs. Without the resources to evaluate properly the safety, efficacy, and quality of new medicines, one team of experts found that MRAs in most low-income countries, particularly in Africa, rely heavily on MRAs in high-income countries. For NTD treatments, however, regulatory authorities in high-income countries may not have sufficient safety and efficacy data on which to conduct comprehensive risk-benefit assessments when approving drugs intended for poorer countries and may not consider complications that are pervasive in poorer areas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding Research and Development: Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["According to a study conducted by the George Institute for International Health, the United States is the world's largest funder of research and development for the treatment and control of NTDs ( Table 5 ).

If contributions by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are added, total U.S. support for R&D for NTDs accounted for 62% of all spending and 71% of outlays by the top 12 donors. Nonetheless, NTD activists call for greater investments in NTD research, particularly since HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria accounted for 72% of these funds in 2008 ( Table 6 ).

The Neglected Disease Review Group is expected to submit a report to Congress that includes recommendations on how FDA should address NTDs.

Despite these actions, relatively few innovative NTD products have been developed. One study indicated that between 1983 and 2008, the FDA approved 325 orphan drug products, two of which were for NTDs. One expert at the Center for Global Development contended that all of the NTD products that were developed \"had limited or no value because their formulation and pricing were inappropriate for developing country settings.\" Some health analysts have contended that major pharmaceutical companies have produced a limited number of NTD products because the low profit margins (if any) of NTD products leave little incentive to invest in R&D.

This partnership seeks to raise the profile of NTDs as a global health issue through advocacy, resource mobilization and global coordination efforts. Communicating success stories is an important component of the Network's work, through sharing personal stories, highlighting disease-specific achievements, and communicating progress in the field. ", "International Vaccine Institute", "The International Vaccine Initiative (IVI) is an international center of research, training, and technical assistance that aims to develop vaccines against diseases that plague developing countries. As of October 2010, 33 countries became signatories and an additional 16 countries were party to the initiative. The United States is not a signatory or party to the South Korean-based initiative, though WRAIR and CDC partners with IVI in various capacities (e.g., researching a vaccine against dengue) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation serves as a key donor. IVI scientists have developed a vaccine against cholera and an IVI-developed vaccine against typhoid fever was 80% effective during a phase 4 trial.", "Infectious Diseases Research Institute", "The Infectious Diseases Research Institute (IDRI) is a\u00a0Seattle-based non-profit\u00a0research center aimed at applying innovative science to the research and development of products to prevent, detect and treat infectious diseases of poverty.\u00a0IDRI is currently researching treatments against leishmaniasis, TB, malaria, leprosy, and Chagas.", "Institute for One World Health", "The Institute for One World Health is a non-profit organization aimed at developing safe, effective, and affordable new medicines to treat infectious diseases that are commonly found in poorer countries. The institute is currently focusing on developing new treatments against leishmaniasis, diarrheal diseases, malaria, Chagas, and soil-transmitted diseases.", "Pharmaceutical Industry", "Primarily through large donations of NTD treatments for little or no cost, the pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in global NTD initiatives. Key pharmaceutical companies include Bayer HealthCare, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, MedPharm, Merck Inc., Merck KGaA, Novartis, Pfizer, and Sanofi-aventis. One example of the pharmaceutical industry's central role to the global response to NTDs is Merck's Mectizan Donation Program. Launched in 1987, the effort stands as the longest-running disease-specific drug donation program. Merck initiated the initiative with large quantities of free Mectizan to treat onchocerciasis and expanded the program in 1998 to target lymphatic filariasis. In a 2008 report, Merck indicated that it had donated more than 2.5 billion tablets of Mectizan that were used to treat 80 million people in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.

The program is executed by WHO and co-sponsored by UNDP, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank. TDR anticipates facilitating the elimination of four NTDS globally: Chagas disease, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, and onchocerciasis. It also aims to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in Latin America. According to the TDR Business Plan for 2008-2013, none of the targeted diseases can be eradicated with current tools and investments, though regional elimination can be achieved. Donor contributions to TDR have increased over the past decade from $57 million in the 2000-2001 budget period to $77.5 million between 2008 and 2009. The United States is a key donor to TDR, though U.S. contributions have declined over the past decade. During 2000-2001, the U.S. contributed $9.2 million, or 16% of total contributions. Between 2008 and 2009 U.S. contributions totaled $4.8 million, amounting to roughly 6% of all contributions."], "subsections": []}]}}
