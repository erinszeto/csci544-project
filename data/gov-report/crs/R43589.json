Others point out, however, that governments have a responsibility to protect the privacy of personal information in their custody. A principal concern is that once personal information is shared with a foreign government, that private data could move easily and without adequate oversight.", "Also at issue is whether visa security procedures should be applied more broadly. While some are proposing to make all foreign nationals who seek to come to the United States subject to the scrutiny of the consular screening procedures, others warn that such a move may create unnecessary hurdles and backlogs for many travelers who do not pose a threat. Still others see holes in the current visa issuance process that they argue should be addressed, such as limiting the circumstances under which a personal interview is waived. Congressional oversight of visa security is ongoing, and possible legislative reforms are under consideration.

It expressly increased consular officers' access to electronic information needed for alien screening. Specifically, it required the development of an interoperable electronic data system to be used to share information relevant to alien admissibility and removability and the implementation of an integrated entry-exit data system. It also required that all visas issued by October 2004 have biometric identifiers.

He indicated that officers in Riyadh and Jeddah also provided assistance, expert advice and training to consular officers on fraudulent documents, fingerprinting techniques and identity fraud.
