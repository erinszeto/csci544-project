While no regular appropriations bill was marked up or reported in the Senate, the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Appropriations Interior Subcommittee released a draft bill, together with a draft detailed funding table, on September 25, 2012.

The bill also provides funds for agencies in two other departments\u2014the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture, and the Indian Health Service (IHS) in the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014as well as funds for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Further, the annual bill includes funding for arts and cultural agencies, such as the Smithsonian Institution, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and for numerous other entities and agencies. ", "Prior to FY2006, the appropriations laws for Interior and Related Agencies provided funds for several activities within the Department of Energy (DOE), including research, development, and conservation programs; the Naval Petroleum Reserves; and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. However, at the outset of the 109 th Congress, these DOE programs were transferred to the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees covering energy and water, to consolidate their jurisdiction over DOE. These programs currently are funded in the annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. At the same time, jurisdiction over the EPA and several smaller entities was moved to the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees covering Interior and related agencies, and they are now funded in the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. This change resulted from the abolition of the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies, which previously had jurisdiction over EPA.", "Since FY2006, appropriations laws for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies have contained three primary titles. This report is organized along these lines. The first section (Title I) provides information on Interior agencies; the second section (Title II) discusses EPA; and the third section (Title III) addresses other agencies, programs, and entities. A fourth section of this report discusses selected cross-cutting topics that encompass more than one agency.", "Entries in this report are for major agencies (e.g., the National Park Service) and cross-cutting issues (e.g., Wildland Fire Management) that receive funding in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. For each agency or issue, we discuss some of the key funding changes that appear to be of interest to Congress based on hearings on agency budgets and statements in Appropriations Committee reports, among other sources. We also address related policy issues that occur in the context of considering appropriations legislation. Appropriations are complex, and not all issues are summarized in this report. For example, budget submissions for some agencies number several hundred pages and contain innumerable funding, programmatic, and legislative changes for congressional consideration. Further, appropriations laws provide funds for numerous accounts, activities, and subactivities, and the accompanying explanatory statements provide additional directives and other important information. For information on programs funded in the bill but not directly discussed in this report, please contact the key policy staff members listed at the end of the report. ", "In general, in this report the term appropriations represents total funds available, including regular annual and supplemental appropriations, as well as rescissions, transfers, and deferrals, but excludes mandatory spending authorities. The House Committee on Appropriations is the primary source of the funding figures used throughout the report.

In general, appropriations in these laws are available only for the fiscal year covered by the act, unless otherwise specified. In recent practice, Interior appropriations laws have provided such one-year appropriations for several accounts. For instance, in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ), the appropriation to the National Park Service for its National Recreation and Preservation account was for FY2012 only, as the law did not specify a different period of availability: \"For expenses necessary to carry out recreation programs, natural programs, cultural programs, heritage partnership programs, environmental compliance and review, international park affairs, and grant administration, not otherwise provided for, $59,975,000.\"", "However, many accounts within the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations laws have contained appropriations for longer periods of availability, involving multiple fiscal years. For example, the appropriation in P.L. 112-74 to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement for its Regulation and Technology account was provided for FY2012 and FY2013. The law provided, in part: \"For necessary expenses to carry out the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, Public Law 95\u201387, as amended, $122,950,000, to remain available until September 30, 2013.\" For accounts available for two years, appropriations may be carried over from the first fiscal year to the second, and must be obligated by the end of the second year.", "Many other accounts have contained appropriations that were available for obligation without fiscal year limitation, often referred to as \"no-year appropriations.\" Such appropriations typically were \"to remain available until expended.\" For these accounts, appropriations may be carried over from fiscal year to fiscal year with no deadline for obligation. In P.L. 112-74 , the appropriation to the Fish and Wildlife Service for its Construction account provides an example of no-year appropriations: \"For construction, improvement, acquisition, or removal of buildings and other facilities required in the conservation, management, investigation, protection, and utilization of fish and wildlife resources, and the acquisition of lands and interests therein; $23,088,000, to remain available until expended.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2013", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Budget Control Act4", "paragraphs": ["FY2013 discretionary appropriations were considered in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ), which established discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021.

Because deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by that date, an automatic spending reduction process established by the BCA was triggered; this process consisted of a combination of sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, initially scheduled to begin on January 2, 2013. The \"joint committee\" sequestration process for FY2013 required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding at a percentage to be determined, under terms specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended by the BCA.

First, the date for the joint committee sequester to be implemented was delayed for two months, until March 1, 2013. Second, the dollar amount of the joint committee sequester was reduced by $24 billion. Third, statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 (and FY2014) were lowered.

To address the disbursements of prior collections of fees that had accumulated when the fund was subject to discretionary appropriations, the 2006 amendments authorized a series of mandatory payments to states and tribes from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. In total, these payments are to be equivalent to the balance of prior collections that had not been appropriated as of the beginning of FY2008.

In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that when Congress appropriates contract support costs on a lump sum basis, tribes are entitled to receive the full amount of reasonable and allowable federal funds for their contract support costs. The Supreme Court pointed out that Congress has several options: it could amend ISDEAA to relieve the DOI of the obligation to enter contracts with all qualifying tribes or the obligation to pay full contract support costs; it could appropriate contract support costs on a contractor-by-contractor basis; or it could appropriate enough funds to cover the aggregate amount of contract support costs of all tribes.

The House Appropriations Committee recommended $169.4 million in FY2013 for Superfund enforcement, a decrease of $15.0 million below the President's request of $184.4 million and of $17.3 million below the FY2012 appropriation of $186.7 million.", "Some Members, states, and communities have expressed concerns that budgetary constraints could jeopardize the availability of funding for ongoing remediation at some Superfund sites. The President's FY2013 budget request indicated that reduced funding would be prioritized for on-going remedial projects and that no new remedial projects would be started with federal funds. The increase for remedial projects that the House Appropriations Committee recommended above the President's request would have provided additional resources, although less than enacted for FY2012. EPA also could still begin new remedial projects in FY2013 at sites financed with private settlement funds paid to EPA from the responsible parties, or at sites directly led by the responsible parties with EPA oversight. Approximately 70% of the sites on the NPL are financed by the responsible parties and do not rely upon Superfund appropriations to ensure the performance of the cleanup.", "In addition to specifying funding, the House Appropriations Committee provided direction to EPA regarding particular elements of the Superfund program. Among them, the committee-reported bill would have prohibited EPA from using any funds in the bill to proceed with its development or implementation of financial responsibility requirements for those who may release hazardous substances. In its report, the committee elaborated that no funding would be provided until the agency completed an analysis of the capacity of the financial and credit markets to provide the necessary assurances for industry to demonstrate financial responsibility. Although the lack of these requirements has been a long-standing issue among those concerned about the capability of potentially responsible parties to satisfy their cleanup liability if contamination were to occur, the committee noted its concern that proceeding with new financial responsibility requirements under current economic conditions may impose an undue burden on industry. The committee also directed EPA to submit a report on the \"practical and legal implications\" of re-prioritizing private settlement funds deposited in Superfund Special Accounts, and to continue to report annually on the use of Superfund Alternative Approach agreements under which the responsible parties pay for the cleanup of specific sites.", "Concerns about the financial capability of responsible parties to pay for the cleanup of contamination also have been at the center of the long-standing debate as to whether Superfund taxes on industry should be reinstated to help support the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund. Congress appropriates monies from this trust fund to finance EPA's Superfund program. The President's FY2013 budget request included a proposal to reinstate Superfund taxes beginning in 2013 and ending in 2022. Historically, these taxes provided most of the revenues for the trust fund until the taxing authority expired at the end of 1995. As the remaining revenues were expended over time, Congress increased the portion of revenues from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury to help compensate for the loss in revenues from the expired industry taxes. General revenues now constitute most, but not all, of the revenues for the trust fund. The reinstatement of Superfund taxes would be subject to reauthorizing legislation.", "The adequacy of funding for the cleanup of brownfields that are not addressed under the Superfund program also has been an issue. Brownfields generally are lower risk sites where the known or suspected presence of contamination may present an impediment to economic redevelopment. EPA's Brownfields program awards competitive grants to state and local governmental entities for the assessment and cleanup of individual sites, and formula grants to help states enhance their own cleanup programs. These grants are funded within the STAG account. EPA's expenses to administer the program are funded separately within the EPM account. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a total of $131.2 million within these two accounts for EPA's Brownfields program in FY2013, a decrease below the President's request of $166.5 million and the FY2012 appropriation of $167.8 million, continuing an overall trend downward since FY2009. The committee's proposed decrease for FY2013 is attributed to a reduction for competitive grants of 36% below the President's request and of 37% below the FY2012 appropriation. The committee noted its support for \"the continued work of the Brownfields program, but at a reduced rate.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Title III: Related Agencies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Department of Agriculture: Forest Service151", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service (FS) manages 193 million acres of national forests, national grasslands, and a tallgrass prairie in 44 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; provides technical and financial assistance to states, tribes, and private forest landowners; and conducts research on sustaining forest resources for future generations.

In its report, the committee expressed that it will not fund new acquisition projects until the agencies submit \"consolidated, prioritized\" lists of requested acquisitions for the committee to use \"to determine which projects would be implemented with limited funds.\" The committee also directed the agencies to implement a standard definition and policy for using funding provided for inholdings.", "There continues to be a difference of opinion on the optimal total level of funding for LWCF, and on allocations for the three purposes for which the fund has been used. For example, for FY2013 the Administration sought a $127.6 million increase (40%) over the FY2012 appropriation. The Administration's FY2012 request was significantly higher still\u2014$900.0 million. Such \"full funding\" has occurred only twice in the history of the program.

The House committee report did not identify the particular lands to be acquired, but noted that funding for new federal acquisitions was limited to small inholdings and recreational access for BLM and FS lands. Also, the committee level was $209.0 million less than the Administration's request for FY2013 of $257.8 million. The Administration sought an increase for each of the four land management agencies over FY2012, with a $71.4 million total increase. ", "In seeking funds for acquisition projects, since FY2011 the DOI agencies have sought to develop and use consistent, merit-based criteria, according to the department. These criteria were designed to meet common conservation goals, such as developing additional recreational opportunities and maximizing landscape conservation for wildlife and habitat. For FY2013, the criteria used by the DOI agencies included the value of the lands to the agency mission, the feasibility of acquiring and managing the lands, the availability of willing sellers and participating partners, and the extent to which the land is threatened by development. The FS budget justifications since FY2011 also have noted changes to the LWCF program, including the use of selection criteria to rank land acquisition projects. For FY2013, the FS criteria included the extent to which the acquisition would be nationally important, supported by the public and partners, have a landscape level impact, result in improvements in land management, and protect threatened lands. Further, for FY2013 the DOI agencies and the FS sought funding for inter-agency landscape scale acquisition projects and acquisitions to increase recreational access, e.g., for hunting and fishing. ", "The development and detailing of criteria for acquisitions in part sought to address congressional concerns regarding the land acquisition process, including that to the maximum extent possible, there be a single set of policies among the four agencies for conducting land acquisitions. Nevertheless, the House Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the information submitted by the agencies in support of acquisitions proposed for FY2013, specifically a lack of \"consolidated, prioritized project lists ...

The $2.8 million was for administrative expenses related to previous grants, rather than new grants. Seeking to eliminate funds for new grants to states is not a new phenomenon. For example, for several years the Clinton Administration proposed eliminating stateside funding and Congress concurred. The George W. Bush Administration also did not request stateside funding for several years, although Congress provided appropriations for new grants during those years. ", "Of the $60.0 million requested by the Administration for FY2013, $3.5 was for program administration, $36.5 million was to be distributed in accordance with the formula in law, and $20.0 million was for a new competitive grant program. The objectives of the proposed competitive program are to fund projects in large urban centers with little or no access to natural areas; reconnect young people and their families to the outdoors; provide access to rivers and waterways; and protect, restore, and connect open space and natural landscapes. The NPS would evaluate proposed projects based on a variety of criteria, including the level of need, expected benefits, and ability to leverage funding.

If enacted, the committee-reported level would have been the second-smallest since funding for other purposes was first provided in FY1998; no funding for other purposes was provided in FY1999. The funds were for two purposes, the Forest Legacy program and cooperative endangered species grants. The Forest Legacy program funds acquisition of lands and easements to protect forests threatened by land conversion. There are two types of cooperative endangered species grants funded through LWCF\u2014recovery land acquisition grants and habitat conservation plan land acquisition grants.
