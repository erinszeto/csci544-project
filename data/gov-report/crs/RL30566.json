If an agreement is reached, it would be the United States' largest FTA since the completion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. To go into effect, FTAs must be approved by Congress and the Korean National Assembly.

In recent years, the United States and South Korea appear to have become more adept at managing their trade disputes, so that they tend to be less acrimonious than they were in the 1980s and 1990s. This is due in part to the quarterly, working-level bilateral trade meetings that have been held since early 2001. Strategic factors, including South Korea's increased economic integration with North Korea, have become issues on the bilateral U.S.-South Korea economic front.

The Korean won lost half its value in the space of a few days, tumbling from 900 to 1900 won to the dollar. In a futile attempt to prop up the currency, the government's foreign currency reserves dropped to $4 billion, an amount insufficient to carry the country through another day. In December 1997, barely a year after joining the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Seoul turned to the IMF for economic assistance.

In 2001, however, growth slowed considerably, dragged down by a combination of internal and external developments, including a decline in consumer and business confidence, the bursting of Korea's stock market bubble, rising oil prices, and a sharp falloff in exports to the United States and Japan, which entered economic downturns of their own. The government responded by lowering interest rates, unveiling an economic stimulus package, and easing the rules on the use of credit cards. These measures boosted consumer spending, which helped to double the growth rate from 3.1% in 2001 to 6.3% in 2002. Growth also was boosted by rapid economic integration with China. Domestic investment, however, remained low.", "In 2003, overuse of personal credit cards led to the near-collapse of many financial firms and a sharp slowdown in economic growth, which fell back to 3.1%. Until the late 1990s, the consumer sector of the economy had been largely untapped, with Korean lenders focusing on the corporate sector. Thus, when the government liberalized financial regulations and forced Korea's giant conglomerates to curtail their borrowing in the aftermath of the 1997 crisis, banks and other financial institutions turned to consumers\u2014at times recklessly\u2014as a new source of profit. The number of credit card holders behind in their payments increased sharply, with an estimated 8% of the population in default in March 2004. In 2003 and 2004, all eight of Korea's specialized credit-card issuers registered massive losses that collectively were more than double their assets. In most cases, insolvency was avoided only through bailouts and takeovers by affiliated members of the companies' respective chaebol groupings . Most of these moves appear to have been engineered, regulatorally enabled, and/or encouraged by the government, which feared a collapse of the financial system if the firms were allowed to fail. The government responded to the household debt crisis by tightening restrictions on credit card use and issuance, and by initiating a refinancing and forgiveness program for individual debtors.", "For 2004, South Korea's economy grew by 4.6%, below the 6% growth rate the government had expected. Much of the growth was driven by a surge in exports\u2014particularly to China\u2014which rose by over 30% from 2003. A sharp rise in oil prices (South Korea imports all of its oil) and lackluster domestic demand contributed to the slower-than-expected growth rate.", "In 2005, economic growth slowed to around 4%, due in part to a slowdown in export growth early in the year. The government responded by unveiling a $6.5 billion fiscal stimulus policy. Beginning in the late spring, South Korean domestic production and demand began to increase, indicating an improvement in the credit card problem; despite rising energy prices, private spending rose by 3.2% in 2005, compared to a 0.5% contraction the year before. Toward the end of the year, the South Korean stock market and the won sharply appreciated in value, the latter against both the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen .

Significantly, the rebound appeared to be more balanced than in previous years, when rising exports had been the primary driver of South Korea's economic growth; for most of 2006, private consumption continued its upward trajectory, though its rate of growth dipped in the final months of the year. While exports were up, rising energy imports caused the merchandise trade surplus to decline considerably. South Korea's soaring housing prices\u2014particularly in the greater Seoul area, where around 40% of the population lives\u2014became a dominant political issue in 2006, exacerbating concerns about increasing economic inequality. The issue is likely to figure prominently in the run-up to the December 2007 presidential election.

If the point of comparison is the Korean economy in 1997, then the government's progress has been impressive. South Korea's economy today is far more transparent, open to foreign investors, and efficient than it was seven years ago. Progress has been particularly notable in opening the country to foreign direct investment (see below) and in reforming the financial sector. In the years following the crisis, the government spent about $140 billion to bail out ailing banks and mutual funds. This amount is approximately 25%-30% of the country's GDP, nearly twice the level required to save Mexico's financial system during its crisis in 1995. Notably, predictions that the government would have to spend substantially more funds have not come to pass, and Korea's banking sector as a whole has returned to profitability. By the end of 2001, non-performing loans (loans which are unlikely to be repaid) had fallen to 2.4% of total loans, compared with 16.4% in 1998. (In 2001, the percentage of non-performing loans for large banks in the United States was 1.5%.)", "The Roh government has accelerated South Korea's efforts to re-privatize the banks that were nationalized in the aftermath of the 1997 crisis. By 2000, the nationalization program had brought about one-third of the banking industry's assets into government hands, and state ownership of the banking sector formed the crux of a major trade dispute with the United States and European Union, in which state-owned and state-controlled banks were accused of illegally subsidizing Hynix Semiconductor Inc., the world's third-largest producer of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) semiconductor chips. By the spring of 2004, however, sales of many of formerly state-owned banks had given foreign companies collectively a major stake in South Korea's financial sector, notwithstanding occasional statements by Korean politicians expressing misgivings about excessive non-Korean ownership. By 2005, foreigners owned about one-third of the assets in the Korean banking sector, including majority stakes in four of Korea's eight nation-wide banks. In March 2004, Korea's Financial Supervisory Commission approved a $1.7 billion bid from Citigroup for a controlling stake in KorAm, Korea's seventh-largest bank. Through 2006, the Korean banking sector continued to be increasingly profitable.", "If the yardstick used to assess South Korea's reforms is the U.S. economy, however, it becomes clear that Seoul has far to go if it is to make the economy truly responsive to market-oriented pressures and incentives. Progress has been particularly difficult in the government's attempts to pressure the chaebol to correct the problems revealed by the 1997 crisis, including excessively high debt levels, a heavy reliance on short-term debt, the lack of transparency, weak corporate governance, and corporate structures dominated by individual families rather than professional business managers. Although two of the largest chaebol \u2014Daewoo and Hyundai\u2014have been dismantled and debt-equity ratios for most of the top conglomerates have been reduced, corporate governance and cross-shareholdings within chaebol groupings remain major problems. The bailouts of struggling credit card affiliates in 2003 and 2004 seemed to many to indicate that the chaebol had not reformed their past practices of forcing their profitable enterprises to rescue failing ones. Also in 2003, a massive accounting scandal at SK Global, the trading unit of the country's fourth-largest chaebol , SK Group, revealed similar structural problems.", "Additionally, the reckless credit card lending activities of Korean credit card firms in 2003 and 2004 exposed the continued weaknesses in risk management and due diligence by Korean financial interests. One of the government's responses has been to accelerate plans to further restructure the financial industry by passing new laws allowing the consolidation of banking, insurance, asset management, and brokerage services. Some critics, however, worry that this cross-sectoral consolidation will accentuate the problem of cross-shareholding within chaebol groupings.

Partly as a response to Kim's reforms, and partly in response to the lower prices of Korean assets following the 1997 crisis, FDI flows increased markedly, soaring from $3.2 billion in 1996 to a peak of $15.7 billion in 2000. FDI fell off significantly from 2001-2003, before rising to $12.8 billion in 2004, the same year President Roh Moo-hyun's government began a policy of boosting FDI as a source of domestic growth.

In June 2000, Daewoo Motor's creditors, many of them government-owned or controlled, reached a tentative agreement with Ford, which bid nearly $7 billion for the company. Negotiations became difficult, and after discovering billions of dollars in previously hidden liabilities (and taking a large loss from the Firestone tire recall), Ford withdrew its offer. General Motors, which initially had bid $4 billion, remained the only viable suitor. Negotiations with creditors and the government dragged on for over a year and a half, however.

Newbridge bought Korea First Bank in 1999 and is credited in many circles with turning around the bank's fortunes. Part of the Korean government's apparent ambivalence to foreign investment, particularly in the financial sector, is that foreign multinationals often are more resistant to government pressure.

South Korea formerly was the third-largest foreign buyer of U.S. beef; the United States exported nearly $800 million worth of beef to South Korea in 2003. Throughout 2004, USTR official said that FTA negotiations were unlikely to begin with South Korea while the ban was in place.

A senior official from the Korean Agricultural Ministry stated that U.S. and Korean negotiators were unable to come up with a mutually acceptable definition of \"boneless beef,\" among other issues, and therefore had failed to resolve the dispute as of February 12, 2007. U.S. officials and beef producers have argued that the fragments are so small as not to be a potential cause of mad cow.

Prior to that date, South Korea notified the WTO that it wished to extend the minimum access quota system rather than convert to tariffs. Under the Uruguay Round agreement, Seoul could do this only if it obtained the consent of other WTO members, which could demand concessions to expand their quota. The United States availed itself of this right, and on December 30, 2004, U.S. and South Korean officials announced an agreement, under which Korea will double the amount of rice it imports over the next 10 years, provide guaranteed access for 50,000 MT of U.S. rice each year, and make imported rice available directly to Korean consumers. In November 2005, after months of delay and acrimonious debate, the Korean National Assembly ratified the rice deal.
