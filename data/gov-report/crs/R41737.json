The set-aside has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds for specific purposes among the HHS agencies. Although the PHSA limits the set-aside to no more than 1% of program appropriations, in recent years the annual Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act has specified a higher maximum amount of funds that may be set aside for evaluation and other uses. The FY2010 Labor-HHS-ED appropriations act capped the set-aside at 2.5%. The FY2011 full-year CR act for FY2011 adopted the same value by reference.
