State and local governments issue debt instruments in exchange for the use of individuals' and businesses' savings. This debt obligates state and local governments to make interest payments for the use of these savings and to repay, at some time in the future, the amount borrowed. State and local governments may finance capital facilities with debt rather than out of current tax revenue to more closely align benefits and tax payments. There was just over $3 trillion in state and local debt outstanding in the third quarter of 2017.", "The federal government subsidizes the cost of most state and local debt by excluding the interest income from federal income taxation. This tax exemption is granted in part because it is believed that state and local capital facilities will be underprovided if state and local taxpayers have to pay the full cost. The federal government also provides a tax preference through tax credit bonds (TCBs), which either provide investors with a federal tax credit in lieu of interest payments or a direct payment to the issuer. P.L. 115-97, the 2017 tax revision, repealed the authority to issue TCBs beginning in 2018. For more on TCBs, see CRS Report R40523, Tax Credit Bonds: Overview and Analysis.", "State and local debt is issued as bonds, to be repaid over a period of time greater than one year and perhaps exceeding 20 years, and as notes, to be repaid within one year. General obligation bonds are secured by the promise to repay with general tax revenue, and revenue bonds are secured with the promise to use a specific stream of tax revenue. Most debt is issued to finance new capital facilities, but some is issued to refund a prior bond issue (usually to take advantage of lower interest rates). Tax-exempt bonds issued for some activities are classified as governmental bonds and can be issued without federal constraint because most of the benefits from the capital facilities are enjoyed by the general public. Many tax-exempt revenue bonds are issued for activities Congress has classified as private because most of the benefits from the activities appear to be enjoyed by private individuals and businesses. The annual volume of a subset of these tax-exempt private-activity bonds (PABs) is capped. For more on private activity bonds, see CRS Report RL31457, Private Activity Bonds: An Introduction.", "Arbitrage bonds devote a substantial share of the proceeds to the purchase of assets with higher interest rates than that being paid on the tax-exempt bonds. Such arbitrage bonds are not tax exempt because Congress does not want state and local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds and use the proceeds to earn arbitrage profits. The arbitrage profits could substitute for state and local taxes.", "A number of tax reform proposals have been introduced that would modify the tax treatment of state and local government bonds. Another policy issue is whether constraints should be relaxed on the types of activities, such as infrastructure spending, for which entities can issue tax-exempt debt. The list of activities that classify tax-exempt private-activity bonds\u2014and whether they should be included in the volume cap\u2014is another area of potential change or reform. The 2017 tax revision repealed authority to issue TCBs and advanced refunding bonds, but did not otherwise modify tax-exempt bonds or PABs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is Debt?", "paragraphs": ["Individuals and businesses lend their accumulated savings to borrowers. In exchange, borrowers give lenders a debt instrument. These debt instruments, typically called bonds, represent a promise by borrowers to pay interest income to lenders on the principal (the amount of money borrowed) until the principal is repaid to the lenders. When a municipal (state or local) government issues bonds, the principal (or proceeds) is typically used to finance the construction of capital facilities, but may also be used for cash management purposes when revenue collections do not match spending needs during the fiscal year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Why Do State and Local Governments Issue Debt?", "paragraphs": ["Since public capital facilities provide services over a long period of time, it makes financial and economic sense to pay for the facilities over a similarly long period of time. This is particularly true for state and local governments, whose taxpayers lay claim to the benefits from these facilities by dint of residency and relinquish their claim to benefits when they move. Given the demands a market-oriented society places on labor mobility, taxpayers are reluctant to pay today for state and local capital services to be received in the future. The state or local official concerned with satisfying the preferences of constituents may therefore elect to match the timing of the payments to the flow of services, precisely the function served by long-term bond financing. An attempt to pay for capital facilities \"up front\" is likely to result in a less than optimal rate of public capital formation.", "State and local governments are also faced with the necessity of planning their budget one to two years in advance. This requires a balancing of revenue forecasts against forecasts of the demand for services and spending. Not infrequently, unforeseen circumstances can undermine the forecast and cause a revenue shortfall, which must be financed with short-term borrowing, or \"notes.\" In addition, even when the forecasts are met, the timing of expenditures may precede the arrival of revenues, creating the necessity to borrow within an otherwise balanced fiscal year. Finally, temporarily high interest rates that prevail at the time bonds are issued to finance a capital project may induce short-term borrowing in anticipation of a drop in rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Makes State and Local Debt Special?", "paragraphs": ["The federal government intervenes in the public capital market by granting the debt instruments of state and local governments a unique privilege\u2014the exemption of interest income earned on these bonds from federal income tax. The tax exemption lowers the cost of capital for state and local governments, which should then induce an increase in state and local capital formation. The lower cost of capital arises because in most cases investors would be indifferent between taxable bonds (e.g., corporate bonds) that yield a 10% rate of return before taxes and tax-exempt bonds of equivalent risk that yield a 6.5% return. The taxable bond interest earnings carry a tax liability (35% of the interest income in most cases), making the after-tax return on the two bonds identical at 6.5%. Thus, state and local governments could raise capital from investors at an interest cost 3.5 percentage points (350 basis points) lower than a borrower issuing taxable debt.", "Generally, the degree to which tax-exempt debt is favored is measured in a variety of ways. Two are fairly common: the yield spread and the yield ratio. The yield spread is the difference between the interest rate on taxable bonds (corporate bonds or U.S. Treasury bonds) and the interest rate on tax-exempt municipal bonds of equivalent risk. In recent decades, the spread between tax-exempt and taxable bonds has declined as underlying interest rates have declined. The greater the yield spread, the greater are the nominal savings to state and local governments as measured by the interest rates they would have to pay if they financed with taxable debt.", "The yield ratio (which is an average rate on tax-exempt bonds divided by an average rate on a taxable bond of like term and risk) adjusts the spread for the level of interest rates. A lower ratio implies a greater savings to state and local governments relative to taxable debt. As the ratio approaches one, however, tax-exempt borrowing approaches that of taxable borrowing.", "Variation in the cost of state and local borrowing relative to the cost of taxable borrowing arises from changes in the demand for and supply of both tax-exempt and taxable bonds. Demand for tax-exempt bonds depends upon the number of investors, their wealth, statutory tax rates, and alternative investment opportunities. Supply depends upon the desire of the state and local sector for capital facilities and their ability to engage in conduit financing (issuing state or local government bonds and passing the proceeds through to businesses or individuals for their private use). Almost all of the factors which influence demand and supply are affected by federal tax policy and fiscal policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Does Tax Exemption Cost the Federal Government?", "paragraphs": ["The direct cost to the federal government of this interest exclusion is the individual and corporate income tax revenue forgone. Consider the aforementioned case where a 35% marginal tax rate corporate investor who purchases a 6.5% tax-exempt bond with principal of $1,000 that is to be repaid after 20 years. Each year for 20 years this taxpayer receives $65 in tax-exempt interest income. Each year the federal government forgoes collecting $35 of revenue because the revenue loss is based upon the yield the taxpayer forgoes. For example, if the investor had purchased a taxable bond carrying a 10% interest rate, he would have received $100 in interest income and paid $35 in income taxes on that income.", "The annual federal revenue loss (or tax expenditure) on the outstanding stock of tax-exempt bonds issued for public purposes is reported in the Analytical Perspectives section of the Budget every year. The estimates since 1994 are displayed in Table 1 . Because they are based upon the outstanding stock of public-purpose tax-exempt bonds, it takes time for some legislative changes to show up in these data. The amount of forgone tax revenue from the exclusion of interest income on public-purpose tax-exempt bonds is substantial; $20.5 billion in 2016. Over the 2017 to 2026 budget window, the estimated loss of revenue is expected to be $422.8 billion, or the 15 th -largest tax expenditure.

It was asserted by many that any taxation of this interest income would be unconstitutional because the exemption was protected by the Tenth Amendment and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected this claim of constitutional protection in 1988 in South Carolina v. Baker (485 U.S. 505).", "Although the legal basis for the subsidy is statutory rather than constitutional, the subsidy may be justified on economic grounds. Economic theory suggests that certain types of goods and services, such as a street light, will not be provided in the \"optimal\" amounts by the private sector because some of the benefits are consumed collectively. The nation's welfare can be increased by public provision of these goods and services, some of which are best provided by state or local governments. Certain goods and services provided by state or local governments, however, benefit both residents, who pay local taxes, and nonresidents, who pay minimal if any local taxes. Since state and local taxpayers are likely to be unwilling to provide these services to nonresidents without compensation, it is probable that state and local services will be under provided. In theory, the cost reduction provided by the exemption of interest income compensates state and local taxpayers for benefits provided to nonresidents. This encourages the governments to provide the optimal amount of public services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Total Debt Outstanding", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments were estimated to have $3.043 trillion in debt issuances outstanding at the end of the third quarter in 2017.

Municipal debt outstanding increased from 2008 to 2010, which may have represented issuances used to cover unexpected shortfalls due to reduced revenues and increased expenditure demands following the Great Recession. The lack of growth in debt outstanding in recent years could be explained by a hesitation to engage in new long-term capital projects given the budget challenges and economic uncertainties facing municipal governments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Classifying State and Local Debt Instruments", "paragraphs": ["State and local debt can be classified based on (1) the maturity (or term), which is the length of time before the principal is repaid; (2) the type of security , which is the financial backing for the debt; (3) the use of the proceeds for either new facilities or to refinance previously issued bonds; and (4) whether the type of activity being financed has a public or a private purpose.", "The risk associated with a bond is also an important factor, as nearly every bond issued by a state or local government is rated based on the probability of default.

If the notes are to be paid from specific taxes due in the near future, they usually are called tax anticipation notes (TANs); if from anticipated intergovernmental revenue, they are called revenue anticipation notes (RANs). If the notes are to be paid from long-term borrowing (e.g., bonds), they are called bond anticipation notes (BANs).

General obligation (GO) bonds pledge the full faith and credit of the issuing government. The issuing government makes an unconditional pledge to use its powers of taxation to honor its liability for interest and principal repayment. Revenue bonds, or non-guaranteed debt, pledge only the revenue from a specific tax or the earnings from the project financed with the bonds. Should these revenues or earnings prove to be inadequate to honor these commitments, the issuing government is under no obligation to use its taxing powers to finance the shortfall. Some revenue bonds are issued with credit enhancements provided by insurance or bank letters of credit that guarantee payment upon such a revenue shortfall.", " Figure 2 displays the breakdown between long-term GO and revenue bonds since 1992. The long-term market has been and continues to be dominated by revenue bonds. The revenue bond share has fluctuated between 60% and 72% from 1992 through 2016. ", "All tax-exempt interest income attributable to state and local governments does not appear in the form of bonds. Governments may enter into installment purchase contracts and finance leases for which the portion of the installment or lease payment to a vendor is tax exempt. For example, computer equipment or road building equipment could be leased from a vendor using a rental agreement or an installment sales contract. Under this type of agreement, the monthly payments to the vendor are large enough to cover the vendor's interest expense on the funds borrowed to purchase the equipment which was leased to the government. The portion that is attributable to interest income is not included in the vendor's taxable income. Such transactions are often referred to as municipal leasing.", "Lease rental revenue bonds and certificates are variations on revenue bonds. An authority or nonprofit corporation issues bonds, builds a facility with the proceeds, and leases the facility to a municipality. Security for the bonds or certificates is based on the lease payments from the municipalities. When the bonds are retired, the facility belongs to the lessee (the municipality). An advantage to this type of arrangement is that many states' constitutional and statutory definitions do not consider this type of financing to be debt because the lease payments are annual operating expenses based upon appropriated monies.", "The leasing technique has also been used to provide tax-exempt funds to nonprofit organizations. A municipality issues the bonds for the construction of a facility that is leased to a nonprofit hospital or university. Again, security for the bonds is based on the lease payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of the Proceeds: New-Issue vs. Refunding Bonds", "paragraphs": ["Long-term tax-exempt bond issues also can be characterized by their status as new issues or refunding issues (refundings). New issues represent bonds issued to finance new capital facilities. Refundings usually are made to replace outstanding bonds with bonds that carry lower interest rates or other favorable terms. As such, the refunding bonds usually do not add to the stock of outstanding bonds or the capital stock. The proceeds of the refunding bonds are used to pay off the remaining principal of the original bond issue, which is retired. Advance refunding bonds, however, do add to the outstanding stock of bonds without adding to the stock of capital. Advance refunding bonds are issued prior to the date on which the original bonds are refunded, so that for a period of time there are two bond issues outstanding to finance the same capital facilities. The 2017 tax revision ( P.L. 115-97 ) repealed the exclusion of interest income on advance refunding bonds issued after December 31, 2017.", " Figure 3 shows the changes in new-issue and refunding municipal bonds from 1992 through 2016. The volume of refunding shares varies widely, depending to a great extent on changes in the relative magnitudes of taxable and tax-exempt interest rates. Note that the 1993 increase in the top marginal individual income tax rates may have increased the demand for tax-exempt bonds (see Figure 2 ). Higher tax rates make tax-exempt bonds more attractive relative to taxable bonds, all other things being equal. The increased demand and accompanying lower interest rates may have prompted state and local governments to replace outstanding issues with refunding bonds that carried lower interest rates. In contrast, refundings dropped considerably in 1999 and 2000. The decline could have been in response to higher interest rates or to strong economic conditions in most states which minimized the need for debt finance generally. The story is reversed from 2001 to 2003 as the economy slowed and state budgets were strained by lower tax revenue collections. Refundings issues in 2003 were more than double the amount of new issues in 2000. In 2005, GO bonds and refunding bond volume peaked, likely reflecting the historically low interest rates on tax-exempt debt.

Bonds are considered to be for a public purpose if they satisfy either of two criteria: less than 10% of the proceeds are used directly or indirectly by a non-governmental entity; or less than 10% of the bond proceeds are secured directly or indirectly by property used in a trade or business. Bonds that satisfy either of these tests are termed \"governmental\" bonds and can be issued without federal limit.

Most ARSs are insured by the issuer because they do not carry a \"put\" option that would allow bondholders to sell the bonds at a specified price to the issuer or a designated third party. The bond insurance reduces risk and thus interest rate, making the bonds less costly to issuers. For this reason, ARSs are heavily influenced by credit ratings, and typically require bond insurance to make them marketable.", "The existing holders of ARSs offer bids as well as new bidders. If all bids of both existing bond holders and new participants fail to clear the market, the auction is termed a \"failed auction.\" In this scenario, the original agreement with the bondholder stipulates a \"reservation\" interest rate the issuer must pay in the event of a failed auction at least until the next successful auction. Because the reservation rate is typically higher than market interest rates, issuers of ARSs would prefer to avoid paying the reservation rate.", "The issuance of ARSs grew considerably from 1988 through 2007. In 1988, the Bond Buyer identified one ARS issue valued at $25 million; none were issued in 1987. In 2004, the peak year, 438 ARS bonds valued at $42.5 billion were issued. No ARSs have been issued since 2007, roughly corresponding to the beginning of the financial crisis, when 322 were sold for a total value of $38.7 billion."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
