In such instances, the Secretary shall purchase such alternative fuel using competitive procedures and ensure the best purchase price for the fuel.", "S. 3254", "As passed by the Senate on December 4, 2012, S. 3254 does not contain any provisions that would restrict the ability of the Department of Defense to procure or produce biofuels. ", "Two provisions in S. 3254 , as reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee ( S.Rept. 112-173 of June 4, 2012), would have affected the Department of Defense's procurement and production of biofuels. Via floor amendments, both of these provisions were stricken from the version of S. 3254 that was passed by the Senate.", "S.Amdt. 2985 was sponsored by Senator Mark Udall and co-sponsored by Senators Murray, Shaheen, Bingaman, Hagan, Kerry, Begich, and Tom Udall. This amendment, which passed 62-37, struck Section 313 from the version of S. 3254 as reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee.

These amendments were each approved in votes of 13-12. A third amendment, sponsored by Senator Inhofe, failed in the Senate Armed Services Committee on a tie vote of 13-13. This amendment would have exempted the Department of Defense from Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-140 ), which prohibits federal agencies from purchasing alternative fuels whose lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions exceed those of conventional fuels.

In such instances, the Secretary shall purchase such alternative fuel using amounts authorized for research, development, test, and evaluation using competitive procedures and shall ensure the best purchase price for the fuel.", "SEC. 2823. PROHIBITION ON BIOFUEL REFINERY CONSTRUCTION.", "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the Secretary of Defense nor any other official of the Department of Defense may enter into a contract to plan, design, refurbish, or construct a biofuels refinery or any other facility or infrastructure used to refine biofuels unless such planning, design, refurbishment, or construction is specifically authorized by law.", "Regarding Section 313, S.Rept. 112-173 states:", "Limitation on availability of funds for procurement of alternative fuel (sec. 313)", "The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the use of funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013 from being obligated or expended for the production or sole purchase of an alternative fuel if the cost exceeds the cost of traditional fossil fuels used for the same purpose, except for continued testing purposes.", "The committee notes that in December 2011, the Defense Logistics Agency, on behalf of the Department of the Navy, purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuels for $12.0 million, which equates to $26.66 a gallon. According to the Department of the Navy it was the single largest purchase of biofuel in government history and was carried out in order to \"demonstrate the capability of a Carrier Strike Group and its air wing to burn alternative fuels.\" The Department of the Navy noted that, despite the use of operation and maintenance funds for the purchase, the demonstration is deemed a research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) initiative as justification for the higher cost per gallon.", "The committee also notes that the Vice Chief of Naval Operations testified before the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support on May 10, 2012, regarding pressure on readiness accounts from increased fuel prices that \"every $1 increase in the price per barrel of fuel results in approximately $31M of additional cost annually above our budgeted level.\" Therefore, the high cost of fuel has direct and detrimental impact on other readiness accounts.", "The committee strongly supports initiatives undertaken by the Department of Defense to reduce the fuel demand of the operational forces through affordable new technologies that increase fuel efficiency and offer alternative sources of power. But given the pressure placed on current and future defense budgets, the committee is concerned about the use of operation and maintenance funds to pay significantly higher costs for biofuels being used for RDTE efforts. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to develop and promulgate guidance to the military services and defense agencies on the difference between the operational use of alternative fuels versus continued RDTE initiatives.

App. 2061 et seq.) for fiscal year 2013 for biofuels production may not be obligated or expended for the construction of a biofuel refinery until the Department of Defense receives matching contributions from the Department of Energy and equivalent contributions from the Department of Agriculture for the same purpose.", "Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( H.R. 5856 , H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6 )", "For the 2013 fiscal year, the House Appropriations Committee, in its report ( H.Rept. 112-493 of May 25, 2012, on H.R. 5856 ), states:", "ADVANCED DROP-IN BIOFUEL PRODUCTION", "The request [for Defense Production Act purchases] includes $70,000,000 for the construction or retrofit of domestic commercial (or pre-commercial) scale advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries. The Committee understands that the Department has allocated $100,000,000 of the $150,000,000 program addition to the fiscal year 2012 Defense Production Act account for this effort and that $70,000,000 of this funding likely will not execute until well into fiscal year 2013 or even into fiscal year 2014. While the Committee is supportive of alternative energy development, in these times of decreasing budgets, it does not seem prudent to stockpile funds so far ahead of need. Accordingly the recommendation provides no funding for this effort in fiscal year 2013. The Committee urges the Secretary of Defense to request this funding in future years when it can execute in a timely manner. (Page 203)", "For the FY2013 fiscal year, the Senate Appropriations Committee, in its report ( S.Rept. 112-196 of August 2, 2012, on H.R. 5856 ), provides for an additional $100 million for the DPA fund over the amount requested in the FY2013 budget request. The report states:", "Additional Funding - The Committee recognizes the critical role that the DPA title III program serves in strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base and believes that this work is in the national interest. Therefore, the Committee increases funding for DPA by $100,000,000 over the budget request. The Committee directs that the additional funding be competitively awarded to new initiatives and priority consideration should be given to completion of DPA projects initiated in prior years. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to inform the congressional defense committees 30 days prior to any obligation or expenditure of these funds.
