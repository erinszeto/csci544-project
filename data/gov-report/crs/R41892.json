These assets have been acquired over a period of decades to help agencies fulfill their diverse missions. Agencies hold buildings with a range of uses, including offices, health clinics, warehouses, and laboratories. As agencies' missions change over time, so, too, do their real property needs, thereby rendering some assets less useful or unneeded altogether. Healthcare provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), for example, has shifted in recent decades from predominately hospital-based inpatient care to a greater reliance on clinics and outpatient care, with a resulting change in space needs. Similarly, the Department of Defense (DOD) reduced its force structure by 36% after the cold war ended, and has engaged in several rounds of base realignments and installation closures.", "Real property disposition is the process by which federal agencies identify and then transfer, donate, or sell real property they no longer need. Disposition is an important asset management function because the costs of maintaining unneeded properties can be substantial, consuming financial resources that might be applied to pressing real property needs, such as repairing existing facilities, or towards other pressing policy issues, such as reducing the national debt.", "In FY2009\u2014the most recent data available\u2014the government held 10,327 unneeded buildings and spent $134 million dollars to maintain them. Agencies have said that their disposal efforts are often hampered by legal and budgetary disincentives, and competing stakeholder interests. In addition, Congress is limited in its capacity to conduct oversight of the disposal process because it lacks access to reliable, comprehensive, real property data. The government's inability to efficiently dispose of its unneeded property is a major reason that federal real property management has been identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as a \"high-risk\" area since 2003.", "This report begins with an explanation of the real property disposal process, and then discusses some of the factors that have made disposition relatively inefficient and costly. It then examines three bills introduced in the 112th Congress that would address those problems: the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act (H.R. 1205), the Excess Federal Building and Property Disposal Act (H.R. 665), and the Civilian Property Realignment Act (H.R. 1734).

Next, GSA sends a written Notice of Availability describing the property to other federal agencies, and posts information about the property on its Property Disposal Resource Center website. Agencies may also identify unneeded assets available for transfer through the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP), a database of the buildings, structures, and land held by federal agencies. If an agency wants to acquire an excess property, it must respond to the Notice of Availability within 30 days, and then submit a formal request for the property to be transferred within 60 days from the date the notice expires.

In FY2009, the government held more than 10,000 excess buildings with total operating costs of $134 million. Agencies have said that their efforts to dispose of unneeded properties are hindered by statutory disposal requirements, the cost of preparing properties for disposal, and conflicts with stakeholders. Each of these issues is discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statutory Disposal Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The steps in the real property disposal process are set by statute, including the public benefit conveyance process. Agencies have noted that the need to offer properties to state and local governments, and non-profits, slows down the disposition process, thereby compelling agencies to incur operating costs for months\u2014sometimes many months\u2014while the properties are being screened. VA officials have said the requirements of the McKinney-Vento Act can add as much as two years to the disposal process. Because public benefit conveyance requirements are set in law, agencies do not have the authority to skip screening, even for surplus properties that could not be conveyed anyway. The Department of Energy, for example, told auditors that they had properties that they felt could be disposed of only by demolition, due to their condition or location, but that still had to go through the screening process, thereby forcing DOE to pay maintenance costs that could have been avoided.", "Statutes pertaining to environmental remediation or historic preservation also add time to the process. It may take agencies years of study to assess the potential environmental consequences of a proposed disposal, and to develop and implement an abatement plan, as required by law. Similarly, the National Historic Preservation Act requires agencies to plan their disposal actions so as to minimize the harm they cause to historic properties, which may include additional procedures such as consulting with historic preservation groups at the state, local, and federal level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disposal Costs", "paragraphs": ["Unneeded buildings are often among the older properties in an agency's portfolio. As a consequence, agencies sometimes find that they must complete expensive repairs and renovations before disposing of certain properties. Agencies may need to invest in repairs that will enable a building to meet health and safety standards, for example, or restore historic sites in accordance with federal standards. VA, for example, estimated that it would need to spend about $3 billion to repair the buildings in its portfolio that it rated in \"poor\" or \"critical\" condition\u201456% of which were vacant or underutilized, and therefore might be candidates for disposal. Agencies that wish to demolish vacant buildings face deconstruction and cleanup costs that, at times, exceed the cost of maintaining the property\u2014at least in the short run\u2014which may encourage real property managers to retain the property rather than dispose of it. Federal agencies frequently cite the cost of complying with environmental regulations as a major disincentive to disposal. Generally speaking, agencies are required to assess and pay for any environmental cleanup that may be needed before disposing of a property. Identifying and addressing environmental hazards, such as lead paint, asbestos, medical waste, and soil contamination, prior to disposition can result in \"significant\" up-front costs for agencies. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholder Conflict", "paragraphs": ["Some agencies have found their disposal efforts complicated by the involvement of stakeholders with competing agendas. The Department of the Interior has said that it can be stymied by the competing concerns of local and state governments, historic preservation offices, and other political factors, when attempting to dispose of some of its unneeded real property. Similarly, VA has found that communities sometimes oppose disposals that would result in new development, and veterans groups have opposed disposing of building space if that space would be used for purposes unrelated to the needs of veterans. The Department of State has had difficulty in disposing of surplus real property overseas, due to disputes with host governments that restrict property sales. These conflicts can result in delay, or even cancellation of proposed disposals, which, in turn, prevents agencies from reducing their inventories of unneeded properties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Availability and Quality of Real Property Data", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) is the government's most comprehensive source of information about real property under the control of executive branch agencies. GSA manages the FRPP and is authorized to collect real property data from 24 of the largest landholding agencies each year (other agencies are encouraged, but not required, to report data to GSA). The data elements that participating agencies collect and report are determined by the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC), an interagency taskforce which is funded and chaired by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The other members of the council are agency Senior Real Property Officers (SRPOs) and GSA.", "The FRPP contains data that could enhance congressional oversight of federal real property activities, such as the number of excess and surplus properties held by major landholding agencies, the annual costs of maintaining those properties, and agency disposition actions. GSA, however, maintains tight control over access to the FRPP, and does not permit direct access to the public and most federal employees, including congressional staff, on the grounds that the data are proprietary. GSA does consider requests for real property data from congressional offices, but GSA staff query the database and provide the results to the requestor.", "Some FRPP data are made public through an annual summary report posted on GSA's website, but the summary reports are of limited use for several reasons. Most of the data are highly aggregated (e.g., the number of assets disposed through public benefit conveyance government-wide), and very limited information is provided on an agency-by-agency basis. It is not possible, therefore, for Congress to monitor the performance of individual agencies through the summary reports. Basic questions, such as how many excess properties each agency disposed of in a given fiscal year, and by what method, cannot be answered. Nor is it possible to compare the performance of agencies, which in turn limits the ability of Congress to study the policies and practices at the most successful agencies and hold poorly performing agencies accountable. ", "Also, the quality of the FRPP data has been questioned. GAO audits have found, for example, that certain real property data were incomplete or were not comparable across agencies, which limited the usefulness of those data for decision making. In addition, the reports may miscategorize important data on disposal methods. The three most recently published FRPPs identify \"other\" as the most common disposition method, accounting for 46% (16,028) of the total number of real property assets disposed by agencies in FY2007, nearly 73% (17,939) of those disposed in FY2008, and 41% (8,008) in FY2009. Typically, the \"other\" data category is reserved for a relatively small number of cases that do not clearly fit into one of the major data categories, so it is unusual to see such a large number of \"other\" dispositions. In fact, the FRPP defines \"other\" disposals as those \"that cannot be classified in any of the other disposition methods.\" The annual reports, however, do not explain why so many disposals cannot be classified as federal transfer, conveyance, sale, or demolition. One explanation may be that agencies are misreporting their disposal data; another may be that some disposals are a combination of methods. If so, then the data reported for all types of dispositions may be of limited use, because thousands of properties may have been miscategorized.", "The summary reports also omit data that Congress might find valuable. The FRPP contains, for example, the number of excess properties held by each agency and the annual operating costs of those properties\u2014issues about which Congress has expressed ongoing interest\u2014but the summary report only provides the number and annual operating costs of disposed assets, thereby providing the \"good news\" of future costs avoided through disposition while omitting the \"bad news\" of the ongoing operating costs associated with unneeded properties the government maintained. Similarly, agencies estimate a dollar amount for the repair needs of their buildings and structures as part of their FRPP reporting, but the estimate is then folded into a formula for calculating a \"condition index\" for each building. Given that repair needs are an obstacle to disposing of some properties, Congress may find it useful to have the repair estimates reported separately to help inform funding decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Select Real Property Proposals in the 112th Congress", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "H.R. 1205: Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 1205 , the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act of 2011, was introduced by Representative Mike Quigley on March 17, 2011.

Agencies would submit their recommendations to the Administrator of the General Services Administration, who would, in consultation with the chairperson of the Federal Real Property Council, review and revise them, and then submit the revised recommendations to a newly established Civilian Property Realignment Commission.

The HUD Secretary would then have 30 days to determine whether any were suitable for homeless use. Simultaneously, non-profits and state or local governments interested in obtaining PBC properties for providing homeless services would need to submit a notice of interest to HUD within the same 30-day time limit. A non-profit, or state or local government interested in a property for a public benefit other than homeless use, would submit a notice of interest to the sponsoring agency, also within 30 days. If the recommendations gained force of law, HUD or the appropriate sponsoring agency would convey the property to the applicant it deems most meritorious.", "CPRA would require executive agencies seeking to acquire leased space to do so only by working through GSA.

Table 1 , below, outlines how each proposal would address the four obstacles to expediting real property disposition discussed in this report: budgetary disincentives, administrative burden, stakeholder conflict, and lack of access to comprehensive, accurate data.", "H.R. 1205 would potentially enhance the ability of agencies to dispose of unneeded properties by permitting them to retain the net proceeds from dispositions. Agencies would be permitted to use these funds to cover the costs associated with preparing properties for conveyance, sale, or demolition. By reinvesting in disposal, agencies could further reduce their inventories of unneeded properties and the costs associated with maintaining them. H.R. 1205 would also permit agencies to apply some or all of its net proceeds towards the repair and maintenance of buildings the agency intends to continue to utilize. While reinvesting proceeds in repairs and maintenance would reduce the amount of funds available for disposition, it also could generate cost-savings. Regular maintenance and repair of a building's core systems\u2014such as electrical, heating, and air condition\u2014tends to both extend the life of those systems and enable them to operate at a lower cost. Similarly, failing to repair building components, such as roofs, can decrease the value of the building and lead to increased future repair costs, as prices increase or the problems worsen. ", "The pilot program established by H.R. 1205 would potentially reduce the time it takes to dispose of buildings and structures scheduled for demolition. While the pilot program would only apply to that one category of disposition\u2014it would not include properties to be disposed of by conveyance, transfer, or sale\u2014it would still encompass thousands of unneeded properties. In FY2009, demolition was the most common method of disposition, accounting for 8,104 out of the19,460 buildings and structures that were disposed of by the government that year. There is no public data that identifies the total number of federal buildings and structures scheduled for demolition, but some agencies have said they would like to demolish many more buildings than they do, so it is possible that thousands more real property assets would be eligible for the pilot program. By speeding up the demolition process, agencies may be able to demolish more buildings and structures, and thereby eliminate the operating costs associated with those properties. It is not clear how much savings would result from the pilot program\u2014in part because there is no comprehensive data on how long it takes properties to move through the PBC process or the annual operating costs of individual properties\u2014but in FY2009, the annual operating costs of demolished properties totaled nearly $82 million.", "H.R. 1205 would address many of the concerns about the current lack of comprehensive real property data. The database required by H.R. 1205 could facilitate oversight, as it would allow users to identify unneeded and underutilized properties at each agency, calculate the operating costs of those properties, and monitor how long it takes for disposition to occur. The annual report required by H.R. 1205 would provide additional data that could enhance congressional oversight, including the market value and disposal costs of excess and surplus properties, and the amount of proceeds generated by the disposition of those properties. The bill would not, however, require GSA to take steps to improve the quality of the real property data it collects. As a consequence, the usefulness of the database as an oversight tool might be limited by the inaccuracy or incompleteness of the data. In addition, it is possible that GSA might object to the inclusion of each property's estimated market value in the report\u2014which it considers confidential\u2014or to the administrative costs associated with additional reporting requirements.", "Unlike H.R. 1205 , H.R. 665 would permit agencies to retain 20%, rather than all, of the net proceeds generated by disposition. Using FY2009 net proceeds data, H.R. 665 would have provided agencies $40 million less than H.R. 1205 for reinvestment in their real property portfolios. The expedited disposal program proposed in H.R. 665 would potentially reduce the administrative burden associated with disposing of most unneeded properties by exempting them from all public benefit conveyance requirements. Opposition to the pilot program may arise among state and local government agencies and non-profit organizations that would prefer to have access to surplus federal property through public conveyance\u2014which would give them the opportunity to obtain the property at a discounted price\u2014and particularly among those agencies and non-profits that serve the homeless, because they had been given special consideration under McKinney-Vento. These exemptions could cut months from the disposal process for many properties, however, thereby reducing maintenance costs and providing the government with the opportunity to realize revenues from the sale of properties sooner. Moreover, some state and local governments, and private firms, might support the pilot program, because it would increase the number of federal properties that could be purchased and therefore be used for a wider range of purposes, including economic development, than if the property had been conveyed. The bill would not impose any new reporting requirements.", "H.R. 1734 would transfer all proceeds to the Commission, which some agencies may find objectionable, preferring instead to have funds generated by their disposal activities to be deposited into their own accounts. By breaking the link between disposal and proceeds, the bill may reduce the incentive of some agencies to dispose of their unneeded properties as promptly as possible. H.R. 1734 would reduce administrative burden associated with the conveyance process by requiring only some properties to go through the screening, and by truncating the conveyance process for those properties that are subject to it. Stakeholder conflict may be reduced by establishing an independent apparatus for making real property disposal decisions, similar to the process by which the Department of Defense disposes of property under the Base Realignment Closure Act. H.R. 1734 may facilitate cost savings by making recommendations regarding consolidation, which the other bills do not. The CPRA process is intended to be an effective way to make decisions about consolidation. The Commission would be able to look at agency space needs across the government when making recommendations and may see a broader range of opportunities for agencies to share space than real property staff within an individual agency. While the bill would require the Commission to hold public hearings and publish its recommendations online, Congress may not be provided with much useful data. There is no requirement for agencies or the Commission to make public data on properties that do not make it into the recommendations. Nor will agencies or the Commission be required to provide data on the operating costs, market value, or even total number of excess and surplus properties. The bill may facilitate oversight of leasing decisions, by requiring all agencies to work through GSA rather than use independent authority."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Enhanced Use Leases", "paragraphs": ["It may not be possible for agencies to sell some unneeded properties, particularly when the real estate market is slow. Congress may therefore wish to consider whether to expand the authority of agencies to enter into Enhanced Use Leases (EULs). In broad terms, EULs are special authorities that permit agencies to enter into short- or long-term lease agreements with public and private entities for the use of federal property. VA has an EUL in New Jersey, for example, that has turned an underutilized property into an industrial park, and it leases unneeded space in Los Angeles on a short-term basis to the film industry. Because EULs are typically provided to individual agencies, the scope of the authority they grant varies widely. Many agencies can retain the proceeds generated by EULs, for example, but others cannot. Similarly, some agencies may use EUL proceeds for activities unrelated to real property, while others may apply them only to real property functions. While EULs may provide revenue to agencies they may not otherwise realize, some agencies find the process of drafting, negotiating, and implementing an EUL agreement to be time consuming and complicated. If Congress does consider expanding EUL authorities, among the issues it might choose to examine are whether to require congressional approval before EUL proceeds may be used by an agency, and whether to limit the use of proceeds to certain purposes (e.g., only disposal, any real property activity, any agency activity)."], "subsections": []}]}}
