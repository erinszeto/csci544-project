The Bipartisan Budget Act procedure, however, places a deadline by which the Finance and the HELP Committees must act, and it creates a mechanism to \"discharge\" (that is, remove) the joint committee bill from the committees if they do not.

", "If a committee in possession of a joint select committee bill does not report by this deadline, it will be automatically discharged\u2014that is, the bill will be taken away from them.

", "No later than two days of Senate session after a joint committee bill has been reported or discharged from the Finance and the HELP Committees, the majority leader or his designee may move to proceed to consider it. It is important to note that the act defines a \"joint committee bill\" as including a bill of the House of Representatives that is a companion measure to the measure introduced in the Senate. As such, the majority leader or his designee may move to call up the Senate bill or instead may call up a House-passed measure pending on the Senate calendar. In the case of the work product of the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans, it seems possible\u2014perhaps likely\u2014that the House of Representatives would consider such a bill a revenue measure, which, under the Constitution, must originate in that chamber. As such, it is arguably likely that full Senate action will proceed on a House-passed measure. If the leader or his designee does not move to the bill within two session days, any Senator may move to call it up on the floor.", "The motion to consider a joint committee bill\u2014and all debatable motions and appeals in connection with the motion\u2014shall be considered for a maximum of 10 hours, evenly divided between the Senate floor leaders or their designees. Since the total time for consideration is limited, time spent in quorum calls or votes would count against the 10-hour total. ", "An optional nondebatable motion to limit debate to less than 10 hours is in order. This motion requires a vote of three-fifths of all Senators\u201460 votes if there is not more than one vacancy in the body\u2014to pass. The act precludes motions that might otherwise be made in the Senate to postpone the motion to proceed or to reconsider a vote on it. Because the time is controlled, either side could also yield back some or all of their allocation of time unused. ", "Passage of the motion to proceed itself also requires the affirmative vote of three-fifths of all Senators (60 votes), the same threshold necessary to invoke cloture in the Senate. Thus, while the motion to proceed to a joint committee bill could not be filibustered, it still requires the same level of support to pass that would be necessary to shut off debate (i.e., invoke cloture) on a regular, debatable motion to proceed. These procedures of the act shorten the time that would otherwise be necessary for the Senate to invoke cloture, however, since the Senate would ordinarily have to wait two session days before voting on cloture and then, if cloture were invoked, expend up to 30 additional hours in postcloture consideration before voting on a motion to proceed.

Once pending, however, such a measure is to be otherwise considered under the regular rules of the Senate. Said another way, if the Senate chooses to take it up, the joint committee bill is to be fully debatable and fully amendable, including by nongermane amendment, and one or more cloture processes (requiring the support of 60 Senators) might be necessary to reach a final vote on it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Senate May Alter the Statutory Procedure", "paragraphs": ["The fact that an expedited parliamentary procedure is contained in statute does not mean that another law must be enacted to alter it. Article I, Section 5, of the Constitution gives each chamber of Congress the power to determine the rules of its proceedings. As a result, statutory expedited procedures such as those governing Senate consideration of a joint committee bill (like all rules of the House or Senate) can be set aside, altered, or amended by either chamber at any time. As several House Parliamentarians have observed, a chamber may \"change or waive the rules governing its proceedings. This is so even with respect to rules enacted by statute.\" ", "In a sense, then, the expedited procedures in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 governing Senate consideration of a joint committee bill establish a default set of parliamentary ground rules. Senators can tailor these provisions to meet specific situations or for their convenience. ", "It is worth noting, however, that, while the Senate has the constitutional power to alter the application of the expedited procedures in their body, doing so may be difficult in practice. In the Senate, overriding the default terms of consideration laid out in the act would effectively require unanimous consent, as setting the terms of consideration in the Senate cannot be accomplished by a numerical majority.
