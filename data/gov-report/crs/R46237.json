Mandated by the Constitution and federal law, the census is considered a cornerstone of the nation's representative democracy. Nevertheless, an enumeration that is complete and accurate is difficult to achieve. Among other challenges, the census is often misunderstood, mischaracterized, feared, or avoided. This report addresses common questions concerning the 2020 census. The report is intended to provide information about the census, including clarifying various aspects of the census process. Among the topics covered are", "the origin and purpose of the census; the dates of key census activities; what the Census Bureau has done to promote the enumeration and gain cooperation with it, such as background research on hard-to-count groups and areas, and outreach to them and the broader public through a $500 million communications strategy that includes paid advertising; what basic data the census will collect, largely about how many people live in each household; each person's sex, age, birthdate, race, Hispanic or non-Hispanic ethnicity, and relationship to the person filling out the census form; and whether the housing unit is owned or rented; what information, the Census Bureau has explained, the census never collects, including Social Security numbers, bank or credit card account information, money, or anything on behalf of a political party; why people who consider themselves to be of Middle Eastern or North African race or ethnicity will not be able to report themselves as such on the census questionnaire; clarification that the census will not include a citizenship, nationality, immigration, or other related question; how the Census Bureau will collect detailed socioeconomic and housing data separately from the census; clarification that people have several different options for answering the census\u00e2\u0080\u0094online, on paper, or by telephone\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though online responses are officially most encouraged; language support for the census, including online questionnaires in English and 12 non-English languages, Census Questionnaire Assistance by telephone in the same languages and through a telecommunications device for the deaf, and language guides in 59 non-English languages that will be available in video, standard and large print, braille, and American Sign Language; legal requirement to answer the census and possible $5,000 penalty for nonresponse or false answers; clarification that people must respond to the 2020 census even if they participated in the 2018 or 2019 census tests; the process for updating the Master Address File, the basis for contacting the population about the start of the census and following up with nonrespondents; how and when people can become employed as temporary 2020 census workers, what the requirements are for being hired, and what this work can offer to employees; how the public can identify census workers to be sure that they are legitimate; and legal and cybersecurity protections for confidential census information."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "1.

For example, the Census Barriers, Attitudes, and Motivators Study (CBAMS), also called the \"2020 Census Planning Survey,\" was conducted from February 20 through April 17, 2018, with a nationwide sample of 50,000 households. It covered, according to the bureau, \"a range of topics related to census participation and completion.\" Respondents could complete the survey in English or Spanish, online or by mail. \"Approximately 17,500 people responded to the survey, which was then weighted to be representative of all householders in the United States ages 18 and older.\" The bureau focused on differences in responses \"across race, age, gender, education, and country of birth.\" Qualitative information gathered from 42 focus groups in 14 locations nationwide from March 14, 2018, through April 19, 2018, supplemented the survey results. The bureau reported that the use of focus groups was \"designed to help the research team understand the attitudes of small demographic groups or groups that were otherwise difficult to reach with the survey.\" The \"chief barrier\" to 2020 census participation identified in the survey and the focus groups was \"a lack of understanding of the purpose and process of the census.\" The focus groups showed this lack to be \"associated with several negative attitudes toward the census, including apathy, privacy concerns, fear of repercussions, and general distrust of government.\" The survey results indicated that \"certain demographic characteristics, including low levels of education, being young, and being of racial or ethnic minority groups,\" were related to \"low levels of intent\" to respond to the 2020 census. The survey and the qualitative findings, however, \"revealed common motivators\" for answering the census. Despite \"important differences\" among demographic groups, \"funding for public services\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as hospitals, schools, and roads\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a key motivator across groups.\" The bureau observed that respondents resembling the people in the focus groups, especially, might understand \"the importance and purpose of the census if they make the connection between completing a census form and the possibility of an increase in funding or support\" for their communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communications Strategy", "paragraphs": ["The bureau used information such as gained from CBAMS to inform its $500 million communications strategy, developed by the bureau and its communications contractor, VMLY&R."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Advertising", "paragraphs": ["As the bureau has explained, VMLY&R includes \"multicultural advertising agencies, seasoned in reaching diverse audiences.\" An advertising campaign \"in English and 12 other languages\" will be part of the communications strategy.

The bureau has compiled and posted on its website a guide for those interested in forming CCCs and an alphabetized list of existing committees, with any available contact information.", "An additional component of the partnership program is Statistics in Schools, which, in general, promotes statistical literacy for students from kindergarten through high school and, specifically, explains to students why the census is important. One goal is for students to bring this message home. A related goal is to make school-age children and the adults in their households aware of the need to count all children in a household, being sure not to miss any babies or other children under age five.

The bureau has emphasized that the census never asks a person for his or her Social Security number or bank or credit card account information, for any \"money or donations,\" or for \"anything on behalf of a political party.\" A form purporting to be a census form that requests such information is not from the Census Bureau and is not legitimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "7.

A citizenship question was proposed, challenged, and ultimately not retained on the census form.", "Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced on March 26, 2018, that the 2020 census form would include the current American Community Survey question on citizenship. The question is, as it has been in the ACS since before 2010, \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" A checkbox appears beside each of the following possible answers: \"Yes, born in the United States\"; \"Yes, born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or Northern Marianas\"; \"Yes, born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents\"; \"Yes, U.S. citizen by naturalization\u00e2\u0080\u0094Print year of naturalization\"; and \"No, not a U.S. citizen.\"", "The Department of Justice maintained that the census, not a survey like the ACS, was \"the most appropriate vehicle for collecting\" citizenship data \"critical to the Department's enforcement of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\" and its \"protections against racial discrimination in voting.\"", "Opponents of the citizenship question expressed concern that it might depress immigrants' census response rates or cause them to falsify data, especially if their status in the United States, or that of their friends or families, was illegal. Census Bureau fieldworkers in 2017 noted heightened anxiety about data confidentiality among certain foreign-born respondents and reluctance to answer questions, particularly about citizenship status. Six former bureau directors signed a January 26, 2018, letter to Secretary Ross, opposing the late-date introduction of a citizenship question that, at the time, had not been tested for the 2020 census.", "Multiple lawsuits were filed to block the question. Judge Jesse Furman, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled on July 26, 2018, that a consolidated suit by the State of New York and others could proceed. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case as Department of Commerce et al. v. New York et al. on April 23, 2019. The Court's decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts and issued on June 27, 2019, found that the addition of a citizenship question did not violate the Enumeration Clause of the Constitution or the Census Act (Title 13, U.S. Code , Census ), but the Court held that Secretary Ross's decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act because his sole stated reason for adding the citizenship question was not the real reason for his decision. On July 11, 2019, the President issued an executive order stating that the ruling had \"made it impossible, as a practical matter, to include a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire.\" The order, instead, directed \"all executive departments and agencies\" to give the department \"the maximum assistance permissible, consistent with law, in determining the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country, including by providing any access\" requested by the department to relevant administrative records. This action, the order continued, \"will ensure that the Department will have access to all available records in time for use in conjunction with the census.\" On September 13, 2019, the organization LUPE and others filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the Commerce Secretary, the Director of the Census Bureau, the Commerce Department, and the Census Bureau, seeking to block implementation of the executive order.

Where are all the detailed socioeconomic and housing questions that some people say the census asks?", "paragraphs": ["The American Community Survey is occasionally confused with the decennial census. In past decades, through the 2000 census, the census consisted of a short form, with questions that applied to all U.S. residents, and a long form, which included the short form questions plus many more questions covering social, demographic, economic, and housing topics. The long form went to a representative sample of all U.S. residents, a 17% sample in 2000, and the results could be generalized to the whole resident population. The bureau discontinued the long form after 2000 and launched its replacement, the ACS, in 2005 and 2006. The bureau considers the ACS a part of the decennial census program but conducts it separately from the census. Although the census is administered once a decade, the ACS goes to a small sample of the population every month and, as did the long form, collects myriad data. ACS results are aggregated over time to produce one-year and five-year estimates. For the most populous areas, those with at least 65,000 people, sample data collected over just 12 months can be generalized to an area's whole population. For less populous areas, down to below 20,000 people, data have to be collected over five years to generate representative samples.

As of the end of May 2019, the Bureau had over 330 corrective actions from its security assessments that needed to be addressed, including 217 that were considered \"high-risk\" or \"very high-risk.\" However, of these 217 corrective actions, the Bureau identified 104 as being delayed. Further, 74 of the 104 were delayed by 60 or more days. According to the Bureau, these corrective actions were delayed due to technical challenges or resource constraints. GAO recently recommended that the Bureau take steps to ensure that identified corrective actions for cybersecurity weaknesses are implemented within prescribed time frames.", "GAO commended the bureau for working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \"to support\" its \"cybersecurity efforts.\" During the past two years,", "as a result of these activities, the Bureau has received 42 recommendations from DHS to improve its cybersecurity posture. GAO recently recommended that the Bureau implement a formal process for tracking and executing appropriate corrective actions to remediate cybersecurity findings identified by DHS. Implementing the recommendation would help better ensure that DHS's efforts result in improvements to the Bureau's cybersecurity posture.", "The GAO testimony also called attention to a Commerce Department Office of Inspector General (IG) report identifying challenges in the bureau's \"cloud based systems\" supporting the census. The bureau \"agreed with all eight\" of the IG's recommendations concerning these systems and \"identified actions taken to address them.\"", "In addition, recognizing that \"many of the same digital and social channels\" being used to promote the census can work against it as well, the bureau established a \"trust and safety team\" to combat \"the spread of misinformation (incorrect information spread unintentionally) and disinformation (incorrect information spread intentionally).\" According to the bureau, the team comprises \"more than a dozen communications and social media experts under the executive leadership of career senior officials.\" It is coordinating the bureau's \"efforts with external technology and social media platforms, partner and stakeholder organizations, and cybersecurity officials.\" Drawing on \"best practices from the public and private sectors,\" the team is monitoring \"all available channels and open platforms for misinformation and disinformation about the census.\" The bureau also has launched a \"Fighting 2020 Census Rumors\" page on its website and has asked members of the public to email [email address scrubbed] if they see any \"resources,\" social media postings, or websites that they think contain incorrect information about the census.", "Noteworthy in this context is a December 19, 2019, press report of an announcement by the social media company Facebook that, starting in 2020, it \"will remove posts, photos,\" and other contents \"that mislead people\" about the census, \"aiming to prevent malicious actors from interfering\" with the process. \"Under the new rules, Facebook will ban posts from misrepresenting when and how the census occurs, who can participate and what happens to the personal information people submit to the government, company executives said.\" According to the article, \"Facebook and other tech giants, including Google and Twitter, have huddled with government officials in recent months to prevent census disinformation.\" Other companies \"have unveiled their own defensive measures: Google in December said it prohibited ads and YouTube videos that aim to misinform about the 2020 count.
