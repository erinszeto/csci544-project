Although there are no government agencies or private sector companies that perform duties identical to that of USPS, it may be helpful to examine the pay rates of public and private-sector managers at entities that perform some identical services, provide some identical products, require a similar managerial skills, or are of a similar size. Examining the pay rates of these individuals may provide Congress with a broader context of USPS managerial pay."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Private Sector", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, federal law provides USPS the authority to set officer and employee pay rates \"on a standard of comparability to the compensation and benefits paid for comparable levels of work in the private sector of the economy\" (emphasis in original). To determine whether officer and employee pay rates are comparable, therefore, it is necessary to determine which private-sector positions would be considered comparable to certain positions within USPS. CRS selected three private-sector corporations that might be considered comparable to USPS for a variety of reasons: FedEx, the United Parcel Service (UPS), and Amtrak.", "FedEx provides a variety of transportation, e-commerce, and delivery services around the world and competes with USPS on some products and services. In FY2011, FedEx paid its Chairman, President, and CEO Frederick W. Smith $1.23 million in salary. When Mr. Smith's awards, non-equity incentives, and other compensation are added to that salary, his total compensation was $7.26 million in FY2011. FedEx does not list all the benefits and perquisites provided to Mr. Smith and other executives, but it does list life insurance premiums, 401(k) matching contributions, and other tax reimbursements among the benefits Mr. Smith received. In FY2011, FedEx reported it had 255,573 average full-time employees worldwide and had revenues of $39.3 billion.", "UPS is a global delivery company that provides specialized transportation and logistics services. Like FedEx, UPS competes with USPS on some products and services. FY2011 compensation data for UPS was unavailable. In FY2010, however, D. Scott Davis, Chairman and CEO of UPS, reported receipt of a $1 million salary and $10.73 million in total compensation. Benefits provided to Mr. Davis appear to be similar to those offered to the PMG, and include life insurance, financial planning, and health benefits. Nearly $7.8 million of Mr. Davis's total compensation for FY2010 was earned in stock options. UPS's website says it has 398,300 employees worldwide and earned $53.1 billion in revenue in 2011.", "Amtrak, also known as the National Rail Passenger Corporation, is a private organization that has received a federal subsidy every year since its inception in 1971. Like USPS, Amtrak has struggled financially. Amtrak's president's salary is currently $350,000. 49 USC \u00a724303(b) of the U.S. Code covers the pay of Amtrak officers. It reads:", "The board [of directors] may fix the pay of the officers of Amtrak.\u00a0An officer may not be paid more than the general level of pay for\u00a0officers of rail carriers with comparable responsibility. The\u00a0preceding sentence shall not apply for any fiscal year for which no\u00a0Federal assistance is provided to Amtrak.

The President's pay is $400,000. The President is provided an additional expense allowance, at present $50,000, which is not taxable and is to be used for official purposes only. All cabinet department secretaries are paid at Level I of the Executive Schedule ($199,700 in 2012). When calculating total compensation for federal employees, the Congressional Budget Office generally adds 30% of the employee's pay. Total compensation of the cabinet secretaries, therefore, would be about $259,610 in FY2012.", "There are few federal employees whose pay is higher than that of the President. Tom Kilgore, the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2014a corporation owned by the U.S. Government, reported earning $850,000 in 2011.

Both the House and Senate proposals are components of bills that, in their entirety, seek to improve the Postal Service's condition.", "Broadly speaking, USPS's present financial troubles are caused by falling revenues and rising operating costs. In recent years, both the economic downturn and the widespread adoption of electronic communication have eroded postage sales. The USPS's operating costs have increased, in part, to the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA), which requires USPS to prefund its future retirees' health benefits at a cost of approximately $5.6 billion per year. Federal law also obligates USPS to provide a wide range of services over a large geographic area six days per week at affordable and uniform prices. This \"universal service obligation,\" as the PRC has noted, costs the USPS approximately $4.4 billion per year. Meanwhile, the value of the USPS's monopoly (as the sole postal service provider), has fallen (because of the decline in mail volume) and generates perhaps $3.5 billion in annual revenues. ", "USPS executives are in an unusual position. They operate an entity with substantial legally conferred advantages (e.g., USPS does not pay tax), but they have limited control over many of the factors that drive USPS's revenues and costs. This makes it complex to assess the performance of USPS executives and align their pay accordingly. Whether the USPS runs a profit or deficit in any one year is not entirely dependent upon the actions of the USPS's top executives.", "Congress may decide that current USPS executive pay rates are at the optimum level to attract appropriate candidates to USPS's executive roles\u2014those who can balance USPS's autonomy, legal obligations, and oversight requirements. In that case, USPS would be authorized to pay up to 12 of its critical senior executives compensation greater than that of the Vice President\u2014and in some cases the President\u2014ranking the PMG and other senior executives at USPS among the highest paid federal employees. Maintaining these levels of pay would arguably more closely align the compensation of the PMG and other high-ranking USPS employees with the basic salary of private sector employees at comparable organizations. ", "Alternatively, Congress has the authority to modify USPS's executive pay structure and total compensation in a variety of ways. Reducing pay for critical USPS positions, for example, may bring USPS executives' salaries more closely in line with that of other top federal officials. Currently, postal executives may be paid as much as the secretaries of Cabinet departments, and up to 12 executives can receive pay at a rate higher than that of the Vice President. Postal executives' total compensation, therefore, may prompt questions about whether their jobs are worth more to the federal government than those of other senior federal officials. ", "It is unclear whether reducing executive compensation would encourage current USPS leadership to seek employment elsewhere in government or in the private sector. Pay reductions could also lead to lower levels of interest from qualified candidates for these positions. However, the same disincentive for federal service would apply to other senior executive positions across the government.", "The nation's economic challenges and the USPS's persistent deficits are viewed by some as reasons for reducing USPS executive pay and eliminating bonuses. Yet, tying postal executive pay to the USPS's financial performance raises the question\u2014is appropriate to increase executive compensation in better economic times or when the USPS runs profits? ", "Finally, USPS's use of deferred compensation has drawn considerable attention. On the one hand, deferred compensation (and executive perquisites) enable the USPS to offer more appealing compensation packages to individuals it wishes to hire or retain. On the other hand, deferred compensation and perquisites do not neatly comport with federal statutory pay caps, and might be viewed by some as a way to evade pay limits. Furthermore, deferred compensation also can lead to situations where individuals no longer employed by the USPS continue to draw significant compensation. Former PMG Potter, for example, will continue to receive deferred pay benefits until 2020 although he retired from USPS in FY2010. Such a prohibition, however, could make postal executive positions less attractive to candidates who are qualified for the jobs or prompt current USPS executives to seek employment outside of the service."], "subsections": []}]}}
