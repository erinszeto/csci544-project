In his 2011 State of the Union address, President Obama proposed the concept of a Clean Energy Standard (CES) that would result in 80% of U.S. electricity generation from clean energy sources by 2035. In March of 2012, the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 (S. 2146) was introduced in the Senate.", "The primary goal of S. 2146 is to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the U.S. electricity sector, which represents approximately 41% of total U.S. CO2 emissions. Generally, the approach used to achieve this goal is to require certain utility companies to source a portion of their electricity generation from qualified clean energy generators. Utilities located in either Alaska or Hawaii are exempted from CES requirements.", "Some utility companies that sell electricity directly to consumers (retail sales) would be required to comply with the CES. Determining which utilities have to comply is based on each utility company's total amount of annual retail sales. Starting in 2015, a utility company that sold more than 2 million megawatthours (MWh) of electricity to consumers would be required to comply. The retail sales level for compliance decreases by 100,000 MWh each year until 2025, where it remains constant at 1 million MWh. These thresholds represent a minority of electric utilities but a majority of U.S. electricity sales.", "Utilities required to comply with the CES would need to obtain a percentage of their electricity from qualified clean energy generators. In 2015 the minimum percentage is 24% and rises to 84% by 2035. The percentage is applied to a utility company's total retail sales; however, all electricity obtained from hydropower and nuclear power facilities placed in service before 1992 can be deducted from the sales base, potentially making compliance easier.", "The bill provides a four-part definition of electricity that would qualify as \"clean energy\": (1) electricity from renewable energy, biomass, natural gas, hydropower, nuclear power, or waste-to-energy facilities placed in service after 1991, (2) electricity from combined heat and power (CHP) systems or any non-biomass energy source that emits less than 0.82 metric tons of CO2 per MWh, (3) certain efficiency or capacity additions to nuclear or hydropower facilities that were placed in service before 1992, and (4) electricity from facilities that capture and store CO2.", "Utility companies can comply with the CES requirement by submitting clean energy credits, making alternative compliance payments (ACP), or a combination thereof. The ACP design element essentially caps the cost of CES compliance. ACP levels start at three cents per kilowatthour in 2015 and increase by 5% annually thereafter.", "Analysis by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that enactment of S. 2146 could result in the following changes to the U.S. power sector in 2035, compared to EIA's reference case projections: (1) CO2 emissions from electric power facilities decline 44%, (2) electricity from coal decreases by 54%, (3) nuclear power and non-hydro renewable electricity increases by 62% and 34%, respectively, and (4) average electricity prices increase by 18%. EIA also notes that regional price disparity among exempt and non-exempt utilities could range between 3% and 30%.

Several CES policies have been proposed in the past, although none have become law.", "According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the electric power sector represents approximately 41% of U.S. energy-related CO 2 emissions. The remaining 59% of CO 2 emissions are from the transportation (33%) and buildings/infrastructure (26%) sectors. Unlike previous carbon reduction policy proposals, S. 2146 is focused only on CO 2 emission reductions in the U.S. electric power sector.", "The concept of a U.S. clean energy standard was proposed by President Barack Obama in his 2011 State of the Union address, and the White House subsequently published a proposed framework for a federal CES. In March of 2011, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee (SENR) released a Clean Energy Standard white paper that solicited feedback on several CES policy design questions. On March 1, 2012, the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 ( S. 2146 ) was introduced in the Senate.

Beginning in 2015, S. 2146 requires utilities that sold 2 million MWh or more the previous calendar year to comply with the CES. The annual sales threshold for utility compliance declines by 100,000 MWh each year from 2015 to 2025, after which the level remains constant at 1 million MWh of annual electricity sales.", "This electricity sales threshold exempts the majority of utility companies from having to comply with the CES. According to EIA data, there are more than 3,500 utility companies operating in the contiguous 48 United States. Preliminary analysis based on 2010 electric utility sales data indicates that just over 300 utility companies would be required to comply with the CES starting in 2015 (see Figure 1 ). However, these 300 utility companies required to comply with the CES would represent approximately 81% of total national electricity sales. ", "As the threshold sales level decreases from year 2015 to 2025, the number of utility companies required to comply gradually increases to nearly 500 in 2025 (see Figure 2 ), at which time approximately 87% of national electricity sales would be subject to CES requirements.

(Definitions for qualified clean energy are discussed and provided in the next section.) Clean energy includes electricity generated from facilities using renewables, nuclear, natural gas, and other specific energy sources, that were placed in service after 1991, plus other technologies described in the next section of this report. ", "The standard requires a minimum of 24% clean energy by 2015. The percentage requirement increases an additional 3% each year until 2035, when 84% of electricity sold from non-exempt utilities must be sourced from clean energy generators (see Figure 3 ). Non-exempt utility companies can deduct their hydropower and nuclear power electricity generation, as long as the electricity is generated from facilities placed in service before 1992, from their applicable sales base. This deduction could potentially make it easier for certain utilities (especially those with large amounts of hydropower and nuclear power in their portfolio) to comply with the standard as a result of decreasing the total amount of qualified clean energy needed to meet annual CES compliance requirements (see example in Table 1 ). ", " Table 1 provides an illustrative example of how the pre-1992 nuclear and hyropower deduction might affect the amount of qualified clean energy needed by three hypothetical utility companies in order to comply with the CES. In this example, three hypothetical utility companies with different generation fuel mixes, but the same amount of total electricity sales (2 million MWh annually), are compared. As Table 1 indicates, CES compliance requirements for different utilities can vary depending on the fuel sources used for generation.

Approximately 93% (nuclear, natural gas, and renewables) of this electric power capacity would qualify under the \"clean energy\" definition (see Figure 4 ).

Changes to the electric power fuel mix are projected to reduce electric sector CO 2 emissions in 2035 by 44% when compared to EIA's reference case scenario. As with any long-term forecast, models used to calculate such estimates are subject to certain economic, cost, technology, market, and other assumptions that can make the accuracy and reliability of long-range projections questionable. EIA's analysis compares two scenarios (Reference and S. 2146 ) with identical macro-level assumptions and adds policy parameters defined in the CES to the S. 2146 scenario. While this approach may not be able to accurately predict what will actually happen in 2035, it does provide some indication of potential changes to the electric power sector associated with the CES policy design.
