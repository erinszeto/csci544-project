It is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and funded through contributions from two government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, rather than through appropriations. Due to concerns about Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's financial position, their contributions to the HTF were suspended for several years before the program had ever received any funding. More recently, however, their contributions to the HTF have begun. The first funding was transferred to the HTF in early 2016.", "In general, affordable housing trust funds provide dedicated, permanent sources of funding for affordable housing that do not require annual appropriations.

(The contributions began in 2015, with the first funds transferred to the HTF in 2016.) At the same time, policymakers who oppose the Housing Trust Fund have made efforts to repeal it or to prevent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from contributing to it while they remain in conservatorship. In recent Congresses, legislation has been introduced to fund the HTF through alternate sources, as well as to eliminate it entirely. The HTF has also been debated in the context of broader housing finance reform efforts, which are largely concerned with proposals for how to reform, eliminate, or replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Advocates wanted a national housing trust fund to be capitalized with new resources devoted to affordable housing activities, rather than resources diverted from other federal affordable housing programs.

In light of this shortage, supporters of a national housing trust fund argue that there is a need for funds specifically targeted to the production of rental housing affordable to households with the lowest incomes\u2014particularly those with incomes at or below 30% of the area median income. Most federal affordable housing programs are targeted towards making existing housing more affordable to low-income households, such as by providing rental assistance, rather than producing or rehabilitating additional housing units that will be affordable to low-income households.

For example, the largest federal rental housing production program, Treasury's Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), helps develop rental units for households with incomes at or below 50% or 60% of area median income. Similarly, HUD's HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME program), which provides funds to states and local governments to use for a variety of housing activities, must be used to benefit households with incomes at or below 80% of area median income or, in the case of most rental housing, at or below 60% of area median income. Furthermore, while HOME funds can be used for rental housing production, they can also be used for a range of other purposes, including activities such as homebuyer assistance, rehabilitating owner-occupied homes, or rental assistance.

The bill would have retained the Housing Trust Fund and directed the new entity to make contributions to the Housing Trust Fund through a fee on covered mortgage-backed securities. ", "In the 114 th Congress, no comprehensive housing finance reform legislation has been considered by committee. However, to the extent that Congress considers Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's status in the future, the Housing Trust Fund is likely to be part of the debate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Provide Additional Funding to the HTF", "paragraphs": ["HERA allows other funds to be \"appropriated, transferred, or credited\" to the Housing Trust Fund. In the years following the suspension of contributions to the Housing Trust Fund, affordable housing advocates searched for both a new dedicated source of permanent funding for the Housing Trust Fund and for a source of funding to initially capitalize the Housing Trust Fund. Although FHFA directed the GSEs to begin their contributions to the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund in December 2014, housing advocates continue to search for additional sources of funding for the Housing Trust Fund. ", "A range of other potential sources of either permanent or initial funding have been suggested by advocates. In recent years, some have proposed generating funding for the HTF through changes to the mortgage interest deduction that would presumably result in lower tax expenditures associated with the deduction. ", "In the 114 th Congress, multiple bills have been introduced to provide additional funding to the Housing Trust Fund. The Common Sense Housing Investment Act of 2015 ( H.R. 1662 ) would make changes to the mortgage interest deduction and direct some of the savings projected to result from such changes to the Housing Trust Fund and some to other housing programs. Versions of the Common Sense Housing Investment Act were also introduced in the 113 th Congress ( H.R. 1213 ) and the 112 th Congress ( H.R. 6677 ). The Pathways out of Poverty Act of 2015 ( H.R. 2721 ) would also provide funding to the Housing Trust Fund from savings generated by changes to the mortgage interest deduction. A version of that bill was also introduced in the 113 th Congress.", "Another bill in the 114 th Congress, the Ending Homelessness Act of 2016 ( H.R. 4888 ), would appropriate $1 billion per year in mandatory funding out of general Treasury funds for the Housing Trust Fund, as well as another $50 million for rental assistance for Housing Trust Fund units. In previous Congresses, other bills would also have provided funds to the Housing Trust Fund from the general fund of the Treasury. For many years, the President's budget requests requested $1 billion in mandatory funding from general Treasury funds be provided to the Housing Trust Fund as well.", "Other bills in previous Congresses proposed providing funds to the Housing Trust Fund from funds related to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP was a temporary program created in 2008 to address the financial crisis and provided Treasury with temporary authority to purchase or insure troubled assets owned by financial institutions. Some bills would have used TARP funds directly to fund the Housing Trust Fund, while other bills would have used funds from dividends paid to Treasury or the sale of warrants under TARP. ", "Other than the original funding mechanism in HERA, no funding for the Housing Trust Fund has been included in annual appropriations acts or in any other enacted legislation to date. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Eliminate or Limit Funding for the HTF", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, some in Congress criticize the Housing Trust Fund as being duplicative of other programs or express concerns that it is funded outside the appropriations process or could be vulnerable to misuse. Furthermore, some have argued that the GSEs should not be diverting funding to affordable housing programs while they remain in government conservatorship.", "There have been several bills introduced in the 114 th Congress and previous Congresses to either eliminate the Housing Trust Fund entirely, or to limit the circumstances under which it can receive funding from the GSEs. For example, in the 114 th Congress:", "The Pay Back the Taxpayers Act of 2015 ( H.R. 574 ) would prohibit Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from providing any funding to the Housing Trust Fund or the Capital Magnet Fund while in government conservatorship or receivership. A version of this bill was also introduced in the 113 th Congress ( H.R. 3901 ). The House-passed version of the FY2016 HUD appropriations bill ( H.R. 2577 ) would have diverted any funding provided to the Housing Trust Fund to HUD's HOME program instead. However, such a provision was not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), the law that provided final FY2016 HUD appropriations. ", "In addition, the Housing Finance Restructuring Act of 2016 ( H.R. 4913 ) would provide for the end of the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and require the entities to rebuild capital. The contributions to the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund would be suspended until Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had rebuilt a certain amount of capital, but the contributions would continue once that capital threshold was reached. ", "In the 113 th Congress, the New Fair Deal Banking and Housing Stability Act of 2013 ( H.R. 3550 ) would have eliminated several government policies, programs, and agencies related to housing and mortgage markets, including repealing the Housing Trust Fund. In the 112 th Congress, the GSE Bailout Elimination and Taxpayer Protection Act was introduced in both the House and the Senate ( H.R. 1182 and S. 693 , respectively) and would have repealed the section of law that established the Housing Trust Fund. The Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011 ( H.R. 2441 ) would have eliminated the Housing Trust Fund and transferred any amounts available in the fund to the Treasury, to be used solely for the purpose of reducing the federal budget deficit. None of these bills were enacted.", "Appendix A. Previous Legislative Proposals to Establish a National Housing Trust Fund ", "Prior to the enactment of HERA, legislation to establish a national affordable housing trust fund was introduced several times, beginning in the 106 th Congress. This appendix provides a brief description of previous legislative proposals to establish a national housing trust fund.", "One major question surrounding the creation of an affordable housing trust fund was how such a program would be funded. Early legislation proposed using a portion of receipts from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). However, because FHA receipts are counted as offsets to appropriations, diverting FHA receipts to a housing trust fund would have a cost.", "Later legislation proposed using contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a potential funding source. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were chartered by Congress to ensure liquidity in the mortgage market. Their charters give them a special relationship with the federal government that includes both certain privileges and certain responsibilities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages from private lenders, guarantee the principal and interest payments on the mortgages, and package them into mortgage-backed securities that they either hold on their balance sheets or sell to investors. They are overseen by an independent federal regulator. ", "Because of the GSEs' status as government-sponsored private entities, rather than federal agencies, contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would not have counted as new government spending. However, there was some disagreement over whether it was appropriate for the government to require the GSEs to contribute to affordable housing funds. Opponents of GSE contributions argued that the GSEs should not be asked to balance public policy objectives against the interests of their shareholders. Proponents pointed to the special privileges that the GSEs received, and statutory affordable housing goals that they already had, to justify their contributions to a national housing trust fund. ", "In 2008, HERA created the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund. Both were to be funded by contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Table A-1 summarizes previous legislation that had been introduced to create a national housing trust fund, including proposed funding sources.", "Appendix B. State HTF Allocations in 2016", "HUD announced the first state allocations from the Housing Trust Fund in May 2016.
