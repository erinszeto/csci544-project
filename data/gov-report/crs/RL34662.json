The initial basis is usually cost; however, the basis of a gift is related to its basis in the donor's hands, and the basis of inherited property is generally the property's fair market value on the date of death.

Unlike other proposals for homebuyer tax credits considered by the 110 th Congress ( H.R. 5565 ; S. 12 , S. 2566 , S. 2734 ), taxpayers generally are not required to reduce their basis in their newly acquired property by the amount of the credit, but are required to pay the credit back. There is a provision for reducing the basis by the credit if the taxpayer sells the property before repaying the credit. In this case, the reduced basis is used to determine whether the taxpayer must repay the remaining credit.", "Other recently passed legislation requires reduction in the basis of a taxpayer's principal residence if the taxpayer has cancelled mortgage debt that is excluded from gross income ( P.L. 110-142 ).

When property is sold, taxpayers must report gain if the amount received for the property is more than the property's tax basis. Gain must be reported even if the property was only used for personal purposes. When the tax basis is more than the property's sales price, the result is a loss. However, the loss generally cannot be used on a tax return if the property was only used for personal purposes. When property is abandoned, a taxpayer who used the property to produce income may be able to deduct the basis of the property on the tax return for the year in which the property is abandoned.

Whichever date is chosen by the estate for valuation, generally the property is valued at its fair market value on that date. There are some special rules for family farm property, and the value of minority shares of stock in closely-held corporations may be reduced. However, the general rule is that when property is inherited, the recipient's basis in the inherited property is the fair market value of the property on the date of death. This \"step-up\" in basis would be eliminated for one year in 2010, but under current law, would be in effect for years after 2010.

Thus, this property's basis would be zero at the end of the first tax year.", "Property with a useful life of more one year includes equipment, automobiles, and buildings, including rental property. For this property, the original basis of business-use property is reduced each year by the depreciation that is allowable on the tax return whether or not that depreciation was actually claimed on the tax return. If the taxpayer claimed more depreciation than was allowable, the larger amount is used to reduce basis. This means that if depreciation could have been taken, it will reduce the basis of the property even if that depreciation was never claimed on a tax return.

The most common example of this involves the purchase of a principal residence. Current law allows the buyer to take a deduction on Form 1040 Schedule A for the points that were paid by the seller. The basis of the residence then must be reduced by the amount of the points. Tax credits for those who purchase certain financially distressed properties as their principal residence were proposed in the 110 th Congress.

The credit is generally repaid over a 15-year period and the basis of the property is not reduced by the credit. However, if the property is sold before the credit is fully repaid, the taxpayer generally must repay the remaining amount in the year of the sale. An exception exists if the gain on the sale is less than the outstanding credit. To determine whether any or all of the outstanding credit must be repaid, the gain must be recalculated.

It is not used to determine the gain realized for tax purposes.", "A less common situation in which basis in personal-use property would be reduced involves an easement. In this situation, the property owner grants someone else the perpetual right to non-exclusive use of part of the property. An example would be allowing an adjacent property owner to use a driveway on the first owner's land. If payment was received in exchange for this perpetual right, the amount received for the use of the driveway would reduce the basis of the land where the driveway was located. Another situation would involve a severance award connected with an \"involuntary conversion\" or \"condemnation.\" An example would be a house owned on a narrow street that the city has decided to widen. Part of the land the house is on will be used for the wider street.

In contrast, improvements would include adding a room to your house, replacing the entire roof on a building, paving a driveway, putting a new engine in a car, and replacing a small stone in a ring with a larger one. Improvements also include restoring damaged property to the condition it was in before the casualty loss.", "In the case of a casualty loss, such as the car with hail damage that was discussed above, basis would have been reduced by the insurance settlement, but restoring the car to its previous condition would increase the basis by the amount spent on restoration. As an example, consider a car whose adjusted basis was $11,000 before the hail damage. The insurance company determined that there was $1,500 in damage to the car. The owner's policy had a $500 deductible; therefore, the check from the insurance was only $1,000. The adjusted basis in the car is $10,000 ($11,000 - $1,000) after the owner receives the insurance check. By shopping around, the owner finds someone who will restore the car for $1,200. The basis in the car after the owner pays $1,200 for the restoration is $11,200 ($10,000 + $1,200). It does not matter that the restoration was done for less than the insurance company estimated. Similarly, if the owner found that all the reputable repair facilities cost more than the $1,500 estimated by the insurance company, the basis would be increased by the amount paid for the restoration. If the restoration cost $1,800, the owner's basis in the car would be $11,800 after restoring it. Furthermore, the cost of restoring damaged property increases the property's basis even if there had been no decrease in the basis from insurance proceeds (or other settlement).", "When free labor, by the owner or by friends and family, is used to improve property, there is no increase in basis for the value of the work performed\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes called \"sweat equity.\" The value of the property may increase, but the basis is unchanged unless there are out-of-pocket expenses incurred for the improvements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "How Is Basis Used in Tax Law?", "paragraphs": ["Basis determines whether there is a gain or loss when property is sold.
