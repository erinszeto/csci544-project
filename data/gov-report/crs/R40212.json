Some programs exclusively offer early childhood services (e.g., Head Start), while others are broad-based funding streams for which such services are among many allowable uses (e.g., Temporary Assistance for Needy Families). Often have differing policy goals, target populations, program services, and administrative rules. Some target a particular service (e.g., home visiting, child care), while others target a particular population (e.g., special needs children, working parents). Many programs target low-income families, but some programs and tax provisions benefit middle- and upper-income families.", "Currently, some of the largest federal investments in targeted early childhood programs come from HHS, through programs such as Head Start ($9.2 billion in FY2016) and the Child Care and Development Block Grant ($5.7 billion in combined mandatory and discretionary funding in FY2016). Two child care-related tax provisions (combining to account for an estimated $5.5 billion in FY2016) and the USDA's Child and Adult Care Food Program (estimated at $3.3 billion in FY2016) also provide substantial financial contributions to federal early childhood initiatives.

Programs Not Currently Funded", "Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC)", "Race to the Top (RTT) was first authorized in FY2009 under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ). Initially, the RTT program was designed to provide competitive grants to states implementing certain specified K-12 education reforms. The FY2009 law did not explicitly authorize or designate RTT funding for early childhood activities. However, the FY2011 appropriations law ( P.L. 112-10 ) subsequently amended the initial RTT program, authorizing ED to reserve a portion of RTT funds for competitive grants to states for the improvement of early childhood care and education. The appropriations law specified that ED should jointly administer this new program with HHS. Under this new authority, ED established the Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC) grant program to support states in (1) establishing statewide data systems; (2) aligning high-quality standards across programs; (3) implementing statewide early learning standards; (4) improving the early childhood workforce; and (5) measuring children's outcomes and progress across developmental domains. In each of FY2011-FY2013, ED reserved a portion of its total RTT funds for RTT-ELC grants, including $500 million in FY2011, $133 million in FY2012, and $370 million in FY2013. Over the course of this three-year period, 20 states received one or more RTT-ELC grant. No new funding has been provided for the RTT-ELC since FY2013.

Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs (Even Start)", "The 2015 ESEA reauthorization law (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ) eliminated the authorization for Even Start programs, which had previously been authorized under ESEA Title I, Part B, Subpart 3. The Even Start programs were intended to integrate early childhood education, adult basic education, and parenting skills education into a unified family literacy program. When funded, these programs provided grants to states, which then distributed the funds to eligible entities (consisting of a local education agency (LEA) in collaboration with a community based organization). Even Start generally served children ages 0-7 and their parents. Even Start services were required to include adult literacy instruction, early childhood education, instruction to help parents support their child's education, participant recruitment, screening of parents, staff training, and home-based instruction. ", "Even Start was first authorized in 1989 and grew rapidly in its early years. However, evaluations suggested the program had not been effective in improving child and adult learning outcomes. Even Start funding subsequently declined from a high of $250 million in FY2002 to $66 million in FY2010, the last year in which the program received annual appropriations.", "For more information, see CRS Report RL30448, Even Start Family Literacy Programs: An Overview , by [author name scrubbed]. ", "Early Reading First", "The 2015 ESEA reauthorization law (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ) eliminated the authorization for the Early Reading First program, which had previously been authorized by ESEA Title I, Part B, Subpart 2. The Early Reading First program supported local efforts to enhance the school readiness of young children\u2014particularly those from low-income families\u2014through scientific research-based strategies and professional development designed to enhance the verbal skills, phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and pre-reading skills of preschool age children. When funded, this program authorized ED to award competitive grants for up to six years at a time to eligible LEAs or to public or private organizations located within eligible LEAs. ", "The Early Reading First program received $113 million from the FY2009 Omnibus ( P.L. 111-8 ), which is the last time the program was funded. President Obama's FY2010 budget requested $163 million for the program, an increase of $50 million over FY2009 funding. However, the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-117 ) provided no funding for Early Reading First. Instead, Congress expanded the mission of the Striving Readers program from focusing solely on improving adolescent literacy, to improving the literacy and pre-literacy skills of students from preschool through high school. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriation increased funding for Striving Readers to $250 million (an increase of about $215 million from FY2009) and reserved about 15% (or $37.5 million) for children ages 0-5. No funding has been requested for Early Reading First since the FY2010 President's budget, and no funding has been appropriated for this program since FY2009.", "Early Childhood Educator Professional Development", "The Department of Education has provided competitive grants to partnerships to improve the knowledge and skills of early childhood educators who work in communities that have high concentrations of children living in poverty. Funding in FY2006 and FY2007 remained stable at approximately $14.5 million, but FY2007 was the last year in which funds were appropriated. ", "Early Learning Fund/Early Learning Opportunities Act Program", "This HHS program (referred to by both names), authorized by the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 106-554 ), was last funded in FY2005 at $36 million. When funded, the program provided grants to communities to enhance school readiness for children under five, specifically supporting efforts to improve children's cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development. Although authorized at $600 million, FY2003 funding for the program was set at $25 million; FY2004 funding was set at $34 million (despite President Bush's FY2003 budget proposal to eliminate the program); and in FY2005, P.L. 108-199 included $36 million for the Early Learning Fund. FY2005 was the last year in which this program received funding. ", "Appendix B. Acronyms Used in This Report"], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
