Each year, Congress deliberates legislation that could affect DOI's management of this vast federal estate. As a result, understanding the roles and responsibilities of DOI's various components and offices is valuable when crafting legislation that affects the department's operations and ability to fulfill its mission.", "DOI primarily implements its responsibilities and mission through nine technical bureaus that make up more than 80% of the agency's workforce.

In addition to these technical bureaus, DOI has multiple departmental offices, which provide leadership, coordination, and services to DOI's various bureaus and programs.", "As of June 2018, DOI employed a staff of 69,563 nationwide across its bureaus and offices. However, total DOI employment figures fluctuate throughout the year, as some bureaus rely on seasonal and part-time staff, increasing staff totals during the summer months. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) reports the average total DOI employment as 65,350 for the four reporting periods from September 2017 to June 2018. The largest bureau within DOI based on number of staff is NPS, which averaged close to 20,000 staff over the same time period\u2014more than twice the size of the second-largest bureau, BLM.

Over the course of the department's roughly 170-year history, DOI has evolved in response to the needs of the nation and at the behest of Congress and the President (see Figure 1 for a timeline of selected events that influenced the current structure of the department). Some of these changes have been relatively broad in nature, such as the creation of a new agency or regulatory body. Other shifts have been smaller in scope, such as modifications to interagency processes or reorganizations in how resources or responsibilities are distributed among offices or programs.", "DOI reorganization proposals put forth by the Trump Administration have renewed attention to the structural relationship between the department's various bureaus and their regulatory responsibilities.

In September 2017, then-Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke issued a reorganization proposal for DOI in response to this order. In June 2018, President Trump issued a more expansive government-wide reorganization proposal, which included further recommendations and proposals affecting the structure of DOI.

Meanwhile, the General Land Office (GLO), which oversaw and disposed of the public domain, was placed by Congress within the Department of the Treasury because of the revenue generated by the GLO from land sales. ", "By the 1840s, the growing federal estate acquired through the Louisiana Purchase, the Mexican-American War, and the newly negotiated Oregon Territory placed an increasing burden on the departments and their leadership. In 1848, then-Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker submitted to Congress a proposal that would bring together GLO, the Office of Indian Affairs, and several other disparate offices and functions under a single, separate executive department. Congress officially established the Department of the Interior on March 3, 1849. ", "In addition to absorbing the functions of the Patent Office, the Office of Indian Affairs, Pension Office, and GLO, the newly established DOI assumed responsibility for a wide range of other domestic matters. As part of DOI's organic legislation, Congress conferred on the Secretary of the Interior the \"supervisory and appellate powers\" held by the President over the commissioner of Public Buildings, as well as oversight responsibility for both the U.S. Census and the Penitentiary of the District of Columbia. Over time, Congress further expanded the department's functions to include the construction of the national capital's water system, the colonization of freed slaves in Haiti, water pollution control, and the regulation of interstate commerce. Most of these early activities eventually were transferred from DOI's charge as Congress began to authorize and create new executive departments and independent agencies to handle this growing list of responsibilities.

Data are published on a quarterly basis (March, June, September, and December); however, figures for September and December 2018 were not available prior to the publication of this report. Because OPM data include full-time, part-time, and seasonal staff, employment totals tend to spike during the summer months, when agencies such as NPS, BLM, and FWS increase their seasonal workforce. ", "OPM figures differ from DOI Budget Office data. The DOI Budget Office calculates employment by full-time equivalents (FTEs), defined as the total number of regular straight-time hours (not including overtime or holiday hours) worked by employees, divided by the number of compensable hours applicable to each fiscal year. ", "The OPM Fedscope data presented in Table 1 are available by location of employment for each bureau and office reflected. Table 2 shows DOI employment figures both within and outside the DC core-based statistical area (CBSA). OPM defines a CBSA as \"a geographic area having at least one urban area of population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties.\" CBSAs differ from metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)\u2014a separate statistical definition also reported on by OPM\u2014which typically encompass a smaller geographic area than CBSAs.

Other changes\u2014including broader reorganization proposals put forth by the Trump Administration\u2014have been proposed for FY2019 but are not in effect.", "The 115 th Congress approved several internal office transfers and realignments. For instance, Congress transferred appropriations for the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) from DOI's Office of the Secretary to Department-Wide Programs for FY2018.

To comply with this requirement, the FY2019 budget request reflects the approved transfer of the Office of Appraisal Services within OST to the Office of the Secretary's Appraisal and Valuation Services Office, thereby consolidating all appraisal activities within a single entity. This change is in addition to a proposed shift in the reporting relationship of OST also included in the FY2019 request. Under this proposal, starting in FY2019, OST would report through the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs rather than directly to the Office of the Secretary (see Figure 2 ).", "As noted in the \" Introduction \" to this report, the Trump Administration also proposed additional, broader DOI reorganizational plans for consideration.

Included in this proposal is a plan to consolidate the various agency-specific regional boundaries (as seen in the \"At a Glance\" boxes included in each bureau summary) into 12 Unified Regional Boundaries. In addition, the plan looks to shift some resources and authority \"to the field,\" potentially in the form of staff, budget, and/or facilities.

The second recommendation would transfer NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service from the Department of Commerce to DOI and merge it with the FWS. This proposal would consolidate administration of the ESA and other wildlife laws under one agency.", "The transfers and reorganization proposals discussed here illustrate the potential changes in the structure of DOI and its operations.
