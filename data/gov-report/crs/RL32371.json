The relief provided is an additional import duty placed on the dumped imports.", "Countervailing duty (CVD) laws give a similar kind of relief to domestic industries that have been, or are threatened with, the adverse impact of imported goods that have been subsidized by a foreign government or public entity, and can therefore be sold at lower prices than similar goods produced in the United States. The relief provided is an additional import duty placed on the subsidized imports.", "Safeguard (also referred to as escape clause) laws give domestic industries relief from import surges of goods that are fairly traded. The most frequently applied safeguard law, Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, is designed to give domestic industry the opportunity to adjust to the new competition and remain competitive. The relief provided is generally an additional temporary import duty, a temporary import quota, or a combination of both. Safeguard laws also require presidential action in order for relief to be put into effect.", "This report outlines the statutory authority, investigative procedures, and statistical outcomes for (1) U.S. AD and CVD actions, and (2) U.S. safeguard actions.

Sections 301-310 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, give the United States Trade Representative (USTR) authority to enforce U.S. rights under international trade agreements and act against unfair foreign trade practices that burden U.S. trade.

A brief description of these trade remedy laws appears in an Appendix to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Interest", "paragraphs": ["Trade remedies have been a focus of much domestic and international debate in recent years. On the domestic front, the preservation of U.S. authority to \"enforce rigorously its trade laws\" was a major negotiating objective included in presidential Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in the 107 th Congress ( P.L. 107-210 ). Many in Congress continue to support this approach.", "Some in Congress also assert that the U.S. use of trade remedies is necessary to protect U.S. firms and workers from unfair international competition. Some also credit the existence of trade remedies with helping to increase public support for additional trade liberalization measures. These Members favor increased enforcement of trade remedies. Others in Congress, especially those who represent U.S. importers, manufacturers, or export-oriented businesses, tend to support revisions to the ADA and ASCM in ways that could make use of U.S. trade remedy laws less frequent and relief harder to obtain. For example, some in Congress have supported legislation introduced in previous sessions that would have required administering authorities to determine whether a trade remedy action (such as imposing an AD or CVD duty) is in the overall public interest before such a measure can be implemented.", "At the beginning of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Development Agenda (DDA or Doha Round) of multilateral trade negotiations, some WTO member countries were concerned about the intensifying worldwide use of trade remedies since the enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements in 1995. Developing nations, such as India and South Africa, had begun using trade remedy actions more frequently, while they were previously tools used almost exclusively by developed nations. The increasing international concern led several countries to press for negotiations on changes to the WTO Antidumping (formally known as the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI ) and Subsidies ( Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) Agreements, despite the efforts of U.S. trade negotiators and some in Congress to keep them off the table. Thus, although the DDA is now at an impasse, if a multilateral trade deal is ultimately reached, possible modifications to the WTO Antidumping and Subsidies agreements (and thus, possible changes in U.S. trade remedy laws) could become focus during congressional consideration. ", "Some congressional observers also expressed concern when WTO dispute settlement and Appellate Body panels made determinations against two U.S. trade remedy provisions, the Antidumping Act of 1916 and the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA)\u2014finding that these measures violated U.S. obligations under the WTO. The Antidumping Act of 1916 was repealed in the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2004 (Section 2006 of P.L. 108-429 , December 3, 2004). Despite considerable congressional resistance to repealing the CDSOA, it was ultimately repealed in a budget reconciliation bill in 2006 ( P.L. 109-171 ). However, since the repeal allowed disbursements under the act to continue for all goods entering the United States prior to October 1, 2007. Since collection of AD and CVD duties is a retrospective process, some domestic producers and interested parties continue to receive disbursements under the law. ", "An administrative practice used in AD and CVD investigations known as \"zeroing,\" (further discussed below) was also challenged in a WTO dispute, and on January 9, 2007, the WTO Appellate Body determined against the United States in a dispute on zeroing. The practice was also successfully challenged in numerous other WTO cases. Since zeroing is an administrative procedure used when calculating the amount of subsidies, some compliance in these disputes may be accomplished without legislative action. The Department of Commerce announced that it would modify its practices in some\u2014but not all\u2014AD/CVD calculations, and began implementing new administrative procedures in some cases in April 2007.

For example, many U.S. domestic manufacturers now import at least some portion of their product lines from overseas, thus possibly reducing their interest in bringing trade remedy cases.", "For example, a 2004 AD investigation on wooden bedroom furniture from China provided an illustration of the possible effects of globalization on the willingness of U.S. industries to petition for trade remedies. The initiation of this case created a deep and vocal controversy in the U.S. furniture industry because some of the larger U.S. companies were importing some furniture lines from China while continuing domestic production of more high-end items. Many furniture retailer/manufactures reportedly objected to the case brought by furniture industry petitioners because they feared that the higher prices caused by possible AD duties would depress sales and result in the layoffs of retail employees. Furniture makers and unions supporting the investigation countered that far more manufacturing jobs were being lost than would have been lost on the retail side. The debate was so heated that the ITA took the unusual step of polling the industry to determine whether there was sufficient industry support for the petition, which resulted in a finding that only slightly more than half of the industry approved. AD duties ranging from 2.3% to 198.08% were ultimately imposed on the targeted merchandise.", "Some observers have also acknowledged that the expansion of multinational corporations with operating plants all over the world could play a role in the apparent decline of trade remedy actions. For example, the largest steel manufacturer in the United States, for example, is now ArcelorMittal USA, a subsidiary of a global firm based in Luxembourg. Since these multinational firms often import goods from foreign subsidiaries to fill out U.S. product lines, they might be less inclined to favor trade remedy actions.", "A third reason that trade remedy initiations have declined in recent years may be related to the growth rate of the world economy. As Figure 3 also illustrates (see GDP Growth, right scale), AD and CVD petitions have historically tended to increase during periods of economic recession and decrease during growth periods. The increase in AD initiations in 2008 (and concurrent increases in CVD and safeguard initiations), then, could partially be a reflection of economic pressures facing industries as a result of the global economic crisis of 2008-2009. ", "Some economists have observed, however, that the worldwide increase in AD initiations in 2008 was not as great as might have been expected, or may have been brought about by reasons other than the crisis.

Second, some opponents found it controversial because it was inserted into the legislation during conference and received no committee or floor consideration in either House.

The level of retaliation was determined through arbitration, and most of the co-complainants in the case, including the European Union, India, Japan, and Korea, received formal WTO authorization to \"suspend concessions\" on targeted U.S. goods in late November 2004. Canada began assessing additional tariffs on U.S. exports of live swine, cigarettes, oysters, and specialty fish in May 2005. The European Union established an additional 15% tariff on imports of certain women's apparel, office supplies, crane trucks, sweet corn, and spectacle frames, also beginning on May 1, 2005.

The repeal language specified, however, that \"all duties on entries of goods made and filed before October 1, 2007 ... shall be distributed as if [the CDSOA] had not been repealed.\" ", "Industries still continue to receive CDSOA disbursements for several reasons. First, the almost two-year time difference between the repeal and the actual statutory date for the end of distributions allowed additional disbursements to continue. Second, AD and CV duties are not assessed until the product \"entry\" is actually liquidated (as opposed to being stored in a bonded customs warehouse) and the goods subsequently enter the commerce of the United States. Third, AD and CVD duties are applied retrospectively\u2014meaning that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) does not collect the payment for these duties until long after the goods have entered U.S. commerce. In many cases, AD and CV duty payments are collected more than a year after liquidation (and can be collected much later if the trade remedy action is disputed in court). Fourth, CDSOA payments are disbursed early (within 60 days) in the fiscal year following the date they are received. Since duties are collected and distributed in this fashion, the petitioners and industry supporters are likely to continue receiving CDSOA payments for some time.

This law, enacted as a funding offset, provided that no CDSOA payments may be distributed on entries of any goods that, on the date of enactment are: (1) not liquidated; and (2) not in litigation and not under an order of liquidation from the Commerce Department. On May 27, 2011, CBP announced that \"the full impact of the CDSOA repeal on distributions may be delayed for several years,\" due to the way that AD and CVD payments are collected, but that \"the amount of money available for distribution can be expected to diminish over time.\" ", "The European Union, Canada, Mexico, and Japan indicated that they would continue to retaliate against CDSOA disbursements until they actually cease.

In U.S. law, AD orders imposed on targeted merchandise must be equal to the dumping margin or \"the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise.\" the ITA typically calculates the margin by first identifying, to the extent possible, all U.S. transactions, sale prices, and levels of trade for each model or type of targeted merchandise sold by each company in the exporting country. These model types are then aggregated into subcategories, known as \"averaging groups,\" which are used to calculate the \"weighted average export price.\" The export prices for each subgroup are then compared to the corresponding agency-calculated \"weighted average normal value.\" Finally, the results of all of these comparisons are added up to establish the overall dumping margin of the targeted product.", "When authorities add up the dumping margins of each of the subgroups to establish an overall dumping margin for the subject merchandise, they sometimes encounter negative margins in a subgroup (an indicator that the items in that subcategory not being dumped). However, rather than including the negative margin in their calculations, which could result in a lower overall dumping margin, ITA officials factor in the results of that subgroup as a zero. Officials use a similar practice when recalculating dumping margins in administrative reviews of AD orders or suspension agreements. One justification for the zeroing practice is that the dumping margin could be skewed if, when determining the weighted average dumping margin, the subgroup that has the negative dumping margin represents a substantial percentage of export sales.", "The U.S. practice has been challenged in the WTO on a number of fronts. In these disputes, WTO dispute settlement and Appellate Body panels have found that the U.S. practice of zeroing is in violation of its obligations under the WTO Antidumping Agreement. For example, in February 6, 2004, the European Union formally requested the establishment of a dispute settlement panel on zeroing, citing 31 U.S. AD cases targeting products of the EU. The EU claimed that the dumping margin would have been minimal, or even negative, if U.S. officials had not used zeroing. A panel was established on March 19, 2004. In a split decision in late October 2005, the dispute settlement panel report found for the United States in its use of zeroing in the course of administrative reviews, but against U.S. practice when conducting initial investigations. On April 18, 2006, the Appellate Body found that the practice of zeroing could be challenged as it relates to original investigations, and upheld the panel's finding that the practice is inconsistent with Article 2.4.2 of the Antidumping Agreement. ", "As a result of this and other WTO disputes against the United States, zeroing has been found to be broadly prohibited in the calculation of duties in antidumping proceedings. Since WTO rulings have challenged a U.S. administrative practice rather than U.S. statutes, the practice may not necessarily require legislative action to implement. In the first dispute mentioned above, the United States told the DSB in May 2006 that it intended to implement the recommendations and rulings of the panels. On February 22, 2007, the ITA initiated proceedings under section 129 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA). the ITA recalculated the weighted-average dumping margins in twelve of the fifteen EU cases found to violate WTO rules (three of the AD orders had been previously revoked). The final recalculated dumping margins for eleven of the cases were announced on May 1, 2007, but the implementation of the finding in the twelfth case was delayed due to a clerical error in the underlying investigation. the ITA also announced that it would \"no longer make average-to-average comparisons in original antidumping duty investigations without providing offsets for non-dumped comparisons.\" ", "In a Federal Register notice published on December 28, 2010, the ITA requested public comments to revise its regulations regarding the calculation of the weighted average dumping margin in reviews to \"provide offsets for non-dumped comparisons while using monthly average-to-average comparisons in a manner that parallels the WTO-consistent methodology the Department currently applies in original investigations.\" The end of the public comment period, originally scheduled for January 27, 2011, was extended by the ITA to February 18, 2011.

If relief is granted due to an absolute increase in imports, China may retaliate after three years.", "Although the procedure under section 421 action is similar to that under section 201, the section 421 safeguard is different in four major respects: (1) the statute provides relief for subject merchandise from China only, whereas the remedy in section 201 applies to subject imports from all countries; (2) consultations with Chinese trade authorities are required; (3) in addition to the USITC, the USTR takes part in the procedure and also submits recommendations to the President; and (4) the standard for relief is \"market disruption\"\u2014a lower standard than in section 201 proceedings.", "To date, there have been seven section 421 investigations completed, as follows: Pedestal Actuators (USITC case number TA-421-1); Wire Hangers (TA-421-2); Brake Drums and Rotors (TA-421-3); Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings (TA-421-4); Uncovered Innerspring Mattress Units (TA-421-5); Circular Welded Non-Alloy Steel Pipe from China (TA-421-06); and Certain Passenger and Light Truck Vehicle Tires (TA-421-7). The USITC made affirmative determinations in five of these cases and negative determinations in two cases (brake drums and rotors and innerspring mattress units). In each of the four cases in which the USITC made affirmative determinations during the Bush Administration, the President decided not to grant relief because he determined that providing such relief was not in the national economic interest of the United States.

The remedy, effective September 26, 2009, imposes additional tariffs on tires imported from China for a three-year period, beginning with 35% ad valorem the first year, decreasing to 30% the second year, and 25% the third year.

The suggested USITC remedy was an additional duty on the subject merchandise for a three-year period, beginning at 55% ad valorem the first year and decreasing 10% each year the duty is imposed. The USITC also proposed that adversely impacted workers and firms should receive expedited consideration of Trade Adjustment Assistance by Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of the ITA if the required petitions are filed (as provided for in section 1802 of P.L. 111-5 ). ", "According to the section 421 statute, the USTR was required to make a recommendation to the President within 55 days of receiving the USITC's report, and the President had to determine whether to provide relief within 15 days of the USTR's recommendation.

Some key industries may currently be facing injury from increased import competition, which can lead to factory closures and loss of domestic manufacturing jobs. Some workers in the service sector are also feeling the effects of import competition due to increased offshore outsourcing. These factors, among others, are reasons that many in Congress support strengthening these laws and insist that the United States must preserve the ability to \"rigorously enforce its trade laws\" in international negotiations.", "Others believe that trade remedy actions (the vast majority of which are AD or CVD investigations and orders) in and of themselves introduce inefficiencies in both domestic and international economies that result in decreased economic welfare. For example, some in Congress have become concerned about the additional costs accruing to U.S. producers who use imports of intermediate goods subject to AD and CVD orders in finished products, such as steel, to manufacture finished products such as automobiles and buildings. In addition, in a global trading environment in which many domestic manufacturers (makers of shoes and furniture, for example) also import a portion of their product lines, the distinctions between U.S. domestic producers and foreign exporters have become less clear.", "Competitive advantage and a liberalized world trading system create both winners and losers in domestic economies. Acting on legislation in a manner consistent with previously agreed upon multilateral commitments, balancing that action with the need to regulate and minimize unfair trade practices, and assisting domestic import-competing industries to become more internationally viable presents Congress with policy challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
