For example, most FY2010 appropriations will be available for obligation from October 1, 2009, through September 30, 2010. Several applicable programs have authorization or appropriations provisions that allow funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year. For example, many of the elementary and secondary education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on July 1 of the same year as the appropriations, and remain available for 15 months through the end of the following fiscal year. That is, FY2010 appropriations for some programs will become available for obligation to the states on July 1, 2010, and will remain available until September 30, 2011. This budgetary procedure is popularly known as \"forward\" or \"multi-year\" funding, and is accomplished through funding provisions in the annual Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED) appropriations bill.", "Forward funding in the case of elementary and secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time for school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year. For Pell Grants for undergraduates, however, aggregate program costs for individual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time. Appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support Pell Grants during the following academic year; that is, the FY2010 appropriations will be used primarily to support grants for the 2010-2011 academic year. Unlike funding for elementary and secondary education programs, however, the funds for Pell Grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years. ", "An advance appropriation , as authorized by Section 421 of GEPA, occurs when the appropriation is provided for a fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation was enacted. For example, funds for obligation and expenditure in FY2011 are appropriated in the FY2010 L-HHS-ED act. In the case of FY2010 appropriations, funds normally would have become available October 1, 2009, under regular funding provisions, but may not become available for some programs until July 1, 2010, under the forward funding provisions discussed above. However, if the July 1, 2010, forward funding date for obligation was to be postponed by three months\u2014until October 1, 2010\u2014the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in a subsequent fiscal year , FY2011. Like forward funding provisions, these advance appropriations are specified through provisions in the annual appropriations bill. ", "At the appropriations level, there is no difference between forward funded and advance appropriations except for the period available for obligation. At the program or service level, relatively little is changed by the three-month delay in the availability of funds, since most expenditures for a standard school year occur after October 1. At the scorekeeping level, however, a significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year, and is therefore fully included in the current 302(b) allocation for discretionary appropriations. Under federal budget scorekeeping rules, an advance appropriation is not counted in the 302(b) allocation until the following year. In essence, a three-month change from forward funding to an advance appropriation for a given program allows a one-time shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations. Thus, Congress is able to provide funding for education and other programs in the appropriations for one fiscal year without having it count against the total amount available for discretionary appropriations in that fiscal year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extension of the Period of Availability of Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Section 421 of GEPA extends the period of availability of appropriations by one fiscal year for applicable programs. In practice, this section extends the period of obligation and expenditure of funds for applicable programs from 12 or 15 months to 24 or 27 months, respectively, depending on whether the program is forward funded. For example, if funds were made available on July 1, 2010, these funds would generally be available for obligation and expenditure until September 30, 2011. However, GEPA would extend the period for obligation and expenditure of these funds until September 30, 2012. Thus, if funds are appropriated for FY2010, they would generally be available for obligation and expenditure through September 30, 2010. While this provision may be useful to SEAs and LEAs in program planning and budgeting, it may also have the effect of providing additional time for funds to be expended in situations where the goal is to have funds expended as quickly as possible. Under these circumstances, statutory language would need to include provisions to override Section 421 of GEPA. For example, while funds made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) for existing education programs administered by ED were authorized for obligation and expenditure through FY2010, Section 421 of GEPA automatically extended the period of obligation and expenditure for these funds. If the intention of providing the funds was to have them be obligated and expended in the year in which they were appropriated (i.e., FY2009), statutory language would have needed to be included in ARRA to state that Section 421 of GEPA did not apply.

In practice, this provision has been used to extend education programs authorized by major pieces of legislation, such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and Higher Education Act, by one year. GEPA, however, only provides for a one-year extension of program authorizations. If Congress does not act to reauthorize a program within the one-year extension period granted by GEPA, the program is technically no longer authorized. This does not mean, however, that a program that is no longer authorized may cease to operate. In practice, as long as a program continues to receive appropriations, the program is considered to be implicitly authorized.

Thus, the authorization period for current ESEA programs was extended through September 30, 2008. Section 422 of GEPA also specifies that the amount authorized to be appropriated for a program during the extension shall be the amount that was authorized to be appropriated for the program during the terminal fiscal year of the program. Thus, in the case of the five ESEA programs with specific authorization levels for FY2007, those authorizations remained the same for FY2008.

These prohibitions, which are designed to maintain state and local control over education, are particularly relevant to elementary and secondary education programs. While the federal government provides funding to support education at the state and local levels, this support cannot be conditioned on state educational agencies, local educational agencies, or schools adopting specific curricula or instructional programs.

For example, FERPA does allow schools to release education records without consent in connection with an emergency if the records are necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other persons. In the wake of the shootings at Virginia Tech in April 2007, there have been several attempts to clarify FERPA's health or safety exception.

In addition, ED issued new regulations that contain similar clarifications regarding disclosure requirements in the event of a threat to health or safety.

Indeed, recent amendments to the HEA essentially override FERPA's optional disclosure rule by requiring IHEs to disclose to the alleged victim of any crime of violence or a nonforcible sex offense the results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the institution against a student who is the alleged perpetrator of such a crime or offense.
