{"id": "R40756", "title": "Foreign Aid Reform: Agency Coordination", "released_date": "2009-08-07T00:00:00", "summary": ["In the decades since the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 became law, Congress, various Administrations, and a number of Commissions, have reviewed U.S. foreign aid programs and proposed ways to improve the coordination and effectiveness of U.S. foreign assistance by consolidating or otherwise restructuring various agencies. Two recent trends in foreign assistance have renewed interest in this issue. First, foreign assistance funding has expanded considerably since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, from just over $15 billion in FY2001 to more than $45 billion in FY2007, including supplemental appropriations. Second, there has been an increase during this same time period in the number of agencies implementing foreign assistance.", "U.S. foreign assistance has long been carried out by multiple U.S. government agencies, including the State Department (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Defense (DOD) and many others, to a lesser extent. In 2007, 24 U.S. government agencies reported disbursing foreign assistance resources. With so many entities administering foreign aid, often with different objectives, many aid experts have questioned whether these agencies are working at cross-purposes. Where agencies have similar objectives, there is concern that they may be duplicating each others' efforts. There is no overarching mechanism in place for coordinating or evaluating this broad range of activities. There are, however, several less-comprehensive systems of coordination in place among various departments and agencies, using means as varied as National Security Council policy coordination committees, new information-sharing technology systems, and inter-agency staff exchanges.", "There is little consensus among policy makers and aid experts about how best to improve coordination, or even the need for more formal coordination. Some argue that the multiple funding accounts and implementing agencies appropriately reflect the wide range of competencies that development programs require, as well as diverse U.S. foreign assistance objectives. Others say the lack of centralized coordination authority impedes U.S. foreign aid transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness. Still others argue that there has been insufficient evaluation of foreign assistance programs to know whether coordination is needed to improve program efficiency and effectiveness. Proposals aimed largely or in part at addressing these concerns include developing a national foreign assistance strategy, authorizing a new or existing agency to coordinate all foreign assistance programs, coordinating through the National Security Council, enhancing the ability of U.S. missions abroad to coordinate aid activities at the country level, separating strategic aid programs from development assistance programs, and enhancing monitoring and reporting activities.", "In the 111th Congress, foreign assistance reform proposals incorporating aid coordination provisions have been introduced by leaders of both the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees. On the House side, H.R. 2410, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011, and H.R. 2139, the Initiating Foreign Assistance Reform Act of 2009, both include provisions to improve inter-agency coordination of foreign assistance. On the Senate side, coordination provisions are included in S. 1524, the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act of 2009.", "This report may be updated to reflect congressional action."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["U.S. foreign assistance is carried out by the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Defense (DOD) and several other federal government agencies. Presidential initiatives, such as the Leadership and Investment in Fighting an Epidemic (LIFE) Initiative in the Clinton Administration and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in the Bush Administration, have expanded foreign assistance outside the traditional foreign aid agencies. Additionally, the Department of Defense has participated in an expanding amount of aid activities, both military and non-military, since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began. In 2007 (the most recent year for which complete data are available), about 60% of U.S. foreign assistance was disbursed by the Department of Defense, 23% by USAID, and 7% by the Department of State (see Table 1 , below). More than 20 other U.S. government agencies are responsible for the remaining 10% of foreign aid spending. ", "There is no overarching mechanism in place to coordinate or evaluate the broad range of foreign assistance activities. Nor is there consensus about the need for better coordination, though congressional interest in the issue appears to be increasing. Provisions addressing agency coordination and structure are included in key foreign assistance reform proposals pending before the 111 th Congress, including H.R. 2410 , the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011; H.R. 2139 , the Initiating Foreign Assistance Reform Act of 2009; and S. 1524 , the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act of 2009. Furthermore, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified at her confirmation hearing that her goal in regard to foreign assistance reform would be to \"maximize coordination, minimize redundancy and make the case for increased resources.\" ", "This report discusses the many agencies involved with U.S. foreign assistance, the mechanisms currently in place to coordinate foreign aid programs, particularly those related to development assistance, and agency coordination issues that Congress may consider as part of foreign assistance reform."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Trends in Foreign Assistance", "paragraphs": ["The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended, authorized the consolidation of most foreign assistance programs under a new agency that would become the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). It also called for the use of domestic agency expertise in foreign aid, stating that \"in such fields as education, health, housing, or agriculture, the facilities and resources of other Federal agencies shall be utilized when such facilities are particularly or uniquely suitable for technical assistance, are not competitive with private enterprise, and can be made available without interfering unduly with domestic programs. \" The need for coordination of these activities was recognized by the FAA's drafters, who included a provision tasking the Department of State's Chief of Mission in each country with coordinating these functions among representatives of the United States Government.", "The FAA states that \"[n]othing in this Act shall infringe upon the powers or functions of the Secretary of State\" and specifies that the Secretary of State \"shall be responsible for the continuous supervision and general direction of economic assistance, military assistance, and military education and training programs....\" Intervening decades, however, have given rise to a range of foreign aid programs and activities that fall outside the scope of State Department/USAID authority. The Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Peace Corps are both independent aid agencies, and many other federal agencies primarily focused on domestic issues provide foreign assistance as well. Some examples include the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) technical assistance overseas on food safety and inspection; the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service multinational species conservation assistance; and the Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Disease Control's (CDC) activities to fight HIV/AIDS, influenza, tuberculosis, and malaria around the world.", "Two key trends in foreign assistance in recent years have drawn attention to and renewed concerns about the fragmentation of aid and the possible need for better coordination. First, total U.S. foreign assistance spending across appropriations bills has grown considerably in current dollars since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, from just over $15 billion in FY2001 to more than $45 billion in FY2007, including supplementals ( Table 1 ). Second, it appears that the number of federal agencies playing a role in foreign assistance is growing. While some experts note that aid has always been fragmented, with domestic agencies moving in and out of the foreign assistance arena from year to year as the need for their expertise arises in the course of U.S. foreign relations and world events, there does appear to be an increase in agencies reporting aid expenditures over the last decade. For a complete list of foreign assistance disbursements reported by U.S. government agencies from FY2001 to FY2007, see Appendix A .", "Disbursement levels for almost all the primary agencies implementing foreign assistance rose, though sometimes erratically, between FY2001 and FY2007 ( Table 1 ). Growth rates between agencies varied considerably, however, reflecting shifts in aid composition. DOD aid disbursement levels increased more than 500% during this time, to more than $27 billion, with much of this growth reflecting military assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as humanitarian disaster assistance in response to the December 2004 tsunami. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also took on a larger role in foreign assistance, largely due to PEPFAR and responses to outbreaks of avian influenza, extremely drug resistant tuberculosis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). HHS disbursement levels rose from $96 million to $1.77 billion (a 1,744% increase) between FY2001 and FY2005, and while they have declined from their FY2005 peak, the FY2007 level of $616 million is still a 540% increase over the FY2001 level. In contrast, State and USAID disbursement rates have increased since FY2001 at a slower rate than total foreign assistance (102% and 46%, respectively) with FY2007 disbursements of $3.4 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively. The Peace Corps was the exception to the growth, with FY2007 disbursement levels falling below the FY2001 level after several years of small increases. ", "In FY2001, nearly half of U.S. foreign assistance was disbursed by USAID (48%), while the Department of Defense (DOD) disbursed 29%, the Department of State (DOS) disbursed 11%, the Treasury disbursed 7% and the remaining 5% was spread among several other agencies. In FY2007, the portion of U.S. foreign assistance disbursed by USAID dropped to 23% and the DOS portion shrunk to 7%, while the DOD's portion doubled to 60%. Treasury disbursements fell to 3% and the share disbursed by all other agencies increased to 7%. ", "The increasing portion of assistance disbursed by U.S. military entities since FY2002 can be largely attributed to dramatic increases in military and reconstruction assistance associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and appears to be on the decline. The impact of these wars on foreign assistance levels is demonstrated by Figure 2 , which compares the same FY2001 agency disbursement chart in Figure 1 with a chart showing FY2007 disbursements without aid to Iraq and Afghanistan. Excluding funding to these two countries more than doubles the share of aid disbursed by State, from 11% to 25%, and gives DOD the third largest share, after USAID and State. Furthermore, it is important to note that much of the funding disbursed by DOD is military assistance, for which State plays a key role in allocation. ", "While the trend towards greater DOD involvement in foreign assistance has raised widespread concerns, Figure 2 demonstrates that outside of spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, DOD's share of foreign aid disbursement in FY2007 (21%) was actually less than it was in FY2001(29%). Nevertheless, the 369% increase in DOD non-military assistance disbursements between FY2001 and FY2007 makes DOD a much bigger player in the development assistance field (DOD disbursed nearly 16% of total U.S. economic assistance in FY2007, compared to 6.4% in FY2001)( Figure 3 ). As Iraq Relief & Reconstruction Funds are no longer available, however, and the Iraq Security Forces Fund declining, DOD's portion of foreign assistance disbursements can be expected to decrease in FY2008 and FY2009.

Where agencies have similar objectives, there is concern that they may be duplicating each others' efforts. A 2009 report on Afghanistan, for example, described how 15 U.S. agencies were working in the Afghan energy sector, each with its own vision, objectives, and procurement strategies.", "Critics assert that the decentralized U.S. aid structure is inefficient and confusing, particularly for implementing partners and recipient countries. Each agency has its own unique rules and procedures that recipient countries must follow, creating a significant administrative burden on countries trying to comply with the requirements not only of multiple U.S. agencies, but often of multiple donor countries.\u00a0 In Mozambique, for example, a Ministry of Planning and Development staff member explained that \"[d]ifferent U.S. agencies have different rules which create problems and add to confusion. The problem of multiplicity occurs even within single sectors. PEPFAR, just one of three big U.S. presidential initiatives in Mozambique, is itself implemented by five U.S. agencies: the CDC, USAID, the Defense Department, the State Department, and the Peace Corps. Insiders recognize the faulty communication while outsiders don't know whom to consult.\" ", "On the other hand, many observers believe that foreign aid programs operate most effectively when administered by agencies and staff with expertise related to the type of foreign assistance provided. The diversity of U.S. foreign assistance leads some to question whether overarching coordination is necessary, or even desirable\u2014why, for example, should programs to train law enforcement officers be coordinated with programs to support endangered species research? To centralize authority over these activities, some argue, would take authority away from those who best understand them. Some experts maintain that aid effectiveness has not yet been sufficiently studied to determine whether administering aid through multiple domestic agencies with sector-specific expertise is more or less effective than through a consolidated aid agency. Following is a discussion of the general types of foreign assistance that each agency provides, as well as how they relate to each other.

The State Department has policy control over programs that are largely or entirely implemented by other agencies. As noted earlier, State allocates strategic economic assistance, which is primarily implemented by USAID, and State allocates military assistance implemented by the Department of Defense. State's policy authority is intended to ensure that foreign assistance programs are aligned with U.S. foreign policy priorities while utilizing the technical and operational resources of other agencies for implementation. As a result, the State Department has some authority over much of the foreign assistance funding disbursed by other agencies, but the coordination implications of this authority are hard to measure.

DOD also provides humanitarian and economic assistance, including health care, reconstruction, food aid, counterdrug activities and other forms of aid, generally in conjunction with military operations, as a means of establishing local support or meeting humanitarian needs in the event that the military is the first responder in a crisis situation. In addition, using funds appropriated through the Iraq Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Fund (IRRF) in FY2004, and subsequent security assistance accounts for Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military has provided a wide range of assistance in these countries, from building schools to improving water sanitation. This type of DOD assistance activity, however, can be expected to decline now that IRRF funds are spent and security assistance funds for Iraq and Afghanistan are in decline.

These Sub-PCCs were not prescribed by a National Security Directive, but were created as the need arose. For example, the Investing in People Sub-PCC began meeting in May 2008 for the purpose of improving collaboration of U.S. government agencies on water and health issues. A Civilian-Military Cooperation Sub-PCC was established in October 2008 to address policy issues relevant to the coordination of foreign assistance activities among the Department of Defense and civilian agencies and departments. Some of these subcommittees are reportedly still meeting, and the Obama Administration has yet to determine if new subcommittees will be established.", "Participants at PCC/IPC meetings have suggested that the lack of overarching authority limits effective coordination. Each agency or department has an interest in protecting its own authority and funding, and none has the authority to impose requirements on the other. While disputes may be referred to higher levels within the NSC, observers have noted that officials tend to resolve disagreements at the lowest possible level to avoid the possibility of being overruled by their superiors or creating new conflicts through the involvement of higher authorities.

The restructuring was part of Secretary Rice's transformational development initiative that included a Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance to align U.S. aid programs with American strategic objectives, transform recipient countries' economic development paths, and graduate countries from development aid. Until January 2009, when a separate acting DFA was appointed, the DFA served concurrently as the Administrator of USAID. Charged with coordinating U.S. assistance programs, the DFA has authority over most State and USAID programs and is tasked with providing guidance to other agencies that manage foreign aid activities. Nevertheless, major foreign aid programs, such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), remain outside of the DFA's authority. ", "With the increasing number of domestic policy agencies involved in foreign aid programs, as well as the Department of Defense's growing role in reconstruction and stabilization work, many analysts believe the DFA controls too small a portion of foreign aid to effectively coordinate the development assistance programs, much less bring cohesion to a broader range of U.S. foreign aid activities.

DOD has used this authority primarily to provide counterterrorism support . Section 1206 requires that State and DOD formulate programs together and coordinate their implementation. The resulting joint review process could serve as a model for other assistance programs and potentially other agencies. Programs are developed with the approval of both DOD and Department of State officials, with input from U.S. embassies and the military combatant commands. Both parties \"must approve each program explicitly in writing\" before the proposal is submitted to DOD and State Department staff in Washington, D.C. for their concurrence and, ultimately, the approval of the Secretaries of Defense and State.

DFID encompasses all major bilateral and multilateral aid programs and unifies policy and implementation authority. One example of DFID's broad authority over development policy is that the Department is consulted on the approval of arms export license applications before they are issued. ", "Some critics believe that the DFID model would not be appropriate for U.S. development programs. One reason cited is that DFID programs must have poverty alleviation as their primary objective, reflecting a singularity of purpose that is incongruent with the multitude of objectives driving U.S. foreign aid programs. Admirers of this model, however, say it has elevated the status and power of development programs within the UK government, leading to improved recruitment of high-quality personnel. One analyst has pointed out that since the creation of DFID, more new government management recruits in the U.K. apply to the development agency than to the Foreign Office or the Treasury, which were the prior favorites. This example may be of particular interest to U.S. policymakers with an interest in rebuilding the waning manpower of USAID as a component of foreign aid reform. Another notable aspect of the U.K. structural reform is the decreased centralization of aid management since the DFID's creation in 1997, an evolution that has given field offices expanded authority and, some say, enhanced partnering and stronger relationships with host countries.

Some experts believe that U.S. aid effectiveness cannot be adequately evaluated as long as the purpose of the aid has not been clearly identified. \"The problem of separating decisions on the allocation of aid by the Department of State and its implementation by USAID has often led critics of foreign aid to blame USAID for development failures (to the detriment of the reputation and morale of USAID) and, more broadly, to reach the mistaken conclusion that aid for development is generally ineffective.\" Observers have suggested that part of the success of the U.K's Department for International Development can be attributed to its singular focus on poverty reduction.", "A realignment that groups aid programs targeted primarily on long-term development objectives (MCC and most USAID programs, for example) under a separate authority from those primarily motivated by diplomatic and security priorities (which are often under the purview of State and/or DOD), proponents argue, could eliminate the need for some inter-agency coordination, provide clarity of purpose and authority, and facilitate accurate evaluation of program effectiveness. Furthermore, if use of aid for U.S. national security becomes more transparent, the American public may better understand where and why their tax dollars are being spent overseas. On the other hand, the line between strategic and development aid is often unclear. Assistance given to a key ally for strategic purposes, for example, may be spent on the same basic education or water sanitation project that traditional development assistance funds might support.

Agency participation is not required, however, and the detail and format with which agencies report their activities is inconsistent. Congress could mandate that all agencies report their foreign assistance activities, at a specified level of detail, to a central office, and further require that this information be made publically available. Such uniform reporting, and perhaps additional resources, could make the data more complete and available for congressional and public access more quickly (a two-year lag that currently exist with the Greenbook), and make it easier for agency staff in the field or headquarters to see whole-of-government activities in their region.

This approach has been suggested by former USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios as a means of ensuring that all programs are evaluated in a comparable manner. A possible model for this type of broader Inspector General role is the Special Inspector General of Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR), which has cross-agency jurisdiction to conduct both financial audits and program assessments of all U.S. activities in Iraq. Many observers have credited SIGIR reports for providing insight into the complex relationships between the wide range of U.S. activities in Iraq, and for identifying which programs have been successful and which have not.
