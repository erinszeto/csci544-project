It is estimated that in total (including those displaced prior to the war) there may be as many as 2 million Iraqi refugees who have fled to Jordan, Syria, and other neighboring states, and approximately 2.7 million Iraqis who have been displaced within Iraq itself.", "Between 2004-2007, the violence and insecurity resulting from the ongoing sectarian strife, terrorism, and insurgency in Iraq produced substantial civilian displacement in different parts of the country. There are continued concerns about the absorptive capacity of neighboring countries, whether they can provide adequately for the populations that have moved across borders, and the impact of refugee flows on stability in general. Many of Iraq's neighbors fear that they are being overwhelmed by refugees who have fled over Iraq's borders. While there is clear evidence of limited improvement in Iraq\u2014decreasing violence, reduced levels of displacement, and some returns in a few governorates\u2014the situation in general remains fragile and requires sustained attention. UNHCR estimates that the number of Iraqis displaced within Iraq who need food and shelter exceeds 1 million people.", "This report provides an analysis of the current crisis, including an overview of the conditions for those displaced in Iraq and the refugee situations in Syria, Jordan, and elsewhere. It also provides information on the U.S. and international response and examines refugee resettlement options in the United States. Aspects of this crisis that may be of particular interest to the111th Congress include a focus on an immediate response (providing humanitarian relief funding), examining resettlement policies, and developing a strategy to manage the displaced, particularly within Iraq.

While some experts agree that Iraq's major communities remain sharply divided over their relative positions in the power structure, in 2008 the Bush Administration reportedly attributed signs of movement on political reconciliation and a reduction in the level of violence to the impact of the 2007 troop surge. The reduced violence has, at the very least, ensured that the displacement problem did not worsen any further in 2008 and there are possibly small signs of improvement. If movement toward political reconciliation as a result of the January 2009 elections takes hold, this could create also conditions for decreasing the current rates of displacement and could increase the desire of the international community to address the refugee and displaced persons issue. Most experts believe that reconciliation would also enhance capacity in Iraq's ministries responsible for security, basic services, and providing assistance to those displaced Iraqis.", "The insecurity resulting from ongoing violence in Iraq continues to have a marked impact on civilian displacement in various parts of the country. This was particularly the case beginning in early 2006, when sectarian violence accelerated an already developing pattern of population displacement and emigration. The numbers of displaced Iraqis are very fluid and vary by source. For example, the Iraqi Red Crescent Society estimates of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) exceeded those published in a January 2008 report by the Migration Policy Institute, which states that there were close to 4.5 million displaced Iraqis (2.2 refugees and 2.3 IDPs). The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) now estimates close to 4.7 million Iraqis are currently displaced from their homes, including roughly 2.7 million inside Iraq and 2 million refugees who have fled Iraq, mostly to neighboring Jordan and Syria.", "When the displacement crisis accelerated in 2006,UNHCR observed that the humanitarian crisis many feared would take place in March 2003 as a result of the war then began to occur. \"The massive displacement has emerged quietly and without fanfare but the numbers affected are in excess of what many agencies had predicted in 2003.\" Then, as now, there were also concerns about the absorptive capacity of neighboring countries, whether they could provide adequately for the populations moving across borders, and the potential impact of refugee flows on stability in the region. The Iraq situation is one of the largest population displacement crises worldwide. As the situation continues, higher food and fuel prices and decreasing subsidies are limiting the ability of aid agencies to provide assistance.", "It is estimated that 1.2 million Iraqis were displaced before 2006, 1.5 million Iraqis were displaced between 2006 and 2007, and less than 1% have been displaced in 2008. While there are some reports of limited improvements\u2014decreasing violence, reduced levels of displacement, and some returns in a few governorates\u2014the situation in general remains serious and requires sustained attention. UNHCR estimates that the number of Iraqi IDPs who need food and shelter exceeds 1 million people.", "The figures on population displacement illustrate the challenges ahead. As the 111 th Congress considers various policy options toward Iraq, the impact of this level of displacement\u2014which is the largest in the Middle East since 1948\u2014cannot be overestimated in terms of its impact on regional stability and the potential for humanitarian suffering. Experts suggest that what is badly needed\u2014and quickly\u2014is the development of a robust response on the part of the international community that provides and funds humanitarian relief; conducts a close examination of resettlement policies and options in third countries; develops a strategy to manage the displaced, particularly within Iraq; and implements increased funding to host countries and aid agencies outside Iraq."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Displacement Within Iraq", "paragraphs": ["Displacement within Iraq has usually been the result of sectarian conflict and general armed violence, local criminal activity, coalition military operations, and fighting among militias and insurgents. Direct personal threats, abductions, assassinations, and death threats remain commonplace, although less so than in 2007. Religious belief, political or tribal affiliation, and association with U.S. forces or Iraqi authorities can also make someone a target for violence. All of these activities continue to create an atmosphere of generalized fear for many ordinary Iraqis. Within Iraq, the current conditions clearly bear the mark of sectarian polarization and \"cleansing\" in neighborhoods formerly of mixed religious orientation that took place during 2006 and 2007. In recent studies, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) found that IDPs tended to be from mixed neighborhoods and displaced to homogenous ones. The movement occurred predominantly in and between urban areas\u2014with more than 70% fleeing Baghdad. At least 10 of the 18 Iraqi provinces have now tried to place entry restrictions on their internal borders to Iraqis displaced from elsewhere in the country.", "Overall living standards within Iraq have declined sharply since 2003. Human development indicators\u2014access to health care, social services, education, employment\u2014have fractured under the current circumstances and affected wider social networks in Iraqi society. Limited assistance activities and access by the international community have made implementation of tangible, long-term policy objectives difficult. Within many areas in Iraq, conditions are deteriorating and, for those already displaced, are becoming more permanent problems. Many who cannot secure protection or assistance could soon find themselves in the same situation. According to some estimates, Iraq's population is 26.8 million, this means that nearly approximately 17% of the population may be displaced.", "There are many patterns of displacement, some that have their origins decades ago, but have now evolved into a new phase\u2014for example, the approximately 300,000 refugees who were in Iran before the 2003 war, then returned to Iraq, and now are believed to have been displaced again, this time within Iraq. Others were refugees from other countries in the region who fled to Iraq and are now on the move again within its borders. Saddam Hussein's brutal regime left a legacy of displacement, as his regime forcibly displaced Iraqi Shiites and Kurds in order to control territory, terrorize the population, and fight insurrection. Some experts estimate as many as 1.5 million may have been displaced over the three decades of his regime."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Profile of Displacement", "paragraphs": ["There have been no reliable census data on Iraq's ethnic and sectarian makeup for decades. Iraq's population represents a number of ethnic groups and religions. In general throughout Iraq, patterns have shown that Shiites have moved from the center to the south; Sunnis from the south to the upper center; Christians fled to Ninevah Province and Kurds ended up within Diyala or Tamim/Kirkuk Provinces. Palestinians in Iraq (who numbered close to 34,000 before the war and are mostly Sunni) have been particularly vulnerable to reprisal attacks by Shiites as they received preferential treatment from Saddam Hussein. Many have been killed, and others have been displaced again. An unknown number of Palestinians remain in Iraq. The United Nations estimates that roughly 3,000 Palestinian refugees live in refugee camps on the Iraqi-Syrian border. Reportedly the living conditions urgently need to be addressed. Some progress has been made on resettling some of the Palestinians in Canada, Brazil, Chile, and Sudan.", "Those Iraqis who have worked with the U.S. government, the new Iraqi government, or international organizations have been particularly targeted. In addition, there are vulnerable groups within these categories of displaced including the elderly, sick, pregnant women, and children. (See \"U.S. Refugee Program and Iraqi Refugees\" section later in this report.)", "Most of those displaced have moved in with family and friends who live in areas where one sect overwhelmingly predominates. When this is not possible they go to public facilities, such as schools and factories (some people are squatting in damaged or abandoned property, such as mosques) and in much smaller numbers, to camps set up by the Iraqi Red Crescent Society or Ministry of Displacement and Migration (MoDM). Repeat-displacement, which means moving a second time, or repeatedly, most commonly applies to those displaced by military operations.", "Daily behavior by those who are displaced or living in fear for their lives may also vary to avoid establishing any predictable pattern: Micro and nighttime displacement means that a person is living in his or her home, but sleeping elsewhere. Daylight displacement involves shifting routines, routes, and activities. And fake displacement are those who pretend to be displaced and build homes on government land or the land of locals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Immediate Consequences of Displacement", "paragraphs": ["There are many consequences to displacement. In the short term, the IOM reports examine the deterioration of basic humanitarian needs and services, not only from displacement itself, but due to lack of employment and a huge economic decline throughout the country. Needs expressed by displaced Iraqis include food, water and sanitation, fuel and electricity, shelter, health care, and education. This level of displacement has increased competition for limited resources and continues to place huge burdens on host communities, which in turn has had an impact as communities reach their saturation point."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Iraqi Government Response to IDPs", "paragraphs": ["Iraqi government ministries providing assistance to the displaced include the Ministry of Displacement and Migration (MoDM), the Ministry of Trade, which is in charge of the allocation of food rations, the Ministry of Interior, which provides documentation for services such as registration for food rations, and the Ministry of Education, which is in charge of registering school children, many of whom have been displaced and need to be enrolled in local schools. Support of the displaced in the provinces is usually handled by a committee and is considered more effective. There are also informal committees set up in local communities and in mosques. As a national aid agency that has been largely viewed as non-sectarian, the Iraqi Red Crescent assists the displaced throughout the country through its 18 branches.", "There have been concerns by Iraq's neighbors, the United States, and other donor countries that the Iraqi government is not doing enough to assist with its displaced citizens. At a conference in Sweden in late May 2008, the Maliki government made a pledge of $195 million to assist the displaced. The International Compact with Iraq annual report states that in addition to $25 million transferred to Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan to support Iraqi refugees, the government of Iraq has allocated $195 million to support voluntary returnees and for emergency costs and housing rehabilitation.", "The United States, UNHCR, and other international partners are working with the government of Iraq to assess what policies and programs are in place to accommodate returns and what will be required once conditions permit voluntary returns to begin. In the meantime, some experts believe that the sectarian groups have tried not only to consolidate territory, but also to fill the gap as \"protector and provider\" in the provision of services the government cannot fulfill for the displaced. Relatively few international humanitarian organizations are working in Iraq because of the unstable security situation. There are 32 humanitarian international NGOs with programs in Iraq (some operating through implementing partners). Those that are there keep a very low profile. Between March 2003 and June 2008, it was reported that 94 aid workers were killed, 86 kidnaped, 245 injured, and 24 arrested."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Iraqi Refugees in Neighboring Countries18", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, Iraq's neighbors have willingly or unwillingly absorbed approximately 2 million refugees fleeing violence and instability in their home country. Jordan and Syria have been the primary destination for the displaced, and by all accounts, both countries have been stretched thin in trying to provide adequate services for largely unwanted refugee populations. Although the plight of many Iraqis refugees is difficult but not dire, there is much concern that the situation could deteriorate over time if the existing refugee populations remain for a prolonged period or if new waves of refugees flood Iraq's neighbors.", "Beyond the dire humanitarian consequences of scattering nearly 10% of Iraq's pre-war population into neighboring countries lie the long-term impact of this large scale displacement on the geopolitics of the Middle East. Many Iraqis have indicated that they will never return home, raising questions over their future status in their new homes. Will Iraq's neighbors move toward integrating refugees into the citizenry at large? Or, will Iraqis be treated as second-class citizens and form a permanent underclass similar to the situation of Palestinian refugees? Will Iraqis become politically active in their host countries and form diaspora organizations? Or, will they be barred from politics altogether driving the most extreme elements to pursue radical causes? Will sectarian violence spill over from Iraq into neighboring states, bringing an added element of instability into an already volatile region?"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Profile of the Displaced", "paragraphs": ["Of those who have fled Iraq, various reports indicate that many refugees were from Iraq's now decimated middle class. Numerous interviews of Iraqi refugees conducted outside Iraq have revealed that Iraqi professionals who fled the country were the least sectarian elements in society, and many fled to escape both the general threat of sectarian violence and the specific threat of kidnapping, which has become a common criminal enterprise conducted by insurgents and organized gangs.", "Unlike other refugee crises in war-torn areas, the status of Iraqi refugees in neighboring states is more difficult to discern. At present, there are no makeshift tent cities for the homeless and destitute, though aid agencies did construct such facilities in 2003 in anticipation of a refugee crisis that did not materialize. While Iraqis refugees are far from being assimilated into their host country, they have blended into urban areas, settling into cities like Amman and Damascus. Many Iraqis who fled the country before/after the U.S. invasion had some temporary means of supporting themselves either through their personal savings or remittances from relatives abroad. Wealthy Ba'th party members and supporters of the Saddam Hussein regime who fled to Jordan in 2003 were dubbed \"Mercedes refugees\" by the diplomatic community and the press. Nevertheless, aid workers assert that the newer waves of Iraqis who crossed the border are progressively poorer than their predecessors and prioritizing those most in need of assistance has become more critical. Aid workers note that because the Iraqi refugee population has blended into urban areas, they are harder to identify, document, and assist.", "There are many challenges that face Iraqi refugees living abroad. Aside from the social isolation that accompanies their separation from family and tribe, Iraqis may face discrimination and disdain from citizens who view them as competition for jobs and access to strained social welfare services. Unemployment was already high in Syria and Jordan before the Iraqis' arrival, and both countries bar them from legally working during their stay. Access to affordable healthcare is difficult for most refugees without significant personal savings, forcing many new arrivals to turn to international aid agencies. Some estimate that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children are not attending public school while in exile. According to one aid worker, \"We are finding that a lot of participants in the youth programs we're running\u2014a very high number, sometimes up to 30 percent per class\u2014are illiterate or close to illiterate.\" Moreover, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon are not state parties to the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and/or its 1967 Protocol, which makes UNHCR's role more difficult, as the term \"refugee\" and the protection mandates recognized under international law are not formally recognized in these countries."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. and International Assistance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Response", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.N.

Iraqis are among the nationalities eligible for P-3 processing in FY2009.", "All refugee applicants are checked through DOS's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS). In addition, DOS must obtain a Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on certain applicants. In the SAO process, additional databases are checked for information on the individual. Iraqi refugees are subject to enhanced security screening procedures established by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Individuals who are preliminarily determined to qualify for a processing priority are presented to DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for an in-person interview. USCIS makes determinations about whether individuals are eligible for refugee status and are otherwise admissible to the United States.", "Each year, the President submits a report to Congress, known as the consultation document , which contains the Administration's proposed refugee ceiling and regional allocations for the upcoming fiscal year. Following congressional consultations on the proposal, the President issues a Presidential Determination setting the refugee numbers for that year. The FY2009 worldwide refugee ceiling is 80,000. It includes 75,000 admissions numbers allocated among the regions of the world and an unallocated reserve of 5,000 numbers that can be used if, and where, a need for additional refugee slots develops. The FY2009 allocation for the Near East/South Asia region, which includes Iraq, is 37,000. According to the FY2009 consultation document, this allocation includes vulnerable Iraqis, Bhutanese, and Iranians, and Afghans. Admissions of Iraqi refugees to the United States totaled 198 in FY2005, 202 in FY2006, 1,608 in FY2007, and 13,823 in FY2008. According to a January 2009 State Department report, it is the Administration's goal to admit at least 17,000 Iraqi refugees in FY2009.", "Beyond the formal refugee program, other immigration mechanisms have been established to facilitate the admission to the United States of Iraqis who have worked for or been closely associated with the U.S. government, including the U.S. military. Provisions enacted in 2006 as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2006, as subsequently amended, authorize DHS to grant legal permanent resident status as special immigrants to certain nationals of Iraq and Afghanistan who have worked directly with the U.S. Armed Forces, or under Chief of Mission authority, as translators or interpreters, and their spouses and children. This program was capped at 500 aliens (excluding spouses and children) for FY2007 and FY2008, and is capped at 50 aliens (excluding spouses and children) for FY2009 and subsequent years. In FY2008, 1,142 special immigrant visas were issued under this program.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, in addition to making changes to the refugee program discussed above, broadens DHS's authority to provide special immigrant status to certain nationals of Iraq. It also grants the Secretary of State the authority to provide such status in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. Under this law, as amended, Iraqi nationals are eligible for special immigrant status if they are or were employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government in Iraq on or after March 20, 2003, for not less than one year; provided documented valuable service to the U.S. government; and have experienced \"an ongoing serious threat as a consequence of the alien's employment by the United States government.\" This special immigrant program is capped at 5,000 principal aliens (excluding spouses and children) each year from FY2008 through FY2012. The National Defense Authorization Act requires the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to establish or use existing refugee processing mechanisms in Iraq and elsewhere in the region for processing Iraqis under the new special immigrant program. Furthermore, the law makes Iraqi special immigrants eligible for the same resettlement assistance, entitlement programs, and other benefits as refugees for up to eight months.

UNHCR stated at the time that it did not consider current conditions in Iraq to be conducive for a voluntary returns program due primarily to concerns about security and protection for returnees and the lack of capacity on the ground to implement a returns program. Reports indicate up to 70% of those who returned to Baghdad could not resettle in their own homes, either because someone else was living there or because the ethnic composition of the neighborhood made it unsafe.", "With increased security and reduced violence, returns continue to increase throughout Iraq, especially in Baghdad, IDPs continue to experience harsh living conditions as many cannot fulfill simple needs such as potable water, safe and clean shelter, food and sanitation. Many homes have been destroyed and infrastructure is in disrepair. Basic public services are in need of rehabilitation. Morever, returnees have no access to employment.

Other experts believe that there may be a sectarian dimension to the majority Shiite Iraqi government's behavior; over 60% of Iraqis in Jordan and Syria are Sunni Muslims. In the June 2008 FY2008 and FY2009 emergency supplemental, Congress raised concerns about the level of resources the government of Iraq has so far dedicated to assisting Iraqi refugees and IDPs.
