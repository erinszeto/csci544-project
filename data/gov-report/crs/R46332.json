{"id": "R46332", "title": "Fintech: Overview of Innovative Financial Technology and Selected Policy Issues", "released_date": "2020-04-28T00:00:00", "summary": ["Advances in technology allow for innovation in the ways businesses and individuals perform financial activities. The development of financial technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094commonly referred to as finte c h \u00e2\u0080\u0094is the subject of great interest for the public and policymakers. Fintech innovations could potentially improve the efficiency of the financial system and financial outcomes for businesses and consumers. However, the new technology could pose certain risks, potentially leading to unanticipated financial losses or other harmful outcomes. Policymakers designed many of the financial laws and regulations intended to foster innovation and mitigate risks before the most recent technological changes. This raises questions concerning whether the existing legal and regulatory frameworks, when applied to fintech, effectively protect against harm without unduly hindering beneficial technologies' development.", "The underlying, cross-cutting technologies that enable much of fintech are subject to such policy trade-offs. The increased availability and use of the internet and mobile devices could offer greater convenience and access to financial services, but raises questions over how geography-based regulations and disclosure requirements can and should be applied. Rapid growth in the generation, storage, and analysis of data\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the subsequent use of Big Data and alternative data\u00e2\u0080\u0094could allow for more accurate risk assessment, but raises concerns over privacy and whether individuals' data will be used fairly. Automated decisionmaking (and the related technologies of machine learning and artificial intelligence) could result in faster and more accurate assessments, but could behave in unintended or unanticipated ways that cause market instability or discriminatory outcomes. Increased adoption of cloud computing allows specialized companies to handle technology-related functions for financial institutions, including providing cybersecurity measures, but this may concentrate financial cyber risks at a relatively small number of nonfinancial companies who may not be entirely comfortable with their regulatory obligations as financial institution service providers. Concerns over cyber risks and whether adherence to cybersecurity regulations ensure appropriate safeguards against those risks permeate all fintech developments.", "Fintech deployment in specific financial industries also raises policy questions. The growth of nonbank, internet lenders could expand access to credit, but industry observers debate the degree to which the existing state-by-state regulatory regime is overly burdensome or provides important consumer protections. As banks have increasingly come to rely on third-party service providers to meet their technological needs, observers have debated the degree to which the regulations applicable to those relationships are unnecessarily onerous or ensure important safeguards and cybersecurity. New consumer point-of-sale systems and real-time-payments systems are being developed and increasingly used, and while these systems are potentially more convenient and efficient, there are concerns about the market power of the companies providing the services and the effects on people with limited access to these systems. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies allow individuals to make payments entirely outside traditional financial systems, which may increase privacy and efficiency but creates concerns over money laundering and consumer protection. Fintech is providing new avenues to raise capital\u00e2\u0080\u0094including through crowdfunding and initial coin offerings\u00e2\u0080\u0094and changing the way companies trade securities and manage investments and may increase the ability to raise funds but present investor protection challenges. Under statute passed by Congress, insurance is primarily regulated at the state level where agencies are considering the implications to efficiency and risk that fintech poses in that industry, including peer-to-peer insurance and insurance on demand. Finally, firms across industries are using fintech to help them comply with regulations and manage risk, which raises questions about what role finetch should play in these systems.", "Regulators and policymakers have undertaken a number of initiatives to integrate fintech in existing frameworks more smoothly. They have made efforts to increase communication between fintech firms and regulators to help firms better understand how regulators view a developing technology, and certain regulators have established offices within their organizations to conduct outreach. In another approach, some regulators have announced research collaborations with fintech firms to improve their understanding of new products and technologies. If policymakers determine that particular regulations are unnecessarily burdensome or otherwise ill-suited to a particular technology, they might tailor the regulations, or exempt companies or products that meet certain criteria from such regulations. In some cases, regulators can do so under existing authority, but others might require congressional action."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Finance, Technology, and Recent Innovation", "paragraphs": ["Finance and technological development have been inextricably linked throughout history. (Possibly, quite literally. The technology of writing in early civilization may have developed to record payments and debts. ) As a result, the term fintech is used to refer to a broad set of technologies being deployed across a variety of financial industries and activities. Although there is no consensus on which technologies qualify as new or innovative enough to be fintech, it is generally understood to mean recent innovations to the way a financial activity is performed that are made possible by rapid advances in digital information technology. Underlying, cross-cutting technological advancements that enable fintech include increasingly widespread, easy access to the internet and mobile technology; increased data generation and availability and use of Big Data and alternative data; increased use of cloud computing services; the development of algorithmic decisionmaking (and the related technological evolutions toward machine learning and artificial intelligence); and the coevolution of cyber threats and cybersecurity. ", "The complementary use of these technologies to deliver financial services could potentially create benefits. Many technologies aim to create efficiencies in financing, which reduce costs for financial service providers. Certain cost savings may be passed along to consumers through reduced prices. With lower prices, some customers that previously found services too expensive could enter the market. In addition, some individuals and businesses that previously could not access financial services because of price or lack of available financial information could gain access at lower prices or through increased data availability and improved data analysis. Fintech also may allow businesses to reach new customers that were previously restricted by geographic remoteness or unfamiliarity with products and services. Increased accessibility may be especially beneficial to traditionally underserved groups, such as low-income, minority, and rural populations.", "However, fintech may also generate risks and result in undesirable outcomes. Predicting how an innovation with only a brief history of use will perform involves uncertainty, particularly without the experience of having gone through a recession. Thus, technologies may not ultimately allocate funds, assess risks, or otherwise function as efficiently and accurately as intended; they may instead generate unexpected losses. Some technologies aim to eliminate or replace a middle man, but in certain cases the middle man may in fact be useful or even necessary. For example, an experienced financial institution or professional may be able to explain and advise consumers on financial products and their risks. In addition, new fintech startups may be inexperienced in complying with consumer-protection laws. These characteristics may increase the likelihood that consumers using financial technology engage in a financial activity and take on risks that they do not fully understand and which unduly expose them to losses. Furthermore, some studies suggest that fintech's use can result in disparate impact on protected groups, and that the increasing use of high-speed internet and mobile devices in finance may be leaving behind groups that cannot afford those services and devices. ", "As financial activity increasingly uses digital technology, sensitive data are generated. On the one hand, data can be used to assess risks and ensure customers receive the best products and services. On the other hand, data can be stolen and used inappropriately, and there are concerns over privacy. This raises questions over data ownership and control\u00e2\u0080\u0094including consumers' rights and companies' responsibilities in accessing and using data\u00e2\u0080\u0094and whether companies that use and collect data face appropriate cybersecurity requirements.", "Given that fintech may produce both positive and negative outcomes, Congress and other policymakers may consider whether existing laws and regulations appropriately foster the development and implementation of potentially beneficial technologies while adequately mitigating the risks those technologies may present. This report examines (1) underlying technological developments that are being used in financial services, (2) selected examples of financial activities affected by innovative technology, and (3) some approaches regulators have used to integrate new technologies or technology companies into the existing regulatory framework.

One consideration is that online companies can often quickly grow to significant size shortly after entering a financial market. This could enable the rapid growth of small fintech startups, possibly through capturing market share from incumbent financial firms. Adopting information technology, however, may require significant investment, which could advantage existing firms if they have increased access to capital. Larger technology firms\u00e2\u0080\u0094including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google\u00e2\u0080\u0094have started financial services operations, and thus may become competitors to or partners with traditional financial institutions. Some industry experts predict that platforms offering the ability to engage with different financial institutions from a single channel will likely become the dominant model for delivering financial services. These developments may raise concerns that offering finance through digital channels could drive industry concentration. ", "Another consideration in this area involves consumer disclosures for financial products. In the past, voluntary or mandatory disclosures were designed to be delivered through paper. As firms move more of their processes online, they have begun to update these disclosures with electronic formats in mind. Consumers may interact differently with mobile or online disclosures than paper disclosures. Accordingly, firms may need to design online disclosures differently than paper disclosures to communicate the same level of information to consumers. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Possible Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["The internet raises questions over what role geography-based financial regulations should play in the future. Many financial regulations are applied to companies and activities based on geographic considerations, as most areas of finance are subject to a dual federal-state regulatory system. For example, nonbank lenders and money transmitters are primarily regulated at the state level in each state in which they operate and are subject to those states' consumer-protection laws. Fintech proponents argue the internet facilitates the provision of products and services on a national scale, and 50 separate state regulatory regimes are inefficient when applied to internet-based businesses that are not constrained by geography. However, state regulators and consumer advocates assert state regulators' experience and local connection are best situated to regulate nonbank fintech companies. An Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) initiative to accept applications for special-purpose bank charters that would allow certain fintechs to enter the national bank regulator regime, and subsequent lawsuits filed by state regulators to block such charters, exemplify this policy debate. Another example is the debate over how a bank's geographic assessment area should be defined for the purposes of the Community Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 95-128 )\u00e2\u0080\u0094a law designed to encourage banks to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate\u00e2\u0080\u0094when so many services are delivered over the internet instead of at a physical branch location.", "Another area in which the internet raises concerns is how effective disclosure requirements are if they are sent electronically and read on a screen, when many disclosure forms may have been designed to be delivered and read on paper. Thus, although electronic disclosures can eliminate costs of printing and physically delivering disclosures, they may hinder customers' ability to read and understand them. Currently, financial regulatory agencies are responsible for implementing consumer-disclosure laws. Often, these agencies create either mandatory or safe harbor form designs that firms use to comply with these laws. Some financial regulatory agencies are either required or choose to test new consumer disclosures themselves before implementing a new disclosure requirement on the entities they regulate. In the past, when most consumer credit origination occurred in person, this testing generally focused on paper delivery. As firms move more of their origination processes online, financial regulatory agencies might consider updating their consumer testing research with this format in mind."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Big Data16", "paragraphs": ["Today, companies can easily collect, cheaply store, and quickly process data, regardless of its size, frequency, type, or location. Big Data commonly refers to the vast amounts and types of data an information technology (IT) system may handle. Big Data data sets share characteristics that require different hardware and software in IT systems to store, manage, and analyze those data. The four characteristics of Big Data are volume, velocity, variety, and variability. Volume refers to a data set's extensive size. Velocity refers to the rate of flow for the data coming into, being processed by, and exiting the IT system. Variety refers to the differing types of data in a data set, such as information entered by a company analyst, images, data from a partner database, and data scraped from a website. Variety can also refer to different types of devices and subsystems in an IT system handling the data. Variability refers to the recognition that Big Data data sets can change with regard to the first three attributes. A data set may grow or shrink in volume, data may flow at different velocities, and a data set may include a different variety of data from one point in time to another. Changes in data variability drive IT systems to have a scalable architecture in order to manage the data sets.", "Big Data is used to generate insights, support decisionmaking, and enable automation. Big Data allows extensive and complex information to be analyzed with new methods (e.g., cloud computing resources, which are discussed in more detail below), leading users to understand and use the data in novel ways. Loan underwriting (evaluating the likelihood that a loan applicant will make timely repayment) is an example from the financial services industry. Loan underwriting has relied on an in-person process, using only a few data sources that might have been months or years old. Big Data enables underwriting to be performed online using a greater variety of more current data sources, potentially allowing for greater speed, accuracy, and confidence in loan decisions, but raises concerns over privacy and questions over what information is appropriate to collect and use.", "In recent years, new technologies have led to the development of new products in the financial services sector. For example, as account information has become electronic, some products allow consumers to combine accounts with several financial services providers on a single software platform, sometimes in combination with financial advisory services. The underlying technology providers for these platforms are sometimes known as data aggregators, which refers to companies that compile information from multiple sources into a standardized, summarized form. One technology commonly used to collect account data is web scraping , a technique that scans websites and extracts data from them, and in general can be performed without a direct relationship with the website or financial firm maintaining the data. As an alternative to web scraping, the financial institution managing the account may provide customer account information through a structured data feed or application program interface (API). Advantages and disadvantages exist when accessing alternative data by API rather than web scraping. For example, in certain circumstances web scraping may be an easier way for companies to gather data because it does not rely on bilateral company agreements, but some industry observers assert that APIs are more secure in terms of cybersecurity and fraud risks. Using API banking standards to facilitate data sharing between financial firms is sometimes called open banking . New financial products that take advantage of data aggregation and open banking could provide benefits to consumers by enabling them to manage personal finances, automate or set goals for saving, receive personalized product recommendations, apply for loans, and perform other tasks. However, increasing access to these data may pose data security and privacy risks to consumers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Possible Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Questions exist about how current laws and regulations should apply to Big Data. Typically, these questions relate to concerns about privacy and cybersecurity. One area of debate is whether data security standards should be prescriptive and government defined or flexible and outcome based. Some argue that a prescriptive approach can be inflexible and harm innovation, but others argue that an outcome-based approach might lead to institutions having to comply with a wide range of data standards. In addition, questions exist about whether relevant data security laws continue to cover all sensitive individual financial information, or whether the scope of these laws should be expanded."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Alternative Data26", "paragraphs": ["Alternative data generally refers to types of data that are not traditionally used by the national consumer reporting agencies to calculate a credit score. It can include both financial and nonfinancial data. New technology makes it more feasible for financial institutions to gather alternative data from a variety of sources.

Financial institutions can mitigate some of these risks through data encryption and other robust data governance practices. Moreover, some prospective borrowers may be unaware that alternative data has been used in credit decisions, raising privacy and consumer-protection concerns. Additionally, alternative data may pose fair lending risks if alternative data elements are correlated with prohibited classes, such as race or ethnicity. ", "Alternative data could potentially increase accuracy, visibility, and scorability in credit reporting by including additional information beyond that which is traditionally used. The ability to calculate scores for previously credit invisible or nonscoreable consumers could allow lenders to better determine their creditworthiness. Arguably, using alternative data would potentially increase access to\u00e2\u0080\u0094and lower the cost of\u00e2\u0080\u0094credit for some credit invisible or unscorable individuals by enabling lenders to find new creditworthy consumers.

The FCRA requires \"that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit ... in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information.\" Using alternative data for credit reporting raises FCRA compliance questions. For example, alternative data providers outside of the traditional consumer credit industry may find FCRA data-furnishing requirements burdensome. Some alternative data may have accuracy issues, and managing consumer disputes requires time and resources. These regulations may discourage some organizations from furnishing alternative data, even if the data could potentially help some consumers become scorable or increase their credit scores. In addition, consumers may not know what specific information alternative credit scoring systems use and how to improve the credit scores produced by these models.", "The CFPB and federal banking regulators have been monitoring alternative data developments in recent years, and in December 2019 they released a policy statement on the appropriate use of alternative data in the underwriting process. The release followed a February 2017 CFPB request for information from the public about the use of alternative data and modeling techniques in the credit process. Information from this request led the CFPB to outline principles for consumer-authorized financial data sharing and aggregation in October 2017. These nine principles include, among other things, consumer access and usability, consumer control and informed consent, and data security and accuracy. In addition, the CFPB issued its first (and, to date, only) no-a ction letter in 2017 to the Upstart Network, a company that uses alternative data, such as education and employment history, to make credit and pricing decisions.

Historically, these complex tasks could only be performed by a human. More recently, technological advances have enabled computers to perform these tasks. This development creates potential benefits and risks, and has a number of financial regulatory implications.", "Financial firms have used algorithms\u00e2\u0080\u0094precoded sets of instructions and calculations executed automatically\u00e2\u0080\u0094to enable computers to make decisions for a number of years, notably in the lending and investment management industries.

", "Automation can also create certain concerns, particularly if automated programs may not perform as intended, possibly resulting in market instability or discrimination against protected groups. Algorithms can fail to perform as expected for reasons such as programmer error or unforeseen conditions, potentially producing unexpected losses. Because algorithms can execute actions so quickly and at large scale, those losses can be quite large. An illustrative event is the Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by roughly 1,000 points (and then rebounded) in intraday trading. The event was caused in part by an automated futures selling program that made sales more quickly than anticipated, resulting in tremendous market volatility. ", "In addition, automated decisions may result in adverse impacts on certain protected groups in a discriminatory way. In lending, for example, these discriminatory outcomes may include higher rates of denial for minority loan applicants than for white applicants with similar incomes and financial histories. Such discrimination can occur for a number of reasons, even if algorithm developers did not intend to discriminate. For example, the data set used to train the lending program is likely historical data of past loan recipients, and minorities may be underrepresented in that sample. By using these data to learn, the algorithm may similarly make fewer loans to underrepresented groups."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Possible Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Programs enabled with artificial intelligence or machine-learning capabilities (i.e., automated programs that are able to change themselves with little or no human input) raise a number of policy concerns.

Under these circumstances, the ability of regulators or other outside parties to understand what a program did, and why, may be limited or nonexistent. This poses a significant challenge for companies using AI programs to ensure they will produce outcomes that comply with applicable laws and regulations, and for regulators to effectively carry out their oversight duties. In order to address this black box problem, some observers assert that regulators should set standards for how AI programs are developed, tested, and monitored.

Cloud computing alleviates users from having to buy, develop, and maintain technical resources and recruit and retain the staff to manage those resources. Instead, cloud computing users pay providers who specialize in building and managing such resource infrastructures.", "Cloud and high-performance computing architectures are better suited to processing Big Data than desktop computing. For many, this makes Big Data and cloud computing inextricably linked, and many commenters may refer to them interchangeably. Although this may be common practice, it is not technically accurate.

Most financial firms store and process large amounts of data related to customer accounts and transactions. Typically, they also provide internet-based access to accounts and services through websites and mobile device apps and attract customers with these services. Meeting these business needs requires significant IT infrastructures and capabilities. For some financial companies, it may be less costly to pay a cloud service provider than to do everything in-house. ", "Cloud computing introduces certain information security considerations and risks. Because data are not physically under the user's direct control (i.e., the data are no longer on a local, owned or controlled data server), the risk that access to those data may spread beyond intended users may be higher. Cloud providers counter that although they have physical access to the data, they do not necessarily have logical access to the data, nor do they own the data. In other words, they argue that although the data are hosted on their servers, they are encrypted or otherwise segmented from the provider's ability to access them. ", "Another related potential risk is commonly referred to as the insider threat \u00e2\u0080\u0094the risk that a trusted insider may purposely harm an employer or clients. Although users may limit unauthorized access to their data through encryption, an insider may be able to manipulate the encrypted files in such a manner that the information is kept confidential, but is no longer available. Users would then depend on the provider to restore a functioning backup of the data to resume data access. Or, the provider may offer encryption and key-management services to the user. In doing so, providers keep the data in their servers confidential between clients, but in a way that continues to afford that provider access to the user's data through encryption and decryption protocol maintenance. ", "It should be noted that financial institutions that keep IT operations in-house also face the insider threat. However, migrating to cloud computing adds the cloud service provider's employees to the set of people that could pose an insider threat. In addition, a portion of the risk shifts from being internally managed by the financial institution to being externally managed by the cloud service provider.

Arguably, the risk of system disruptions and failures can be reduced by using a cloud provider with technical specialization in operating, maintaining, and protecting IT systems.

This could place substantial regulatory burden on banks and cloud services providers that see potential benefit to working together. ", "The BSCA gives bank regulators supervisory authority over service providers. Exercising this authority over cloud service providers, however, may raise challenges. At least initially, bank regulators may be unfamiliar with the cloud service industry, and cloud service providers may not be familiar with what is expected during bank-like examinations. The Federal Reserve's April 2019 examination of Amazon Websites Services (AWS; a cloud provider with bank clients) anecdotally illustrates the frictions in this area. Reportedly, AWS was wary of the process, and when examiners asked for additional documents and information, \"the company balked, demanding to first see details about how its [AWS's] data would be stored and used, and who would have access and for how long.\" ", "The cloud computing industry could pose risk to broader financial system stability in addition to risk at individual financial firms. Cloud computing resources are pooled, meaning cloud service providers build their resources to service many users simultaneously. This means many financial institutions could be using the same cloud provider, and are likely doing so because the cloud computing industry is highly concentrated at a small number of large providers (as discussed in more detail in the next section). Before cloud computing was available, successful cyberattacks or other technological disruptions would occur in individual institutions' systems. With cloud computing, an incident at one of the main cloud service providers could affect several firms simultaneously, thus affecting large portions of the entire financial system. Large, systemically important banks are reportedly moving significant portions of their operations onto cloud services, which could exacerbate the effects of a disruption at a cloud service provider.

In general, automation in underwriting relies on algorithms\u00e2\u0080\u0094precoded sets of instructions and calculations executed by a computer\u00e2\u0080\u0094to determine whether to extend credit to an applicant and under what terms. In contrast, human underwriting relies on a person to use knowledge, experience, and judgement (perhaps informed by a numerical credit score) to make assessments.", "More recently, with the proliferation of internet access and data availability, some new lenders\u00e2\u0080\u0094often referred to as marketplace lenders or fintech lenders \u00e2\u0080\u0094rely entirely or almost entirely on online platforms and algorithmic underwriting. In addition, the abundance of alternative data about prospective borrowers now available to lenders\u00e2\u0080\u0094either publicly accessible or accessed with the borrower's permission\u00e2\u0080\u0094means lenders can incorporate additional information beyond traditional data provided in credit reports and credit scores into assessments of whether a particular borrower is a credit risk.

However, such practices raise questions about what kind of data should be accessible and used in credit decisions and whether its use could result in disparate impacts or other consumer-protection violations. Although fintech lending remains a small part of the consumer lending market, it has been growing quickly in recent years.

Often these criticisms are based largely or in part on the argument that the state-by-state regulatory framework facing nonbank lenders is ill-suited to an internet-based (and hence borderless) industry. Opponents of this view assert that state-level licensing and consumer-protection laws, including usury laws (laws that target lending at unreasonably high interest rates), are important safeguards that should not be circumvented. ", "Additional policy questions arise in cases where banks and nonbanks have partnered with each other to issue loans, such as in an arrangement depicted in Figure 1 . Fintech companies and banks enter into a variety of such arrangements in which one or the other may build the online, algorithmic platform; do the underwriting on the loan; secure the funding to make the loan; originate it; and hold it on its own balance sheet or sell it to investors. These arrangements generally require a bank to closely examine its compliance obligations related to vendor relationship requirements, discussed in more detail in this report's \" Banks and Third-Party Vendor Relationships \" section. In addition, certain arrangements have raised legal questions concerning federal preemption of state usury laws\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically, whether federal laws that allow banks to export their home states' maximum interest rates apply to loans that are originated by banks but later purchased by nonbank entities. Whether applicable laws and regulations governing these arrangements are appropriately calibrated to ensure availability of needed and beneficial credit or expose consumers to potential harm through the preemption of important consumer protections is a matter of debate.", "Another area of debate is how consumers will be affected by fintech in lending. Fintech lending proponents argue that, because financial technologies increasingly use quantitative analysis of new data sources, the technologies may expand credit availability to individuals and small businesses in a fair, safe, and less costly way. Thus, these proponents argue that overly burdensome regulation of these technologies could cut off a beneficial credit source to individuals who may have previously lacked sufficient credit access. However, some consumer advocates argue that inexperienced fintech lenders with a relative lack of federal regulatory supervision could inadvertently violate consumer-protection regulations. For example, these lenders may make loan decisions that unintentionally have a disparate impact on protected groups, violating fair lending laws. Also, when lenders deny a loan application they generally must send a notice to the applicant explaining the reason for the denial, called an adverse action notice .

Hence, the prudential depository regulators issued interagency guidelines in 2001 that require banks to establish information security programs. Among other things, banks must regularly assess the risks to consumer information (in paper, electronic, or other form) and implement appropriate policies, procedures, testing, and training to mitigate risks that could cause substantial harm and inconvenience to customers.

For example, questions surround how to assign blame if an investment loss occurred through an AI-based system\u00e2\u0080\u0094should the designer of the AI system or the investment manager incorporating its use bare the blame and penalty? If asset management continues to become increasingly automated, policymakers may weigh these risks and concerns against possible benefits, such as reduced cost and increased access.

Fintech could affect insurance throughout the business, including insurance products, underwriting, claims, and marketing, and across all lines of insurance (life, health, and property and casualty [P&C]). Potential aspects of insurtech include peer-to-peer insurance, Big Data, artificial intelligence, blockchain, mobile technology, and insurance on demand. Specific examples could include life or health insurers offering discounts for people wearing devices that track activity and fitness; auto insurers offering discounts for cars that include telematics devices tracking drivers' behavior; and insurers scanning social media as an underwriting tool or to detect fraud. In 2017, the fastest-growing P&C insurer by direct premiums written was an auto insurer, Metromile Insurance, offering per-mile insurance with a telematics tracker. In 2018, the fastest-growing P&C insurer was Root Insurance, also a telematics-based auto insurer, and the second-fastest growing was Lemonade Insurance, a homeowners and renters insurer using technology like chatbots and AI to sell and service policies.", "Unlike banks or securities firms, the primary regulators for insurers are the individual states. An insurer is required to obtain a charter or license in every state in which it operates. The states coordinate insurance regulatory policies through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and have been active in addressing issues raised by technology. In 2017, NAIC created an NAIC Insurance and Technology task force and adopted a model law relating to insurer data security. A U.S. Department of the Treasury report specifically encouraged states to adopt the model law and, as of August 4, 2019, seven states had adopted the model with another state considering adoption.

The 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act generally provides for a state-based system, but Congress can enact laws overriding the states and has done so on a number of occasions. Congress has also conducted oversight on specific aspects of the insurance regulatory system and encouraged the states to act on issues without enacting specific statutes at the federal level. Given the breadth of technology's potential impact on insurance, Congress might question numerous aspects of the states' approach to the new technology, including the impact on consumers and the potential for regulatory arbitrage between the federal regulatory approach for banks and securities firms and the state regulatory approach for insurers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Risk Management and Regtech187", "paragraphs": ["Risk-management and compliance functions in financial firms frequently rely on data analysis to assess the risk of bad outcomes, such as wrongdoing or financial losses. For example, in anti-money laundering compliance, financial firms are required to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) when transactions by a customer appear potentially to be tied to illicit crime, fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, or other transgressions. In addition, banks may also be subject to requirements involving stress testing, modeling risks, forecasting, and monitoring employees and internal risk (e.g., the probability that a risky trade under consideration could imperil a bank's capital or liquidity positions). Regulators also must monitor for certain risks or unfolding events (e.g., securities markets regulators trying to detect illegal trading practices). Companies are increasingly using innovative technology in these risk management and regulatory compliance activities. Sometimes in the latter case, the technology is referred to as regtech .", "Algorithms are especially well suited to sifting through, analyzing, and identifying patterns in large data sets, and so potentially could be used in these risk assessment and compliance functions. Algorithms' increased sophistication and the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence have fueled strong interest in the financial industry in further using these technologies to automate risk-management and compliance functions. For example, FINRA predicts that such tools will help with anti-money laundering processes; surveilling internal firm employees involved in placing trades on a firm's behalf; broker-dealer trade execution for customers; ensuring customer data privacy and preventing security risks; and centralizing supervisory control systems for additional risk management.", "In large part, the goal of cost savings is driving the development and adoption of automation in compliance. Some financial firms argue that because they are relatively more regulated than firms in other industries, they must deploy automation wherever possible to reduce compliance costs and remain profitable and competitive. Certain industry observers predict that the cost of processes that involve prediction will drop in coming years and the accuracy of automated prediction processes will continue to increase.", "However, exactly how these technologies will develop and be deployed in regulatory compliance, and what outcomes they will produce if deployed, remains to be seen.

While automation could more efficiently collect and act on information, individuals may be uncomfortable that their transactions and private information could be instantly reported to the government or their financial situation affected through a process that involved no human judgement or oversight. For example, should a human have to file a SAR about a customer to the Treasury Department, or should the filing of such reports be completely automated? To take this example a step further, should the decision to close a customer's account be fully automated as well?", "Regtech tools also raise similar privacy and cybersecurity risks as the other technologies discussed in this report. After all, certain regtech programs involve the automated monitoring of individuals' and private companies' financial transactions, flagging some of those transactions as suspicious, and reporting those transactions to government agencies. Policymakers may consider under what circumstances certain regtech processes inappropriately impinge on people's privacy.", "To the extent that certain processes or functions can be automated to achieve greater regulatory efficiency or effectiveness, questions exist concerning whether regulators need to be more active in deploying compliance technologies themselves and allowing the institutions they regulate to do so.

Thus, policymakers may consider ways to reduce regulatory uncertainty and integrate fintech into the regulatory framework. This often involves balancing efforts to encourage innovation while protecting consumers and the financial system from excessive risk. Many still-evolving terms are used to describe different programs regulators have implemented or proposed to address fintech uncertainty. Such programs are often informally called sandboxes or greenhouses . Generally, such programs use at least one of a variety of approaches. ", "One such approach involves fostering communication between fintech firms and regulators. Communication can help these firms better understand how regulators view a developing technology and potential regulatory concerns. Communication also helps make regulators aware of new fintech innovations when developing new or interpreting existing regulations. As discussed below, certain regulators have established offices within their organizations to conduct outreach to fintechs\u00e2\u0080\u0094including maintaining outreach websites, participating in fintech conferences, and organizing office hours with fintech firms. In another approach, some regulators have announced research collaborations with fintech firms to improve their understanding of new products and technologies. Such initiatives could include jointly designing a research trial or fintech firms sharing data about their product performance with regulators. ", "Another potential approach policymakers may use if they determine that particular regulations are unnecessarily burdensome or otherwise ill-suited to a particular technology is to exempt companies or products that meet certain criteria from such regulations. Similarly, a regulator could issue a no-a ction letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094an official communication stating a regulator does not expect to take enforcement actions in certain situations. Regulators will often only provide such special regulatory treatment to companies that first demonstrate that consumers will not be exposed to undue harm or meet other conditions, like agreeing to share data with regulators for research purposes. Regulatory uncertainty can be resolved if regulators offer or require certain fintech firms to enter a regulatory regime with well-defined permissions, restrictions, and responsibilities. For example, a regulator could offer or require a specific charter or license for certain firms.", "Financial regulators have begun to implement some of these approaches through a number of rulemakings and by establishing programs and offices and taskforces within agencies.

Scott."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Possible Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["The regulatory approaches described above could be supported or opposed by various stakeholders depending on how they are designed and implemented and which firms or products are affected. For example, while fintech firms may want to reduce regulatory uncertainty and operate under one set of rules nationally (rather than different rules in each state), they may also oppose new or additional data-reporting requirements. Incumbent financial institutions may argue that regulatory tailoring and exemptions for fintech firms would put incumbents at a competitive disadvantage. State regulators and consumer advocates may oppose any federal charter that would preempt state consumer-protection laws. ", "Congress or financial regulators may consider various regulatory approaches. Policymakers choosing to tailor regulation for fintechs could apply a different regulatory treatment either to companies or to products. If the goal is to provide new, inexperienced firms an opportunity to learn how they and their products would be regulated, institution-based regulation for firms meeting criteria associated with start-up companies may be the better option. But if the goal is to integrate a new technology regardless of the size or sophistication of the firm offering it, the differentiated regulatory treatment could apply to the product rather than the firm. Policymakers could also choose to tailor regulation for fintechs meeting certain objective criteria. Alternatively, regulators could use discretion in determining which fintech companies or products would qualify for such tailoring, potentially based on authorities or directions enacted in legislation. Policymakers may also consider how long to apply a particular regulatory treatment to a fintech company or product.
