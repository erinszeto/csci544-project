By doing so, the program aims to help federal agencies achieve their statutory goal of awarding 5% of their federal contracting dollars to WOSBs.", "Under this program, federal contracting officers may set aside federal contracts (or orders) for WOSBs (including EDWOSBs) in industries in which the SBA determines WOSBs are substantially underrepresented in federal procurement and for EDWOSBs exclusively in industries in which the SBA determines WOSBs are underrepresented in federal procurement. The SBA has identified 364 six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry codes (out of 1,023) in which federal agencies may set aside federal contracts exclusively for WOSBs (including EDWOSBs) and 80 six-digit NAICS industry codes (out of 1,023) that may be set aside exclusively for EDWOSBs.", "Federal agencies may also award sole source contracts to WOSBs and EDWOSBs in eligible industries under the following conditions: the contracting officer does not have a reasonable expectation that offers would be received by two or more eligible WOSBs and EDWOSBs; the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price; and the anticipated total value of the contract, including any options, is below $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts).", "To participate in the program, WOSBs must", "be a small business (as defined by the SBA); be at least 51% unconditionally and directly owned and controlled by one or more women who are U.S. citizens; have women manage day-to-day operations and make long-term decisions; and be certified by a federal agency, a state government, the SBA, or a national certifying entity approved by the SBA.", "EDWOSBs must", "meet all the requirements of the WOSB contracting program; be owned and controlled by one or more women, each with a personal net worth less than $750,000; be owned and controlled by one or more women, each with $350,000 or less in adjusted gross income averaged over the previous three years; and be owned and controlled by one or more women, each\u00c2 having $6 million or less in personal assets (including business value and primary residence).", "The WOSB program's legislative history is a bit more complicated than other small business contracting programs, primarily due to the distinctions between WOSBs and EDWOSBs and among underrepresented, substantially underrepresented, and other NAICS codes. These distinctions were designed to shield the WOSB program from legal challenges related to the heightened level of legal scrutiny applied to contracting preferences after the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena (1995), which involved contracting preferences for small disadvantaged businesses. The Court found in that case that all racial classifications, whether imposed by federal, state, or local authorities, must pass strict scrutiny review.", "An unintended consequence of these distinctions has been the SBA's difficulty in defining these terms, which contributed to a 10-year delay in the program's implementation and may help to explain why it has taken the SBA nearly six years to implement its own WOSB certification process as required by P.L. 113-291 , the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. That act also prohibited small businesses from self-certifying their eligibility for the WOSB program to ensure the program's contracts are awarded only to intended recipients. The SBA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register on December 18, 2015, to solicit public comments on drafting a proposed rule to meet these requirements. The proposed rule was issued on May 14, 2019, and the final rule implementing the certification program and removing the self-certification option was issued on May 11, 2020.

Congress's interest in promoting small business contracting dates back to World War II and the outbreak of fighting in Korea. At that time, Congress found that thousands of small business concerns were being threatened by war-induced shortages of materials coupled with an inability to obtain defense contracts or financial assistance. In 1953, concerned that many small businesses might fail without government assistance, Congress passed, and President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law, the Small Business Act (P.L. 83-163). The act authorized the SBA. ", "The Small Business Act specifies that it is Congress's declared policy to promote the interests of small businesses to \"preserve free competitive enterprise.\" Congress indicated that one of the ways to preserve free competitive enterprise was to increase market competition by insuring that small businesses received a \"fair proportion\" of federal contracts and subcontracts.", "Since 1953, Congress has used its broad authority to impose requirements on the federal procurement process to help small businesses receive a fair proportion of federal contracts and subcontracts, primarily through the establishment of federal procurement goals and various contracting preferences\u00e2\u0080\u0094including restricted competitions (set-asides), sole source awards, and price evaluation adjustment/preference in unrestricted competitions\u00e2\u0080\u0094for small businesses. Congress has also authorized the following:", "government-wide and agency-specific goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses generally and to specific types of small businesses, including at least 5% to WOSBs; an annual Small Business Goaling Report to measure progress in meeting these goals; a general requirement for federal agencies to reserve (set aside) contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000) but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000); and, under specified conditions, contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses. A set-aside is a commonly used term to refer to a contract competition in which only small businesses, or specific types of small businesses, may compete; federal agencies to make sole source awards to small businesses when the award could not otherwise be made (e.g., only a single source is available, under urgent and compelling circumstances); federal agencies to set aside contracts for, or grant other contracting preference to, specific types of small businesses (e.g., Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program (known as the 8(a) program) small businesses, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small businesses, WOSBs, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs)); and the SBA and other federal procurement officers to review and restructure proposed procurements to maximize opportunities for small business participation.", "Additional requirements are in place to maximize small business participation as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. For example, prior to issuing a solicitation, federal contracting officers must do the following, among other requirements:", "divide proposed acquisitions of supplies and services (except construction) into reasonably small lots to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement; plan acquisitions such that, if practicable, more than one small business concern may perform the work, if the work exceeds the amount for which a surety may be guaranteed by the SBA against loss under 15 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7694b [generally $6.5 million, or $10 million if the contracting officer certifies that the higher amount is necessary]; encourage prime contractors to subcontract with small business concerns, primarily through the agency's role in negotiating an acceptable small business subcontracting plan with prime contractors on contracts anticipated to exceed $700,000 or $1.5 million for construction contracts; and under specified circumstances, provide a copy of the proposed acquisition package to an SBA procurement center representative (PCR) for his or her review, comment, and recommendation at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the solicitation.

", "The data on WOSB federal contract awards suggest that federal procurement officers are using the WOSB program more often than in the past, but the amount of WOSB awarded contracts account for a relatively small portion of the total amount of contracts awarded to WOSBs. Most of the federal contracts awarded to WOSBs are awarded in full and open competition with other firms or with another small business preference, such as an 8(a) or HUBZone program preference. Relatively few federal contracts are awarded through the WOSB program (see Table 1 ).", "In addition, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the SBA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) have noted deficiencies in the SBA's implementation and oversight of the program. For example, the WOSB program was authorized on December 21, 2000. The SBA took nearly 10 years to issue a final rule for the program (on October 7, 2010) and another four months before the program actually went into effect (on February 4, 2011). The SBA attributed the delay primarily to its difficulty in identifying an appropriate methodology to determine \"the industries in which WOSBs are underrepresented with respect to federal procurement contracting.\" ", "P.L. 113-291 , the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (NDAA 2015), enacted on December 19, 2014, removed the ability of small businesses to self-certify their eligibility for the WOSB program as a means to ensure that the program's contracts are awarded only to intended recipients.

Among other provisions, the executive order required federal agencies \"to take appropriate affirmative action in support of women's business enterprise,\" including promoting procurement opportunities and providing financial assistance and business-related management and training assistance.", "Under authority provided by Executive Order 12138, the SBA added WOSB procurement goals to the list of small business contracting goals it negotiated with federal agencies. At that time, WOSBs received about 0.2% of all federal contracts. By 1988, this percentage had grown, but to only 1% of all federal contracts.", "WOSB advocates argued that additional action was needed to help WOSBs win federal contracts because women-owned businesses are subject to \"age-old prejudice, discrimination, and exploitation,\" the \"promotion of women's business enterprise is simply not a high priority\" for federal agencies, and federal \"agency efforts in support of women's business enterprise have been weak and have produced little, if any measurable results.\" Their efforts led to P.L. 100-533 , the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988.", "P.L. 100-533 provided the SBA statutory authorization to establish WOSB annual procurement goals with federal agencies. The act also extended the goaling requirement to include subcontracts, as well as prime contracts, and added WOSBs to the list of small business concerns to be identified in required small business subcontracting plans (at that time, small business subcontracting plans were required for prime contracts exceeding $500,000, or $1 million for the construction of any public facility)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government-Wide Small Business Procurement Goals", "paragraphs": ["In a related development, P.L. 100-656 , the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988, authorized the President to annually establish government-wide minimum procurement goals for small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (SDBs).

The reduction took place because NAICS 2017 merged two four-digit NAICS industry groups that affected the WOSB program.

Issues of particular interest to Congress may include congressional oversight of the SBA's implementation of the WOSB program's certification procedures; congressional oversight of the SBA's training of federal procurement officers to ensure that WOSB awards are made only to eligible firms in eligible industries; the performance of federal agencies in achieving the 5% procurement goal for WOSBs; and the WOSB program's efficacy in helping to meet the 5% goal.", "As shown in Table 1 , federal procurement officers' use of the WOSB program has increased from about $21 million in FY2011 to $893 million in FY2018, with most of that increase resulting from rising use of WOSB set-asides (from $15 million in FY2011 to $742 million in FY2018). Although WOSB program usage is increasing, WOSB set-asides and sole source awards continue to account for a relatively small portion of the federal contracts awarded to WOSBs. Although the WOSB program has been operational since 2011, many federal agencies have little experience with the program. ", "For example, in FY2018, about 63% of the federal contracts awarded to WOSBs were awarded in full and open competition with other firms, about 33% were awarded with another small business preference (such as the 8(a) and HUBZone programs), and about 4% were awarded with a WOSB preference. ", "Also, GAO found that from the third quarter of FY2011 through the third quarter of FY2018, six federal agencies accounted for nearly 83% of the contract amount awarded under the WOSB program: DOD (48.6%), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (12.4%), Department of Commerce (8.0%), Department of Agriculture (6.3%), Department of Health and Human Services (4.0%), and GSA (4.0%). All other federal agencies accounted for 16.8%. ", "GAO conducted an audit of the WOSB program from October 2017 to March 2019. As part of the audit, GAO interviewed 14 stakeholder groups (staff from DHS, DOD, and GSA, eight contracting officers within these agencies, and three WOSB third-party certifiers) to obtain their views on WOSB program usage. The stakeholder groups identified several positive aspects about the WOSB program, including that it provided WOSBs greater opportunities to win federal contracts, and that the SBA had several initiatives underway to help improve collaboration between federal agencies and the small business community. The stakeholders also identified several impediments that limited the WOSB program's use by federal contracting officers, including the following:", "Sole S ource A uthority R ules .", "Executing sole source authority under the WOSB program is difficult for contracting officers because rules for sole source authority under the WOSB program are different from those under SBA programs.... For example, the FAR's [Federal Acquisition Regulation] requirement that contracting officers must justify, in writing, why they do not expect other WOSBs or EDWOSBs to submit offers on a contract is stricter under the WOSB program that it is for the 8(a) program.", "Industry Restrict i ons .", "13 of the 14 stakeholder groups ... commented on the requirement that WOSB program set-asides be awarded within certain industries, represented by NAICS codes. For example, two third-party certifiers ... recommended that the NAICS codes be expanded or eliminated to provide greater opportunities for WOSBs to win contracts under the program.", "Eligibility Documentation Requirements .", "7 of the 14 stakeholder groups discussed the requirement for the contracting officer to review program eligibility documentation and how this requirement affects their decision to use the program. ", "For example, staff from one contracting office said that using the 8(a) or HUBZone programs is easier because 8(a) and HUBZone applicants are already certified by the SBA; therefore, the additional step to verify documentation for eligibility is not needed.... GSA officials noted that eliminating the need for contracting officers to take additional steps to review eligibility documentation for WOSB-program set-asides could create more opportunities for WOSBs by reducing burdens on contracting officers. ", "Need for A dditional G uidance .", "13 of the 14 stakeholder groups discussed guidance available to federal contracting officers under the WOSB program. For example, two third-party certifiers identified the need for additional training and guidance for federal contracting officers, and staff from two federal contracting offices said that the last time that they had received training on the WOSB program was in 2011, when the program was first implemented. ", "In a related development, the House passed legislation ( H.R. 190 , the Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2019) which would, among other provisions, eliminate the inclusion of option periods in the award price for sole source contracts awarded to qualified HUBZone small businesses, SDBs, SDVOSBs, and WOSBs (including EDWOSBs). This provision would increase the number of contracts available for sole source awards to these recipients because the option years would not count toward the statutory caps on sole source awards (the WOSB caps are currently $6.5 million for manufacturing contracts and $4 million for other contracts). The bill would also increase the WOSB sole source cap to $7 million for manufacturing contracts to align them with the $7 million cap for the HUBZone and 8(a) program small businesses. ", "Also, some WOSB advocates have suggested that the WOSB program should be amended to (1) eliminate the distinction and disparate treatment of WOSBs and EDWOSBs when awarding contracts, and/or (2) allow set-asides and sole source awards to WOSBs (including EDWOSBs) in all NAICS industry codes regardless of WOSB representation, as is the case for other small business preference programs. Both legislative options could lead to an increase in the amount of contracts awarded to WOSBs. In the first instance, WOSBs would be eligible for set-asides and sole source awards in both underrepresented and substantially underrepresented NAICS codes, instead of just substantially underrepresented NAICS codes. In the latter instance, WOSBs and EDWOSBs would be eligible for set-asides and sole source awards in all NAICS industry codes, not just underrepresented or substantially underrepresented NAICS industry codes.", "As mentioned in the \"A Targeted Approach to Avoid Legal Challenges\" section, one of the reasons the WOSB program provides disparate treatment to WOSBs and EDWOSBs, and makes distinctions among underrepresented, substantially underrepresented, and other NAICS industry codes was to address the heightened level of legal scrutiny related to contracting preferences following the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena . The Supreme Court ruled that all racial classifications, whether imposed by federal, state, or local authorities, must pass strict scrutiny review (i.e., they must serve a compelling government interest and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest). Although the WOSB program is not based on racial classifications, it was expected to receive a heightened level of judicial scrutiny. As such, it lead the WOSB program's advocates to create these distinctions in an effort to shield it from legal challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned in the \" Introduction ,\" the WOSB program is one of several contracting programs that Congress has approved to provide greater opportunities for small businesses to win federal contracts. Its legislative history is a bit more complicated than others, primarily due to the distinctions between WOSBs and EDWOSBs and among underrepresented, substantially underrepresented, and other NAICS codes. These distinctions, and the SBA's difficulty in defining them, led to the 10-year delay in the program's implementation and may also help to explain why the SBA's implementation of the SBA's certification program was delayed nearly six years. ", "The SBA's implementation of the WOSB program is likely to remain a priority for congressional oversight during the 116 th Congress, as is federal agency use of the program. As mentioned, the federal government has met the 5% procurement goal for WOSBs only once (in FY2015) since the goal was authorized in 1994, and implemented in FY1996.", "Also, the data on WOSB federal contract awards suggest that federal procurement officers are using the WOSB program more often than in the past, but the program accounts for a relatively small portion of WOSB contracts. Most of the federal contracts awarded to WOSBs are awarded in full and open competition with other firms or with another small business preference program (such as the 8(a) and HUBZone programs). Relatively few federal contracts are awarded through the WOSB program. Determining why this is the case, and if anything can, or should be done to address this, is likely to be of continuing congressional interest. "], "subsections": []}]}}
