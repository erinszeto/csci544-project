Understanding the differences between these two accounting methods could be helpful to Congress as it considers reforming the tax system and changing the federal government's financial reporting requirements.", "Currently with certain exceptions, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) requires some companies with gross receipts in excess of $5 million to use accrual basis, instead of cash basis, of accounting to determine their tax liabilities. The IRC's requirement to use the accrual method, arguably, ensures that revenue and the expenses incurred to generate that revenue are realized in the same year. Types of companies that may be excepted from using accrual basis of accounting for income taxes are sole proprietors and certain qualified personal service corporations (PSCs) in such fields as health, law, engineering, accounting, performing arts, and consulting firms, as well as farms that are not corporations or do not have a corporate partner.", "Some Members of Congress have put forth proposals to revise the circumstances under which certain companies are able to use cash method. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp introduced H.R. 1, the Tax Reform Act of 2014, on December 10, 2014. Among the changes proposed in the bill is the requirement that some partnerships, S corporations, and PSCs use the accrual method instead of the cash method to determine their federal taxable liability. Specifically, these business types would be required to use the accrual method if their average annual gross receipts exceeded $10 million. Former Senate Committee on Finance Chairman Max Baucus included a similar provision in his Cost Recovery and Accounting staff discussion draft, which has not been formally introduced as legislation. The Small Business Accounting and Tax Simplification Act (H.R. 947), Start-up Jobs and Innovation Act (S. 1658), and Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act (S. 1085), introduced in the 113th Congress, would raise the gross receipt test limit from $5 million to $10 million.", "The President's budget is prepared primarily using cash basis. The Financial Report of the United States Government is prepared using both accrual and modified cash basis. For the past 17 years, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued a disclaimer of opinion on the Financial Report of the United States Government. One of the reasons stated by GAO for the disclaimer of opinion for the 2013 financial report was that the federal government's process for preparing the consolidated financial statements was ineffective to determine whether the financial reports were presented fairly in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).", "A number of congressional proposals would change how the U.S. government's financial reports are prepared.

The IRC's current requirement that certain businesses use the accrual method arguably addresses the concern that if related revenue and expense items that contribute to income are assigned to different years, then neither year's income nor tax liability will be properly reported by the business.", "Under the current IRC, an exception exists for certain farms, partnerships, S corporations, and Personal Service Corporations (PSCs)\u2014allowing these entities to use cash accounting regardless of their average gross receipts.

First, from an asset perspective, an accrual is recorded when a service has been performed or a product has been delivered by a company but the payment has not yet been received.

Cash basis is simpler for record keeping but arguably, the process of matching revenue and expenses under accrual basis accounting leads to a better understanding of the financial condition of a business compared to the results under cash accounting.

The accrual method more accurately reflects the revenue and expense items used to generate income in the taxable year, not merely the cash flows occurring within the period. According to the legislation businesses with average gross receipts of less than $10 million could use the cash method as it is easier for record keeping and requires less effort. Changing from the cash method to accrual method could cause taxpayers to recognize income as a result of the change in accounting methods. Taxes paid on this income would increase federal revenues. Changing the timing of when income is recognized could also accelerate or defer tax liability. A deferral decreases the real value of tax payments over time, due to the time value of money.

A business relies on its assets to help generate future income and cash, whereas the government relies on tax revenue (or cash receipts) to provide services to its citizens. Arguably, a government's effectiveness can be assessed based on the quality of services provided to its citizens rather than by the revenue it generates from using its existing assets.
