The USGS Streamgaging Network encompasses 10,300 streamgages, which record water levels or streamflow for at least a portion of the year. Approximately 8,200 of these streamgages measure streamflow year round as part of the National Streamflow Network. The USGS also deploys temporary rapid deployment gages to measure water levels during storm events, and select streamgages measure water quality.", "Streamgages provide foundational information for diverse applications that affect a variety of constituents. The USGS disseminates streamgage data free to the public and responds to over 670 million requests annually. Direct users of streamgage data include a variety of agencies at all levels of government, private companies, scientific institutions, and recreationists. Data from streamgages inform real-time decisionmaking and long-term planning on issues such as water management and energy development, infrastructure design, water compacts, water science research, flood mapping and forecasting, water quality, ecosystem management, and recreational safety.", "Congress has provided the USGS with authority and appropriations to conduct surveys of streamflow since establishing the first hydrological survey in 1889. Many streamgages are operated cooperatively with nonfederal partners, who approach the USGS and sign joint-funding agreements to share the cost of streamgages and data collection. The USGS Cooperative Matching Funds (CMF) Program provides up to a 50% match with tribal, regional, state, and local partners, as authorized by 43 U.S.C. \u00a750. The average nonfederal cost-share contribution has increased from 50% in the early 1990s to 63% in FY2018. In the early 2000s, the USGS designated federal priority streamgage (FPS) locations based on five identified national needs. The SECURE Water Act of 2009 (Title IX, Subtitle F, of P.L. 111-11) directed the USGS to operate by FY2019 no less than 4,700 federally funded streamgages. In FY2018, 3,640 of the 4,760 FPSs designated by the USGS were operational, with 52% of their funding from the USGS.", "Congressional appropriations and agreements with 1,400 nonfederal partners funded USGS streamgages at $189.5 million in FY2018. The USGS share included $24.7 million for FPSs and $29.8 million for cooperative streamgages through CMF. A dozen other federal agencies provided $40.7 million. Nonfederal partners, mostly affiliated with CMF, provided $94.3 million. In FY2019, Congress appropriated level funding for FPS and CMF streamgages. Congress directed an additional $8.5 million to pilot a Next Generation Integrated Water Observing System (NextGen), establishing dense networks of streamgages in representative watersheds in order to model streamflow in analogous watersheds. The President's budget request for FY2020 does not include NextGen system funding and would reduce CMF for streamgages by $250,000.", "The USGS uses appropriated funding to develop and maintain the USGS Streamgaging Network. The USGS and numerous stakeholders have raised funding considerations including user needs, priorities of partners, federal coverage, infrastructure repair, disaster response, inflation, and technological advances. Some stakeholders advocate for maintaining or expanding the network. Others may argue that Congress should consider reducing the network in order to prioritize other activities and that other entities operate streamgages tailored to localized needs. Congress might also consider whether to invest in streamgage restoration and new technologies.", "Congress may consider outlining the future direction for the USGS Streamgaging Network through oversight or legislation. As the USGS faces a deadline by the SECURE Water Act of 2009 to operate no less than 4,700 FPSs by FY2019, Congress directed the USGS through appropriations legislation to invest in the NextGen system.

Direct users of streamgage data include a variety of agencies from all levels of government, utility companies, consulting firms, scientific institutions, and recreationists.", "Streamgages are operated across the globe with national programs in North America, Europe, Australia, and Brazil, among others. In the United States, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Department of the Interior's (DOI's) lead scientific agency, manages the USGS Streamgaging Network ( Figure 1 ). The network encompasses 10,300 streamgages that record water height or streamflow for at least a portion of the year. Approximately 8,200 of these streamgages measure streamflow year-round and are part of the National Streamflow Network. This subnetwork includes 3,640 Federal Priority Streamgages (FPSs), which Congress and the USGS designated as national priorities (see section on \" Federal Priority Streamgages \"). Some entities, such as state governments, operate their own streamgages separate from the USGS Streamgaging Network. ", "Congressional appropriations and agreements with approximately 1,400 nonfederal partners funded the USGS Streamgaging Network at $189.5 million in FY2018. Some streamgages are funded solely through congressional appropriations for the USGS and other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and Department of Defense (DOD). Much of the USGS Streamgaging Network is funded cooperatively. Interested parties sign funding agreements with the USGS to share the cost of streamgages and data collection. The USGS Cooperative Matching Funds Program (CMF) provides up to a 50% match with tribal, regional, state, and local partners (see section on \" Cooperative Matching Funds Program \"). Other federal agencies, nonfederal governments, and nongovernmental entities may provide reimbursable funding for streamgages in the USGS Streamgaging Network without contributed funds from the USGS. ", "Evolving federal policies and user needs from diverse stakeholders have shaped the size, organization, and function of the USGS streamgage program. This report provides an overview of federal streamgages by describing the function of a streamgage, the data available from streamgage measurements, and the uses of streamgage information. The report also outlines the structure and funding of the USGS Streamgaging Network and discusses potential issues for Congress, such as funding priorities and the future structure of the nation's streamgage network. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is a Streamgage?", "paragraphs": ["A streamgage's primary purpose is to collect data on water levels and streamflow (the amount of water flowing through a river or stream over time). Streamgages estimate streamflow based on (1) continuous measurements of stage height (the height of the water surface) and (2) periodic measurements of streamflow, or discharge, in the channel and floodplains. USGS measurements are used to create rating curves, in order to convert continuously measured stage heights into estimates of streamflow. Selected streamgages may provide additional measurements, such as measurements of water quality (see box on \"Supergages\").", "Streamgages house instruments to measure, store, and transmit stream stage height ( Figure 2 ). Stage height is usually transmitted every hour, or more frequently at 5 to 15 minute intervals for emergency or priority streamgages. Most streamgages transmit data by satellite to USGS computers; the data then are provided online to the public. Numerous streamgages also have cameras that capture and transmit photos of streamflow conditions.", "Periodic streamflow measurements require USGS personnel to measure discharge at various sections across the stream. Streamflow measurements are made every six to eight weeks to capture a range of stage heights and streamflows, especially at high and low stage heights. Repeated measurements allow scientists to capture changes to the channel from vegetation growth, sedimentation, or erosion, which can affect the relationship between stage height and streamflow. ", "The USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) receives and converts all stream height data from USGS streamgages into streamflow estimates. An example of streamgage data from NWIS is shown in Figure 3 for a site capturing peak streamflow during a hurricane event. The free and publicly accessible data are frequently accessed online or by request to users. For example, the agency responded to over 670 million requests for streamflow and water level information in 2018. The NWIS website is the main repository for current and historical streamflow data, in addition to other water information. Tools such as WaterWatch summarize the current conditions of the nation's streams and watersheds through maps, graphs, and tables by comparing real-time streamflow conditions to historic streamflow from streamgages with records of 30 years or more. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Streamgage Uses", "paragraphs": ["The USGS Streamgaging Network provides streamflow information to assist during natural and man-made disasters, such as flooding and drought, and to inform economic and statutory water management decisions, such as the allocation of water supplies for irrigation. Individual streamgages in the network also can serve multiple uses. For example, a streamgage intentionally established for the purpose of reservoir management may provide data to inform water quality standards, habitat assessments, and recreational activities. Additionally, the value of a single streamgage is enhanced by the operation of the entire network, particularly for research, modeling, and forecasting.", "Streamgages were first established in the United States to inform water use and infrastructure planning\u2014applications that benefit from continuous, long-term hydrologic records (see box on \"Evolution of Streamgage Uses\"). Long and continuous periods of data are used to construct baselines for water conditions and to identify deviations in the amount and timing of streamflow caused by changes in land use, water use, and climate. Some stakeholders contend that the value of streamflow records increases over time, with at least 20 years of continuous coverage needed for many applications. ", "Technological advances allowing access to streamflow information in real time have expanded the uses of streamgages. Real-time forecasting and operational decisionmaking are used in many applications of streamflow data. Web and phone applications also have facilitated increased public use of water information. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Examples of Streamgage Uses", "paragraphs": ["Streamgage data is used for a wide range of applications, including supporting activities of federal agencies. There are also a variety of streamgages tailored for specific purposes. The following is a noncomprehensive selection of streamgage uses to illustrate the scope of applications.", "W ater M anagement and Energy D evelopment . USACE, Reclamation, and various state and local water management agencies use streamgages to inform the design and operation of thousands of water management projects across the nation. Timely streamflow information helps water managers make daily operational decisions as they balance water requirements for municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses. Energy production and mineral extraction operations also rely on continuous streamflow measurements to comply with environmental, water quality, or temperature requirements. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requires hydropower companies to support USGS streamflow and water-level monitoring as part of their FERC licensing process. ", "Infrastructure Design . Transportation agencies use streamflow data to develop regional flow frequency curves for the design of bridges and culverts, stream stability measures, and analysis of bridge scour\u2014the leading cause of bridge failure. Without adequate information, some observers contend that engineers may overdesign structures, resulting in greater costs, or may not make proper allowances for floods, compromising public safety. ", "Interstate and International Water Rights . Federal streamgages are used to collect streamflow information at U.S. borders and between states. Streamgage data informs interstate compacts, Supreme Court decrees, and international treaties (e.g., under the purview of the International Boundary and Water Commission and the International Joint Commission). ", "Water Science Research . Many federal agencies depend on consistent, long-term data from streamgages to conduct water research and modeling (e.g., USACE, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], DOI, U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], and National Aeronautic and Space Administration [NASA]). To monitor climate trends and ecological patterns, the USGS distinguishes a subset of streamgages that are largely unaffected by development to serve as benchmarks for natural conditions. ", "Flood Mapping . The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) uses floodplain maps to establish flood risk zones and requires flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for properties with a 1% annual chance of flooding. Long-term streamflow records are used to determine 1% annual chance flood flows and to develop water surface profiles to map areas at risk of flooding. The USGS often works with FEMA to produce new inundation maps after streamgages record new streamflow peaks from weather events such as hurricanes. ", "Emergency F orecasting and Response. Streamgages inform flood forecasting and emergency response to protect lives and property. Real-time data from more than 3,600 streamgages allow NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) river forecasters to model watershed response, project future streamflows, forecast monthly to seasonal water availability, and issue appropriate flood watches and warnings (see box on \"National Water Model\"). Flood warnings provide lead time for emergency response agencies, such as FEMA, to take effective action in advance of rising waters. In addition, the USDA National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) uses streamgages to forecast flows for water supply, drought management and response, hydroelectric production, irrigation, and navigation in western states. ", "Water Q uality . Streamflow data is important for measuring water quality and developing water quality standards for sediments, pathogens, metals, nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), and organic compounds (e.g., pesticides). At select streamgages, the USGS also operates instruments recording water quality data (see box on \"Supergages\"). Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to develop total maximum daily load (TMDL) management plans for water bodies determined to be water quality impaired by one or more pollutants. When determining TMDL levels for specific pollutants, agencies may consider historic streamflow data, along with other factors, in their evaluations. Agencies may use current flow conditions when determining the proper release of wastewater to ensure compliance with TMDL standards and National Discharge Elimination System permitting. ", "Ecosystem Management and Species . Some water users and resource agencies use streamflow data to meet the flow requirements needed to protect endangered or threatened fish and wildlife under the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a71531 et seq.). Natural resource agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), collect streamflow data to understand how threatened and endangered species respond to flow variations. The USGS operates streamgages to monitor ecosystem restoration progress, such as restoration of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.", "Recreation . Real-time streamgage data can help individuals and tourism businesses assess stream conditions for recreational outings. USGS data can be used to decide if conditions are suitable for recreational activities such as fishing, boating, and rafting. The USGS also partners with the National Park Service (NPS) to provide water science and data to help manage parks and to enhance interpretive programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Network Structure", "paragraphs": ["The USGS Streamgaging Network is part of the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program under the USGS Water Resources mission area.

In 2018, CMF supported 5,345 streamgages (52% of the USGS Streamgaging Network).", "The first cooperative agreement began in 1895 with the Kansas Board of Irrigation Survey and Experiment (now known as the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture). Funds from cooperative entities steadily increased in the early 20 th century. Congress passed legislation in 1928 stipulating that the USGS can share up to 50% of the costs for water resources investigations carried out in cooperation with tribes, states, and municipalities (see Figure 5 ). In 2016, this Federal-State Cooperative Water Program was renamed the Cooperative Matching Funds Program (CMF), which provides cooperative funding for programs across the USGS Water Mission Area.", "To participate in the CMF, potential partners approach the USGS to discuss the need for a specific streamgage. The USGS determines its feasibility based on available funds and program priorities. If the USGS deems establishing the streamgage is feasible, the USGS and cooperator sign a joint funding agreement (JFA), which is a standard agreement that specifies how much each party will contribute to funding the streamgage and the payment schedule for the cooperator. These agreements span five years or less. During the agreement, the cost-share generally remains the same, but there is flexibility to alter the cost-share on an annual basis for multi-year agreements. Once a streamgage is operating, if a partner can no longer contribute funds, the USGS seeks to work with other partners that use the streamgage to augment funding. The USGS provides a website identifying streamgages that are in danger of being discontinued or converted to a reduced level of service due to lack of funding. The website also identifies streamgages that have been discontinued or are being supported by a new funding source.

Nonfederal partners sign JFAs, and federal partners share interagency agreements with the USGS (except USACE which uses a military interdepartmental purchase request). These gages are part of the USGS Streamgaging Network and are operated in accordance with the quality control and public access standards created by the USGS, with the agency assuming liability responsibility for the streamgages. ", "Public and private entities may also elect to own and operate streamgages tailored to their specific needs and not affiliated with the USGS.

In a 1998 report to Congress, the USGS stated that the streamgage program was in decline because of an absolute loss of streamgages, especially those with a long record, and asserted that the loss was due to partners discontinuing funding. Partners also had developed different needs for streamflow information. The USGS proposed the creation of an entirely federally funded NSIP to ensure a stable \"backbone\" network of streamgages to meet national needs. The USGS used five national needs to determine the number and location of these streamgage sites: ", "1. Meeting legal and treaty obligations on interstate and international waters. 2. Forecasting flow for NWS and NRCS. 3. Measuring river basin outflows to calculate regional water balances. 4. Monitoring benchmark watersheds for long-term trends in natural flows. 5. Measuring flow for water quality needs. ", "The original design included 4,300 active, previously discontinued, or proposed streamgage locations.

When the USGS does not receive disaster supplemental funding from Congress, the agency is not reimbursed for funding it redirects in order to provide around-the-clock monitoring during the events and equipment repair during and after the events. Some stakeholders have advocated for Congress to provide funds specifically for strengthening and restoring infrastructure, especially to withstand natural disasters. These stakeholders estimate that $238 million is needed to update half of the streamgages in the network to enable them to withstand major flood events and to meet new data transmitting requirements. Under budget constraints, increases in congressional appropriations are often prioritized to maintain or expand the network instead of restoration.

While regarded as reliable, many of the current streamgage operations are based on labor-intensive and more expensive techniques.

Others raise that these approaches may not provide the quality and consistency of data expected of USGS streamgages and may reduce funds available for existing operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Telemetry and Information Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["The SECURE Water Act of 2009 directed the USGS to equip all FPSs with modernized telemetry systems by FY2019. According to stakeholders, the current U.S. streamgage telemetry and information infrastructure may be vulnerable to failure, and the existing data collection platforms and computer networks might eventually be inefficient for real-time and detailed data. In September 2018, an error in telemetry equipment resulted in an outage of 11% of the network. The USGS stated that redundancy in telemetry using cellular signals or camera streaming could have alleviated the problem, which affected the network for weeks. The IMAGES Act of 2018 ( H.R. 4905 ) introduced in the 115 th Congress would have directed FEMA to work with USGS to modernize hardware and increase the speed of data transmittal, but the legislation did not specify funding amounts. Some stakeholders have suggested a figure of $112 million as the amount needed to upgrade the enterprise data management systems, information technology infrastructure, and real-time data delivery capabilities. Past increases of appropriations for streamgages have prioritized continued operation and network expansion over technological improvements. To mitigate costs for such upgrades, federal science agencies are considering cloud computing that could also benefit cloud providers if other users develop applications on the cloud network using the data already hosted there. The FY2020 budget request for the USGS outlines enhancement and modernization of NWIS with a centralized platform meeting the Federal Cloud First Computing Strategy. Some argue that Congress should fund alternative data infrastructure to ensure capacity and reliability of increased data while reducing the cost, though others may argue these strategies are not ready for full implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NextGen System", "paragraphs": ["The USGS suggests that modern models and computational methods to estimate streamflow in ungaged or sparsely gaged basins may provide an alternative approach to conventional streamgaging. These methods require more observational data, particularly for reference river basins, than that provided by the current streamgage network. In an effort to assess this approach, the USGS initiated a NextGen system pilot project in the Delaware River Basin with $1.5 million in FY2018 ( Figure 8 ), and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) provided $8.5 million for the NextGen system. Reports accompanying FY2019 Interior appropriations bills by the House and Senate in the 115 th Congress addressed the NextGen system. The Senate committee report encouraged the USGS to have a cost-effective strategy for the NextGen system ( S.Rept. 115-276 ), and the House committee report directed the USGS to provide the committee with a report on the NextGen system, explaining the limitations of the current water monitoring system, the enhancements and modernization needed, and costs to implement the system over a 10-year period and operate and maintain the system ( H.Rept. 115-765 ). The USGS says the funding will allow further the NextGen system implementation in the Delaware River Basin; continued progress in modernizing USGS data infrastructure; and the selection of the next basin. Advances by the NextGen system to estimate streamflow at ungagged locations based on modeling of highly measured reference basins could also result in reduced need for streamgages, lower costs, and expansion of coverage of streamflow data. Others may suggest that modeling streamflow may not provide adequate data as physical measurements, and initiating the NextGen system may result in decreased funding available for traditional operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Innovation", "paragraphs": ["Congress may also consider directing the USGS to pursue innovative observation technologies: satellite-based or airborne platforms, ultrasound sensors for river stage-height measurement, radar technology for stream velocity, and autonomous vehicles for Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and other types of remote sensing. The USGS is currently evaluating combining cameras and radars with advanced imagery analysis and installing these combined technologies on drone platforms to collect streamflow in difficult or inaccessible areas. Data coverage could also potentially increase with high-density sensing and sensor networks that use miniaturization, artificial intelligence, and economy of scale. Statistical advances to estimate streamflow at locations without streamgages could also result in reduced need for streamgages. Some suggest that such technologies may eventually satisfy streamflow information needs at lower cost, while others caution that advanced technologies may not provide as robust and reliable data as traditional methods.

At the close of FY2018, 3,640 of the 4,760 FPS locations designated by the USGS were operational, with 52% of their funding coming from the USGS. As the USGS faces a deadline by the SECURE Water Act of 2009 to operate no less than 4,700 FPSs by FY2019, Congress directed the USGS through appropriations legislation to invest in the NextGen system.

Extending the mandate may provide more time to complete the FPS network. Some suggest that the national interests have evolved and the national goals and FPS locations should be reassessed. For example, monitoring streamflow for ecological purposes was not considered in the original design but has become an increased priority. The SECURE Water Act of 2009 directed the USGS to incorporate principles of adaptive management by conducting period reviews of the FPSs to assess whether the law's objectives were being adequately addressed. An analysis of the network could reveal whether some currently funded FPS sites are no longer in the national interest and funding could be reallocated to complete other sites. Changes in the national goals may also result in the discontinuation of long-term streamgages or the need for new streamgages, and coverage may increase or decrease in various river basins.
