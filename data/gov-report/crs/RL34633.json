Members of Congress have 60 \"days of continuous session\" to introduce a resolution of disapproval after a rule has been submitted to Congress or published in the Federal Register, and the Senate has 60 \"session days\" to use CRA expedited procedures. Although the CRA was considered a reassertion of congressional authority over rulemaking agencies, only one rule has been disapproved using its procedures, and that reversal was the result of a specific set of circumstances created by a transition in party control of the presidency.", "The CRA also indicates that if a rule is submitted to Congress less than 60 session days in the Senate or 60 legislative days in the House of Representatives before Congress adjourns a session sine die, then the rule is carried over to the next session of Congress and treated as if it had been submitted to Congress or published in the Federal Register on the 15th legislative day (House) or session day (Senate). This restart of the CRA process in a new session of Congress occurs even if no joint resolution of disapproval had been introduced regarding the rule during the preceding session of Congress.", "A review of the House and Senate calendars from the first session of the 100th Congress to the first session of the 110th Congress indicates that the date triggering the carryover provisions of the CRA (i.e., the date after which less than 60 legislative or session days remained in a session) has usually been determined by the House of Representatives, and that the date was almost always earlier in second sessions of Congress (during which congressional elections are held) than in first sessions. The median date after which the \"carryover periods\" began for all sessions during this period was June 25, and the median for all second sessions was June 9. Since the CRA was enacted in March 1996, the median starting point for these carryover periods during second sessions of Congress has been somewhat earlier\u2014June 7.", "At the conclusion of most recent presidential administrations, the volume of agency rulemaking has increased noticeably. In May 2008, the White House Chief of Staff generally required federal agencies to finalize all regulations to be issued during the Bush Administration by November 1, 2008. According to press accounts and other sources, federal agencies are planning to issue a number of significant final rules by the end of 2008.

The act also establishes a special set of expedited or \"fast track\" legislative procedures, primarily in the Senate, through which Congress may enact joint resolutions disapproving agencies' final rules. Although the general powers of Congress permit it to overturn agency rules by legislation, the CRA is unique in permitting the use of expedited procedures for this purpose. If a rule is disapproved through the CRA procedures, the act specifies not only that the rule \"shall not take effect\" (or shall not continue, if it has already taken effect), but also that the rule may not be reissued in a \"substantially\" similar form without subsequent statutory authorization.", "The CRA was initially considered a reassertion of congressional authority over rulemaking agencies, but thus far it has had little direct effect on agency rules. After enactment, a CRA joint resolution of disapproval must be presented to the President for signature or veto. Under most circumstances, it is likely that the President would veto the resolution to protect rules developed under his own administration, and it may also be difficult for Congress to muster the two-thirds vote in both houses needed to overturn the veto. Of the nearly 50,000 final rules that have been submitted to Congress since the legislation was enacted in March 1996, the CRA has been used to disapprove only one rule\u2014the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's November 2000 final rule on ergonomics.", "The March 2001 rejection of the ergonomics rule was the result of a specific set of circumstances created by a transition in party control of the presidency. The majority party in both houses of Congress was the same as the party of the incoming President (George W. Bush). When the new Congress convened in 2001 and adopted a resolution disapproving the rule published under the outgoing President (William J. Clinton), the incoming President did not veto the resolution. Congress may be most able to use the CRA to disapprove rules in similar, transition-related circumstances.", "This report addresses some of the implications of the CRA with regard to agency rulemaking in the final months of a presidential administration. It first notes the practice of increased rulemaking activity during this period, and describes how this practice has been addressed by two White House memoranda issued during the current Bush Administration. The report then briefly identifies key elements of the complex set of time periods established by the CRA\u2014elements that define points during the disapproval process at which various actions may occur. This discussion focuses on the CRA provisions for carrying over the disapproval process into a subsequent session of Congress, and indicates how rules submitted at the end of a Congress may be affected by these provisions.

For example, if the House of Representatives and the Senate adjourn on a Friday and both reconvene on the following Monday or Tuesday, the 60-day \"clock\" for the introduction of resolutions of disapproval continues to run throughout the weekend because neither house was out of session for more than three days. On the other hand, if the House is in recess for a month but the Senate continues in session, then the 60-day \"clock\" for this \"initiation period\" stops until the House comes back into session.", "Once introduced, resolutions of disapproval are referred to the committees of jurisdiction in each house of Congress.

However, many rules submitted before the Bolten memorandum deadline will remain subject to congressional disapproval in the 111 th Congress because they will not have been submitted before the starting point of the carryover period, and because the CRA permits Congress to enact resolutions of disapproval regarding rules that have already taken effect.", "Although the exact starting point for the CRA carryover period in the second session of the 110 th Congress can be determined only after sine die adjournment has taken place, the likely date or range of dates may be illuminated by examining congressional activity in prior years. To identify these earlier starting points, CRS examined the calendars of the House and the Senate for all sessions of Congress during the previous 20 years (i.e., from the 100 th Congress, which began in 1987, through the first session of the 110 th Congress in 2007). Counting backwards from the end of each session, we determined the date after which there were either less than 60 days of session in the Senate or less than 60 legislative days in the House. Although some of these sessions of Congress predate the enactment of the CRA, the starting points for those sessions were included to better understand the trends in these dates.", " Table 1 below presents these data. For each session of Congress, the earlier of the House or Senate starting point dates is shown in the table in bold face . Since the CRA was enacted in March 1996, any rule submitted after the specified date in that session was available for disapproval under the CRA process during the following session of Congress. As the table indicates, the starting points for the CRA carryover periods varied between the two houses of Congress in each session, and across the sessions within each chamber. The data also show the following:", "In all but two sessions of Congress during this period (i.e., the first and second sessions of the 101 st Congress), the starting point date for the House of Representatives occurred earlier than the starting point date for the Senate. In every session since the CRA was enacted in March 1996, the House starting point has determined the relevant date for CRA carryovers to the next session of Congress. Across all of these sessions of Congress, the earliest starting point for the carryover period was May 12 (second session of the 108 th Congress), and the latest date was September 9 (first session, 100 th Congress). However, it has been unusual for the starting point to be before June or after July. The median relevant starting point (i.e., half occurring before, half after) for all of these sessions of Congress was June 25. The starting points for the CRA carryover periods were almost always earlier during the second sessions of Congress (i.e., during election years) than the starting points in the first sessions. The median starting point during all second sessions was June 9; the median during first sessions was July 19. This difference in median starting points is explained by the fact that both houses often adjourn or recess just prior to and/or after congressional elections. Since the CRA was enacted in March 1996, the starting points for the carryover periods during second sessions of Congress have been even earlier than for the full period, ranging from May 12 to June 23, with the median starting point being June 7.", "Any rule that was submitted to Congress after the relevant starting point date in any session since the CRA was enacted in March 1996 would not have had 60 days of session in both houses, and Congress' ability to introduce and act on CRA resolutions of disapproval regarding the rule carried over to the next session of Congress.

Also, once a rule is disapproved, the CRA prevents the agency from proposing a substantially similar rule without subsequent statutory authorization.", "Even without the CRA, though, Congress can stop rulemaking in other ways. For example, each year, Congress includes provisions in appropriations legislation prohibiting rulemaking within particular policy areas, preventing particular proposed rules from becoming final, and prohibiting or affecting the implementation or enforcement of rules.
