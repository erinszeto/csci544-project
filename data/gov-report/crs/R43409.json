The minimum wage would be adjusted for inflation thereafter. Whether the minimum wage or alternative policies, namely government-funded earnings supplements such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), are more effective in addressing poverty has been long debated.", "The minimum wage affects workers regardless of their family status. A full-time, year-round worker at the current minimum wage would gross $15,080 in the year. A worker's poverty status, however, depends on family circumstance, specifically family size. A single full-year, full-time worker earning the current federal minimum wage would have gross earnings above the 2014 poverty guidelines, but the same worker in a family of two or more people would have gross earnings that fall below these guidelines.", "The federal tax system and government benefit programs take into account family circumstances in determining tax liabilities and benefits. Therefore, minimum wage and earnings supplement policies have differing impacts, depending on a worker's family type. The main distinction is the presence of children in the family. Low-wage workers heading families with children receive considerable benefits from federal income tax credits and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) food assistance. Childless singles do not benefit from refundable tax credits as do households with children. The effect of federal tax and SNAP benefits is to partially mitigate differences in net incomes relative to poverty among the family types.", "An increase in the minimum wage would boost gross earnings and increase the net incomes of families with a worker employed full-time, all year earning the minimum wage. However, because the federal tax system is progressive and need-tested benefits pay more to families with less income, the income boost would be less than $1.00 for each $1.00 increase in gross earnings, as workers pay more taxes and lose some benefits. The degree to which workers would gain net income because of a minimum wage increase also differs by family type.", "The impact of an increase in the minimum wage on the well-being of minimum wage workers depends in great part on whether the wage increase would cause a loss in employment. Some economic studies have found that increases in minimum wages cause job loss; other economic studies have found no such job loss. A previous consensus that increasing the minimum wage reduces employment, at least among teenagers, has been challenged by numerous recent studies suggesting little or no dis-employment effects of minimum wage increases. However, the debate over the employment effects of the minimum wage is likely to continue.", "There are also some considerations to expanding government-funded earnings supplements, such as the EITC, child tax credit, and SNAP. Expanding these earnings supplements would result in costs to the federal budget. In addition, these programs too might affect the labor market, albeit in ways different from a minimum wage increase. Research has provided evidence that the EITC has increased the number of workers in the labor market. Through the operation of supply and demand, this could suppress wage rates. Since all workers do not qualify for earnings supplements through the EITC, the child tax credit, or SNAP, lower-wage workers who do not receive them might be harmed economically.

The FLSA establishes that if states enact minimum wage, overtime, or child labor laws more protective of employees than those provided in the FLSA, the state law applies. In the case of minimum wages, this means that if an individual is covered by the FLSA in a state with a higher state minimum wage, the individual is entitled to receive the higher state minimum wage. On the other hand, some states have set minimum wages lower than the FLSA minimum. In those cases, an FLSA-covered worker would receive the FLSA minimum wage and not the lower state minimum wage.", "As of January 1, 2014, 21 states and the District of Columbia had minimum wage rates above the federal rate of $7.25 per hour.

That is, if increases in the minimum wage lead to lower levels of employment, through job loss or reduced work hours, then the benefits of an increase would not be realized.", "In the broad range of economic literature on the effects of the minimum wage, there is vigorous debate among economists about the effects of the minimum wage. Rigorous and valid literature exists to support conflicting views on the impact of the minimum wage.", "The divergent findings of the minimum wage literature may be organized by categorizing the labor market models underpinning the various studies. ", "In broad terms, the competitive model of the labor market suggests that minimum wage increases will lead to reduced employment. Firms in a competitive market determine the number of people they employ based on wage rates, and the prices their products command. These firms cannot set the prices for their products and earn profits needed just to stay economically competitive. Under this model, the only avenue these firms have to respond to a change in the wage rate from an increase in the minimum wage is to change (reduce) the level of employment. On the other hand, if some of the assumptions of the competitive model are relaxed, or the labor market is analyzed using non-competitive models , theory might predict negligible or positive employment effects. These models are premised on the notion that one or more of the conditions of the strict competitive model, described above, do not hold for firms. These firms might be able to charge a higher price for their products, or otherwise offset increases in wage rates through channels of adjustment other than employment (e.g., profit, operational efficiencies).", "In the late 1970s, Congress created the Minimum Wage Study Commission (MWSC) to review the literature and assist Congress in understanding the costs and benefits of the federal minimum wage. The research up until the time of this review typically consisted of time-series analysis on national level data. The MWSC released its review findings in 1981 and a widely reported finding was that a 10% increase in the minimum wage was typically associated with a 1% to 3% reduction in teenage employment. There was not a similar consensus on the effects of minimum wage increases on adult employment. These conclusions were typically considered the \"consensus\" view of the effects of the minimum wage on employment: small employment effects for teenage workers and an indeterminate effect on adult employment.", "By the early 1990s, with the implementation of some state level minimum wage rates above the federal rate, researchers turned to \"natural experiments\" and case studies to test the effects of minimum wage increases. Perhaps best known in this area is work by economists David Card and Alan Krueger, who, taking advantage of a minimum wage increase in New Jersey in the early 1990s, compared the employment effects in the fast-food industry in that state and in neighboring Pennsylvania. The findings from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey case study, as well as from analyses using controls for regional variation in wage costs, suggested little or no employment effects of minimum wage increases. In their earlier review of the minimum wage literature, Card and Krueger noted \"a new body of evidence showing that recent minimum wage increases have not had the negative employment effects predicted by the textbook [competitive] model.\"", "Following the research in the 1990s and early 2000s, a few reviews and \"meta studies\" came out in the 2000s that attempted to examine the voluminous research on the minimum wage:", "In an extensive review of minimum wage studies, economists David Neumark and William Wascher in 2007 noted that there is a \"lack of consensus about the overall effects on low-wage employment of an increase in the minimum wage\" but \"a sizable majority of the studies surveyed \u2026 give a relatively consistent (although not always statistically significant) indication of negative employment effects of minimum wages.\" Neumark and Wascher's own work on the minimum wage consistently supports the negative and statistically significant employment effects of minimum wage increases. The empirical findings of Neumark and Wascher, and the other studies that find negative effects of the minimum wage, tend to support the standard competitive model of the labor market, which suggests that increases in the minimum wage will have negative measurable employment effects. In a meta-study of studies published between 1972 and 2007, Doucouliagos and Stanley reviewed 1,474 empirical estimates of the minimum-wage elasticity of employment contained in 64 studies and find that the evidence corroborates the Card-Krueger \"overall finding of an insignificant employment effect (both practically and statistically) from minimum-wage raises.\" The empirical findings of Card and Krueger, and the other studies that find negligible or positive employment effects of the minimum wage, tend to support alternative models of the labor market. For example, in reviewing these studies, Flinn concluded that, \"these recent studies have been particularly useful in indicating that the 'textbook' competitive model of the labor market, which has been used as an interpretive framework for the bulk of empirical work \u2026 may have serious deficiencies in accounting for minimum wage effects on labor market outcomes.\"", "Finally, at least two recent studies have attempted to further refine the methodological approaches to estimate the effects of minimum wage increases by exploiting the growing number of divergent state minimum wage rates. Taken together, this line of research suggests that once heterogeneity in employment growth (i.e., different employment performance across states and over time) is considered, any negative effects of minimum wage laws become insignificant. That is, according to these recent studies, disemployment effects often attributed to changes in minimum wage rates disappear once the estimation models account for regional and local differences in employment trends. Overall, the authors conclude that the estimates \"suggest no detectable employment losses from the kind of minimum wage increases we have seen in the United States.\"", "In a February 2014 report, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessed a $10.10 per hour increase in the minimum wage. It estimated that, once fully implemented in the second half of 2016, the proposed increase in the minimum wage would reduce employment by 500,000 workers, or 0.3%. CBO also noted there was \"considerable uncertainty\" around this estimate, and the employment impact could range from very slight reductions to 1.0 million workers. They also assessed an increase in the minimum wage to $9.00 per hour. CBO estimated that an increase to $9.00 per hour would have smaller effects (reduced employment by an estimated 100,000 workers). CBO, in its report, noted that the proposed increase in the minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour is larger than most increases studied in the research, and CBO assumed that the responses by employers would be greater the larger the increase in the minimum wage.", "In sum, as this brief review suggested, the literature on the effects of the minimum wage is voluminous and the findings are often contradictory. As this body of research has developed over time and as additional data and estimation techniques have become available, it is reasonably clear that the previous consensus finding of negative employment effects of minimum wage increases (particularly for teenagers) no longer holds for minimum wage increases of the size that had been typically considered in the United States. In recent years, there have been numerous studies suggesting little or no disemployment effects of minimum wage increases.

It is only at higher levels of earnings that the EITC is phased out, and at even higher earnings that the child credit is phased out.", "However, the fact that these benefits phase out creates concern about work disincentives. Families that receive benefits from multiple programs, such as the EITC and SNAP, can sometimes have benefits from more than one program being reduced at the same time. This leads to concern that some families face high implicit marginal tax rates that produce disincentives to increasing hours of work or seeking higher paying jobs.

Together, these taxes amount to a 7.65% explicit tax on earnings. ", "In addition to explicit taxes, need-tested assistance programs may effectively impose an implicit tax on working individuals. The structure of traditional need-tested assistance reflects a varying balance between social provision of a minimum level of income adequacy and reinforcing personal responsibility among society's members. Need-tested programs provide conditional assistance to households, families, and individuals, based on need and circumstance. Under traditionally structured need-tested assistance, households, families, or individuals with minimal income and resources may qualify for a maximum benefit, which in turn is reduced as earnings or other \"countable income\" increases. The reduction of benefits associated with increased earnings or other \"countable income,\" often referred to as the benefit reduction rate (BRR), is commonly seen as an \"implicit\" tax, as earnings (or other countable income) increases. As such, a family's total income does not rise by $1 for each $1 in increased earnings, as a portion of other assistance they might have received is reduced at the program's BRR. For example, after income and certain expense disregards, SNAP benefits are reduced by 24 cents on every dollar earned, which can be viewed as an implicit 24% tax on earned income. Combined with FICA payroll taxes, an individual worker receiving SNAP might face a combined 31.65% marginal tax on earnings.", "The EITC is structured differently than traditional need-tested assistance, in that it provides an \"earnings bonus\" to specified workers over lower-earnings ranges, up to a specified earnings level and maximum credit amount, before it begins to phase-out at higher earnings levels.

Over the credit's phase-in range, the credit represents what some refer to as a \" negative income tax ,\" in the sense that those eligible for the credit receive money back from the government, either as a refund in excess of any regular federal income tax liability, or as a reduction in federal income taxes that would otherwise be owed.", " Figure A-2 shows the structure of benefits, tax credits, and explicit taxes relative to earnings.

For example, over broad ranges, sustained high implicit marginal tax rates may discourage individuals from working more hours, or working harder in hopes of securing a wage increase. In contrast, over broad ranges, low or even negative marginal tax rates, may help to encourage work. For example, at lower earnings ranges, the nominal EITC benefit increases with increased earnings, resulting in a net implicit marginal gain in net income that exceeds the marginal gain in gross earnings, which contribute to negative marginal implicit tax rates over a specified range. At higher income ranges, the nominal EITC is reduced as gross earnings increase, resulting in net income increasing to a lesser extent than an increase in gross earnings over a specified range, and thereby contributing to positive implicit marginal tax rates on earnings. It should be noted that marginal tax rates would differ from those shown if a different margin were used. 34", "Average implicit tax rates, shown in Figure A-5 , represent the gain in net income resulting from moving from a state of non-work (i.e., zero earnings) to work, at a specified level of gross earnings (expressed as multiples of full-time full-year work at the current law $7.25 per hour wage rate). In this sense, average implicit tax rates have theoretical bearing on individuals' choices to work, or to not work, affecting labor market entry and exit. In contrast, marginal implicit tax rates theoretically have bearing on individuals' choices relating to hours or weeks of work. However, in that many (if not most) workers face work schedules with fixed hours, workers may have little flexibility vis-a-vis employers to adjust their hours, on margin, according to their preferences.
