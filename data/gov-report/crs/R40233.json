The proponents in each case indicated that multiple committees claimed jurisdiction over a subject and that the House would be unable to legislate, or at least to legislate efficiently, in the absence of a select committee. The creation of the Outer Continental Shelf select committee may have been a early test case of new House rules that recognized the potential need for such a committee. The Energy select committee and the Homeland Security select committee (107th Congress) centralized important aspects of committee decision making to develop comprehensive legislation on subject matter that was widely diffused in House committees. The reason advanced for creating the Select Committee on Homeland Security in the 108th Congress was slightly different: it provided a transition committee responsible for homeland security while the House decided whether and how to reorganize its committees to accommodate the new Department of Homeland Security.", "In creating a select committee with legislative authority, considerations include what legislative authority to grant, jurisdiction and referral, the relationship between the select committee and the standing committees of jurisdiction, reporting deadline, membership and chairmanship, resources made available to the select committee, floor and post-passage consideration of the legislation reported by the select committee, and the select committee's life-span.", "In developing legislation matched to a strategic policy goal, a number of advantages can accrue to the House by using an ad hoc select committee with legislative authority, including efficiency, transparency, a new forum, coherence, and cohesiveness. A select committee, however, cannot guarantee speed after the committee phase, majority support, compromise and comity, or bicameral agreement. Some factors that might better ensure the effectiveness of a select committee are its bipartisan creation, leadership support for its work, the support of standing committees, adequate time for deliberation, and a single purpose for the select committee's existence and work.", "The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is not analyzed in this report since it is a permanent, not an ad hoc, committee."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The House can readily create an ad hoc select committee \u2014to consider measures or matters that fall within the jurisdiction of two or more standing committees, to take action on measures or matters that standing committees have not considered, or for another reason.

At any time after an original appointment, the Speaker may remove Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner from, or appoint additional Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner to, a select or conference committee.\" The Speaker's authority to appoint members of select committees has existed in House rules since 1880. Authority for the Speaker to remove or add members to select and conference committees after the initial appointment of members was added in the 103 rd Congress. By custom, the minority leader proposes to the Speaker the names of minority-party Members to be appointed to a select committee."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Referral Changes", "paragraphs": ["One reason for including the change related to select committees in the Committee Reform Amendments was another change contained in this legislation. The Committee Reform Amendments supplanted the existing referral system, whereby a measure was referred to a single committee, with a new system that became known as \"multiple referral\" and providing the Speaker with referral options:", "Every referral of any matter...shall be made in such manner as to assure to the maximum extent feasible that each committee which has jurisdiction under clause 1 [of Rule X] over the subject matter of any provision thereof will have responsibility for considering such provision and reporting to the House with respect thereto. ...the Speaker may refer the matter simultaneously to two or more committees for concurrent consideration or for consideration in sequence (subject to appropriate time limitations in the case of any committee after the first), or divide the matter into two or more parts (reflecting different subjects and jurisdictions) and refer each such part to a different committee....", "The rules change created three forms of multiple referral, which became known as joint referral of a measure to more than one committee, sequential referral to one committee and then to another or others, and split referral of specific parts of a measure to specific committees. Proponents of allowing committees with a jurisdictional stake in a measure to have an opportunity to consider the measure nonetheless recognized that there could be circumstances under which more centralized committee consideration might be desirable. In those circumstances, the House could create an ad hoc select committee, to which the Speaker could refer legislation or other matters.", "When the Republican majority organized the House in the 104 th Congress (1995-1997), the rules package adopted changed referrals to direct the Speaker to designate a committee of primary jurisdiction when a measure was referred to more than one committee. Referral to second or other committees under this process has been referred to as \"additional initial referral.\" Sequential and split referrals, in addition to referral to an ad hoc committee created by the House, remained as referral options. In the 108 th Congress (2003-2005), the Speaker was authorized not to designate a primary committee \"where he determines that extraordinary circumstances justify review by more than one committee as though primary.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advantages and Disadvantages", "paragraphs": ["The House has sometimes created a select committee to bring focus to a specific, significant issue. When jurisdiction over subject matter was so fragmented or overlapping that no single committee could claim either established or leading jurisdictional responsibility, leaders and issue proponents might have perceived the development of a coordinated approach to most likely occur through the use of a select committee. Since select committees with legislative authority may be designed in a number of ways, including in their relationship to the standing committees and their reporting authority, leaders and issue proponents might have perceived advantages of efficiency and expeditiousness in using a select committee. Leaders and issue proponents might also have made political determinations that a strategic policy goal might best be achieved through a select committee since committee members are chosen by the Speaker, and a select committee might be more responsive to the majority leadership or majority sentiment in the House than specific standing committees might be.", "Creating a select committee also provides additional committee slots, especially chair and ranking minority member positions. Top select committee positions could be filled with Representatives lacking the rank or seniority to merit such an assignment on a standing committee. On the other hand, leaders and Members might believe that such positions call for previous or current committee leadership experience to gain consensus or guide a measure through the legislative process. The chair and ranking minority member could be drawn from one of the committees of jurisdiction or from outside that set of committees.", "A decision on membership may nonetheless generate controversy. Should membership include representation solely from the standing committees with jurisdiction? Should there be representation from each of the affected committees? Which other interested Representatives might serve as members? What states or regions must be represented? What caucuses or viewpoints within each party must membership reflect? What ratio of majority to minority is desired or desirable by each party? Final authority to weigh these considerations and make appointments rests with the Speaker.", "There are also disadvantages to creation of a select committee. A select panel may duplicate, or intrude on, the efforts and jurisdictional prerogatives of one or more standing committees. A select committee's recommendations or work product, once reported, might be opposed, watered down, or ignored by the standing committees, thereby obviating the select panel's original purpose. Service on a select committee places an additional workload burden on individual Representatives and on the distribution of work in the House generally.

As noted earlier, the proponents of H.Res. 988 in the 93 rd Congress wanted to require multiple referrals, where appropriate, but recognized that there could be instances in which the House might wish to centralize committee decision making in one committee. The House could already by resolution give any standing committee that authority on a temporary or permanent basis, or create a new standing or select committee. However, the proponents of H.Res. 988 , supported by the House, specifically provided the mechanism of ad hoc select committees, to be created by resolution.", "The Outer Continental Shelf select committee (94 th -95 th Congresses) was created to produce one piece of legislation, instead of several committees potentially reporting competing measures or competing versions of a measure. Representative Murphy said, \"The establishment of this select committee will prevent major jurisdictional problems which would occur because of vast overlapping jurisdictions in these areas.\" Mr. Murphy inserted in the Congressional Record a Congressional Research Service analysis of referrals of outer continental shelf legislation in support of this argument. The House in this instance seemed to feel especially unable to act expeditiously through its standing committees when the Senate had already passed a bill in the 93 rd Congress and was expected to pass a related bill early in the 94 th Congress.", "Majority Leader Wright expressed similar sentiments in support of creation of the Energy select committee (95 th Congress): \"This device should facilitate an opportunity, heretofore lacking, for the House to work its will in achieving a comprehensive energy policy.\" In the previous Congress, Speaker O'Neill stated that jurisdiction over energy policy was split among too many committees and that he would work for a standing energy committee in order to develop comprehensive energy policy. The Speaker was unable to achieve that objective, but he was able to negotiate the creation of the ad hoc committee to facilitate House consideration of President Carter's energy proposals.", "In advocating creation of the Homeland Security select committee (107 th Congress), Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier first made an analogy to the 95 th Congress's Energy select committee: \"... it establishes a process for considering the President's initiative similar to one that was used a quarter of a century ago...in addressing the energy crisis.\" He argued the objective of efficiency:", "This resolution ensures that we are moving forward with a sense of deliberative urgency, permitting the House to condense the legislative process.... Instead of potentially lengthy struggles on overlapping jurisdictional issues, the select committee will operate as a type of conference committee for all relevant committees of jurisdiction. Every committee is ensured to have a voice.", "In these two latter instances, the House seemed to choose an ad hoc select committee when jurisdiction was spread too widely and too equally among committees. Concomitantly, the House seemed to perceive an ad hoc select committee in these instances to be an antidote to likely delay and inefficiency if the committees of jurisdiction were each allowed to exercise their full jurisdictional and procedural authority: the end result, when reached, would be competing measures or versions of measures in which each committee had a deeply vested interest. The House also seemed to want a policy committee to play the key mediating role among House committees and Representatives, rather than leaving that role directly or solely to the Rules Committee, the majority leadership, or another set of actors. The existence of \"iron triangles,\" or at least communities of interest, between specific committees or subcommittees, executive agencies or units, and interest groups might also have been a factor: an ad hoc select committee might have a better chance of overcoming customary understandings, ways of doing business, and relationships in order to develop legislation matched to a strategic policy goal.", "The Select Committee on Homeland Security (108 th Congress) served a different purpose.

It would also confine a select committee legislatively, making the legislative outcome relatively predictable while protecting the jurisdiction of the standing committees. A bill could be drafted to include and exclude what the majority wishes, allowing the select committee to act on certain subjects but not on others. The bill could also presumably be drafted to reflect the majority's desired legislative outcome and, hence, policy outcome. A bill could alternately be drafted as a bipartisan bill, giving both the majority and minority a stake in its consideration by a select committee. Drafting in either case could anticipate Senate action and presidential positions.", "Jurisdiction established by reference to a presidential message, as was done in creating the Energy select committee (95 th Congress), would seem to cede discretion to the President to determine what a House select committee could consider. The message would determine what is included and excluded from the select committee's jurisdiction and development of legislation. The message could be broader or narrower than the House might wish. Coordination between the President and Congress, or a least between the President and his party in Congress when the President's party controls Congress, could result in a presidential message of an appropriate scope, even if there were policy differences between the President's recommendations and what a majority of Members of Congress might support.

So long as the subject matter was described generally enough, the Speaker could determine the specific matters to refer, which would then establish the select committee's purview for developing legislation.", "In the case of the select committees on Energy and Homeland Security (107 th Congress), the resolutions creating the committees also provided for the consideration of recommendations made by the standing committees of jurisdiction.
