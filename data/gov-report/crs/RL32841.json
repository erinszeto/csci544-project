Congressional interest, however, continues in broader, more comprehensive approaches including efforts in the 108 th Congress to respond to the report of the 9/11 Commission embodied in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA, P.L. 108-458 ).

Starting in 1998, Congress stimulated the creation of three commissions to better understand the nature of the terrorist threat facing the nation. These included the Gilmore Commission, the Bremer Commission, and the Hart-Rudman Commission. Highly specific actions to protect against immediate threats . Immediately following the airplane-based attacks of 9/11, early legislative action focused on airline security, visa and border security, and then moved on to maritime security. Structural and procedural changes to provide an effective framework for action . Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress enacted legislation to create the Department of Homeland Security to provide a structural framework for subsequent action, and the USA PATRIOT Act to provide the tools needed for the new challenge to national security. Interest in broader, more comprehensive substantive approaches . As evidenced in oversight hearings, Congress has been frustrated by the failure to more aggressively address other border and transportation security threats (including the need to create integrated terrorist watch-lists, and measures to address other modes of transportation\u2014rail and mass transit, air cargo, trucking, and buses).

This reality leads to a redefinition of the task from one of pitting security vs. economic well-being to that of good border management. Good border management requires facilitating (and even expediting) the flow of desirable goods and people across our borders, while screening out dangerous people and material. The process of doing that is made more manageable if the border is envisioned not merely as a physical boundary but rather as a flexible concept that allows for the possibility that the border begins at the point where goods or people commence their U.S.-bound journey. The result of such a broader perspective is a significantly wider array of options for good border management.", "A companion report presents several graphical images of how this process might be envisioned. (See CRS Report RL32839, Border Security: The Complexity of the Challenge , by [author name scrubbed].) That report blends the geographic dimension of the problem with the challenge of screening people, goods, and documents. It starts by identifying the paths that may be followed in moving from the source country to the United States, and then overlays the various points at which people, goods, and documents face the possibility of interception en route to the ultimate destination (the final destination inside the United States). The results are portrayed in Figure 1 . The figure should be viewed from left to right, moving from the foreign port of exit (FPOE) through a transit zone (illustrating the case where some goods or people might move through one or more intermediate countries en route), to the domestic port of entry (DPOE)\u2014the final destination in the United States.", "In the process, exported goods may be handled by multiple intermediaries, people will follow several processes, and the necessary travel documents will pass through many hands. While designed to illustrate the multiple points where bad things can happen, the illustration also suggests that the multiple points of vulnerability in the shipping or travel process can also be seen as opportunities for interception\u2014and, if exploited, can actually increase the probability of interdiction of the bad things and bad people that we seek to intercept before they arrive at their intended targets.", "The current programs designed to accomplish this interception are discussed more fully in the second report in this series: CRS Report RL32840, Border and Transportation Security: Selected Programs and Policies , by Lisa M.

Returning to our case of securing a home, we might consider some additional ways to ward off burglars without trying to make conventional doors and windows burglar-proof. Since thefts often occur at night, we could consider installing automatic lights that are triggered when people approach. A dog on the premises will provide another measure of security. Add to this a sign posted on the front lawn that indicates the home is monitored by a security company. Finally the community could form neighborhood watch groups and post signs on the streets advertising this fact. Any of these measures might work only 60% of the time.

Both of these processes require better use of intelligence. They also require an attempt to avoid predictability in whatever we do to make it less likely that terrorists can take evasive actions based on second-guessing our targeting system.

Random changes and random inspections are useful supplement to targeting, in order to determine what you don't know\u2014in terms of identifying gaps in present algorithms for setting targets. It also increases risks for terrorists, who may be studying the inspection process carefully in order to exploit any predictable patterns to avoid interdiction. A good example of using random principles is found at the land border port between Mexico and the United States at the Douglas, AZ port. This port uses sophisticated (and automated) algorithms to randomly switch inspectors from one lane to another, as well as change targets for inspection\u2014and does so at random intervals, using a secure communication system for the inspectors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic Planning: Red Teams and War Games", "paragraphs": ["Consider the expanded use of \"Red Teams\" and war-gaming. These concepts are borrowed from both the national security and intelligence fields, and are related functionally. The use of Red Teams involves gathering experts in the security field and various potentially vulnerable sectors to creatively explore vulnerabilities and suggest ways in which attacks might be feasible. War games involve taking the scenarios developed by the Red Teams and determining ways to defeat the attack efforts. This path was cited approvingly by the 9/11 Commission in the following graphic example. The commission noted that such techniques have been used by the military for many years, revealing that the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) had run an exercise that \"postulated a hijacked airliner coming from overseas and crashing into the Pentagon.\" The exercise was terminated because of the exigencies of the Korean War . The commission identified the four elements common to this type of contingency planning as \"(1) think about how surprise attacks might be launched; (2) identify telltale indicators connected to the most dangerous possibilities; (3) where feasible, collect intelligence on these indicators; and (4) adopt defenses to deflect the most dangerous possibilities or at least trigger an early warning.\" The first step represents the Red Team portion of the process, and the fourth step is the war-gaming phase. The intervening stages are used to target intelligence to inform the entire response process. The notion of \"Red Teams\" was specifically endorsed in the Bush Administration's National Strategy for Homeland Security. More recently, the Red Team technique was also endorsed by the 9/11 staff group charged with aviation and transportation security, in an early version of its draft report to the commission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multi-Purpose Detection Technology", "paragraphs": ["Expand research and development efforts to develop better and more flexible detection devices for radiation and explosives that are capable of working across transportation systems. In terms of explosives detection, the ability to use NII technology to detect explosives carried by a passenger at a distance could have a very high payoff in the crowded setting of rail and transit terminals. The 9/11 Commission stated that \"The most powerful investments may be for improvements in technologies with application across the transportation modes, such as scanning technologies designed to screen containers that can be transported by plane, ship, truck or rail. Though such technologies are becoming available now, widespread deployment is still years away.\"", "As noted above, this is not intended as a comprehensive inventory of all steps that could be considered, nor is it a series of recommendations. The examples cited here flow directly from the frameworks used above and offer a few illustrative options that might be worth further exploration."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The goal is to find more effective ways to promote better border management. This effort is complicated by the many potential goal conflicts that can arise in seeking greater security, while at the same time trying to pursue other important national goals like promoting economic growth, assuring freedom of movement to law-abiding citizens and allies, and protecting privacy and civil liberties. Pushing too hard on any one of these goals may make it too expensive, both in terms of resource costs, but also in losses imposed on other important social goals.", "One possible path to facilitate this delicate balancing act is to pursue the \"layered\" approach recommended by the 9/11 Commission and other BTS analysts over the years. Such an approach would mitigate over-reliance on any one policy action, yet holds out the possibility of achieving a higher level of security cumulatively by spreading actions over many areas to enhance the odds of either interdicting or deterring terrorist activity wherever it may occur. It also addresses the dilemma of terrorist opportunism, which afflicts preventive efforts that are more concentrated. As fast as we secure one area through a concentration of resources, the terrorists have shown themselves to be remarkably adaptable in seeking other softer targets (in effect, finding the weakest link in the defensive chain and attacking it, instead of the newly hardened target).", "Whether policymakers wish to follow the layering strategy discussed above, or pursue a more targeted approach, the options identified above may constitute a useful point of departure for possible actions to consider. Under any circumstances, the following criteria (in the form of policy questions) may be useful in evaluating how far to take any single action:", "What are the relative priorities for action in the near term? Does the action yield security benefits that outweigh possible social or economic costs? Is the step being taken in the least intrusive manner consistent with achieving the objective? Are incursions on privacy and civil liberties taken into account, minimized, and accompanied by appeals processes for any violations? In what ways will the steps under consideration interact with others in the security process to provide higher cumulative security?"], "subsections": []}]}}
