The expanded program is financed through two funding streams commonly referred to incombination as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF).", "CCDF appropriations in FY2002 from the two funding streams total $4.8 billion: $2.7 billion in mandatory funding and $2.2 billion in discretionary funds ( Figure 1 ). The two funding streamsfall under separate committee jurisdictions, and carry with them different rules regarding allocation,state matching requirements, and time limits for obligating and spending money. A portion of themandatory funding is \"guaranteed\" to states and is based on states' spending on child care prior tothe 1996 welfare law. In order for a state to be eligible for its share of the remaining mandatoryfunds, which require state matching, the state must first spend a designated amount (also based onhistorical spending) of its own state funds. Discretionary CCDF funding is 100% federal (i.e.,requires no state match) and is allocated according to a different formula than either portion ofmandatory funds. Both the mandatory and the discretionary funding streams expire at theend ofFY2002 and are due to be reauthorized this year, the mandatory funding as part of welfare (TANF)reauthorization.", "Although the CCDF is the only federal grant program dedicated solely for the purpose of providing child care subsidies and activities for low-income families, states also are using two otherfederal block grants for this purpose: TANF and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG). Stateshave increasingly used TANF dollars for child care services within their TANF programs ($2.2billion in FY2000) in addition to transferring TANF funds to the CCDF. The TANF transfers toCCDF in FY2000 ($2.4 billion) exceeded the discretionary funds appropriated for any single yearso far. Overall, expenditure data show that in FY2000, states spent more than $9 billion in federaland state funds associated with the CCDF and TANF - more than double the amount spent on childcare via these programs in FY1997. SSBG expenditure data are not available for FY2000, but statesare reported to have spent almost $400 million in SSBG funds in FY1999 to support child careservices.", "As Congress decides how much funding to make available for child care, it will need to consider multiple programs, and the various funding streams within them.

This additional funding was accompanied by the creation of a unified and expanded ChildCare and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program, with the aim of serving low-incomefamilies, regardless of welfare status. The expanded program is financed through two fundingstreams: one discretionary (authorized by the CCDBG Act), and one mandatory (appropriated underSection 418 of the Social Security Act). These two funding streams are commonly referred to incombination as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF).", "Since passage of the welfare law, states have spent increasing amounts of both federal and state money on child care. (As will be discussed later, a portion of federal mandatory funding to statesis contingent on states spending some of their own state funds on child care.) Although the CCDFis considered the primary source of federal funding for child care subsidies for low-income workingand welfare families, two other federal block grants are contributing significantly to the child carefunding picture: the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, and the SocialServices Block Grant (SSBG).", "States use all three of these sources to help finance child care assistance for families, but only the CCDF is dedicated solely for this purpose. The CCDF supports child care subsidies andactivities, and nothing else, whereas TANF and SSBG provide a wide range of assistance, includingchild care.", "This report focuses on the financing structure of the CCDF, actual expenditures made from it, and the role of TANF and the SSBG in child care funding and spending. Authorization for thediscretionary portion of the CCDF and appropriations for both the CCDF mandatory funds, as wellas the TANF block grant, are due to expire at the end of FY2002. Therefore, Congress is expectedto confront child care financing issues this year as part of both the child care and welfarereauthorizations. Debates over the level of funding necessary for child care are already percolating,and although the 1996 law consolidated several components of federal child care funding, thefinancing structure remains complicated, potentially leading to calls for simplification. MultipleCCDF funding streams (with different state funding and spending rules) fall under differentcongressional committee jurisdictions, and comprise only a portion of a complex child care financingpicture.", "Seeing the full picture also requires focusing on the degree to which TANF funds contribute to child care expenditures. Recent TANF expenditure data show that states are spending increasingamounts of TANF funds for child care services within the TANF program ($2.2 billion in FY2000);however, the extent to which this will continue during an economic downturn is an unansweredquestion for TANF and child care state administrators alike. States also have the authority to transferup to 30% of their annual TANF block grant to the CCDF and/or the SSBG (at a maximum of 10%)for use under those programs' rules, and as this report will discuss, many states have done so.", "Before examining these three sources of child care funding in greater detail, the next section provides an overview of how changes made as part of the 1996 welfare law affected child careprograms and funding.

Before 1996, four separate federal programs specifically supported child care for low-income families. Three were associated with the cash welfare system. Families on welfare (then Aid to Families withDependent Children (AFDC)) were entitled to free child care. Families who had left the AFDC rollswith employment were entitled to 12 months of \"transitional\" subsidized child care. The thirdAFDC-related child care program targeted families who, without a child care subsidy, would be \"atrisk\" of qualifying for AFDC. These three programs operated under three separate sets of rules, andtargeted three separate populations. Critics argued that mothers navigating their way through thewelfare system faced unnecessary complexity that could be alleviated with a more unified child careprogram.", "All three of the AFDC-related child care programs were funded with mandatory money, and fell under the same congressional committee jurisdiction (Ways and Means Committee in the House,and the Finance Committee in the Senate). AFDC Child Care and Transitional Child Care were bothopen-ended federal entitlements (i.e., there was no limit on program funding), with the federal shareof payments to states based on the state's Medicaid matching rate. The AFDC At-risk program, onthe other hand, was not open-ended, but was instead authorized as a \"capped entitlement\" to thestates at an annual level of $300 million.", "CCDBG. The fourth pre-1996 child care program for low-income families was the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). Establishedin 1990, it supported child care for low-income families not connected to the AFDC welfare system. The block grant subsidized child care for children under age 13 whose working family income didnot exceed 75% of state median income (SMI), adjusted for family size. In addition, it providedfunds for activities to improve the overall quality and supply of child care for families in general. Unlike the AFDC-related programs, the CCDBG was funded with discretionary funds appropriatedas part of the annual appropriations process. Authorizing legislation fell under the jurisdiction ofthe Education and Labor Committee in the House (later renamed the Committee on Education andthe Workforce) and the Labor and Human Resources Committee in the Senate (later renamed theCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions).", "How the 1996 Welfare Law Expanded Child Care Funds. The 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ) repealed AFDC and its threeassociated child care programs. Like cash welfare, child care was no longer to be an individualentitlement to welfare families. Instead of preserving three separate programs, the new law createda consolidated block of mandatory funding under Section 418 of the Social Security Act. Like theearlier three programs, this new block of funding was designed to be largely targeted toward familieson, leaving, or at risk of receiving welfare (now Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)). (1) However, unlike the three AFDC-related child care programs, each of which was administered underits own set of rules, the 1996 law instructed that the new mandatory funding be transferred to eachstate's lead agency managing the CCDBG, and be administered according to CCDBG rules. The lawappropriated $13.9 billion for this new child care block grant over 6 years (up $4 billion fromspending estimated by CBO under old law). Committee jurisdiction for the mandatory fundsremained with the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees.", "In addition to creating the new block of mandatory child care funding, the 1996 welfare law reauthorized and amended the CCDBG. The 1996 law authorized discretionary funding levels at $1billion annually (the authorized \"such sums as necessary\" for FY1995 had led to an appropriationof $935 million), and modified the program rules, including an expansion of program eligibility(from 75% of SMI to 85% of SMI). The discretionary funding and the CCDBG program rulesremained under the same committees' jurisdiction as before.", "This combination of new mandatory funding and expanded CCDBG discretionary funding is commonly referred to as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and makes up the largestsource of federal program funding ($4.8 billion in FY2002) appropriated solely for child caresubsidies and child care activities for low-income families.

Readers should note that while the \"CCDF\" is in essence a funding term, it is notunusual for it to be used interchangeably with \"CCDBG.\" Nevertheless, from a financingperspective, there are technical distinctions between these two acronyms, which are noted in thefollowing discussion of the multiple funding streams that comprise the CCDF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CCDF Funding Streams", "paragraphs": ["Mandatory Funding.

In other words, states are entitled to receive this portion of federal fundingwithout having to \"match\" those dollars with any child care spending from their own state funds.", "In order for a state to be eligible for its share of the remaining funds (also known as \"matching funds\" ), that state must first meet a \"maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement.\" Meeting theMOE requires that a state expend at least the same amount of state funds for child care as it didunder its AFDC-related child care programs in FY1995 or FY1994 (whichever was higher). Oncea state's child care spending has reached that MOE level in the given year, it may begin to access itsshare of the year's remaining federal mandatory funds. States' matching fund allotments aredetermined after setting aside the \"guaranteed\" mandatory portion described above, and are basedupon each state's relative share of children under age 13. Every dollar of state child careexpenditures above the MOE amount is matched at the state's Medicaid matching rate, to the extentprovided for by the state's allotment of federal matching funds.

Actual funding amounts are determined in the annual appropriations process. This portionhas sometimes been singled out as \"the CCDBG funding\" when referring to funding trends overtime, because prior to 1996, the discretionary child care funding was the sole source of CCDBGfunding. However, since 1996, the distinction between discretionary and mandatory funds has notbeen so relevant from the programmatic angle (since all CCDF money is directed to CCDBGprograms), but rather from the standpoint of differences in rules regarding the time limits that stateshave for obligating and expending the different funding streams (discussed below) and statematching requirements on those funds.", "PDFversion", "Discretionary funds are allocated among states according to the formula contained in theoriginal CCDBG Act of 1990 and retained in the amended act of 1996.

Specific and different rules govern time limits for obligating and spendingCCDF money, depending on the funding stream (Figure 2) . First, what does it mean for a stateto\"obligate\" funds? Essentially, obligated CCDF funds reflect money that states have committed tospend from their CCDF grant awards. (4) CCDFregulations impose some restrictions on statedefinitions of \"obligations,\" but generally leave discretion to the states in defining what constitutesan obligation. Examples of obligations may involve states \"subgranting\" funds to programs thatoperate independent of state agencies (i.e., state-supervised county-run programs or privatecontractors) or making transactions that require future payment for services. When the state actuallymakes a payment for the service, an expenditure is recorded.", "CCDF Discretionary Funds. States have 2 years in which to obligate discretionary funds appropriated in a given fiscal year. States have an additionalyear to actually spend the money (in other words, a total of 3 fiscal years from the time ofappropriation). For example, CCDF discretionary funding appropriated for FY2001 is available forobligation through the end of FY2002. States then have until the end of FY2003 to actually makepayments on those obligations. (They can, however, make expenditures at any point within the3-year period.)

(5) Since its implementation, increasing amountsof TANF funding have been used for supporting child care, both through transfers to the CCDF, andby funding child care within the TANF system itself. As mentioned earlier, states are permitted totransfer a combined total of 30% of their annual TANF allotments to the CCDF and the SSBG (witha maximum limit of 10% to the SSBG).

Within the rules for applying state child care expenditures toward TANFand CCDF MOE levels, states may \"double count\" many expenditures toward both programs'requirements. In other words, as long as a child care expenditure is for a TANF-eligible family, itmay be applied toward both the TANF's MOE level and the CCDF MOE. States are notrequiredto explain in either their TANF or CCDF expenditure report whether any, all, or none of their MOEspending overlaps. As a result, if MOE expenditures from the CCDF and TANF expenditure formswere to be added together, the resulting total might overstate the level of MOE child care spendingactually made by the states. Therefore, for this analysis of TANF child care expenditures, onlyTANF MOE spending that exceeds the level of CCDF MOE expenditures made by a state will becounted (recognizing that this method results in the most conservative estimate). A step-by-step lookat the process of reaching \"unduplicated\" TANF MOE expenditure amounts is provided later in thereport, where TANF expenditures are analyzed on a state-by-state basis.", "Trends in TANF Child Care Spending. TANF expenditure data reveal that states as a group are spending increasing amounts of TANF funds onchild care services. Table 5 shows that the combined total of federal TANF funding and the\"excess\" (or \"unduplicated\") child care expenditures made from state funds has grown from over$133 million in FY1997 to almost $2.2 billion in FY2000.

As expressed in the discussion of funding sources, states are not required to spend any given amount of their TANF funds on childcare. States have the flexibility to spend their TANF funding on a variety of services, in addition tocash assistance, and therefore it is useful to look not only at national trends regarding the use ofTANF funding for child care, but also at state-by-state trends. Table 7 provides the samebreakdownof TANF child care expenditures by year and type (federal or state) as that shown in Table 5 , butona state-by-state basis.

Table 8 provides adetailed breakdown of CCDF and TANF child care expenditures made by each state, showingspending amounts by funding source. The final column of the table reflects the calculation of\"excess\" child care TANF MOE expenditures, which are explained in more detail below.", "Calculating \"Excess\" TANF MOE Child Care Expenditures. Table 9 includes the expenditure data used to make the\"excess\" TANF MOE expenditure calculations for FY2000. The \"excess\"expenditure amount isdefined here as any amount that remains after the total reported CCDF MOE expenditures aresubtracted from the TANF child care MOE reported amount. If the subtraction yields a negativeamount, or zero, then there is no excess amount to report as a state-funded TANF expenditure. Ifthe reported TANF MOE child care spending amount is greater than the amount reported toward theCCDF MOE, then the positive difference is counted in Table 9 as the excess amount. ", "For example, as shown in the first column of numbers in Table 9 , Alabama was required tomake $6.896 million in child care expenditures from state funds to meet its annual CCDF MOErequirement. According to Alabama's reporting form for FY2000 CCDF expenditures, they spentprecisely that amount in FY2000. The third column shows the level of child care expendituresreported on the TANF expenditure form toward the TANF MOE: $4.409 million. Because theTANF MOE expenditures do not exceed the CCDF MOE expenditures, and all $4.409 million couldalready potentially be accounted for as part of the $6.896 million reported as CCDF MOE spending,no expenditures are counted toward state TANF child care spending. (In other words $4.4 millionminus $6.8 million yields a negative number.)", "In other cases (Arkansas, for example), Table 9 shows that the reported TANF MOE child careexpenditures ($5.278 billion) exceed those reported toward the CCDF MOE ($1.887 billion). Therefore, the excess (rounded to $3.4 billion in this case) is the amount that appears in Table 8 under TANF child care MOE.

The issue of how much funding to make available for child care will likelybe at the forefront, but is complicated by the fact that child care is supported by multiple fundingsources. As policymakers consider funding levels for child care, the following questions might beasked with respect to each potential funding source:", "Are funds from this source specifically dedicated for child care?", "How are funds from this source allocated to states? (What is the distributionformula?)", "Are states required to match funds from this source with their own statefunds?", "Can funds from this source be transferred to otherprograms?", "How long do states have to obligate and spend funds from this source?", "The answers to these questions highlight the varying implications of providing child care funding through different sources. For instance, funds provided through CCDF are the only fundsdedicated solely for child care, but nevertheless, expenditure data (through FY2000) reveal thatTANF has also played a significant role in funding child care, both through transfers to CCDF anddirectly within TANF. Therefore, should CCDF funding levels be set with the presumption thatstates will continue to use the same amount of TANF funds for child care? A lesser or greateramount? Likewise, what are the implications of the CCDF funding decision on setting the overallTANF funding level? Will an economic downturn prompt states to make different decisions as tohow they allocate their TANF funds? Greater child care expenditures have been fueled by reducedcash welfare caseloads through FY2000; will these spending trends continue if cash welfarecaseloads level off or rise? To what extent are CCDF funds used to serve welfare (TANF) families?", "Even with respect to the funds targeted specifically for child care (i.e., the CCDF) the implications for states differ depending on whether funds are provided via the mandatory ordiscretionary stream. As described earlier, the mandatory and discretionary portions of the CCDFare currently allocated among states according to different formulas, based on different factors. Consequently, the same amount of funding will translate into different allocation amounts for states,depending on the funding stream from which the money is allocated. Furthermore, mandatory fundsbring with them state matching requirements (for the non-\"guaranteed\" portion). Of course, whetherstates actually spend state funds in order to access the available federal mandatory funds depends oneach state's individual decision to participate in the matching program. For example, Michigan hasnot always opted to access its full matching grant, but has instead applied state child careexpenditures toward meeting its TANF MOE requirement.", "Discretionary and mandatory CCDF funds also carry with them different time limits for states to obligate and spend the money. Policymakers will be faced with deciding: What portion of CCDFfunding should be delivered via discretionary money versus mandatory money? Should the formulasfor allocating those funds remain as they are? Should states' historical spending levels from theearly 1990s continue to serve as the basis for the fixed amount of \"guaranteed\" mandatory funding? Should matching requirements remain the same? How long should states have for obligating andspending the funds?", "Decisions regarding states' authority to transfer funds between block grants (i.e., TANF funds to CCDF and SSBG) are also expected as part of the reauthorization process. In addition to theallowable level of transfer, some critics of the status quo argue that states should be allowed totransfer TANF funds remaining from prior years, rather than only current year funds. Of course, justas an economic downturn could prove to affect states' decisions to use TANF funds directly for childcare, so too could it affect their decisions to transfer funds.", " Appendix A.
