A similar pattern emerges from 2015 estimates of per capita income. Estimated USVI income per capita was $22,653, which was above that of Puerto Rico ($11,394) but below that of the United States as a whole ($28,930). The purchasing power of USVI incomes is diminished by the relatively higher costs of living, including the cost of energy, which is especially high relative to the mainland and other areas.", "In recent years, the USVI economy has depended heavily on tourism and related trade. In 2015, the USVI hosted 2.6 million visitors, 80% of which arrived on cruise ships. Hotels and other tourist facilities in the Caribbean are typically the largest commercial consumers of electric power. The islands' manufacturing sector, which had played a major role in economic development in the 1960s, is now a minor part of the USVI economy, aside from two rum distilleries, which are heavily subsidized with pub lic funds.

The refinery operated as a joint venture between Hess Oil, a U.S. company, and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, a petroleum company owned by the Venezuelan government since 1998. HOVENSA filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in September 2015. Some facilities were purchased by Limetree Bay, which maintains an oil storage facility in the USVI.

On a per capita or on a percentage of GTP basis, those debt levels are extremely high compared to other subnational governments. Concerns about debt levels had led each of the three major credit ratings agencies to downgrade the islands' public debts in January 2017. Those concerns intensified in the wake of the September 2017 hurricanes, as rating agencies complained of incomplete financial information from the USVI government. Within a month, two agencies withdrew their ratings and Moody's initiated a review of USVI bonds.

While DOE says that several resilience metrics and measures have been proposed, it recognizes that to date \"there has been no coordinated industry or government initiative to develop a consensus on, or implement, standardized resilience metrics.\"", "If power outages are to be minimized, electric power systems must be able to recover quickly from weather-related events which challenge the system's reliability. Electric utilities generally approach planning for weather-related events from the potential for an event to result in an outage. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, present another level of risk to the reliability of a system, especially for electric utility systems on isolated Caribbean and Atlantic islands that face such risks annually. As of 2010, VIWAPA had completed $29 million of hazard mitigation projects, $18 million of which has been financed through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. In the November 2017 hurricane recovery funding request, the USVI estimated that $300 million is needed to meet the mitigation and resiliency needs for the energy sector.

In November 2017 the CEO of VIWAPA testified as follows:", "By far, the most extensive damage was experienced by the transmission and distribution system and the overall electrical grid. The two power plants, in Estate Richmond on St. Croix and at Krum Bay on St. Thomas, fared well. The transmission and distribution system suffered damage at the hands of Hurricane Irma on the order of 80% on St. Thomas and 90% on St. John, with the two outlying islands, Hassel Island and Water Island, each suffering about 90% damage to their electrical infrastructure. Hurricane Maria rendered about 60% damage to St. Croix's system. Today, [VI]WAPA is engaged in a major restoration effort on all islands. We are in the process of rebuilding transmission feeders and primary circuits, all before we can completely restore commercial and residential customers.", "While hardening activities are generally based on the types of extreme weather experienced in a region, activities to improve resiliency may consider more than a region's history with storms. According to a 2010 report from DOE, a number of actions exist for hardening electric grid transmission and distribution infrastructure. Some actions electric utilities can take to harden energy infrastructure include the following measures. ", "To protect against damage from flooding:", "Elevating substations, control rooms, pump stations; Relocating or constructing new lines and facilities.", "To protect against damage from high winds: ", "Upgrading damaged poles and structures; Strengthening poles with guy wires; Burying power lines underground.", "Newer electric power infrastructure can potentially survive damage from extreme weather better than older infrastructures, simply due to the repeated exposure over time to weather events of older facilities. Therefore, DOE also recommends modernizing electricity systems by deploying smart grid technologies with smart sensors and control technology to pinpoint system problems, and reroute power flows as needed. ", "The chief executive officer of VIWAPA described the efforts the utility planned to undertake to further harden electric systems to minimize the effects of severe weather (such as major hurricanes).", "[VI]WAPA is beginning to replace traditional wooden poles with composite poles on various key transmission feeders on all islands. The composite poles have a proven track record of withstanding sustained wind speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. We have identified a need for approximately 4,300 composite poles for major primary electrical circuits for the St. Thomas-St. John district, and approximately 5,900 composite poles on St. Croix. The Authority is also aiming to relocate key aerial facilities underground. Utilizing past FEMA hazard mitigation grant funding, [VI]WAPA has already placed limited portions of its distribution system underground. Service to critical infrastructure such as hospitals, airports, and 75% of the business districts are underground. In the aftermath of last month's storms, they were among the first facilities to be restored. Our focus now is to underground facilities that service key seaports and shipping companies, to be in a position to restore inbound cargo traffic to the islands upon the opening of the shipping channels by the Coast Guard following a hurricane or tropical storm.", "DOE also states that electric system resiliency can be enhanced by improvements to utility preparedness by programs and investments which improve general readiness (e.g., conducting hurricane preparedness planning and training; complying with inspection protocols; managing vegetation; participating in mutual assistance groups; improving employee communications; and tracking, purchasing, or leasing mobile transformers and substations and procuring spare equipment). Storm-specific readiness can also be improved by activities such as maintaining minimum fuel tank volumes, facilitating employee evacuation and reentry to storm areas, securing fuel contracts for emergency vehicles, expanding deployment staging areas, and supplying logistics to recovery staging areas.", "Other observers point out that distributed resources, particularly microgrids, can function separately from a centralized power grid, and may be easier to repair and restore electricity service than a centralized power generation system, which provides power to communities via transmission and distribution systems.", "[VI]WAPA is also exploring the benefits of electric micro grids, a move toward hardening of the electrical grid which is also vulnerable in windstorms. We have the first micro grid on the drawing board for implementation on St. Croix. Each micro grid would be a localized group of energy sources that would work both in lockstep with [VI]WAPA's generating facilities but independently as a source of power. In the event of a major electrical service interruption, for example, the micro grid would function as a small generating facility to produce electricity on its own power."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Managing Costs of Hardening and Resiliency", "paragraphs": ["Hurricanes and other severe storms are almost certain to recur in the Caribbean region as part of the weather cycle.

Deciding just how much redundancy is considered necessary will likely go beyond the usual cost-benefit analyses to address perceived risk. While DOE's recommendations below are extensive, electric utilities generally try to manage the potential costs of actions to promote system reliability by considering the risks of various extreme weather events. A strategy for grid resilience was suggested in the 2013 report from DOE and the President's Council of Economic Advisors and focused on six factors identifying weather-related risks to the system, and the cost for hardening of the grid. ", "Key among these factors were the following:", "Risk awareness and preparation using mutual aid networks with other utilities; Cost-effective grid strengthening focused on distribution line pole upgrades to concrete, steel, or composite materials, and transmission tower upgrades to galvanized steel lattice or concrete structures; and Increasing system flexibility and robustness by utilizing new technologies for power generation and control, and energy storage. ", "The government of the USVI says it has been focused on improving the resiliency of the island's grid gradually over time, and with each episode of severe weather.", "We're already taking basic steps to improve the resilience of the grid as we build it back, using things like composite poles that can better withstand hurricane force winds, but we must go further.

Due to the potential benefits regarding this alternative, discussions with PREPA should be given priority by the Authority. If this arrangement is shown to be beneficial, the Authority plans to incorporate this option in future power supply evaluations.", "The proposed project would develop a 45-mile, 115 kV underwater transmission cable with fiber optics and connect between the eastern point of Fajardo, Puerto Rico, and Botany Bay on the island of St. Thomas: ", "As contemplated, the IAES [Inter American Energy Sources LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of PREPA] would own the transmission cable and would develop, permit, finance, and construct the Transmission Project in consultation with the Authority. The Authority would develop, permit, finance and construct a new substation at Botany Bay. The Authority would purchase from IAES electric power generated by PREPA subject to the terms and conditions of a power and other required purchase agreements. Subject to approvals by PREPA and the Authority, as well as receipt of various approvals and permits, the Transmission Project could be commercially available within a three-year period. The estimated direct construction cost of the new substation at Botany Bay has not yet been developed and is not included in the Authority's 2010-2014 Capital Improvement Program.", "In addition to a transmission project with Puerto Rico, VIWAPA has also considered a direct current (DC) transmission intertie between St. Thomas and St. Croix. A direct route passes through water that is approximately 12,000-18,000 feet deep; however, for practical purposes a water depth limited to no more than 6,000 feet deep is preferred. Accounting for the shallower depth, a potential route could be expected to be approximately 100 miles in length. The length makes a DC circuit operating 150 kV more practical than an alternating current (AC) due to transmission cable limitations. The benefits of such a system include the ability to use larger size generators and smaller planning reserves. In the USVI, the planning reserve margin is currently based on the two largest units on each island. An interconnection could reduce this planning margin to the two largest units on the two islands collectively. Larger generating units typically have lower capital costs per kilowatt (kW). Without an interconnection, each island's system must operate to withstand a sudden loss of the largest unit due to forced outage. St. Croix is, therefore, limited to generating units of approximately 20 MW each to maintain system reliability. With an interconnected system, larger units could be installed on either island without reduced systems reliability. The 2008 analysis found that at the time these benefits combined with plant efficiency improvements would not outweigh the costs of the interconnection project; however, the report noted that VIWAPA may consider an interconnection in the future when considering the addition of new or replacement generation capacity.

Propane was chosen for a new generation of central station power plants, as it was deemed the cheaper alternative to liquefied natural gas (LNG). However, the new combustion turbines would be fuel flexible, allowing them to burn LNG, propane, or fuel oil. VIWAPA completed conversion of the main units on St. Croix in 2016, but outright replacement of some units in St. Thomas appears to be still ongoing. The USVI government has implemented a goal of reducing petroleum use by 60% by 2025, and VIWAPA has targeted a 40% reduction in fossil fuel use by increasing the efficiency of power generation and by reducing power consumption.
