The IDEA is a grants statute that provides federal funding for the education of children with disabilities and requires, as a condition for the receipt of such funds, that states agree to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE; i.e., specially designed instruction provided at no cost to the parents that meets the needs of a child with a disability) to every eligible child.", "The IDEA, most recently reauthorized by P.L. 108-446 in 2004, was appropriated approximately $13.4 billion in FY2018. The largest part of the IDEA is Part B, Assistance for Education of all Children with Disabilities, which covers special education for children and youth with disabilities between the ages of 3 and 21. Approximately 92% of total IDEA appropriations fund the Part B, Section 611, grants-to-states program. Part B was funded at $12.7 billion in FY2018, and in the 2016-2017 school year, 6.8 million children ages 3 through 21 received educational services under it.", "In addition to the Part B grants-to-states program, the IDEA contains two programs for young children with disabilities. Part C authorizes federal funding for early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities ages birth to three years, and Part B, Section 619 authorizes supplementary grants to states for preschool programs serving children with disabilities ages three to five.", "Each IDEA program serving children and youth with disabilities has followed a similar funding pattern. Appropriations for IDEA Part B (Sections 611 and 619) and Part C increased steadily from each program's inception until the early 2000s. Since the IDEA's most recent reauthorization in FY2004, the funding for both Part B and Part C programs has fluctuated.", "The IDEA has two formulas for determining Part B grants to states: one for years when the appropriated amount available to states is greater than or equal to the amount available to states in the previous year, and one for years when the amount available to states is less than the amount available to states the previous year. In years when the appropriated amount for Part B increases or remains the same, each state receives its base-year (FY1999) grant amount plus a share of the \"new money\" (i.e., the amount above the FY1999 appropriation), based on the state's share of the national child population and national population of children living in poverty, adjusted according to one maximum and three minimum grant calculations, and ratably reduced when necessary. In years when the appropriated amount for Part B decreases, each state receives its base-year grant amount plus a share of the new money the state received the previous year, which has been ratably reduced in proportion to the total new money available for the current year.", "This report will examine the development of the allocation formula for the Part B grants-to-states program, the major changes to the formula over the past 40 years, current funding levels and trends, and how allocations are currently calculated.

The original version of the ESEA, which Congress enacted in 1965 as P.L. 89-10, did not specify assistance for children with disabilities. However, the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare report on the legislation included a provision stating that upon a U.S. Office of Education determination of disability, children with disabilities would be considered \"educationally deprived\" for purposes of eligibility for the ESEA Title I compensatory education program for disadvantaged children.", "P.L. 89-750, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments of 1966, established a new Title VI of the ESEA, separately authorizing an assistance program for projects in states to educate children with disabilities. Sponsors of this law argued that the U.S. Office of Education had not appropriately responded to the needs of children with disabilities under the ESEA Title I program. P.L. 89-750 authorized a two-year program of project grants to states for the education of children with disabilities at the preschool, elementary, and secondary school levels. Allotments of grant funds to states were based on the state's population of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21 in need of special education and related services. P.L. 89-750 also authorized a National Advisory Committee on the Education of the Handicapped, and established a bureau within the Office of Education to administer programs for the education and training of children and youth with disabilities.

", "By 1970, some Members of Congress argued that greater emphasis should be placed on EHA assistance to states because of the number of school-aged children with disabilities who reportedly were unserved by states. The House Committee on Education and Labor report on the bill that would become P.L. 91-230 noted that by U.S. Office of Education estimates, 60% of the total school-aged population of children with disabilities in the United States were not receiving special education services. The committee did not recommend any changes in the federal program of project grants to states to address the problem, but it urged full program funding. The committee noted that the history of assistance programs for children with disabilities had been \"marked by serious discrepancies between authorizations and appropriations.\" In FY1969, for example, appropriations were only about 18% of the authorization. ", "By 1974, when the EHA state grant program was next reauthorized in P.L. 93-380 , Congress had become increasingly persuaded that the program did not adequately address the educational needs of children with disabilities. States, under court mandates and their own laws, had major new responsibilities to provide educational services to all children with disabilities, but due to financial constraints many were unable to meet minimum educational requirements.

These basically similar bills would have authorized federal assistance to states to help them implement the Supreme Court's mandate that all children with disabilities receive appropriate educational services. In contrast to the existing federal program of grants supporting projects, the program authorized by these bills would have provided federal payments to states for up to 75% of the excess costs incurred by school districts for educating children with disabilities.", "In his statement introducing S. 3614, Senator Williams noted the following: ", "We have increased Federal assistance [for children with disabilities] from $45 million 5 years ago to $215 million in the present fiscal year. But these have been token expenditures. Nowhere in our public laws or in our budget figures do we find acceptance for the proposition that all handicapped children have the right to an education. It has been the courts which have forced us to the realization that we can delay no longer in making just such a commitment. [W]e at the Federal level are going to have to change our traditional methods of investing money. The theory that the Federal Government can provide minimal assistance to the states as incentive grants to provide extensive educational services simply does not meet the mark in this instance\u2026It is hard to argue to the states that the Federal Government is serious about full educational opportunity for all handicapped children when we are not willing to invest money to make this goal a reality.

", "The Education Amendments of 1974 ( P.L. 93-380 ) included a significant change in the EHA state grant program. Offered by Senator Charles Mathias of Maryland, the \"Mathias amendment\" authorized a program of federal assistance to states, for FY1975 only, through a funding allotment equaling a state's population of children ages 3 through 21 multiplied by $8.75. This authorization represented a threefold increase in the amount last authorized for the state grant program under P.L. 91-230. The Mathias amendment also, for the first time, required states as a condition of receiving assistance to adopt certain program policies and due process procedures such as those that were being proposed in S. 6 and H.R. 70 .

Congress encouraged states to serve all children in need of special education and related services by tying Part B funding to the number of special education students each state served. ", "By the mid-1990s, Congress found that their goal of ensuring public schools would identify and serve children with disabilities had been successful; however, a growing concern was a disproportionate number of minority children being identified as disabled, particularly in the more subjective disability categories of specific learning disability (SLD), intellectual disability, and emotional disturbance. The committee reports accompanying the 1997 IDEA amendments presented Congress's concern about the disproportionate representation of minorities in special education and explained their rationale for a new state allocation formula. The House report of the Committee on Education and the Workforce stated the following:", "The Committee developed the change in formula to address the problem of over-identification of children with disabilities. When the Act was first passed in 1975, States were not providing educational services to many children with disabilities. Therefore, Congress proposed to distribute federal funds for special education services in order to encourage and reward States for serving eligible children. In the 22 years since then, the States have made excellent progress in identifying children with disabilities and providing them access to special education, and are now serving 5.5 million children with disabilities or approximately 10 percent of children aged 3 through 17. Logically, a formula was established at that time that based funding on counting the number of children with disabilities identified. This was to encourage States to proactively locate children with disabilities.", "Today, the growing problem is over identifying children as disabled when they might not be truly disabled. The challenge today is not so much how to provide access to special education services but how to appropriately provide educational services to children with disabilities in order to improve educational results for such children. As States consider this issue, more and more States are exploring alternatives for serving more children with learning problems in the regular educational classroom. But in doing so, they face the prospect of reductions in Federal funds, as long as funding is tied to child counts.", "While it is unlikely that individual educators ever identify children for the additional funding that such identification brings, the financial incentive reduces the proactive scrutiny that such referrals would receive if they did not have the additional monetary benefit. It also reduces the scrutiny of children who might be moved back out of special education. In-State funding formulas that follow the current disability-based Federal child-count formula further reduce such scrutiny, with more children being identified to draw additional State funds.", "This problem is most intense with minority children, especially African-American males. Over-identification of minority children, particularly in urban schools with high proportions of minority students, remains a serious and growing problem in this Nation. The problem also contributes to the referral of minority special education students to more restrictive environments. The committee is also cognizant, however, that in some areas under identification remains a problem, particularly for minority children.", "The report explained the change from a formula based on the number of children receiving special education to a formula based on the total population of children in each state and the percentage of those children living in poverty:", "The Committee has squarely faced this problem by shifting, once the targeted threshold is reached, to a formula of which 85 percent of additional funds is based on the total school age population and 15 percent is based on the poverty statistic for children in a State. This system was encouraged in the 1994 report of the Department of Education's Inspector General. The Inspector General noted: ``Because [a population-based] method [of allocating funds] uses objective data derived for other purposes, [this method] eliminates the financial incentives for manipulating student counts [that exist in the current formula], including retaining students in special education just to continue receiving Federal funds.'' The Committee added a poverty factor to the formula because there is a link between poverty and certain forms of disability. This concept was also encouraged by the Inspector General's report.", "Based on the significant progress that has been made in providing access to special education and concerns about the over-identification of children as disabled, the Committee believes this new formula will address many of these concerns. This change will enable States to undertake good practices for addressing the learning needs of more children in the regular classroom without the unnecessary categorization or labeling thereby risking the loss of Federal funds. Changing the Federal formula may also motivate States to change their own formulas for distributing State aid in ways that eliminate inappropriate financial incentives for referring children to special education.", "The funding formula adopted through the 1997 IDEA amendments was set to take effect the year the federal appropriation for the grants-to-states program first exceeded $4.9 billion. The formula guaranteed states a minimum base-year amount, which was set as the amount states received the year before the new formula took effect. Since the IDEA appropriation exceeded $4.9 billion for the first time in FY2000, the base-year amount states were guaranteed was their FY1999 funding level.", "In years when Congress appropriated more funding to the grants-to-states program than it had the year before, funding exceeding the base-year amount would be allocated to states based on the total population of children ages 3 through 21 in the state and the percentage of those children living in poverty.

In the current IDEA Part B formula, states with higher rates of children living in poverty are also targeted.
