The first reading of the text of the bill to be marked up can be waived, either by unanimous consent or by adopting a non-debatable motion. The bill then is read for amendment, one section at a time, with committee members offering their amendments to each section after it is read but before the next section is read. By unanimous consent only, the committee may agree to dispense with the reading of each section, or to consider a bill for amendment by titles or chapters instead of by sections. Also by unanimous consent, the committee may consider the entire bill as having been read and open to amendment at any point.", "Each amendment must be read in full unless the committee waives that reading by unanimous consent. Committees debate amendments under the five-minute rule. A committee can end the debate on an amendment by ordering the previous question on it, or by agreeing to a motion to close debate on it. A committee also can order the previous question or close debate on the entire bill, once it has been read or that reading has been waived by unanimous consent. However, the committee can only close debate, not order the previous question, on individual sections (titles, chapters) of the bill. The various kinds of amendments, as well as most of the other motions, that are in order on the House floor are in order in committee as well.", "Committees do not actually change the texts of the bills they mark up. Instead, committees vote on amendments that their members want to recommend that the House adopt when it considers the bill on the floor. The committee concludes a markup not by voting on the bill as a whole, but by voting on a motion to order the bill reported to the House with whatever amendments the committee has approved. A majority of the committee must be present when this final vote occurs. For all other stages of markups, committees may set their own quorum requirements, so long as that quorum is at least one-third of the committee's membership.", "Like the Speaker of the House, committee chairs are responsible for maintaining order and for enforcing proper procedure, either at their own initiative or by ruling on points of order that other committee members make. Chairs also frequently respond to questions about procedure in the form of parliamentary inquiries.", "A committee may report a bill back to the House without amendment, with several amendments, or with an amendment in the nature of a substitute that proposes an entirely different text for the bill. Alternatively, a committee may report a new or \"clean\" bill on the same subject as the bill (or other text) that it has marked up."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The primary legislative function of standing committees in the House of Representatives is to evaluate the thousands of bills and resolutions that Members introduce during each Congress. This evaluation process typically begins with an initial screening by which the majority party leaders and staff of each committee identify the relatively small percentage of measures referred to it that may merit more consideration. The committee or one of its subcommittees may conduct one or more days of public hearings to receive testimony about the issue and the merits of the legislation proposed to address it. If the committee decides that it may want to recommend that the House take legislative action, the hearings are followed by markup meetings at which committee members propose and vote on amendments to a bill (or the draft of a bill). These meetings are called markups because committee members mark up the legislation before them as they decide what amendments to propose to the House. Finally, the committee votes to order the bill reported back to the House for consideration on the floor.", "This report focuses on the markup stage of the legislative process in committee. It discusses the selection of the text to be marked up, the procedures for proposing and debating amendments to that text, the voting and quorum procedures that govern markups, and the final stages of ordering the marked-up text reported to the House for its consideration."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Applicability of House Rules", "paragraphs": ["In general, the markup process in House committees reflects many of the rules and practices that govern the amending process on the House floor. Clause 1(a)(1)(A) of House Rule XI states in part that \"the Rules of the House are the rules of its committees and subcommittees so far as applicable.\" As this report will discuss, this clause is somewhat ambiguous in application because there is more than one House rule governing some aspects of the floor amendment process, such as the devices available to terminate debate or to preclude additional amendments from being offered.", "Clause 2(a)(1) of Rule XI also empowers each standing committee to supplement and implement clause 1(a)(1)(A) by adopting its own written rules, which each committee does at one of its first meetings at the beginning of each Congress. According to clause 2(a)(1), these committee rules \"may not be inconsistent with the Rules of the House or with those provisions of law having the force and effect of Rules of the House.... \" This statement also is ambiguous in that a committee rule governing debate on amendments, for example, may be consistent with one House rule but inconsistent with another. As this report also will discuss, the House Parliamentarian has given committees some helpful guidance about how these provisions should be understood and applied during the conduct of markups and other committee meetings.", "The combined effect of these two clauses, therefore, is to give the House's standing committees some clear direction about how to proceed during markups, but also to give them some discretion in setting their own committee rules, procedures, and customary practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variations Among Committees", "paragraphs": ["Committee markups tend to be less formal than the corresponding amending process on the House floor. Committees are much smaller bodies, so they do not always need elaborate rules that are strictly enforced in order for them to conduct their business. In fact, a more informal process sometimes contributes to efficient and collegial decision making in committee. Furthermore, most committee markups are somewhat less constrained by rules than House floor sessions because the House Parliamentarian and his assistants do not attend committee markups to advise chairs and other committee members on procedural questions. Although many committees designate a majority party staff member to provide procedural advice, committee chairs tend to rely much more on their own knowledge and judgment in conducting committee meetings than do the Speaker and other Representatives who preside over House floor sessions.", "The rules of the House give its committees some discretion in how each of them conducts its markup meetings, and committees exercise this discretion in somewhat different ways\u2014both in the formal rules they adopt to govern their meetings, and even more in the informal (and unrecorded) practices that different committees typically follow.", "This report concentrates on the markup procedures that House committees are expected to employ, although not all committees follow these procedures in all respects and at all times. The report also discusses some informal practices and certain tactical alternatives that committee chairs and members sometimes employ. However, the discussion here could not possibly encompass every variation in markup procedure that may be observed in committee practices. Readers of this report should not be surprised if it does not accord in every respect with what they may have observed at certain markup meetings of the committees with which they are most familiar.

Essentially, there are two choices. First, the committee may mark up the text of one of the bills that Members had introduced and that the House Parliamentarian, acting for the Speaker, had referred to the committee.", "Second, the committee may mark up the draft of a bill that has not yet been formally introduced and referred to the committee. The chair can direct the committee's staff to prepare the draft of a bill, usually written with the assistance of attorneys in the House's Office of Legislative Counsel, that reflects the chair's policy preferences. The committee then may mark up this draft bill, which, in its printed form, may be called a staff draft , discussion draft , or chair's mark . This last phrase originated in committee consideration of budget resolutions, but it now is commonly used to denote any draft that constitutes the legislative starting point from which a committee chair thinks a markup should begin.", "In either case, the text that a committee marks up already may have been marked up by one or more of the committee's subcommittees. If there has been a subcommittee markup, the subcommittee then makes its legislative recommendations to its parent committee. In turn, the committee most often uses the product of the subcommittee's markup as the starting point for its own markup.", "The selection of the text\u2014or the base text or vehicle , as Members sometimes call it\u2014that the committee will mark up is important because it sets the framework within which the markup, and the policy debates it inspires, will take place. Each provision of the selected text will survive the markup and be recommended to the House for passage unless a committee member takes the initiative to propose an amendment to it that the committee adopts. The burden is on those who would change the provisions of the base text; it is up to them to devise alternatives to that text and convince a majority of their committee colleagues to vote for those alternatives. Clearly, then, it is advantageous to be able to select the vehicle from among the bills that were referred to the committee, or to devise the vehicle by drafting a new text that very well may draw on selected provisions of the introduced bills on which the committee held hearings.", "Under House Rule XI, clause 2(g)(4), the text of the legislation to be marked up by a committee generally must be made publicly available in electronic form at least 24 hours prior to the meeting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Chair's Authority in Practice", "paragraphs": ["Almost invariably, it is the committee chair who selects the text to be marked up. Yet there is nothing in the rules of the House that explicitly gives chairs this authority. Instead, this power would seem to derive from the authority of committee chairs to schedule committee meetings and set the agenda for them.", "Clause 2(b) of House Rule XI directs each committee to establish regular monthly meeting days to conduct business, which can include marking up legislation. Committees interpret this rule as giving the chair the authority to decide what, if anything, the committee should consider at each of its regular meetings. Many committees also exercise the authority derived from clause 2(b) to allow their chairs to cancel regular meetings when the chair considers it appropriate to do so.", "Clause 2(c)(1) of the same rule authorizes each standing committee chair to call \"additional and special\" committee meetings \"for the consideration of a bill or resolution pending before the committee or for the conduct of other committee business, subject to such rules as the committee may adopt.\" Again, this clause is understood to allow the chair to decide what measure or what other committee business will be on the agenda of each such meeting.", "House rules do require the chair to give prior notice before scheduling a meeting. Specifically, clause 2(g)(3) of House Rule XI states that a meeting \"may not commence earlier than the third day on which members have had notice thereof.\" The chair in concurrence with the ranking member can waive this requirement for \"good cause.\" In addition, a majority of the committee, a quorum being present, can vote to waive the requirement.

However, members very rarely resort to either of these devices.", "If a committee member objects to the committee marking up a matter that the chair has placed on the agenda for a regular or additional committee meeting, the member may ask the committee to vote on whether it wants to consider that matter. To secure this vote, a member raises what is known as the question of consideration . Under clause 3 of House Rule XVI (which Rule XI, clause 1(a)(1)(A), makes applicable to committees),", "When a motion or proposition is entertained, the question, \"Will the House now consider it?\" may not be put unless demanded by a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner.", "Put differently, whenever a bill or resolution, or the draft text of a measure, is called up for markup at a committee meeting (but before debate on it actually begins), any member may compel a vote on the question of consideration. If a majority of the committee votes \"no\" on this question of consideration, the committee does not proceed to act on the matter in question. In this way, a majority of a committee can prevent its chair from compelling them to mark up legislation that they prefer not to consider, at least at that time. However, the question of consideration rarely is raised, and, if raised, it is very unlikely that the committee will block consideration of a measure that the chair wishes the committee to mark up.", "There are two primary, and related, reasons. First, in setting the committee's markup agenda, the chair usually is acting in support of the majority party's policy and political interests. Except in the most unusual cases, therefore, the chair's agenda decisions can be expected to enjoy the support of all, or almost all, of his or her fellow party members on the committee. Second, whether in committee or on the floor, control of the agenda is at the very heart of the powers and prerogatives of the majority party in the House. Therefore, majority party members in committee are inclined to (and normally are expected to) support their chair on procedural votes, such as votes on questions of consideration, when control of the committee's agenda is at stake.", "Committee members have a different recourse if a committee chair fails to schedule a meeting to mark up legislation that a majority of the committee wants to consider. Under clause 2(c)(2) of Rule XI, any three committee members can request in writing that their chair call a special meeting for a specific purpose, such as to mark up a measure that is identified in the written request. If the chair fails to call the meeting within three days, and if the meeting does not take place within seven days, a majority of the committee may require that the committee meet for that purpose (and only that purpose) at a designated date and time.", "In this way, a majority of committee members may take control of the agenda away from their chair and require the committee to mark up a measure that the chair has failed to schedule for consideration. However, this rule has rarely, if ever, been formally invoked since the House first adopted it as part of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. The reasons are not surprising. In the contemporary House, we would rarely expect to encounter serious and open conflicts between a committee chair and many committee members of his or her own party. Therefore, we would expect this rule to be invoked by the committee's minority, joined by at least a few majority party members of the committee, who would have to be willing to undermine their party's control over the committee's agenda. On the other hand, the threat of invoking the clause 2(c)(2) procedure for calling a special meeting may have convinced chairs to schedule matters for markup that they would have preferred not to bring up, at least at that time.", "The combined effect of these rules, and the political and institutional conditions affecting their use, generally is to give committee chairs effective control over what matters their committees mark up, when these markups take place, and precisely what text the committee considers. However, chairs exercise this control within limits imposed by their knowledge that a chair's decisions can be overridden if he or she thwarts the will of the committee's majority party members, and that the continuance of each chair in that office depends on retaining the support of the entire majority party's conference or caucus. In practice, the minority party members of a committee usually have little effective recourse when they object to what their chair has or has not scheduled for the committee to mark up."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Markup Process in General", "paragraphs": ["A general discussion of the markup process in House committees will provide a context for subsequent sections of this report that discuss the individual stages of the process.", "As mentioned above, the rules of the House of Representatives are ambiguous with respect to the procedures that standing committees are to follow at markup meetings. Clause 1(a)(1)(A) of Rule XI generally provides that \"the Rules of the House are the rules of its committees and subcommittees so far as applicable ... \" (italics added). And clause 2(a)(1) of the same rule directs each standing committee to adopt written rules governing its procedures that \" may not be inconsistent with the Rules of the House.... \" (Italics added).", "Two problems arise in interpreting these rules. First, they do not provide criteria to judge whether committee rules are not inconsistent with House rules. Second, they do not define which House rules are applicable to committees and subcommittees. The House's rules make available different sets of procedures that the House uses under different circumstances to consider various bills and resolutions on the floor. It would not be possible for all of these procedures to be applicable to committees at the same time. By the same token, it would not be possible for committees to adopt rules that avoid being inconsistent with any of these procedures.", "The House Parliamentarian provides important guidance when he notes in the commentary accompanying Section XXX of Jefferson's Manual that \"[t]he procedures applicable in the House as in the Committee of the Whole generally apply to proceedings in committees of the House of Representatives.\" He also points out several exceptions to this general statement that are discussed below.", "The phrase \"the House as in Committee of the Whole\" refers to a distinctive set of procedures that the House may, but rarely does, use to consider measures on the floor. These procedures are not stated in the House's standing rules, but they are a matter of well-established precedent. As its name suggests, the procedures applicable in the House as in Committee of the Whole combine elements of the procedures that apply in the House and those that are followed in Committee of the Whole.", "To summarize what is discussed in more detail below, when a standing committee begins a markup, the text to be considered first is to be read in full, although this reading usually can be waived by majority vote. The text then is considered for amendment, section by section. Each section is read, unless the reading of one or all sections is waived by unanimous consent. Committee members may offer amendments to each section after it is read but before the next section is read. Each amendment must be in writing and is to be read before debate on it begins. An amendment may be withdrawn without the need for unanimous consent (on the floor unanimous consent is needed) unless the committee has acted on it. Committee members may speak on the bill and amendments under a five-minute rule, meaning that each member may speak for five minutes on each amendment unless the committee votes to bring the debate to an end.", "There are two motions available to end debate. Members may vote either to close the debate or to order the previous question on (1) a pending amendment or (2) the entire bill after the last section of the bill has been read or considered as read. However, members may move only to close the debate, not to order the previous question, on the pending section of the bill (and all amendments to it). Both motions are decided by simple majority vote. The difference lies in the fact that ordering the previous question ends the debate and precludes additional amendments, while the motion to close debate does only that\u2014it ends the debate, but it does not prevent members from offering additional, non-debatable amendments that otherwise are in order.", "It should be emphasized that the rules of the House do not specifically describe these procedures and require committees to follow them.

In principle, members who have been recognized may yield to colleagues or request unanimous consent for additional time, but they are much less likely to do so while making opening statements than when debating amendments.", "House rules do not provide for opening statements (although they are somewhat akin to the period for general debate in Committee of the Whole on the House floor), nor do the rules of many House committees. In the absence of a committee rule guaranteeing members' rights to make opening statements, committee chairs typically reserve the right to limit the number or length of these statements. In the interest of time, for example, it is not unusual for a chair to recognize only himself or herself and the ranking minority member, and then to announce that other committee members may submit their opening statements in writing and have them included in the formal record of the committee's proceedings. If some members insist on actually making their opening statements, the chair may accommodate them. Committees rarely publish the transcripts of their markup meetings, so opening statements that are simply submitted for the record may receive little or no attention.", "The chair's authority to permit or restrict opening statements is somewhat clearer when these statements take place before the chair actually calls up the bill for consideration, which constitutes the formal beginning of the markup. Before the markup formally begins, there is no business that is before the committee at that meeting, so the chair can justify exercising more discretion in recognizing members to speak.

Instead, it is voting on what amendments, if any, the committee will recommend that the House adopt when it considers the bill on the floor.

After the committee has disposed of any and all amendments to the first section, or after it has been amended in its entirety, the chair directs the clerk to read the second section, which then is open to amendment. This process is repeated until the committee has voted on the last amendment to be offered to the last section of the bill.

One reason for requiring that each section be read is to delay the proceedings.", "It requires unanimous consent for a committee to do anything but have each section read for amendment in sequence. Longer and more complex bills often are divided into titles, and each title is subdivided into sections. The largest bills even may be divided into chapters that are subdivided into titles and then into sections. In such cases, the chair may ask unanimous consent that the bill be open for amendment one title or one chapter at a time, so that members can propose amendments to any part of the title or chapter, not just to one section of it at a time. This arrangement normally saves some time, and also allows committee members to address at the same time all aspects of each title or chapter. If, for example, a committee member has an alternative for how a title of the bill deals with different dimensions of the same issue, the member may offer that alternative as a substitute for the entire title, rather than having to amend each section of the title as it is considered.", "When the committee begins marking up a shorter bill, or one to which few amendments are expected, the chair may ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be considered as read and open to amendment at any point. In that case, members can offer their amendments to any part of the bill in any order. This could be confusing when members plan to offer many amendments to a long and complex bill. When there are few amendments to consider, however, opening the bill for amendment in this way can conserve time without causing confusion.", "Committees normally agree to such unanimous consent requests, especially because they usually are made by the committee chair. When any member objects, however, no motion is in order to open the bill for amendment by titles, chapters, or at any point. By the same token, it is not in order for a member to move to waive the reading of any section, title, or chapter of a bill, or to move that the entire bill be considered as having been read.

After the committee disposes of that amendment (and any amendments to it), the chair normally recognizes a senior member of the minority party to offer another amendment to that section. Thereafter, the chair typically recognizes other members to offer amendments to the section in order of their seniority, alternating between members of the two parties.

Amendments also must meet certain other requirements, including those of the congressional budget process. The House's rules do not explicitly prohibit members from offering amendments on matters that are not within the committee's jurisdiction.

A member may not move the previous question on the section (title, chapter) of the bill that is open for amendment. This protects the rights of committee members, especially minority party members, to offer their amendments to each part of the bill when it becomes subject to amendment.", "Thus, the majority cannot necessarily control the length of a markup by ordering the previous question on the bill as a whole at whatever time it chooses. If the committee agrees to a unanimous consent request that the bill be considered as read and open to amendment at any point, a majority can expedite completion of the markup by agreeing to order the previous question on the bill and any pending amendments thereto.

So one difference between the two motions is that the committee can vote to close the debate on the pending section of the bill, but it may not order the previous question on it.", "The other difference is in the effect of the two motions. The motion to close debate does only that: It brings a debate to an end. Unlike the previous question, the motion to close debate does not affect the rights of members to offer additional amendments. The motion to close debate may take one of three forms: it may propose to close the debate immediately, or at a certain time, or after a certain period of time for additional debate. When a committee uses this motion to close debate immediately on a section, for example, no more debate is in order on the section or on amendments to it. Members can continue to offer additional amendments to the section, and request roll call votes on them, but they may not take any time at all to explain their amendments (except by unanimous consent, of course).", "Because of its dual effect, committee members tend to move the previous question more often than they move to close debate when both motions are in order. Thus, members are most likely to move the previous question on a pending amendment or on the bill after it has been read in full or its reading has been dispensed with.

The House frequently considers major bills on the floor under the terms of special rules recommended by the Rules Committee that restrict the floor amendments that members are allowed to offer. By this use of special rules, the majority can limit the number of amendments that members can offer on the floor, and permit some specific amendments to be offered while blocking consideration of others. In the process, the majority party can use special rules to control how long members can spend offering and debating amendments to bills in Committee of the Whole.", "During committee markups, on the other hand, there is no equivalent to the Rules Committee or to special rules. There is no procedural device by which a committee majority can vote to preclude consideration of certain amendments that comply with House rules. By the same token, there is no motion by which a committee majority can vote to conclude a markup until the committee has completed the process of reading the bill for amendment.", "To put it differently, the minority members of a committee can insist that a bill be marked up one section at a time and that each section be read. Then they can continue to offer their amendments to each section, and request roll call votes on the amendments. The committee majority may vote to close the debate on each section after it is read, but doing so does not block the minority from offering more amendments to the section. The motion only precludes debate on amendments after debate on the section has been closed.", "One way in which the majority can gain more control over how long a markup lasts is through the use of an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The committee's chair (or another majority party member acting for the chair) sometimes offers an amendment in the nature of a substitute as soon as the first section of the bill has been read. This complete substitute represents the majority's preferred version of the bill. While this substitute is pending, members may not offer amendments to the bill itself, except to the first section. This effectively blocks the minority from insisting that the bill be read for amendment by sections and from offering amendments to each section as it is read.", "After the substitute has been read and debate on it has begun, the majority can order the previous question on the substitute whenever it decides to do so. If the previous question is ordered on the complete substitute, the committee then votes on agreeing to it without further debate or amendment. Because the substitute was offered by or for the chair, the committee is likely to agree to it, and that vote effectively ends the amending process. By agreeing to the substitute, the committee thereby amends the entire text of the bill. No more amendments to the bill are in order, therefore, because any further amendments would be subject to points of order for proposing to amend something that already has been amended.", "In this way, the majority can use an amendment in the nature of a substitute to give it more control over the length of a markup. However, there are two potential disadvantages to this approach. First, any member can insist that the complete substitute be read in full, and this can be a time-consuming process. The majority cannot waive this reading by motion. Second, the majority's ability to use the amendment process to its advantage is limited. The majority's amendment in the nature of a substitute is a first-degree amendment to which the minority can offer second-degree perfecting amendments. When a minority party member offers a first-degree amendment that the majority opposes, the majority can respond by defeating it or, if that seems unlikely, by amending it in order to make it more palatable. However, when the minority offers unwelcome second-degree perfecting amendments to the majority's complete substitute, the majority can only attempt to defeat each minority amendment because second-degree amendments cannot be amended. If the committee agrees to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute as \"original text\" or as \"an original question for purpose of amendment,\" then committee members can offer amendments to it in two degrees.

The motion to table rarely is made to dispose of amendments during committee markups because the effect of tabling an amendment is to table (or kill) the bill to which the amendment was offered. The motion to reconsider is offered from time to time, especially when members who are losing a roll call vote (on an amendment, for example) believe that they are going to lose that vote only because one or more committee members are absent. In that case, a member who would prefer to vote on the losing side votes instead on the winning side. Doing so qualifies that member to move to reconsider the vote at some time before the markup ends.

Members sometimes have two or more committee or subcommittee meetings at the same time, requiring them to leave one meeting to attend the other when a vote is taking place. Chairs know that their committee members want to be recorded as having voted whenever possible, so they may delay a roll call vote when they are informed that absent members intend to come to the committee room to vote. Alternatively, rather than postponing the vote, the chair might delay asking the clerk to report the tally to allow absent members to reach the committee room and cast their votes. ", "Although committees typically require only a one-third quorum for all but the final vote in markup, committee staff do their best to make sure that all the members of their party are present to be recorded on each roll call vote. The reason lies in part in the House's ban on proxy voting in committee. Before 1995, members could leave their proxies with one of their committee colleagues to cast for them. This often enabled a committee chair, if he or she held enough proxies, to win a roll call vote even when the chair's position was opposed by a majority of the members who actually were present.", "Proxy voting was prohibited in 1995. The result has been to put more of a premium on maximizing attendance, especially when the majority party holds only a few more committee seats than the minority. In those circumstances, the absence of only one or two majority party members can enable the minority party to prevail on a party-line vote if all the minority party members are present. It is very important, therefore, for as many members as possible to attend markups and for the committee staff of each party to know how to contact their absent members as soon as a roll call vote begins (if not before).
