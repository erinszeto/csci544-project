It has three functions in the economy: 1) a medium of exchange (an item that buyers give to sellers when they want to purchase goods and services); 2) a unit of account (the yardstick people use to post prices and record debts); and 3) a store of value (an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power from the present to the future).", "Traditionally, money has taken two major forms ( Figure 1 ). Commodity money is made of materials that have intrinsic value, like gold and silver coins. Fiat money has no intrinsic value, but serves as money by government decree. Before World War I, most countries were on the gold standard, using gold coins or paper money convertible to gold on demand. Today, most countries, including the United States and other major economies, use fiat money as national currencies. ", "More recently, technological developments have led to the creation of virtual currencies , digital representations of value that can be digitally traded (without any physical banknotes or coins) and strive to function as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. However, unlike a fiat currency, virtual currencies generally do not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction; they have value only by agreement within the community of users of the virtual currency. ", "There are different types of virtual currencies. Convertible virtual currencies can be exchanged back-and-forth with fiat (real) currencies, while non convertible virtual currencies are used in restricted online domains (such as multiplayer online gaming) and are not converted into fiat currencies. There are a number of exchanges that have been established to facilitate the conversion of virtual currencies to other assets, such as conventional fiat money or different virtual currencies. ", "Additionally, some virtual currencies are run by a centralized administrator that issues currency and maintains a central payment ledger. Other virtual currencies are decentralized , for which transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger, which is maintained by many independent, peer-to-peer computers. They rely on encryption techniques to control the creation of monetary units and to verify the transfer of funds. Users are given some level of anonymity or pseudonymity, and the system does not rely on government agencies (central banks) or financial institutions, which are generally embedded in the creation and transfer of fiat money. ", "Convertible, decentralized virtual currencies are often referred to as cryptocurrencies . Bitcoin was the first and continues to be the most widely used cryptocurrency, but a number of competitors have emerged. According to one estimate, there are about 2,100 cryptocurrencies currently in circulation, with a total market capitalization of $121.1 billion as of November 25, 2018. As cryptocurrencies have proliferated, they have taken on more forms. Some virtual currencies, such as Ripple, are arguably centralized currencies, but nonetheless are frequently referred to under the general umbrella term of cryptocurrencies. \"Cryptocurrency\" is sometimes used broadly for any digital currency not issued by a sovereign government.", "One process by which new cryptocurrency coins or tokens are issued is called initial coin offerings (ICOs) . Cryptocurrency currency transactions are validated by a process known as mining ; successful miners are rewarded for their efforts through new cryptocurrency tokens. A number of companies have also developed to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies. For example, exchanges are platforms that allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies and/or fiat currencies. Wallets are applications or interfaces that can be downloaded onto a device to make transacting in cryptocurrencies more user friendly.", "Some central banks are considering or are actively exploring using distributed ledger technology to create digital representations of fiat currencies, or digital fiat currencies .

Bitcoin has the largest market share, accounting for about half of the total market capitalization. The five largest cryptocurrencies account for almost 80% of the total virtual currency market capitalization, and include Bitcoin ($65.5 billion), Ripple ($14.0 billion), Ethereum ($11.2 billion), Bitcoin Cash ($3.0 billion, a 2017 offshoot of Bitcoin); and EOS ($2.9 billion) ( Figure 2 ). ", "Cryptocurrencies generate a lot of debate. Some argue that the development and spread of virtual currencies have the potential to revolutionize the financial and banking industries. Virtual currencies could increase payment efficiency, reduce transaction costs of payments and fund transfers, increase participation in the financial system, and facilitate transactions. Others are far more skeptical. The value of virtual currencies is highly volatile, virtual currencies and the exchanges on which they are traded face an uneven regulatory framework compared to banks, creating concerns for consumer protections and anti-money laundering efforts, and virtual currencies require sizeable energy resources for the associated computations.

The government has used various policies to promote the use of cryptocurrencies, including a \"token day,\" when some retailers accept various cryptocurrencies as payment in an effort to normalize their use.

The jurisdiction has tried to attract cryptocurrency companies and exchanges through the early adoption of regulations designed to provide regulatory certainty; these regulations are also generally viewed as favorable to attracting cryptocurrency activities. As with Malta, multinationals are attracted to Zug's low tax rates. Companies that created and promote Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by value, are located in Zug, and as many as 200-300 cryptocurrency entities have opened there in recent years. Government agencies in Zug also accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. However, following the publishing of ICO guidelines in February 2018, many cryptocurrency businesses presumably feeling the regulations too restrictive left Switzerland for rivals such as Liechtenstein, Gibraltar, and the British Virgin Islands.

In 2013, it restricted Chinese banks from using cryptocurrencies as currency, citing concerns about money laundering and a threat to financial stability. In 2017, the Chinese government banned ICOs and restricted cryptocurrency exchanges operating in China, as part of broader efforts against financial risks following a rapid run-up in corporate debt and a proliferation of new, risky investment products. In 2018, Chinese authorities in an eastern district of Beijing directed stores, hotels, and offices not to host any cryptocurrency-related speeches, events, or activities, and blocked a number of public accounts involving ICOs on the popular messaging app WeChat.", "South Korea has also banned some cryptocurrency activities. A week following China's ban on ICOs, South Korean financial regulators banned ICOs as well, citing concerns about the increasing risk of financial scams.

In April 2018, India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, banned banks, financial institutions, and other regulated institutions from providing any services related to virtual currencies, giving the institutions three months to exit operations. The directive was upheld by India's Supreme Court in July 2018, during which the central bank argued that cryptocurrencies cannot be treated as currency under India's existing law that mandates coins be made of metal or exist in physical form and be stamped by the government. In October 2018, a committee chaired by the Secretary of Economic Affairs recommended devising a legal framework to ban the use of cryptocurrencies in India.", "In addition, Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan have banned cryptocurrencies; Bolivia has banned any currency not issued by a government, including cryptocurrencies; Egypt has prohibited trading in cryptocurrencies; Indonesia has banned cryptocurrency transactions; Lebanon has banned financial institutions from dealing with virtual currencies; Taiwan has banned banks from transacting in cryptocurrencies; and Vietnam has banned the use of virtual currencies for payment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approach 3: Regulate Cryptocurrencies", "paragraphs": ["Some governments are seeking to regulate cryptocurrencies.

In terms of the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, governments vary in whether they are taxing cryptocurrencies, and if so, whether they are applying, for example, value-added-tax, capital gains tax, or property tax to cryptocurrencies.
