While the sale took place as scheduled, the BLM agreed to allow the district court judge to review and rule on the suit before the lease sale would be finalized (30 days after the sale). In January 2009, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order halting BLM from finalizing the sale of 77 parcels (on about 110,000 acres) based on a finding of inadequate environmental review of oil and gas development in the area. On February 4, 2009, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced that the BLM would not accept the bids on the 77 parcels under the restraining order and would withdraw the leases because of what the Obama Administration considers to have been a rushed sale without adequate environmental review. A follow-up DOI review conducted a parcel-by-parcel assessment to determine which of the 77 parcels should be deferred, leased, or removed from leasing.

The Secretary called for the establishment of a set of wild horse preserves throughout the United States, particularly on the grasslands of the Midwest and East. The wild horses in these preserves would be non-producing. Land for the preserves would be acquired by BLM or \"partners.\" Proposals to reduce population growth included enhancing use of the fertility control drug PZP, and increasing the proportion of males to females in herds to reduce the number of foals born yearly. The Administration has indicated that it is not planning to use euthanasia to put down healthy horses, or to sell older horses without limitation, as these authorities have been controversial.

The bills seek to prohibit the slaughter of wild horses and burros, unless the animal is terminally ill or fatally injured, and to remove agency authority to sell excess wild horses and burros. They would limit the removal of wild horses and burros from the range to certain circumstances: (1) the immediate health or safety of the animals is threatened; (2) the health and well being of native plants or wildlife is threatened; or (3) the Secretary \"has exhausted all practicable options\" of maintaining the animals on the range, has determined that there is an \"adoption demand\" for the animals, and can \"ensure humane treatment and care\" through specified requirements.

BLM estimated that the cost of wild horse and burro management will be approximately $85 million in FY2012 under current practices.

Among other findings, GAO determined that if the costs of holding animals in facilities are not controlled, they will overwhelm the program. GAO also concluded that the BLM's options for dealing with unadoptable animals are limited, and that because the BLM is not destroying animals or selling them without limitation, it is not in compliance with 1971 Act.

This effectively reinstates \u00a7215.12(f).", "In addition, five of the new CE types, including those for fire management activities and limited timber harvesting, were challenged in the U.S. District Court for Alabama. The challenges were to the NEPA process (i.e., did the FS comply with NEPA). Challenges also addressed whether the regulation complied with other laws. In January 2007, the court upheld the regulations on the NEPA process, finding that the FS complied with NEPA in adopting the CEs. However, it refused to consider other issues (e.g., ARA challenges to the Appeal Rule), finding they were not ripe for review because the rule had not been applied yet.", "Despite the Alabama District Court's holding, the hazardous fuels reduction CE is not in effect. In December 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the CE violated NEPA. The court found that the FS had failed to consider the environmental consequences of such a broad program, and stopped the use of that CE until NEPA had been followed. ", "In other cases regarding NEPA reviews, but not reviewing new regulations, the Ninth Circuit found in favor of the FS. In one case, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the lower court had overly scrutinized FS actions in some cases. The Ninth Circuit said it should not act as a panel of scientists, instead deferring to the FS's expertise regarding the disputed timber sale. In the second case, the Ninth Circuit found that the FS took the requisite \"hard look\" at possible impacts on wildlife populations in its EIS and determined that the hazardous fuels reduction project did not endanger the viability of species. In support of the viability conclusions, the court found that the FS appropriately relied on studies conducted by qualified scientists and its own wildlife biologist's evaluation.

All BLM lands (except some lands in Alaska) are covered by a land use plan. Most of the proceeds are to be used for land acquisitions, as described below. The law's purposes include allowing for the reconfiguration of land ownership patterns to better facilitate resource management, improving administrative efficiency, and increasing the effectiveness of the allocation of fiscal and human resources. This authority to sell or exchange BLM lands briefly expired on July 25, 2010\u2014ten years after enactment. On July 29, 2010, it was subsequently extended for one year. An issue for the 111 th Congress is whether to retain this authority and, if so, in what form. ", "Currently, proceeds from the sale or exchange of BLM lands under FLTFA are split between the state in which the lands were disposed of (4%) and a separate Treasury account (96%). The funds in the account are available to both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire inholdings and other nonfederal lands (or interests therein) that are adjacent to federal lands and contain exceptional resources, with no more than 20% for administrative expenses related to the land disposal program. Of the funds for acquisitions, at least 80% are to be used in the state in which the funds were generated, and the remaining funds may be used in any state. Further, not less than 80% of the funds for land purchases within a state are to be used to acquire inholdings. ", "Since the enactment of FLTFA, BLM has used the authority to sell a total of 309 parcels with 29,437 acres and a value of approximately $113.4 million. Acquisitions by the agencies have been smaller in terms of number of parcels, acreage, and value. Specifically, since enactment of FLTFA, the agencies have acquired a total of 28 parcels with 16,738 acres and a value of approximately $43.8 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Action", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget supported making FLTFA permanent, and using current land management plans for determining which lands to sell or exchange.

The Administration noted the difficulty of relying on land exchanges under other BLM authorities, important acquisitions made under FLTFA, and the role of FLTFA as a \"critical tool for enhancing our Nation's treasured landscapes.\" The George W. Bush Administration also supported using updated land management plans for determining which lands to sell or exchange, and proposed extending FLTFA until January 1, 2018. ", "The changing nature of land use plans has prompted interest in amending FLTFA to allow the most current land use plans to be used as the basis of land disposals. In 2001, BLM began a multiyear effort to develop new land use plans and to update existing ones to address changing circumstances, such as increased demand for energy resources. BLM estimates that, from the start of that effort through FY2009, it has completed 86 new or revised plans. Further, the agency anticipates that in FY2011, at least 34 major plans will be under development or revision. ", "The FLTFA sales authority was not tied to future land use plans due to concerns that BLM might revise plans to pursue a broad land disposal program as a way to generate funds. BLM asserts that its authorities to dispose of public lands would preclude this. Under FLPMA, for example, BLM is authorized to sell certain tracts of land only if they meet specified criteria. The agency also has asserted that land use plan revisions since 2000 have not changed significantly the acreage identified for disposal. Further, a 2008 report of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that, while BLM land use plans identified areas for disposal, BLM had not made sale of lands under FLTFA a priority.

Both bills would allow for updated land management plans to be used as the basis for identifying lands for disposal and exchange. The bills have somewhat different language on using updated plans. The Senate bill calls for use of plans in effect as of its enactment, while the House bill simply calls for use of approved land use plans, which would imply the most current plans.", "Other pending legislation (H.R. 6206 and S. 3762) seeks to reinstate the monies that were in the FLTFA account when the law (briefly) expired on July 25, 2010. Under FLTFA, any funds in the account when the law terminated were to become available for appropriation under the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act. Because a law extending FLTFA was not enacted until July 29, 2010, the monies in the account ceased to be available for FLTFA purposes (the administrative costs of BLM land sales and the agencies' land acquisitions). Both the House and Senate bills specify that the balance in the FLTFA account as of July 24, 2010 is to be reinstated, and available until expended, for the purposes covered by the FLTFA law.

H.R. 6206 was introduced on September 23, 2010, while S. 3762 is on the Senate calendar.", "None of the pending bills would not make other changes in areas that have been under recent debate. One such area is whether to retain the current allocation of proceeds. One question has been whether to continue to allow the proceeds of land sales to be retained by the agencies, or whether to return them to the general fund of the Treasury as traditionally had been the case before the enactment of FLTFA. Under one proposal in the FY2009 Bush Administration budget, for instance, 70% of the net proceeds would have been deposited in the general fund of the Treasury. The proposal was promoted to reduce the federal deficit, to ensure that the public would benefit from land sales, and to reduce the amount of money not subject to oversight during the appropriations process. However, such a change would have reduced funds for land acquisition at a time of declining funds from the primary acquisition source\u2014the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Since then, funds for land acquisition have increased. A related question has been whether some of the funds should be used for other federal lands purposes. For instance, the FY2009 Bush Administration proposal had sought to dedicate \"a portion\" of the funds to BLM for restoration projects.", "Another issue regarding the allocation of proceeds is whether to retain the requirement that most of the funds for land acquisition be used in the state where the funds were generated. GAO concluded in 2008 that this requirement has made it difficult to acquire priority lands in states that sell relatively little land. Currently, most of the revenue for land acquisitions is available in Nevada. GAO testified in 2009 that approximately 78% of the revenues raised\u2014$88 million\u2014has come from land sales in Nevada. Nevada has generated the most revenue from land sales due to the large BLM holdings in areas of population growth, the high demand for such land to develop, and the experience of BLM with selling land in Nevada under another land sale program. ", "Still another focus has been on whether changes are desirable to increase the pace of spending FLTFA funds to acquire lands. In its 2008 report, GAO determined that agencies had spent $13.3 million of the $95.7 million in the FLTFA account. The pace of acquisitions has quickened since that time. In its 2009 testimony, the Administration stated that the agencies had spent $43.8 million of the $108.9 million in the account. Among the challenges to completing land acquisitions, GAO has identified the time, cost, and complexity of acquisitions; difficulty in identifying a willing seller; insufficient realty staff to conduct acquisitions; lack of funding for some states; and public opposition to land acquisitions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "National Forest Planning", "paragraphs": ["(by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed])"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The FS is required by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) to prepare comprehensive, integrated land and resource management plans for the national forests.
