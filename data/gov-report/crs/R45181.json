Title X projects would be required to maintain physical and financial separation between their Title X projects and abortion-related activities. Several terms, including family planning and low-income family , would have new definitions. Criteria for awarding Title X Family Planning Services grants would be revised. Title X grant applicants and grantees would be subject to new reporting requirements. ", "This proposed rule has sparked a debate about whether providing an abortion-related service, such as referring a pregnant client to an abortion provider, should be a family planning service under Title X. In addition, there is debate on whether this proposed rule is a \"gag rule\" that would prevent some Title X clients from receiving adequate information that would permit them to make an informed decision about their health care treatment.

Current grantees received notification today inviting them to submit a request for grant extension, so there is no gap in services.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Differences Between the FY2017 and FY2018 FOAs", "paragraphs": ["There were several key differences between the FY2018 FOA and the FY2017 FOA, which was posted under the previous Administration. Key differences were as follows: ", "The FY2018 FOA had a new requirement for clients under the age of consent. A client under the age of consent would be subject to a preliminary screening to rule out victimization after he or she presents with an STD, pregnancy, or any suspicion of abuse. ", "The FY2018 FOA stated that Title X projects should communicate the benefits of avoiding sexual risk, delaying sex, and returning to \"sexually risk-free status,\" especially for adolescents. The FY2017 FOA did not use the phrase \"sexually risk-free.\" The FY2017 FOA required projects to have written clinical protocols in accordance with \"Providing Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and the U.S. Office of Population Affairs and Program Requirements for Title X Funded Family Planning Projects\" (QFP). The QFP document stated, \"Providers should give comprehensive information to adolescent clients about how to prevent pregnancy. This information should clarify that avoiding sex (i.e., abstinence) is an effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs.\"", "Both FOAs required that projects encourage family participation with respect to services to minors. But unlike the FY2017 FOA, the FY2018 FOA additionally stated that this requirement applied to all clients, not just to minors. Under the FY2018 FOA, successful projects would use \"counseling techniques that encourage family participation for all clients, including the involvement of parents, spouses or family where practicable.\"", "The FY2018 FOA emphasized care coordination by noting that \"each Title X project should ensure that family planning is contextualized within a holistic conversation of health, with the project optimally offering primary health services onsite, or having robust referral linkages to primary health providers in close proximity to the Title X site.\" The FY2017 FOA did not mention onsite or nearby primary care, but it did list among the program's priorities \"Addressing the comprehensive health care needs of clients through formal, robust linkages or integration with comprehensive primary care providers.\"", "Under the FY2017 FOA, final award selections were made by the applicable Public Health Service Region's regional health administrator (RHA), in consultation with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs (DASPA) and the Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) or their designees. In contrast, under the FY2018 FOA, final award selections were made by the DASPA or designee. This change was a shift from program practices in place since the 1980s. The Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) 2009 report A Review of the HHS Family Planning Program stated that \"Although the original language of the Title X statute provides decision-making authority to the DASPA, the Secretary of HHS transferred this authority from the DASPA to the RHAs in the 1980s. This transfer has helped maintain the integrity of the funding processes associated with the Title X program.\" The IOM report also stated that \"the DASPA's status as a political appointee is one of the most significant issues affecting the Title X program.\" ", "The FY2018 FOA encouraged applications for \"innovative\" services and methods that had been \"historically underrepresented\" in the Title X program. The FY2017 FOA did not use those terms.", "Finally, among the program's key issues, the FY2017 FOA explicitly mentioned access to \"contraceptive options, including long acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), other pharmaceuticals, and laboratory tests, preferably on site\" whereas the FY2018 FOA did not. A Questions and Answers document accompanying the FY2018 FOA did clarify that projects must provide contraception."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2018 Awards", "paragraphs": ["In announcing the FY2018 Grantees for Family Planning Services, OPA stated that \"All of these grants will begin on Saturday, September 1, 2018, and will end on Saturday, March 31, 2019.\" This seven-month grant period is a departure from the program's typical practice. ", "Title X family planning services projects have \"project periods,\" typically up to three years, during which HHS does not require the grantee to recompete for funds. Within these project periods, continuing awards generally are funded in annual increments (one-year budget periods), although program guidance states that \"shorter or longer budget periods may be established for compelling administrative or programmatic reasons.\" Continuing awards are contingent on factors such as appropriations, grantees' compliance with federal requirements, and the best interests of the government. OPA stated in the FY2018 FOA that OPA \"will fund grants in annual increments (budget periods) and generally for a project period of up to 3 years, although [OPA] may approve shorter project periods.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Rule Nullification on Selecting Subrecipients", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned under the \" Grantees and Clinics \" heading in this report, Title X grantees can provide family planning services directly or can subaward Title X funds to other government or nonprofit entities (subrecipients) to provide services. In December 2016, OPA promulgated the final rule \"Compliance With Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients.\" The rule became effective January 18, 2017, but P.L. 115-23 nullified the rule on April 13, 2017.", "The rule would have applied to grantees that make subawards; it would not have affected grantees that provide all their Title X services directly. It would have added language that \"No recipient making subawards for the provision of services as part of its Title X project may prohibit an entity from participating for reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services\" to Title X Family Planning Services grant program regulations.", "The President signed P.L. 115-23 , \"Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule submitted by Secretary of Health and Human Services relating to compliance with title X requirements by project recipients in selecting subrecipients.\" P.L. 115-23 nullified the rule under the Congressional Review Act. As a result, the rule \"shall be treated as though such rule had never taken effect.\" That is, the rule is deemed not to have had any effect at any time. Furthermore, HHS is prohibited from reissuing the nullified rule in \"substantially the same form\" or issuing a \"new rule that is substantially the same\" as the nullified rule.", "In the December 2016 preamble accompanying the rule, OPA explained that some states had taken actions to limit Title X participation by certain types of providers. For example, some states enacted laws to prohibit state and local agencies from giving Title X subawards to abortion providers. Some other states had established a priority system for allocating Title X subawards, for example, by giving preference to state health departments, primary care providers, and community health centers over specialized family planning clinics. OPA argued that \"these policies, and varying court decisions on their legality, have led to uncertainty among recipients, inconsistency in program administration, and reduced access to services for Title X priority populations.\" ", "The rule would have limited the criteria a grantee could use to restrict entities from Title X subawards, disallowing \"reasons other than [the entity's] ability to provide Title X services.\" The preamble explained that applicants for new and continuing Title X grants would be required to describe their criteria for choosing subrecipients. The preamble stated that, under this rule, HHS would have reviewed these submissions for rule compliance and would have made \"every effort to help entities come into compliance, and will award replacement grants to other providers when necessary to minimize any disruption of services.\"", "Supporters of the rule argued that it would have protected funding to specialized family planning providers, such as Planned Parenthood, and that it would have protected vulnerable individuals' access to family planning services. Critics of the rule argued that states should have the discretion to administer Title X funds consistently with state policy, and that the rule would have violated the conscience rights of voters and states that object to public funding of abortion providers.
