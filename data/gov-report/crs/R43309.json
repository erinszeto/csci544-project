Haiyan was one of the strongest typhoons to strike land on record. Over a 16 hour period, the \"super typhoon,\" with a force equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane and sustained winds of up to 195 mph, directly swept through six provinces in the central Philippines. The disaster quickly created a humanitarian crisis. In some of the hardest hit areas, particularly in coastal communities in Leyte province and the southern tip of Eastern Samar, the storm knocked out power, telecommunications, and water supplies. The humanitarian relief operation was initially hampered by a number of significant obstacles, including a general lack of transportation, extremely limited communications systems, damaged infrastructure, and seriously disrupted government services. Despite the physical and logistical challenges, regular relief activities reportedly reached most of the worst-stricken areas within two weeks of the storm.", "Two and a half months after the typhoon struck, United Nations (U.N.) agencies reported that 14.1 million people had been affected, with more than 4.1 million displaced. Estimates of the number killed had risen to 6,201 with more than 1,785 missing. The number of injured was unknown. In addition, assessments revealed that an estimated 1.1 million houses had been damaged or destroyed and nearly 5.6 million people required food assistance.", "Ongoing humanitarian relief operations and recovery efforts are being led by the Philippine government. The United Nations, along with other partners, including the United States, remains at the forefront of the on-the-ground response. Apart from U.N. agencies, those responding to the crisis include international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Agencies (PVOs), and bilateral and multilateral donors. As of January 31, 2014, international donors have contributed a total of $662.9 million to the relief efforts. U.S. assistance has included approximately $87 million in disaster aid and $59 million in private sector contributions, a massive U.S. military humanitarian effort, as well as diplomatic and legislative activity.", "At their peak, 66 U.S. military aircraft and 12 naval vessels were involved in relief efforts and nearly 1,000 U.S. military personnel were deployed directly to the disaster areas. The USS George Washington naval task force as well as elements of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit from Okinawa formed the majority of Joint Task Force (JTF) 505, which coordinated and carried out U.S. military relief efforts (Operation Damayan) in cooperation with the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine government. U.S. military assistance included clearing roads, transporting aid workers, distributing 2,495 tons of relief supplies, and evacuating over 21,000 people.", "More than two months after the storm, humanitarian assistance is still required in some affected areas, particularly food, clean water, shelter, and basic health care. The Philippine government launched an $8.2 billion, four-year plan, Reconstruction Assistance in Yolanda (RAY), which focuses on rebuilding areas affected by the typhoon and developing resilience to natural disasters. The U.N. Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), in partnership with U.N. organizations and non-governmental and international organizations, designed a Strategic Response Plan (SRP) to support the Philippines government's activities in meeting immediate humanitarian needs and reconstruction goals.", "The United States and the Philippines maintain close ties stemming from the U.S. colonial period (1898-1946), a security alliance, and common strategic and economic interests.

Over a 16 hour period, the super typhoon or cyclone, with a force equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane and clouds that covered two-thirds of the country, directly swept through six Philippine provinces and affected over 10% of the nation's population of 105 million people. Haiyan's estimated wind speeds were 195 mph at its peak and 155 mph as it weakened and moved west, with wind gusts of up to 235 mph. Several hundred thousand people reportedly had fled their homes in advance of Haiyan's arrival. Many of those displaced were moved to evacuation centers. (See Figure 1 and Figure 2 .)", "The speed of the storm as well as advance warning prevented greater flooding and may have saved many lives. However, in some of the hardest hit areas, particularly in coastal communities in eastern and western Leyte province and the southern tip of Eastern Samar, there appears to have been little defense against Haiyan's wrath. Between two-thirds and 90% of structures were heavily damaged or destroyed, including medical facilities. Downed trees and other debris blocked roads. Airports, vital links to the rest of the archipelagic country, were damaged. Furthermore, decentralized government authority, a shortage of available government workers, looting, and heavy rains delayed some relief efforts.", "The typhoon was the deadliest natural disaster ever recorded in the Philippines. Within a few days of the typhoon, the Philippine government reported that an estimated 11.5 million people had been affected by the storm, with more than 540,000 displaced (of which roughly 380,000 were staying in 1,215 evacuation centers and 162,000 outside the centers). The government also reported that 792,000 people were evacuated in advance of the disaster. The city of Tacloban (population 220,000), capital of Leyte province, was one of the hardest hit places and the scene of the most concentrated destruction and death. Thousands of Tacloban residents reportedly drowned in a \"two-story-high\" storm surge, including people seeking safety in a sports stadium that served as a shelter. Many others were killed by flying debris.

An average of 20 major storms batter the country each year. In 2012, Typhoon Bopha (Pablo) struck the southern island of Mindanao, leaving nearly 2,000 people dead or missing. On the island of Bohol, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in October 2013 displaced 350,000 people, many of whom resisted going to shelters as Haiyan approached, fearing that they might collapse in an aftershock.

These fall into several possible categories:", "The initial humanitarian relief period: Congressional interest and support is likely to focus on the humanitarian impact of the disaster, the U.S. and international response, and ongoing humanitarian developments. Ongoing oversight: Congress may exercise its oversight authority in the ongoing provision of U.S. humanitarian assistance. It may consider how USAID and DOD responses to the Haiyan disaster mesh with overall and existing U.S. foreign aid programs, contributions by other governments, and overall global humanitarian priorities. Longer-term assistance strategy: Given the extensive damage to the central Philippines' economy and infrastructure, Congress may consider broad, long-term U.S. assistance strategies in the Philippines, including policies to boost Philippine exports from storm-affected areas. Lessons learned from the response to the Philippines typhoon may influence future U.S. global disaster assistance strategies and the provision of food aid. Strategic questions: Congress may consider how the U.S. disaster response may impact the U.S.-Philippines relationship as well as regional geopolitical dynamics, and how existing and ongoing U.S. military activities in the Philippines may be affected by DOD's role in disaster relief.

The U.S. Government Emergency Response Mechanism for International Disasters", "The United States is generally a leader and major contributor to relief efforts in response to humanitarian disasters. The President has broad authority to provide emergency assistance for foreign disasters and the U.S. government provides disaster assistance through several U.S. agencies. The very nature of humanitarian disasters\u2014the need to respond quickly in order to save lives and provide relief\u2014has resulted in a rather unrestricted definition of what this type of assistance consists of at both a policy and an operational level. While humanitarian assistance is assumed to provide for urgent food, shelter, and medical needs, the agencies within the U.S. government providing this support typically expand or contract the definition in response to circumstances. Funds may be used for U.S. agencies to deliver services or to provide grants to international organizations (IOs), international governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private or religious voluntary organizations (PVOs). The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the U.S. government agency charged with coordinating U.S. government and private sector assistance. It also coordinates with international organizations, the governments of countries suffering disasters, and other governments.", "The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) in USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) provides immediate relief materials and personnel, many of whom are already abroad on mission. It is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance and can quickly assemble Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) to assess conditions. OFDA has wide authority to borrow funds, equipment, and personnel from other parts of USAID and other federal agencies. USAID has two other offices that administer U.S. humanitarian aid: Food For Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). USAID administers emergency food aid under the Food for Peace Act (Title II of P.L. 480) and provides relief and development food aid that does not have to be repaid. OTI provides post-disaster transition assistance, which includes mainly short-term peace and democratization projects with some attention to humanitarian elements but not emergency relief.", "Although not all applicable to the disaster in the Philippines, the Department of Defense (DOD) Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funds three Dodd humanitarian programs: the Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP), Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) Program, and Foreign Disaster Relief and Emergency Response (FDR/ER). OHDACA provides humanitarian support to stabilize emergency situations and deals with a range of tasks including providing food, shelter and supplies, and medical evacuations. In addition the President has the authority to draw down defense equipment and direct military personnel to respond to disasters. The President may also use the Denton program to provide space-available transportation on military aircraft and ships to private donors who wish to transport humanitarian goods and equipment in response to a disaster. ", "Generally, OFDA provides emergency assistance for 30 to 90 days after a disaster. The same is true for Department of Defense humanitarian assistance. After the initial emergency is over, assistance is provided through other channels, such as the regular country development programs of USAID.", "The State Department also administers programs for humanitarian relief with a focus on refugees and the displaced. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Account (ERMA) is a contingency fund that provides wide latitude to the President in responding to refugee emergencies. Assistance to address emergencies lasting more than a year comes out of the regular Migration and Refugee Account (MRA) through the Population, Migration, and Refugees (PRM) bureau. PRM assists refugees worldwide, conflict victims, and populations of concern, often extended to include internally displaced people (IDPs). Humanitarian assistance includes a range of services from basic needs to community services.", "Appendix F. Mass Fatality Management", "Management of the dead is one challenge of the response to a catastrophe. The task often falls upon local communities, which are typically overwhelmed tending to the needs of the living.", "A pervasive myth holds that human remains cause epidemics in disaster-stricken communities. Human remains do not carry pathogens that are not already in circulation in a community, and they do not generally pose an additional threat to the public. Rather, epidemics of intestinal illness that follow a disaster typically result from loss of the infrastructures that prevent sewage from contaminating potable water. Under such circumstances, many become exposed to the illnesses of a few. ", "Upon review of the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) published a first responder manual on mass fatality management. In it they said that \"political pressure brought about by [rumors of epidemics from human remains] causes authorities to use unnecessary measures such as rapid mass burials.... The consequences of mismanagement of the dead include mental distress and legal problems for relatives of the victims.\" Responders are urged to take steps that allow the eventual identification of remains, and the opportunity for relatives to claim remains. Recommended approaches include rapid retrieval of remains by responders who are not medical personnel (in order to focus the efforts of medical personnel on survivors), best practices for victim identification, and options for storage of remains pending identification. Because the means for optimal storage\u2014ice and refrigeration\u2014may be in short supply following a disaster and are also needed by survivors, the manual recommends temporary burial as a good option for immediate storage where no other method is available."], "subsections": []}]}}
