Four agencies administer 617.5 million acres of the federal land: the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service, all in the Department of the Interior. Most of these lands are in the West, including Alaska. They generate revenues for the U.S. Treasury, some of which are shared with states and localities. The agencies receive funding through the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations laws, as well as in various trust funds and special accounts.", "The lands administered by the four agencies are managed for a variety of purposes, primarily related to preservation, recreation, and development of natural resources. Yet each of these agencies has distinct responsibilities for the lands and resources it administers. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages 255.8 million acres and is responsible for 700 million acres of subsurface mineral resources. The BLM has a multiple-use, sustained-yield mandate that supports a variety of uses and programs, including energy development, recreation, grazing and wild horses and burros, and conservation. The Forest Service (FS) manages 192.8 million acres also for multiple uses and sustained yields of various products and services, including timber harvesting, recreation, grazing, watershed protection, and fish and wildlife habitats. Most of the lands are designated national forests, but there are national grasslands and other designations. Wildfire protection is an increasingly important activity for both agencies. The BLM and FS have several authorities to acquire and dispose of lands.", "The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) manages 90.8 million acres of federal land, primarily to conserve and protect animals and plants. The National Wildlife Refuge System includes wildlife refuges, waterfowl production areas, and wildlife coordination units. Units can be created by an act of Congress or executive order, and the FWS also may acquire lands for migratory birds. The National Park Service (NPS) manages 78.1 million acres of federal land to conserve lands and resources and make them available for public use. Activities that harvest or remove resources generally are prohibited. The National Park System has diverse units ranging from historical structures to cultural and natural areas. Units are created by an act of Congress, but the President may proclaim national monuments.", "There also are three special management systems that include lands from more than one agency. The National Wilderness Preservation System consists of 107.6 million acres of protected wilderness areas designated by Congress. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System contains 11,944 miles of wild, scenic, and recreational rivers, primarily designated by Congress and managed to preserve their free-flowing condition. The National Trails System contains four classes of trails managed to provide recreation and access to outdoor areas and historic resources."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction1", "paragraphs": ["Ownership and use of federal lands have stirred controversy for decades.

The figures understate total federal land, since they do not include lands administered by the Department of Defense or other federal agencies; it should be recognized that these other federal lands are not uniformly distributed among the states, and that Table 1 thus understates total federal land by more in states with extensive military bases or other federal lands (e.g., Arizona, Florida, and Nevada). Table 1 also identifies the total size of each state, and the percentage of land in each state administered by the four federal land management agencies. These percentages point to significant variation in the federal presence within states. The figures range from 0.2% of land in Connecticut to 80.8% of land in Nevada.", "While fourteen states contain less than \u00bd million acres of land administered by the four federal land management agencies, another dozen have more than 10 million acres managed by these agencies within their borders. All 12 states where the federal government owns the most land are located in the West (including Alaska). This is a result of early treaties and land settlement laws and patterns. Management of these lands is often controversial, especially in states where the federal government is a predominant or majority landholder and where competing and conflicting uses of the lands are at issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Review", "paragraphs": ["The nation's lands and resources have been important in American history, adding to the strength and stature of the federal government, serving as an attraction and opportunity for settlement and economic development, and providing a source of revenue for schools, transportation, national defense, and other national, state, and local needs.", "The formation of our current federal government was particularly influenced by the struggle for control over what were known as the \"western\" lands\u2014the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River claimed by the original colonies. Prototypical land laws enacted by the Continental Congress, such as the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, established the federal system of rectangular land surveying for disposal and set up a system for developing territorial governments leading to statehood. During operation of the Articles of Confederation, the states that then owned the western lands were reluctant to cede them to the developing new government, but eventually acquiesced. This, together with granting constitutional powers to the new federal government, including the authority to regulate federal property and to create new states, played a crucial role in transforming the weak central government under the Articles of Confederation into a stronger, centralized federal government under the U.S. Constitution.", "The new Congress, which first met in 1789, enacted land statutes similar to those enacted by the Continental Congress. Subsequent federal land laws reflected two visions: reserving some federal lands (such as for national forests and national parks) and selling or otherwise disposing of other lands to raise money or to encourage transportation, development, and settlement. From the earliest days, these policy clashes took on East/West overtones, with easterners more likely to view the lands as national public property, and westerners more likely to view the lands as necessary for local use and development. Most agreed, however, on measures that promoted settlement of the lands to pay soldiers, to reduce the national debt, and to strengthen the nation. This settlement trend accelerated with federal acquisition of additional territory through the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Oregon Compromise with England in 1846, and cession of lands by treaty after the Mexican war in 1848.", "During the mid- to late 1800s, Congress enacted numerous laws to encourage and accelerate the settlement of the West by disposing of federal lands. Examples include the Homestead Act of 1862 and the Desert Lands Entry Act of 1877. Approximately 816 million acres of the public domain lands were transferred to private ownership between 1781 and 2007. Another 328 million acres were granted to the states generally, and an additional 134 million were granted in Alaska under state and native selection laws. Most transfers to private ownership (97%) occurred before 1940; homestead entries, for example, peaked in 1910 at 18.3 million acres but dropped below 200,000 acres annually after 1935, until being totally eliminated in 1986.", "Certain other federal laws were \"catch up\" laws designed to legitimize certain uses that already were occurring on the federal lands. These laws typically acknowledged local variations and customs. For example, the General Mining Law of 1872 recognized mineral claims on the public domain lands in accordance with local laws and customs, and provided for the conveyance of title to such lands. In addition, early land disposal laws allowed states to determine the rights of settlers to use and control water. The courts later determined, however, that the federal government could also reserve or create federal water rights for its own properties and purposes.", "Although some earlier laws had protected some lands and resources, such as salt deposits and certain timber for military use, other laws in the late 1800s reflected the growing concern that rapid development threatened some of the scenic treasures of the nation, as well as resources that would be needed for future use. A preservation and conservation movement evolved to ensure that certain lands and resources were left untouched or reserved for future use. For example, Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 to preserve its resources in a natural condition, and to dedicate recreation opportunities for the public. It was the world's first national park, and like the other early parks, Yellowstone was protected by the U.S. Army\u2014primarily from poachers of wildlife or timber. In 1891, concern over the effects of timber harvests on water supplies and downstream flooding led to the creation of forest reserves (renamed national forests in 1907).", "The creation of national parks and forest reserves laid the foundation for the current development of federal agencies with primary purposes of managing natural resources on federal lands. For example, in 1905, responsibility for management of the forest reserves was joined with forestry research and assistance in a new Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture. The National Park Service was created in 1916 to manage the growing number of parks established by Congress and monuments proclaimed by the President. The first national wildlife refuge was proclaimed in 1903, although it was not until 1966 that the refuges coalesced into the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Grazing Service (Department of the Interior, first known as the Grazing Division) was established in 1934 to administer grazing on public rangelands. It was combined with the General Land Office in 1946 to form the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).", "In addition to the conservation laws and activities noted above, emphasis shifted during the 20 th century from the disposal and conveyance of title to private citizens to the retention and management of the remaining federal lands. During debates on the Taylor Grazing Act, some western Members of Congress acknowledged the poor prospects for relinquishing federal lands to the states, but language included in the act left disposal as a possibility. It was not until the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) that Congress expressly declared that the remaining public domain lands generally would remain in federal ownership. This declaration of policy was a significant factor in what became known as the Sagebrush Rebellion, an effort that started in the late 1970s to provide state or local control over federal land and management decisions. To date, judicial challenges and legislative and executive attempts to make significant changes to federal ownership have proven unsuccessful. Current authorities for acquiring and disposing of federal lands are unique to each agency, and are described in subsequent chapters of this report.", "Since the cession to the federal government of the western lands of several of the original 13 colonies, many issues and conflicts have recurred. Ownership continues to be debated, with some advocating increased disposal of federal lands to state or private ownership, and others supporting retention of federal lands by the federal government. Still others promote acquisition by the federal government of additional land, including through an increased, and more stable, funding source. A related issue is determining the optimal division of resources between federal acquisition of new lands and maintenance of existing federal lands and facilities.", "Another focus is whether federal lands should be managed primarily to produce national benefits or benefits primarily for the localities and states in which the lands are located. Who decides these questions, and how the decisions are made, also are at issue. Some would like to see more local control of land and a reduced federal role, while others seek to maintain or enhance the federal role in land management to represent the interests of all citizens.", "The extent to which federal lands should be made available for development, preserved, and opened to recreation has been controversial. Significant differences of opinion exist on the amount of traditional commercial development that should be allowed, particularly involving energy development, grazing, and timber harvesting. How much land to dedicate to enhanced protection, what type of protection to provide, and who should protect federal lands are continuing questions. Whether and where to restrict recreation, generally and for high-impact uses such as motorized off-road vehicles, also is a focus of debate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Federal Land Management", "paragraphs": ["Four agencies administer 617.5 million acres (95%) of the roughly 650 million acres of federal land.

The BLM has jurisdiction over 255.8 million acres (39%) of the federal total. The FS has jurisdiction over 192.8 million acres (30%) of the total federal acreage. The FWS administers 90.8 million acres (14%) and has secondary jurisdiction on another 1.6 million acres and easements or leases on 4.0 million acres. The NPS administers 78.1 million acres of federal land (12%), and NPS units encompass another 6.2 million acres of other federal and nonfederal lands. Table 2 displays the acreage for each of these four agencies in each state, the District of Columbia, and the territories. In addition, Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 , below, provide maps showing these federal lands. Figure 1 shows federal lands in the West; Figure 2 shows federal lands in the East; and Figure 3 shows federal lands in Alaska and Hawaii.", "The four major federal land management agencies were created at different times and for different purposes. Thus, their missions and purposes differ. The NPS has a dual mission\u2014to preserve unique resources and provide for their enjoyment. This protection-versus-recreation dichotomy causes many of the agency's management challenges. The FWS has a clearer primary-use mission\u2014to provide for the conservation of plants and animals. Other uses (recreation, hunting, timber cutting, oil or gas drilling, etc.) are permitted, to the extent they are compatible with the species' needs. It can be challenging to determine compatibility.", "The BLM and FS have similar management responsibilities for their lands\u2014sustained yields of the multiple uses. The uses considered by the agencies include recreation, grazing, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife and fish habitat, and conservation. The agencies are to manage their lands for sustained yield\u2014a high level of resource outputs in perpetuity, without impairing the productivity of the lands. Because of the similarity of their missions, merging the two agencies occasionally has been proposed. However, different uses have been emphasized by each agency historically. For instance, most rangelands are managed by the BLM, and the BLM administers mineral development on all federal lands. Most federal forests are managed by the FS, and only the FS has a cooperative program to assist nonfederal forest landowners.", "Congress also has chosen to protect certain other resource values\u2014wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, and national trails. Instead of creating a new agency for administering federal lands providing these values, Congress has established land systems with management guidelines and constraints for the existing agencies to use in conjunction with their existing missions and purposes. Thus, each of the four agencies administer wilderness areas, portions of national trails, and wild, scenic, or recreational river segments, with the more restrictive management standards (the agencies' existing missions or the systems' constraints) applying to the areas. For example, hunting is permitted in most wilderness areas, but generally not in NPS wilderness areas because most NPS lands are closed to hunting.", "Despite the diverse missions and purposes of the four major federal land management agencies and the systems of federal lands, one overarching issue will likely affect all the lands, resources, and agencies\u2014global climate change. Climate change has and will continue to affect temperatures and alter precipitation patterns and hydrologic regimes, thus affecting animal and plant distributions. Managing lands to provide for diverse outputs and values will become increasingly challenging. Landowners, and the federal land management agencies, will face conditions\u2014drought, wildfires, insect and disease epidemics, invasive species\u2014that differ from anything seen in the past.

In recent years, nearly all of the money that has accrued to the fund resulted from offshore oil and gas development. For instance, for FY2008, it is estimated that $897 million was derived from offshore development, with $1 million from the federal motorboat fuels tax and $2 million from surplus property sales.

Congress created a permanent system for revenue-sharing for most FS lands in 1908. The agency pays 25% of its gross revenues to the states for use on roads and schools in the counties where the national forests are located. The states determine which road and school programs are to be funded, and how much goes to each program, but the amount allocated to each county is determined by the FS and the states cannot retain any of the funds. For the national grasslands, 25% of net revenues go directly to the counties. In addition, three counties in Minnesota receive a special payment of 0.75% of the appraised value of the Superior NF lands in the county.

Of these high-3 payments, 15%-20% must be spent on certain county programs or on projects on federal lands recommended by a local advisory committee or chosen by the FS. The program was extended for one year (FY2007) in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY2007, and the payments under this extension accounted for 88% of the $377 million in FS payments in FY2007. The program was extended for FY2008-FY2011 in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-343 ), with declining full funding, significant changes to the allocation formula, and transition payments for certain states.", "For BLM lands and revenues, the revenue-sharing system is more complicated. The share going to state and local entities ranges from 0% to 90% of gross program revenues, as specified in individual statutes. For example, states and counties receive 12\u00bd% of revenues from grazing within grazing districts (under \u00a73 of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934) and 50% of revenues from grazing outside grazing districts (under \u00a715 of the Taylor Grazing Act). Another example is timber sale revenues. The states and counties receive 4% of timber revenues from most BLM lands. However, the counties receive up to 75% from the heavily timbered Oregon & California (O&C) railroad grant lands in Western Oregon. Counties with the Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) grant lands (adjoining and usually identified with the O&C lands) similarly receive up to 75%, but actual payments are limited by county tax assessments. Because the O&C and CBWR payments have been largely from timber sales, which have declined since the late 1980s, they were included with national forest lands in the spotted owl payments program and the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. (See above.)", "These examples demonstrate the complexity of the legal issues for sharing BLM revenues with state and local governments. The BLM revenue-sharing payments are permanently appropriated, with 11 separate payment accounts; for FY2007, budget authority was $144.5 million, of which $117.1 million (81%) was for the O&C and CBWR lands.", "Finally, the FWS has a revenue-sharing program, but payments depend on the history of the land. For refuges reserved from the public domain, the payments are based on 25% of net revenues (in contrast to 25% of gross revenues from FS lands other than national grasslands).

The Northeast Region (roughly extending from Virginia to Maine, with 71 refuges) took the lead in addressing this budget issue by attempting to consolidate management at refuges, and increasing the number of refuges which are not staffed on a full-time or regular basis (termed \"de-staffing\").

This first national park was placed under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior, who was responsible for developing regulations to \"provide for the preservation, from injury or spoliation, of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition\" (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 22). Other park functions were to include developing visitor accommodations, building roads and trails, removing trespassers (mostly poachers), and protecting \"against wanton destruction of fish and game.\"", "When Yellowstone National Park was authorized, there was no concept or plan for the development of a system of such parks. The concept now firmly established as the National Park System embracing a diversity of natural and cultural resources nationwide, evolved slowly over the years. The idea of a national park was an American invention of historic proportions, marking the start of a global conservation movement that today accounts for hundreds of national parks (or equivalent conservation preserves) throughout the world. The American National Park System continues to serve as an international model for resource protection and preservation.", "At the same time that interest was growing in preserving the scenic wonders of the American West, efforts were underway to protect the sites, structures, and cultural objects associated with early Native American cultures, particularly in the Southwest. In 1906, Congress enacted the Antiquities Act to authorize the President \"to declare by public proclamation [as national monuments] historic and prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific interest\" (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 431). In the years following the establishment of Yellowstone, national parks and monuments were authorized or proclaimed, principally from the public domain lands in the West, and were administered by the Department of the Interior (initially with help from the U.S. Army). However, no single agency provided unified management of the varied federal parklands. Before a management system emerged, 35 national parks and monuments had been created.", "On August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the act creating the National Park Service, a new federal agency in the Department of the Interior with the responsibility for protecting the existing national parks and monuments then managed by the department and those yet to be established. This action reflected a developing national concern for preserving the nation's heritage. This \"Organic Act\" states that the National Park \"Service then established shall promote and regulate the use of Federal areas known as national parks, monuments and reservations ... to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations\" (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). By executive order in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt transferred 63 national monuments and military sites from the FS and the War Department to the National Park Service. This action was a major step in the development of a truly national system of park units. Today, roughly 60% of the park areas administered by the NPS were designated as symbols of the nation's culture, history and prehistory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organization", "paragraphs": ["The National Park Service manages the 391 units of the National Park System.

The NPS Director is nominated by the President, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, and confirmed by the Senate. Directly overseeing NPS operations is the Interior Department's Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks. The NPS and its more than 20,000 permanent, temporary, and seasonal employees protect, preserve, interpret, and administer the Park System's diverse natural and historic areas representing the cultural identity of the American people. In addition, the National Park Service Advisory Board, composed of private citizens with requisite experience and expertise, advises on management policies and on potential additions to the System.", "The individual park units are arranged in seven regional offices, each headed by a regional director. The NPS had traditionally operated with 10 regional offices but in the 1990s three regional offices were eliminated and a system of \"park clusters\" was formed. The reorganization, a part of the Clinton Administration's \"reinventing government,\" focused on downsizing and streamlining, was primarily designed to shift resources and personnel from central offices to field units. Regional offices and cluster support offices provide certain administrative functions and specialized staff services and expertise which were believed to be impracticable for each park unit. This shared assistance is particularly important to the smaller units. The individual units are overseen by a park superintendent, with staff generally commensurate with the size, public use, and significance of the unit. The park units in Alaska are an exception, with relatively few personnel in comparison to the large size of the holdings. Park superintendents have broad discretionary authority in managing the day to day operations of the varied individual units, and considerable flexibility in interpreting how NPS regulations apply in the specific units.", "Of the four federal land management agencies, the NPS manages the most diverse collection of units and generally affords the most protection for lands and resources. The variety of park unit classifications can be confusing to the public as more than 20 different designations are used for park sites or areas, ranging from the traditional national park designation to scenic rivers and trails, memorials, battlefields, historic sites, historic parks, seashores, lakeshores, recreation areas, and monuments. (See Table 5 .) Some of the Park System nomenclature is descriptive; others are not self-evident. Because of this variety of park unit designations and the sometime public perception of lesser status for units lacking the national park designation, Congress sought to establish that all units in the System are to be considered of equal value. The National Park System General Authorities Act of 1970 stated that all NPS units are part of \"one national park System preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all people of the United States.... \" In 1978, Congress amended that law to reassert the System-wide equal standard of protection for all areas administered by the NPS.

Mining, for instance, is generally prohibited, although in a limited number of national parks and monuments some mining is allowed, in accordance with the Mining in the Parks Act of 1976. Also, in authorizing certain additions to the System, Congress has specified that certain natural resource uses, such as oil and gas development or hunting, may\u2014or shall\u2014be permitted in specific units; examples include national preserves (such as Big Cypress and Bering Land Bridge) and national recreation areas (such as Glen Canyon and Delaware Water Gap).

Motorized recreation in NPS units presents particular challenges, with debates over the economic and environmental impacts of, safety of, and level of access for such types of recreation and the adequacy of existing laws and regulations governing motorized use. Vehicle manufacturers and user groups fear that NPS limits would be economically damaging to communities and industries serving users, unfairly restrict access, and set a precedent for other federal land managers. Others, including environmentalists, fear that failure to adequately manage motorized use will damage resources and diminish the experience of other park users, and increase pressure for additional forms of motorized access. Continuing litigation over differing versions of regulations that would either restrict or allow snowmobile use in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway shows no sign of concluding.

The NPS assists heritage areas in attaining the designation and supports state and community efforts through seed money, recognition, and technical assistance. Some interests have recommended generic NHA legislation, to standardize and guide the creation and management of these areas; others, however, prefer to retain the variety and flexibility that individual legislative initiatives provide. Proponents contend that NHAs protect valued resources and traditions; promote tourism and community revitalization; and help prevent new and perhaps costly or inappropriate additions to the Park System.

These contributions have in general been beneficial to the NPS. An ongoing management challenge is to balance the beneficial aspects of this support while avoiding reliance on private largess to carry out the core responsibilities of park operations and facility maintenance; these tasks are traditionally supported by annual appropriations and are a key component of congressional oversight. The NPS has developed extensive policy regulations to guide park managers in dealing with donations. Sometimes donations are conditioned upon some reciprocity that the donor expects in return for the donation; park managers must assess park needs and resist or deny the quid-pro-quo attached to proposed donations when necessary.", "Some have argued that the Park Service should more aggressively pursue outside funding support by marketing such things as naming rights to various park features and allowing \"tasteful\" corporate advertising within park boundaries. Others have criticized \"commercialization\" and \"privatization\" influences in the parks and have raised concerns that park managers' pursuit of various entrepreneurial efforts to finance park needs will be to the detriment of management's core function of resource protection. One commonly cited example of inappropriate use of NPS lands was the broadcast of an NPS-sanctioned, week-long, corporate-sponsored festival on the National Mall in September, 2003, that featured large advertising banners using the Mall's iconic monuments as a backdrop; Congress subsequently included a provision in the FY2004 Interior appropriations act (\u00a7145, P.L. 108-108 ) limiting the use of commercial advertisement on the National Mall.", "In August 2006, President Bush proposed a three-part National Park Centennial Initiative for park improvement projects to ready the NPS for its 100 th anniversary in 2016.

Part of the Initiative was a Centennial Challenge that would rely on corporations, foundations, and other private donations. This raised some concerns about potential commercialization and privatization influences upon the parks. Congress did not authorize the challenge component through legislation, but did provide $24.6 million in seed money in the FY2008 Interior appropriation bill (in P.L. 110-161 ) and directing that the funds be used for signature projects controlled by the NPS. Some interests have suggested that economic stimulus legislation include an NPS Centennial Challenge provision.", "Another commercialization and privatization controversy developed in 2006 when the NPS issued a court-ordered environmental impact statement (EIS) on bioprospecting (assessing biological resources for their potential commercial value). The agency's preferred alternative would allow private companies to research genetic resources of plants, animals and micro-organisms in Park System areas set aside for stewardship in the public trust. Some environmental groups campaigned against it, but it became NPS policy to allow commercial bioprospecting under benefit-sharing agreements.

The area included may not exceed an average of 320 acres per mile of river designated (640 acres per mile in Alaska), an average quarter-mile wide corridor of land on each side of the river.", "Where wild and scenic river corridor boundaries include state, county, or other public land, or private land, federal agencies have limited authority to purchase, condemn, exchange, or accept donations of state and private lands within the corridor boundaries. Additionally, federal agencies are directed to cooperate with state and local governments in developing corridor management plans.", "In response to controversies associated with management of lands within wild and scenic river corridors, several recent designations have included language calling for citizen advisory boards or other mechanisms to ensure local participation in developing management plans. Even without such direction, management plans for river corridors involving predominantly private lands usually are developed with input from local jurisdictions, prior to designation.", "Management of lands within wild and scenic corridors generally is less restricted than in some protected areas, such as wilderness, although management varies with the class of the designated river and the values for which it was included in the System. Administration is intended to protect and enhance the values which led to the designation, but Congress also directed that other land uses not be limited unless they \"substantially interfere with public use and enjoyment of these values\" (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1281(a)). Primary emphasis for management is directed toward protecting aesthetic, scenic, historic, archaeologic, and scientific features of the area.

Management of these state-nominated rivers may be more complicated because of the diversity of land ownership in these areas. Fewer than 10% of the federal wild and scenic river designations have been made in this manner.", "Designation and management of lands within river corridors have been controversial in some cases, with debates over the effect of designation on private lands within the river corridors, the impact of activities within a corridor on the flow or character of the designated river segment, and the extent of local input in developing management plans. Initially, the river designations involved federal land; however, over the years, more and more segments have been designated that include private lands within the river corridors. The potential use of condemnation authority has been particularly controversial. Congress has addressed these issues in part by encouraging development of management plans during river study phase, prior to designation, and by avoiding condemnation. According to the NPS, condemnation has \"almost ceased to be used [since] the early 1980s.\" Another issue that arises from time to time is the nature of state or federal projects prohibited within a corridor, such as construction of major highway crossings, bridges, or other activities that might affect the flow or character of the designated river segment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Statutes", "paragraphs": ["Wild and Scenic Rivers Act: P.L. 90-542; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1271, et seq."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "National Trails System116", "paragraphs": ["The National Trails System (NTS) was created in 1968 by the National Trails System Act.
