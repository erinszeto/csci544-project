Among the agencies represented is the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), in the Department of the Interior. Many of its programs are among the more controversial of those funded in the bill. For FY2012, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-74, Division E, H.Rept. 112-331) provided $1.48 billion for FWS, down 2% from the FY2011 level of $1.50 billion. (This measure also provided appropriations for most federal government operations for the remainder of FY2012.) For FWS, most accounts were reduced to some degree relative to the FY2011 level.", "This report analyzes the FWS funding levels contained in the FY2012 appropriations bill. Emphasis is on FWS funding for programs that have generated congressional debate or particular constituent interest, now or in recent years. Several controversies arose during the appropriations cycle over funding levels or restrictions on funding:", "The Administration proposed limitations on funds that could be used to respond to petitions to list new species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), arguing that petitions diverted the agency from listing species with higher conservation priority; others argued that without petitions FWS would list fewer species. The Administration also proposed to limit spending on listing foreign species. Both limits were accepted. The House bill proposed to limit judicial review of FWS decisions concerning the delisting of gray wolves under ESA. This provision was eliminated from the final bill. The Administration proposed cutbacks in funding for certain fish hatcheries involved in mitigation of the effects of federal water projects. FWS argued that the mitigation burden belonged on the shoulders of the agencies responsible for the projects. Congress did cut some of the program, but also specified a transfer of funds to FWS to support hatchery mitigation. The Administration proposed elimination of annual appropriations for payments to counties for lost revenues due to the presence of non-taxable FWS lands. Congress continued the appropriation, with small reductions from previous appropriations. The House bill proposed to eliminate nearly all funding for FWS land acquisition. Congress reduced but did not eliminate the program.", "All of these issues are discussed in more detail below, along with funding levels for other programs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, which began its consideration as H.R. 2584 and ended as Division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-74 ), funds agencies and programs in parts of three federal departments (Interior, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services), as well as numerous related agencies and bureaus, including the Environmental Protection Agency. Among the more controversial agencies represented in the bill is the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), in the Department of the Interior (DOI). House floor consideration of Interior and Environment appropriations was not completed, and the Senate first considered these programs in the context of Division E of the conference report on a bill whose original subject was appropriations for military construction. The House next considered FWS appropriations in the context of the conference report for the same measure. As a result, the legislative history of Interior and Environment appropriations in general, and FWS specifically, is truncated relative to most years, and the emphasis below is largely on the final bill.", "Congress approved $1.48 billion for the agency for FY2012. The President had requested $1.69 billion (up 13% from FY2011); on July 12, 2011, the House committee approved $1.19 billion (down 21% from FY2011). (See Table 1 .) Most accounts and subaccounts were reduced relative to FY2011 levels. At the account level, percentage changes from FY2011 to FY2012 ranged from a reduction of 20.4% for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund to an increase of 10.8% for Construction.

Consideration continued to July 28, 2011, when the House rose, leaving H.R. 2584 as unfinished business. During floor consideration, there were three amendments affecting FWS; two were adopted, and one was rejected. ", "The first amendment ( H.Amdt. 732 ; Bass, NH) increased land acquisition funding by $4 million for FWS, as well as making increases for specified other agencies, with offsetting reductions in funds for the Office of the DOI Secretary.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Endangered Species Funding", "paragraphs": ["Funding for the endangered species program is part of the Resource Management account, and is a perennially controversial portion of the FWS budget. Congress approved $176.0 million, up 0.3% from the FY2011 level of $175.4 million. The Administration's FY2012 request was $182.6 million. (See Table 2 .) The House Committee approved $138.7 million; the accompanying committee report, citing the absence of a reauthorization for the Endangered Species Act (ESA), gave statistics on the low rate for recovery of listed species as evidence that the ESA has failed. Over half of the House committee's reduction from FY2011 level came from elimination of funding for adding new species to the list of species protected under the ESA, and for the designation of new critical habitat for species. The reductions were contained in the tables accompanying the bill; but in addition, the committee's bill language itself reinforced that elimination by directing that \"none of the funds shall be used for implementing subsections (a), (b), (c), and (e) of Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act, (except for processing petitions, developing and issuing proposed and final regulations, and taking any other steps to implement actions described in subsection (c)(2)(A), (c)(2)(B)(i), or (c)(2)(B)(ii) of such section).\"", "The language would have prevented listing new species or changing a species from threatened to endangered, or a designating new critical habitat. It would have allowed action to delist species or to downlist species from endangered to threatened, although with no funding in the committee's bill for the listing program it is not clear what funds would have been available for such actions. On July 26, 2011, the House considered H.Amdt. 735 (Dicks, WA) to strike this language. Supporters of H.Amdt. 735 rejected the claim that the ESA has failed, and cited the continued existence of all but a few of the listed species struggling in the face lost habitat and other dangers as an alternative measure of success. The amendment passed (yeas 224, nays 202; roll call #652) on July 27, 2011. In the end, P.L. 112-74 contained limits on spending for listing species in response to petitions, for listing foreign species, and for designation of critical habitat. The limitations on listing foreign species or responding to petitions were not found in the previous appropriations bill; limitations on critical habitat designation have been a feature of appropriations bills for over 15 years.", "P.L. 112-74 reduced funding for consultation under Section 7 of the ESA by 1.5% from FY2011. Under Section 7, federal agencies are obliged to consult with FWS on their actions which may affect listed species, and obtain a biological opinion (BiOp) from FWS on whether the action might jeopardize the species. The BiOp may include reasonable and prudent alternatives for the agency action that would avoid jeopardy. Reduced funding for FWS to consult could delay federal actions, because the action agency might hesitate to open its actions to the citizen suit provisions of the ESA in the absence of the FWS BiOp.", "The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund also benefits species that are listed or proposed for listing under ESA, through grants to states and territories. P.L. 112-74 provided $47.7 million, down 20.4% from the FY2011 level of $59.9 million. The program assists states with, among other things, the preparation of Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs). HCPs are developed for non-federal actions by state, local, business or private entities as a requirement for obtaining an Incidental Take Permit for actions that may affect listed species. For HCPs involving many actors, states may use their funds from this program to coordinate the HCPs, to develop a single umbrella plan on behalf of a region, or to acquire land to mitigate effects of a project. Reduction of state support leaves states with the option of funding some of these efforts alone, or leaving individual actors to develop their own plans.", "Taking the two programs together, the final bill projects savings in endangered species funding, compared to FY2011 levels, at 5.0%.

However, that does not mean that the agencies lack authority to conduct actions (\u00a7\u00a74, 6-8, 10, and 11; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71533, 1535-1537, 1539, and 1540), or that prohibitions within the act are no longer enforceable (\u00a79; 16 U.S.C. \u00a71538). Those statutory provisions continue to be law, even when money has not been appropriated. The expiration of a provision authorizing appropriations does not end the statutory obligations created by that law. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that \"the mere failure of Congress to appropriate funds, without further words modifying or repealing, expressly or by clear implication, the substantive law, does not in and of itself defeat a Government obligation created by statute.\" Moreover, Section 11(g) (16 U.S.C. \u00a71540(g)) \"allows any citizen to commence a civil suit on his own behalf\" on various broad, specified provisions of the act. This option would still be available, regardless of agency funding. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wolf Delisting10", "paragraphs": ["Appropriations bills have been vehicles for action on the status of wolves. While P.L. 112-74 contained no provisions regarding wolves, substantial action on delisting of gray wolves occurred in the FY2011 appropriation process ( P.L. 112-10 ), and provides background for additional action occurring during consideration of the House committee bill for FY2012. Section 1713 of P.L. 112-10 removed most wolves in the Northern Rockies from the protections of ESA. This removal from the ESA's list of protected species (or \"delisting\") makes these gray wolves the 49 th species to be delisted, and the only one delisted due to specific legislative action. In April 2009, FWS had issued a regulation to delist the population of wolves that had been reintroduced in the Northern Rockies. The rule removed wolves in Montana, Idaho, and parts of Washington, Oregon, and Utah from ESA protections, but the rule did not change the wolf's status outside these five states. The wolves of Wyoming were to remain protected because FWS held that Wyoming's proposed management plan was not adequate to avoid population declines that would result in relisting the wolves. In August 2010, a federal court overturned the rule. In addition, in November 2010, a federal district court in Wyoming ordered FWS to reconsider the Wyoming plan for wolf management, holding that FWS had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting the plan. Section 1713 ordered FWS to reissue the April 2009 rule and insulated the new rule from judicial review. It further stated that the section was to have no effect on the Wyoming case. FWS reissued the rule on May 5, 2011. The provision appears to leave open the option for a subsequent proposal to re-list the species.", "Two factors made this delisting distinct from past efforts to delist species legislatively. First, FWS had previously delisted the species though the action was later rejected by a court. FWS had argued that the best available science supported delisting. Second, the species had met and exceeded the numeric goals for delisting in the species' recovery plan, although some aspects of its recovery were disputed.", "In H.R. 2584 (\u00a7119), the House committee addressed concerns that the re-issued rule or other rules delisting wolves might be challenged in court. The section directed that any final rule delisting wolves in Wyoming or in the western Great Lakes area not be subject to judicial review, provided that FWS had authorized the state(s) to manage the wolf population. H.Amdt. 750 (Dicks, WA) was offered to strike this section. In a recorded vote on July 27, 2011, the House rejected the amendment (yeas 174; nays 250, roll call #659), leaving the language in place. In the end, though, P.L. 112-74 omitted the House's provision. ", "The only language concerning wolves in the final bill was contained in the conference report ( H.Rept. 112-331 , p. 1051). The language instructed FWS to provide $1 million from its ESA recovery funds to \"re-instate a livestock loss demonstration program as authorized by P.L. 111-11 .\" The program compensates ranchers for their losses due to wolf predation.

Costs of operations have increased on many refuges, partly due to special problems such as hurricane damage and more aggressive border enforcement, but also due to increased use, invasive species control, maintenance backlog, and other demands. According to FWS, refuge funding has not been keeping pace with these demands. Combined with the rising costs of rent, salaries, fuel, and utilities, the agency says these demands have led to cuts in funding for programs to aid endangered species, reduce infestation by invasive species, protect water supplies, address habitat restoration, and ensure staffing at the less popular refuges. While some increases were provided to address these problems in recent years, the FY2009 stimulus law provided additional funding to address these concerns. One response to reduced funding has been the consolidation of refuges (called \"complexing\" by FWS) under a single refuge manager and staff, as a means of sharing staff and equipment. This program has met resistance from refuge supporters who argue that refuge units will lose resources and adequate supervision. Balanced against these concerns is congressional interest in general deficit reduction.", "Law Enforcement is part of the Subaccount for Migratory Birds, Law Enforcement, and International Affairs.

However, concern had been generated early in the FY2012 appropriations cycle when the Administration proposed that FWS negotiate reimbursable agreements with responsible parties for mitigation activities at National Fish Hatcheries. Until such reimbursement was negotiated, FWS proposed to eliminate or substantially reduce activities at the nine National Fish Hatcheries where mitigation costs were at least 40% of total operating expenses.", "FWS manages a number of hatcheries under the National Fish Hatchery System. In some cases the mandated role of a hatchery, in whole or in part, is to provide mitigation for activities by other agencies. For FY2012, FWS projected annual expenditures to mitigate projects of four agencies: Army Corps of Engineers ($4.7 million), Tennessee Valley Authority ($835,000), Bonneville Power Authority ($40,000), and the Bureau of Reclamation ($715,000). (See Table 3 . ) Nine hatcheries met or exceeded the Administration's 40% mitigation threshold: more than 40% of the benefit of the hatchery was attributed to mitigation of the effects of a water project. These nine hatcheries were then targeted for reduction or elimination of FWS support. FWS argued that some or all of the hatchery costs should be borne by the responsible water project agencies.", "This issue was addressed and resolved in conference:", "The conferees have restored the proposed $3,388,000 shortfall in the budget for mitigation hatchery operations and critical supplies. An additional $3,800,000 is appropriated elsewhere in this consolidated Act for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reimburse the Service. Together, these amounts fully fund mitigation hatcheries operated by the Service for the Corps, Tennessee Valley Authority, Bureau of Reclamation's Central Utah Project and the Bonneville Power Administration. The conferees support efforts by the Service to recover costs of programs that are conducted to mitigate the environmental effects of other Federal partners.

This estimate is $14.0 million above the previous year, and was based on the assumption that Congress would approve a proposed increase in the price of duck stamps from $15 to $25.

However, these receipts are sufficient for funding a small fraction of the authorized formula, and county governments have long urged additional appropriations to make up the difference. The Administration requested no funding for NWRF in FY2012, which would have meant that based on receipts alone, counties would have received 5% of the authorized level.
