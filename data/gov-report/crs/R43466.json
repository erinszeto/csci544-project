The large majority of children enter foster care because of neglect or abuse at the hands of their parents. Maltreatment by a caregiver is often traumatic for children, and may lead to children having challenges regulating their emotions and interpreting cues and communication from others, among other problem behaviors. Children in foster care are more likely to have mental health care needs than children generally.", "Children in foster care who have mental health needs may receive psychosocial services such as individual or group counseling and case management to improve their health. Alternatively, or in addition, a medical professional may prescribe psychotropic medications. These are prescribed drugs that affect the brain chemicals related to mood and behavior. They are used to treat a variety of mental health conditions including attention disorders, depression, anxiety, conduct disorders, and others. While psychotropic medication alone is not necessarily advised, children in foster care may more readily receive psychotropics to treat their mental health needs due to the complexity of their symptoms and the lack of appropriate screening and assessment and/or the limited availability of health care professionals trained to provide effective therapies (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy).", "Between 16% and 33% of children in out-of-home care may be using psychotropic medication on any given day, although the rate of use varies significantly based on certain factors, including the child's age, placement setting, and length of involvement with the child welfare agency. Among children generally, about 6% are taking psychotropic medications at some point during a given year. Some of the difference in prevalence of use may be explained by the higher levels of mental health risk factors among children in foster care.", "The use of psychotropics by children in foster care has come under increased scrutiny by policymakers and stakeholders in the child welfare field. Little research has been conducted to show whether psychotropics are effective and safe for children who need mental health services. Despite these concerns, some children may benefit from specific psychotropic medication for managing mental and behavioral symptoms associated with their exposure to traumatic events. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year initiative to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care by encouraging the use of evidence-based screening, assessment, and treatment of trauma and mental health disorders. Congress has also taken a strong interest in oversight of prescription medications used by children in care, addressing the issue in oversight hearings and other fact-finding forums.", "Further, federal law (Title IV-B, Subpart 1 of the Social Security Act) requires states and other jurisdictions to describe their oversight of prescription medications for children in foster care, including specific protocols used with regard to psychotropic medication. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued guidance about these provisions and requires jurisdictions to submit annual reports to the department that describe this oversight."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Children in foster care are more likely to have mental health care needs than children generally.

On the one hand, prescription of psychotropic medication for foster children may be appropriate, given their mental health needs. Still, the evidence on the safety and efficacy of psychotropics in children is limited. Congress has taken a strong interest in how states are monitoring and regulating use of these medications. Federal child welfare law requires states to have a plan for overseeing prescription drug use among children in foster care, including the use of psychotropic medications.

Some children may remain in their homes following the investigation, while some are removed from their homes into foster care. Children in foster care are placed in another setting that is designed to provide round-the-clock care (e.g., foster family home, group home, child care institution). Placement in foster care means that a judge has determined that the child's removal from his or her home was necessary because the home was \"contrary to the welfare\" of the child and, accordingly, the judge has given responsibility for the child's \"care and placement\" to the state child welfare agency. Most children enter foster care because of neglect or abuse experienced at the hands of their parents, although a child's behavior problem may also be a factor in foster care placement. This is especially true for children entering care at an older age. Foster care is intended to be a temporary placement until a child can be reunited with his or her parent(s), or when this is not possible, until a permanent placement with relatives, an adopted family, or a legal guardian can be found. While working to find them permanent homes, states must attend to the safety and well-being of children in foster care, including their physical and mental health. ", "During FY2015, some 671,000 children spent at least one day (24 hours) in foster care and 243,000 left the system, resulting in nearly 428,000 of those children remaining in care on the last day of that fiscal year. Although there is variation at the state level, the national foster care caseload has generally been in decline for more than a decade. Across the nation, there were about 77,000 fewer children in foster care on the last day of FY2015 as compared to the last day of FY2006 (when 505,000 were in care)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mental Health Needs of Children in Foster Care", "paragraphs": ["Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs than children generally. The abuse or neglect children experience before entering foster care can have serious mental health outcomes. Maltreatment by a parent or other caregiver is stressful for children and may alter how their brains develop in ways that lead them to have more difficulty regulating their emotions and interpreting cues and communication from others. This negatively affects their socialization and may result in a tendency to violence or aggression towards others, among other problem behaviors. ", "In a national survey conducted in 2008 and 2009, more than 4 in 10 (43%-46%) children (aged 18 months to 17 years) who were placed in a foster family home following an investigation of alleged child abuse and neglect in their families were found at risk of a behavioral or emotional problem and potentially in need of mental health services. Among children of that same age group who were placed in a foster care group home or institution, as many as 7 in 10 (61%-70%) were at such risk. These rates are much higher than those found in the general population. In separate surveys, about 7% to 11% of all children (in roughly the same age range) were identified as having emotional and behavioral problems.", "In recent years, children whose Medicaid eligibility is based on their \"foster care\" status have been increasingly more likely to be given mental health diagnoses. This is also true of children generally. Such diagnoses include attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Nearly all children who are in foster care are eligible for health care services funded via Medicaid, which is a means-tested entitlement program administered by the federal government in partnership with the states and authorized under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (and discussed further in the next section). From 2002 to 2007, the share of children whose Medicaid eligibility is based on their \"foster care\" status who were diagnosed with mental health disorders increased for most of these conditions. The most common diagnoses varied by age and older children were more likely to be given one of these diagnoses. In 2007, children ages 3 to 5 were most likely to have diagnoses of conduct disorder (7.4%) and attention disorders (6.7%); children ages 6 to 11 were most likely to be diagnosed with attention disorders (52.5%) and conduct disorders (26.8%); and children ages 12 to 18 years old were most likely to be diagnosed with conduct disorders (67.3%) and depression (44.4%). ", " Figure 1 (below) shows, for 2002 and 2007, rates of major mental health diagnoses by age group (6 to 11 years and 12 to 18 years) among children whose Medicaid eligibility is based on their \"foster care\" status. The figure indicates that these rates went up across all diagnoses for both age groups, except for depression among children ages 6 to 11 and schizophrenia among both age groups."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mental Health Services and Treatments for Children in Foster Care", "paragraphs": ["National standards for mental health care developed by leading child welfare and pediatric organizations propose that all children should receive a mental health screening when placed into foster care, a subsequent comprehensive mental health assessment by a mental health professional within a month of being placed into care, and a coordinated approach to delivery of services to meet the children's ongoing mental health needs. Such diagnostic and treatment services should currently be available to children in foster care through Medicaid. Under Medicaid, each state designs a plan for provision of medical assistance in its own state, including primary and acute medical services, as well as long-term care. The plan must be consistent with federal requirements and, if approved by HHS, entitles the state to federal reimbursement for a part of the cost of providing that medical assistance to each eligible individual in the state. ", "Most, if not all, children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid and are generally entitled to the same set of \"traditional\" Medicaid state plan services available to other children enrolled in a given state's Medicaid program. Central among these benefits is a provision in the law requiring that children receive all medically necessary services authorized in federal statute through the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. The EPSDT program covers health screenings and services, including assessments of each child's physical and mental health development; laboratory tests (including lead blood level assessment); appropriate immunizations; health education; and vision, dental, and hearing services. The screenings and services must be provided at regular intervals that meet \"reasonable\" medical or dental practice standards. Under EPSDT, states are required to provide treatment to meet children's identified health needs, including mental health needs. Medicaid financing may be used to provide services to meet children's behavioral health needs, including case management or services provided by psychiatrists, psychologists, or clinical social workers. It may also be used to pay for prescription drugs. ", "In general, children who have mental health challenges may benefit from health care services that could include psychosocial treatment, such as counseling and case management from mental health professionals. There is a growing body of evidence on practices for responding to mental disorders in children through the use of psychosocial treatment. For example, certain psychosocial treatment interventions (i.e., behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]; family-focused and group-based treatment; and treatments with multiple types of interventions) have been found to be moderately effective for children or parents of children with antisocial-related and disruptive behaviors. In addition, CBT\u2014such as activities that include anger management, conflict resolution, and social skills training\u2014has been found to be effective for children who experience trauma (defined as actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others). ", "A medical professional may prescribe psychotropic medications to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective or when pharmaceutical or combination treatment has been demonstrated to be more effective than psychosocial treatment. Nonetheless, psychotropics may still be prescribed without accompanying psychosocial therapies because medical professionals and other stakeholders may not have resources and support readily available to address the complex mental health needs of children in care. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the Medicaid program, has said that \"an over-reliance on medication [for children in care] may reflect a lack of timely access to effective behavioral health care for Medicaid enrollees in some states, as well as fewer evidence-based psychosocial therapies for children than for adults.\" There is not a standard for what constitutes evidence-based therapies; however, HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) has rated treatments based on the evidence of their effectiveness. ", "Analysis of data from a national survey of children who come into contact with child welfare agencies due to investigation of alleged child abuse or neglect found that children entering foster care were more likely to receive supports (i.e., mental health screening, a follow-up mental health assessment by a mental health professional, and referral to services) than were children with mental health needs who remained in their own homes following such an investigation. Similarly, research on Medicaid claims data for children in 20 states whose \"foster care\" status makes them eligible for Medicaid shows an increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions among those taking antipsychotic medication, from 58.0% to 65.5% between 2009 and 2011. This is compared to about 28.0% to 29.0% of non-foster children in Medicaid in both 2009 and 2011.", "Other studies have shown that children in foster care who need mental health services do not always receive them. A national survey that collected data between 2008 and 2010 found that among children who had been in foster care for approximately 18 months or less, and who met clinical criteria for a mental health need, 3 out of 10 did not receive any specialty mental health services (e.g., counseling or residential or outpatient treatments) or psychotropics, and 9% received psychotropics without any such services.

Children whose Medicaid eligibility is based on their foster care status have been found to receive psychotropic medication at three to nine times the rate of all other children served by Medicaid, and at a level that is somewhat comparable to (but still higher than) older children (ages 13 to 18) with a diagnosed mental disorder or neurodevelopmental disorder. At the same time, research based on a national study of the use of outpatient mental health services found that children living in non-relative foster family homes were no more likely than child-welfare involved children living in their own homes to be prescribed psychotropic medication.

Closer analysis of the differences across states led the researchers to conclude that differences in risk for mental health services was not the primary factor leading to variation, suggesting the importance of state practices in prescribing psychotropic medication. ", "A separate study of Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 showed variation in psychotropic medication use among children whose eligibility for Medicaid was based on their \"foster care\" status. The study found an initial increase in the use of psychotropic medications followed by some decline in most states. However, across this same time frame the study found an increase in the use of antipsychotic medications\u2014which are a subset of psychotropic drugs generally used to treat schizophrenia and sometimes bipolar disorder\u2014among children whose Medicaid eligibility was based on their \"foster care\" status. Specifically, it found that 45 states experienced a relative increase in the use of these medications from 2002 to 2007, two states experienced a relative decrease, and one state experienced no change over the period. In 2007, the annual rate of antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care ranged from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state.", "A more recent review examined trends in 20 states of Medicaid claims data for children whose eligibility was based on their \"foster care\" status.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined Medicaid data from 2008 to glean insight on the use of psychotropic drugs among foster children in five states. They found that in each of these states 0.3% to 2.1% of children under age 1 were prescribed psychotropics, compared to a lower rate (0.1% to 1.2%) of infants of the same age who were not in foster care. Other research found that prescribing rates for ADHD medication and antipsychotic medication increased with each year of age among children ages 3 and 6 in foster care.

Still, as mentioned previously, psychotropic medications may not be effective in treating the mental health needs of some individuals.", "Children in care may more readily receive psychotropics due to the paucity of psychosocial services available. This lack of services could be due to a number of factors, including a shortage of mental health providers generally and of those who have clinical understanding of the complex trauma many children in foster care may have experienced and/or who specialize in therapies that have proven to be effective. While the rate of prescribing psychotropics has decreased in recent years, the use of certain classes of these drugs\u2014namely antipsychotics, used for the off-label treatment of children who have bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, and used to treat certain other behavioral conditions\u2014has steadily grown.

This overall upward trend could be due to a number of factors, including more research (albeit limited) on the efficacy of these medications in children and the role of pharmaceutical companies marketing drugs to prescribers and consumers. Further, children generally have increasingly been prescribed certain psychotropic medications in recent years. ", "The use of psychotropics by children in foster care has come under growing scrutiny by policymakers and stakeholders in the child welfare field. Although there is an expanding body of research on psychotropic use among children with mental health disorders, few studies show that they are safe and effective for this population. A review by HHS of research on one class of psychotropics, antipsychotics, found that most studies had insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the safety of these drugs in addressing child mental health disorders generally\u2014 not just those occurring among foster youth . Further, little to no evidence was available for certain conditions such as disruptive behavior disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, or eating disorders (i.e., anorexia nervosa). According to the analysis, the median study duration of eight weeks was insufficient to evaluate some long-term outcomes. The analysis also found that most of the studies had a high risk of bias because missing data were not handled and reported properly, study participants were not randomly assigned to the treatment groups, and/or the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the psychotropic medication. Other research has shown that antipsychotics are associated with harmful health outcomes in some children, including high cholesterol levels, weight gain, and type-2 diabetes. ", "Despite these concerns, some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms and issues associated with mental health and behavior concerns stemming from their exposure to complex trauma, particularly if this treatment is coupled with psychosocial services. Stimulants for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common childhood disorder, appear to be among the best researched of the antipsychotic classes. Multiple studies with research methodologies that used randomized control trials have found that some stimulants are very effective at reducing the core symptoms of ADHD, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and aggression. ", "Further, children in foster care are more likely to have a mental health diagnosis than children generally, including children who are low income. A 2011 GAO report on psychotropic medication use by children in foster care cited statements from state officials and child psychiatrists that higher levels of psychotropic drug use may be appropriate to deal with the increased prevalence and greater severity of mental health conditions among this population. In addition, multiple foster care placements and inconsistent state oversight practices for managing their care may contribute to the likelihood that psychotropics are used to respond to the mental health needs of these children.

As part of the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-288 ), Congress required state child welfare agencies, as a condition of receiving certain child welfare funding, to describe how they actively consulted with physicians or other medical professionals in assessing the health and well-being of children in foster care and in determining appropriate medical treatment for them.", "The issue of oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care in particular was briefly discussed at a 2007 congressional hearing on health care oversight for children in foster care, and it was the sole topic of a 2008 hearing. Both hearings were held by the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support. Subsequently, as part of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-351 ), Congress expanded on the requirement that states consult with medical professionals on the health and well-being of children in foster care. Specifically, states are required through their child welfare and Medicaid agencies, and in consultation with appropriate medical professionals, to develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services for each child in foster care. The 2008 law directed states to ensure this coordinated strategy provided for oversight of drugs prescribed to children in foster care. In October 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act ( P.L. 112-34 ) amended this provision to further stipulate that the coordinated strategy must include protocols for use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care.", "In December 2011, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services and International Security held an oversight hearing that focused on the results and recommendations of the aforementioned study by the Government Accountability Office. GAO reviewed state policies and regulations for oversight of prescribing psychotropic medications in six states. The study compared state policies against best practice guidelines for prescribing psychotropics for foster children and other vulnerable child populations. These best practice guidelines were developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) with support and funding from HHS's SAMHSA. Overall, GAO found that each of the six state programs fell short of providing comprehensive oversight as defined by AACAP. For example, though all six states implemented some practices consistent with the guidelines for consent procedures, only one state (Texas) fully implemented these procedures. According to the report, states that do not incorporate consent procedures similar to AACAP's guidelines may increase the likelihood that caregivers are not fully aware of the risks and benefits associated with the decision to use psychotropic medications. GAO made recommendations that HHS consider endorsing guidance to state Medicaid and child welfare agencies on best practices for monitoring psychotropic medications for children in foster care. According to GAO, this recommendation was implemented (see next section on executive branch actions). ", "Witnesses at the hearing spoke about the role of HHS and the state Medicaid programs in increasing cooperation and communication between the agencies and discussed how HHS could increase the guidance on best practices to assist states in preparing plans for psychotropic medication oversight. Further, a 12-year-old former foster youth described being given multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects he experienced from multiple psychotropic medications that were prescribed to him while in foster care. He also testified that a therapist that he saw with his adoptive parents was most helpful to him. ", "Additionally, in April 2013 the Senate Finance Committee convened a roundtable discussion with Senate staff and child welfare stakeholders to address issues associated with the prescription of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and to highlight alternative strategies to effectively respond to trauma experienced by children and youth in foster care. At the roundtable, current and former foster youth shared their experiences with psychotropic medication and some noted that therapy ultimately helped them transition from psychotropic medications. The youths' stories sometimes highlighted the importance of an invested caregiver or other knowledgeable professional in ensuring that appropriate mental health treatment is identified and provided. Child welfare stakeholders discussed the prevalence of psychotropic medication use among subpopulations of youth; the role of the federal government in promoting alternatives to psychotropics; tools for determining whether youth should be prescribed medications; and the roles of schools, the mental health system, and foster parents in engaging with youth on whether psychotropic medications should be prescribed. ", "In May 2014 the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care and the efforts of states and the federal government to ensure that such medications are used appropriately. Witnesses included the Associate Commissioner of HHS's Children's Bureau; GAO; a researcher who focuses on psychotropic medication use among children in care; and Dr. Phil McGraw, who has sought to bring greater awareness to the issue. ", "At the May 2014 hearing, staff from GAO focused remarks on the agency's work from 2011 to 2014 related to psychotropic medication prescription among children in care. Following their December 2011 Senate hearing testimony and report, GAO examined prescribing rates among children in foster care in five states, including the extent to which documentation supported the use of psychotropics among a sample of 24 children in care. GAO contracted with two child psychiatrists who conduct mental health research and work on issues related to foster care to examine the sample of cases. These experts found varying quality in the documentation supporting the use of psychotropics. For example, experts found that in most cases medical pediatric exams were mostly supported by documentation; however, they found that documentation was partially supported for about half to slightly more than half of the cases examined with regard to the dosage amount of medications and concurrent use of multiple medications. GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states regarding oversight of medication to third-party managed care organizations (MCOs), which increasingly are administering Medicaid benefits (including prescription benefits) for children in foster care. As noted in the subsequent section, HHS has since issued guidance to state child welfare and Medicaid agencies on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in care. According to GAO, this guidance has not addressed the role of third-party MCOs in oversight of psychotropic use among foster children. ", "GAO subsequently issued a report in January 2017 that examined how child welfare agencies and Medicaid agencies in seven states monitor psychotropic use among children in care and the results of these state efforts. State officials reported to GAO that they developed a variety of practices to better support the appropriate mental health diagnoses and treatment for children in foster care, including initial mental health screenings and monitoring children after they are prescribed medications. For example, all seven states developed guidelines on prescribing psychotropic medications and on promoting the use of psychosocial services (e.g., requiring or recommending psychosocial services prior to or concurrently with psychotropic medication). Officials in all seven states reported that several factors\u2014strong collaboration among child welfare, Medicaid, or other partnering agencies; state outreach to stakeholders such as physicians about the requirements; and gradual rollout of new practices\u2014were critical in implementing their oversight work. ", "GAO did not examine the effectiveness of state practices, state compliance with state or federal policies, or whether there are controls in place to ensure that required practices are followed. State officials reported to GAO that they use a variety of measures to gauge the results of their efforts, including physician prescribing practices (e.g., type and amount prescribed); state oversight practices (e.g., reviewing case and health records); and monitoring child outcomes (e.g., placement disruptions for children on psychotropic medications). ", "GAO also looked into the ways that HHS has supported states in their oversight work since 2014, noting that HHS has not convened meetings with stakeholders engaged in state oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in care. (Some of these efforts are described in the next section.) GAO recommended that HHS consider cost-effective ways to convene state stakeholders to share information and collaborate on psychotropic medication oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Executive Branch Actions", "paragraphs": ["HHS has implemented the federal requirements that states have protocols in place for monitoring psychotropic medication use.

This collaborative included representatives of state child welfare, mental health, and Medicaid agencies. They worked together to define common terms and common measures on data about the utilization of psychotropic medication among foster youth, including sub-groups of foster youth. They also developed best practices in psychotropic medication oversight and monitoring, with each state establishing a set of individual goals.
