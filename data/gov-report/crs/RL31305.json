A very simple measure of the trend is to calculatetotal O&M funding per active duty troop in constant, inflation adjusted prices. Making some adjustments to reduce inconsistencies from year to year, the resultshows a very constant pattern of growth of about 2.5% per year above inflation fromthe mid-1950s on - Figure 1 illustrates the trend.", "Continuing, unabated growth in personnel and in O&M costs takes up a substantial share of projected increases in overall defense spending over the next fewyears. Table B5 shows Administration projections of defense funding byappropriations title through FY2007. Between FY2000, the last full year of theClinton Administration, and FY2007, overall national defense funding is projectedto increase by $166 billion.

A decline in new weapons purchases,said Perry in 1996, was justified in the early 1990s, first, because threats haddeclined, second, because many new weapons ordered in the 1980s had just enteredthe force, and, finally, because older weapons were retired first as the size of theforce declined, so the average age of equipment was dropping even without newacquisitions. But the holiday would have to end soon, said Perry, in order to avoidcreating an unaffordable \"bow wave\" of costs in the future to replace large numbersof rapidly aging weapons.", "At the time, the Joint Chiefs set $60 billion per year for procurement by FY1998 as the goal, a target reached in the Clinton Administration's final budget for FY2001. In the years since Perry laid out the argument, however, the debate has shifted. Nowthe issue, at least among defense advocates, is no longer whether $60 billion a yearis adequate, but rather, how much more than $60 billion is needed to meetmodernization needs. ", "Much of the discussion has been shaped by a series of studies of the amounts needed to sustain a \"steady state\" procurement rate for major weapons: i.e., howmuch is needed to replace the existing stock of weapons with more modern systemsas weapons reach the ends of their planned service lives. A study by the Center forStrategic and International Studies estimated $160 billion a year, in FY2000 prices,if strategic nuclear weapons are included in the calculus, and $110 billion a yearwithout strategic modernization. The Congressional Budget Office made its ownestimate of about $90 billion a year, and the Center for Strategic and BudgetaryAssessments said $80 billion, both also in FY2000 prices. Most recently theChairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Richard Myers, said that a Joint Staff study,not released for public review, concluded that $100-110 billion a year, in FY2001prices, is needed. (3) After adjusting for inflation, the$99 billion projected forprocurement in FY2007 does not quite reach CBO estimates of steady-stateprocurement requirements: $99 billion in FY2007 prices equals about $83 billion inFY2000 prices.", "Many members of the congressional defense committees have expressed concern that the Administration's budget plan - both in FY2003 and in future years- does not appear sufficient, despite large increases in the defense total, to financeplanned weapons procurement programs. In the FY2003 request, committeemembers have been especially critical of the shipbuilding budget, which calls forprocuring just five new ships. Assuming a 35-year service life for Navy ships, itwould take an average of 8.5 new ships per year to maintain a force of 300 ships inthe fleet. Only in the later years of the FY2003-2007 defense plan does theshipbuilding rate reach the nominal \"steady-state\" replacement rate. Some argue thathelicopters, munitions, and other programs are inadequately funded as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Procurement \"Bow Wave\"", "paragraphs": ["Most recently there have been reports that DOD has been discussing how to cope with a substantial \"bow wave\" of procurement costs in FY2007 and beyond. Analytically, a \"bow wave\" refers to the normal pattern of funding for weaponsprograms. The annual budget for any major acquisition program tends to grow as asystem moves from technology development to full scale engineering developmentto production. Then the acquisition cost will decline again as production windsdown. Thus the shape of a bow wave. A very large cumulative bow wave candevelop if many new systems are scheduled to begin full production at about thesame time.", "This situation now appears to be facing the Defense Department at the end of the decade, when a number of new systems will be in production, including the F-22and F-35 (Joint Strike Fighter) aircraft, the Comanche helicopter, and several newNavy ships. According to numerous press accounts, the Defense Department hasbeen considering how to cope with the substantial projected shortfalls in procurementfunding. The Navy, reportedly, is proposing to cut back substantially on plannedprocurement of F-35 fighters, and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld is reportedlyconsidering terminating several weapons programs - perhaps some in addition to theCrusader self-propelled artillery system - in order to safeguard future funds for more\"transformational\" weapons (see below)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defense Transformation", "paragraphs": ["During the presidential election campaign, then-candidate George Bush strongly endorsed the notion of a defense transformation to meet the needs of a dramaticallynew security environment.

Second, to deny enemy sanctuary, depriving them of the ability to run orhide, any time, any where. Third, to project and sustain forces in distant theaters inthe face of access denial threats. Fourth, to conduct effective operations in space.Fifth, to conduct effective information operations.
