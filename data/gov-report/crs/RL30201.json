Just over three-fourths($46.57 billion) of the total amount in the act is classified as mandatory spending (primarily foodstamps and farm programs funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation), which inessence is governed by authorizing statutes and is out of the direct control of appropriators.

The CCC is the fundingmechanism for the commodity support programs and farm disaster assistance. It borrows directlyfrom the Treasury and subsequently requests an appropriation for a reimbursement of its net losses.

Supplementalappropriations generally are made if and when these estimates fall short of requiredspending. An annual appropriation is also made to reimburse the Commodity CreditCorporation for losses it incurs in financing the commodity support programs and thevarious other programs it finances. Historically, the farm commodity supportprograms were a larger portion of the USDA budget than they are currently. Spending levels among these programs were erratic and unpredictable, making totalUSDA spending highly variable. Some of this unpredictability was lessened by theenactment of the 1996 farm bill, which fixes the level of spending on direct paymentsto program crop producers, and no longer ties these payments to market conditions. However, emergency provisions in both the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act( P.L.105-277 ) and the FY2000 agriculture appropriations act ( P.L. 106-78 ) made available a total of $14.6 billion in additional funding to farmers to help them recover fromlow commodity price and natural disasters.

This included funding for the food stamp program, thelargest of all food assistance programs, for meal programs in schools and child caringfacilities (e.g. school lunch and breakfast, child care food and summer food, andspecial milk programs), and for supplemental feeding programs for low-incomewomen, infants, and children (WIC). It also covered spending for commodityassistance programs serving the elderly, needy, and homeless, and the costs of federalsalaries and expenses and program administration. The FY2000 agricultureappropriations act ( P.L. 106-78 ) provides $35.04 billion for food and nutritionprograms, or $6.3 billion less than the Administration request. This is $227 millionmore than the $34.8 appropriated for these programs for FY1999. The amount in P.L.106-78 is lower than both the House and Senate level primarily because of a\"downward re-estimate\" of required funding for the food stamp program. ", "Most of the $6.3 billion differences between the Administration request andwhat is provided in P.L. 106-78 is related to the congressional rejection of the $4.8billion in advance funds requested by the Administration for the food stamp programfor FY2001 (in case appropriations are not enacted prior to the beginning of thatyear), and a $100 million contingency reserve fund for food stamps in P.L. 106-78 , instead of the $1 billion reserve fund requested by the Administration.", "For the food stamp and related programs , the Administration budget proposed $27.3 billion; the House- and Senate-passed bills recommended $21.6 billion. P.L.106-78 provides: (1) $19.6 billion for food stamp expenses, which is $500 millionbelow the original request, and reflects a re-estimate of the needs of the program; (2)$100 million for the food stamp contingency reserve, instead of the $1 billionproposed by the Administration; (3) no advance funding for FY2001 (compared with$4.8 billion proposed by the Administration); and (4) $1.27 billion, the same as theAdministration and the House and Senate bills for Nutrition Assistance for PuertoRico. P.L. 106-78 allows $98 million to be spent on Emergency Food AssistanceProgram mandatory commodities, splitting the difference between the $97 millionin the House bill and $99 million in the Senate bill. Conferees deleted Senatelanguage that would have required the Economic Research Service to conduct a studywithin 6 months of enactment on the reasons for the decline in food stampparticipation, and to identify any obstacles that households with eligible children have experienced in obtaining food stamps. ", "No major policy changes were proposed by the Administration for child nutrition programs (including the school lunch, breakfast, child and adult care,summer and special milk programs). P.L. 106-78 provides $9.554 billion for theseprograms, close to the Administration request for $9.565 billion. Over 90% of theappropriated funds are expected to be used to fund the school lunch program ($5.48billion), the school breakfast program ($1.42 billion) and the child and adult carefood program ($1.76 billion). The level in P.L. 106-78 for child nutrition programs($9.56 billion) is about $377 million more than projected FY1999 spending for theseprograms, and is $6 million less than was recommended by the Senate appropriationsbill and $7 million more than the House appropriation measure. The difference is theresult of the decision to provide $7 million for the school breakfast pilot project,instead of nothing proposed by the House, and $13 million proposed by the Senate.", "P.L. 106-78 also continues language (originally added in FY1999 appropriations) requiring the USDA to use so-called \"bonus commodities\" (6) to helpmake up the difference between the per meal commodity assistance rate mandatedfor school lunches, and the requirement that not less than 12% of federal schoollunch assistance be in the form of commodities. For several years, the per lunchcommodity reimbursement did not total to an amount equal to 12% of federal schoollunch aid, and the USDA had to use child nutrition funds to buy commodities tomake up the difference. Last year, the Congress added a provision to FY1999agriculture appropriations law requiring the Secretary to use \"bonus commodities\"when necessary to meet the 12% requirement. This resulted in savings for the USDA(projected at $40 million) because they could use commodities already acquired forfarm support or surplus removal reasons to meet this obligation. (7) House and Senatenegotiators trying to forge an acceptable budget package that merges the severalremaining FY2000 appropriations bills reportedly have agreed to make permanentthe \"12% solution\" so they can use the $55 million in savings to offset some of thenew spending in the consolidated budget package.

P.L. 106-78 funds WIC at $ 4.032 billion, which is $108 million more than the amount providedin FY1999, and $73.5 million less than the Administration request. TheSenate-passed bill would have funded WIC at $4.038 billion, or about $33 millionmore than the House bill. Responding to renewed pressure to permit natural sugarcontained in fruits to be exempted from the sugar limits established for cerealsapproved for WIC program use, the conference report to P.L. 106-78 containslanguage directing that USDA make no exception to the current sugar limit. Neitherthe House nor Senate bills approved the Administration request to fund the Farmers'Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) from Commodity Assistance Program (CAP)funds instead of WIC funds, and continue to require that $10 million of WIC fundingbe used within 45 days of enactment for the FMNP. The FMNP provides WICparticipants in some areas with vouchers to buy fresh foods at farmers markets. TheHouse and Senate bills assumed that there will be $125 million in unexpended, orcarryover funds from FY1999 available for the program in FY2000, and that this,together with the appropriated funds will be sufficient to maintain a monthly averageWIC caseload of 7.4 million participants.", "The Administration proposed to fund Commodity Assistance Programs (CAPs) at a total of $155.2 million for FY2000, $20 million of which was to go for theFMNP (described above). The remainder would have provided $90.2 million for thecommodity supplemental food program (CSFP), $4.2 million more than the FY1999appropriation, and $45 million for state administrative grants for the emergency foodassistance program (EFAP), the same amount as in FY1999. P.L. 106-78 adopted$133.3 million in spending for CAPs for FY2000, $2.3 million more than FY1999funding, and $2 million less than that requested for these programs by theAdministration. The House originally approved version of the bill included a totalof $151 million for CAPs, $20 million more than FY1999 spending; theSenate-passed bill provided $131 million for CAPs, $20 million less than the House.As mentioned above, neither chamber approved funding WIC farmers marketcoupons under this budget category.", "Food donations programs for selected groups (the elderly and needy families) would receive $151.1 million in FY2000 under the Administration proposal, $10million more than was provided in FY1999.
