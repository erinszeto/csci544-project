Over the last three decades, many\u2014but not all\u2014of the major issues causing tension between the two nations have been resolved.", "One major legacy of the Vietnam War that remains unresolved is the damage that Agent Orange, and its accompanying dioxin, have done to the people and the environment of Vietnam. For the last 35 years, this issue has generally been pushed to the background of bilateral discussions by other issues considered more important by the United States and/or Vietnam. With most of those issues presently resolved, the issue of Agent Orange/dioxin has emerged as a regular topic in bilateral discussions.", "In the last few years, the United States has shown a greater willingness to fund environmental remediation activities in Vietnam. Since 2007, Congress has appropriated $59.5 million for dioxin removal and related health care activities in Vietnam. In 2012, the Senate has proposed providing an additional $20 million in the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2013 (S. 3241), but the House of Representatives has not included dioxin remediation funding in its corresponding appropriations bill, H.R. 5857. The Vietnamese government and people would like to see the United States do more to provide help for victims of Agent Orange, as well as assist with the cleanup of other Agent Orange \"hot spots.\"", "According to various estimates, the U.S. military sprayed approximately 11 million-12 million gallons of Agent Orange over nearly 10% of then-South Vietnam between 1961 and 1971. One scientific study estimated that between 2.1 million and 4.8 million Vietnamese were directly exposed to Agent Orange. Vietnamese advocacy groups claim that there are over 3 million Vietnamese suffering from health problems caused by exposure to the dioxin in Agent Orange.", "The people of Vietnam have become increasingly concerned about the issue of Agent Orange. Various non-government organizations are placing more pressure on the Vietnamese government to remove the dioxin from the environment and provide better care to the people exposed to Agent Orange. Some government ministries are comparatively sympathetic to the public concern about Agent Orange, but other ministries are apprehensive that highlighting the dangers of dioxin could have undesired consequences for bilateral relations or for Vietnam's economy.", "This report examines various estimates of the effects of Agent Orange on Vietnam's people and environment, the history of U.S. policy on the issue, the current cleanup efforts in Vietnam, the various forms of assistance\u2014including U.S. governmental assistance\u2014provided to people with medical conditions associated with dioxin exposure, and the implications for bilateral relations. It concludes with a brief discussion of possible congressional responses to the issue.", "This report will be updated as conditions warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Since the mid-1990s, bilateral relations between the United States and Vietnam have become virtually normalized. The United States has granted Vietnam permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status and Vietnam has become a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO)\u2014two major objectives of the Vietnamese government following the end of the Vietnam War. As part of the bilateral agreements related to PNTR and WTO membership, Vietnam has made a number of significant changes in its trade policies, and has increased its efforts to help the United States recover the remains of U.S. soldiers and civilians who died during the Vietnam War. The two nations also have expanded their nascent cooperation on strategic and military issues to the point that Vietnam has emerged as an important partner for the United States on many issues in Asia. ", "Although the United States remains concerned about human rights in Vietnam, tensions between the two nations are comparatively low. However, inside Vietnam, there is a long-standing issue that could continue to cause friction in the future\u2014the condition of Vietnamese people affected by Agent Orange and its unintended byproduct, the dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD. Agent Orange was one of several herbicides that the U.S. military used widely in southern Vietnam during the Vietnam War. According to U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam David Shear, \"Agent Orange remains among the most sensitive issues in U.S.-Vietnam relations.\"", "Over the last decade, there has been a groundswell of concern among the Vietnamese people about the continuing problems of environmental damage and illnesses associated with Agent Orange. Some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Vietnam are seeking compensation or assistance from the U.S. government and the manufacturers of Agent Orange. Partially in response to this rising tide of popular concern, the Vietnamese government has raised the profile of this issue in various bilateral fora with U.S. officials, including the June 2008 summit between President Bush and Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.", "Vietnam's government is divided on the issue of whether to seek greater U.S. assistance with the Agent Orange/dioxin issue. Vietnam's Ministry of Defense (MOD) and various veterans groups are among the more vocal advocates of seeking more U.S. assistance. Similarly, the Ministry of Health (MOH); the Ministry of Labour, War Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA); and the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment (MONRE) would like to see the United States increase its assistance. However, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) is concerned that by drawing attention to the continued pervasive presence of dioxin in the Vietnam's environment, other nations may restrict or prohibit the import of Vietnamese crops, aquatic products, meats and poultry, and processed foods supposedly for health reasons. Some officials in Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) are also apprehensive that greater pressure on the United States on the Agent Orange/dioxin issue may have an adverse impact on other important bilateral issues, such as Vietnam's application to the U.S. Generalized System of Preference program or the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations.", "According to one Vietnamese estimate, there are up to 5 million Vietnamese spanning three generations who have medical conditions that are purported to be related to exposure to Agent Orange and similar herbicides\u2014and more importantly, their accompanying dioxin\u2014that the U.S. military sprayed across much of South Vietnam as part of Operation Ranch Hand. The Vietnamese government and various Vietnamese interest groups have long sought U.S. assistance with the cleanup of the residual dioxin in Vietnam, as well as financial support to provide medical treatment to people exposed to Agent Orange. The official U.S. response to date has been to deny any legal liability and to contest that the medical conditions are related to exposure to Agent Orange and dioxin. The Vietnamese government and people have objected to these denials given the level of support provided to U.S. veterans who were presumably exposed to Agent Orange and the extensive cleanup efforts made at Love Canal, Times Beach, and other U.S. locations found to have elevated levels of dioxin in the soil.", "In the waning months of the George W. Bush Administration, there were some indications that the United States was becoming more flexible on this issue\u2014just as the issue has risen in importance in Vietnam. For example, following President Bush's November 2006 meeting with President Nguyen Minh Triet, the two governments issued a joint statement that included the sentence, \"The United States and Vietnam also agreed that further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage facilities would make a valuable contribution to the continued development of their bilateral relations.\" The joint statement also indicated that \"President Triet also expressed appreciation for the U.S. Government's increasing development assistance to Vietnam and urged the U.S. side to increase humanitarian assistance including through cooperation on areas such as unexploded ordinance and continued assistance to Vietnamese with disabilities.\"", "In addition, Congress has demonstrated a willingness to provide assistance for both the dioxin cleanup and humanitarian support for Vietnamese believed to be affected by exposure to dioxin. In May 2007, the 110 th Congress appropriated $3 million to the State Department for the cleanup of dioxin in and around an ex-military base in Da Nang used as a distribution center for Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Some of the funds were to be used to provide medical care for residents near the ex-military base. The 111 th Congress appropriated $3 million in FY2009 and an additional $15 million in FY2010 for the cleanup and related health activities in Da Nang. In April 2011, the 112 th Congress appropriated $18.5 million as part of Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 ( P.L. 112-10 ) for Agent Orange/dioxin remediation and related health activities in Vietnam, and an additional $20.0 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ). Additional legislation has been introduced in 112 th Congress that would appropriate funds for Agent Orange/dioxin remediation and related health activities in Vietnam (see \" Issues and Options for Congress \").", "Some Members of Congress have also stated that the United States has a \"moral obligation\" to the people of Vietnam\u2014many of whom were either allies at the time or were innocent civilians\u2014to help address the perceived environmental and health problems created by the use of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. In April 2008, Senator John McCain said in regards to the Agent Orange/dioxin issue, \"I believe it remains an irritant, and perhaps more than that, for some of the people of Vietnam. I think we need to continue to address the issue both in compensation for the victims as well as cleanup of areas that are clearly contaminated.\"", "Although both sides appear to be willing to discuss the issue, the legacy of Agent Orange has the potential to adversely affect U.S.-Vietnamese relations in the future. With other key issues apparently resolved, Agent Orange has emerged as one of Vietnam's top concerns. However, Vietnam's interest in forming closer economic ties with the United States\u2014such as its formal request for inclusion in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and the ongoing negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement \u2014may once again push the Agent Orange issue into the background.", "For the United States, the recent growth in bilateral trade and U.S. investment in Vietnam is providing a strong incentive to improve relations with its former enemy. According to many U.S. manufacturers, Vietnam is one of the more attractive alternative sources to China for a variety of imported products. Also, some analysts think that friendly relations with Vietnam offer a strategic counterbalance to the growth of Chinese influence in Asia. In addition, greater assistance with the cleanup of dioxin in Vietnam and/or aid in providing medical care for dioxin victims may enhance the image of the United States in Southeast Asia, as well as improve Vietnam's public environmental management and health systems. Some observers assert that if the United States continues to deny the legitimacy of Vietnam's environmental and health claims\u2014and the responsibility to help ameliorate the damage caused by Agent Orange/dioxin\u2014it risks causing harm to its relations with Vietnam, and possibly weakening U.S. soft power in Asia."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Brief History of Post-War U.S.-Vietnam Relations and the Agent Orange Issue", "paragraphs": ["From 1975 to about 2000, although the Agent Orange issue was on Vietnam's agenda, it was generally pushed into the background. There are many reasons for this, including Vietnam's desire for greater trade opportunities with the United States, the U.S. desire for a more complete accounting for U.S. soldiers still listed as \"missing in action\" (MIA) in Vietnam, Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978, and the rising tide of Vietnamese \"boat people.\"", "In 1975, following North Vietnam's victory over South Vietnam, President Gerald Ford severed diplomatic relations and imposed a trade embargo on Vietnam. Although Vietnam sought to normalize relations, it was predicated on the United States honoring President Richard Nixon's \"secret promise\" of $3.25 billion in reconstruction assistance, which the United States was unwilling to do. Although President Jimmy Carter signaled a willingness to discuss normalization soon after his inauguration, the emotional issue of U.S. prisoners of war/missing in action (POW/MIAs), the migration of Vietnam's so-called \"boat people,\" Vietnam's 1978 invasion of Cambodia (known at that time as Democratic Kampuchea), and Vietnam's border conflict with China made any significant warming of relations politically impossible. U.S.-Vietnamese relations became even more frosty following the signing of a mutual defense treaty between Vietnam and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) on November 3, 1978. These circumstances pushed the issue of Agent Orange effectively off the bilateral agenda despite Vietnamese efforts to raise the subject.", "President Ronald Reagan was generally opposed to any move towards normalizing relations with Vietnam so long as Vietnamese forces remained in Cambodia and the Vietnamese government had not provided a \"full accounting\" of U.S. POW/MIAs. In addition, the Reagan Administration, which repeatedly expressed a skepticism about U.S. veterans claiming medical problems related to Agent Orange exposure, was generally unwilling to discuss the issue of Vietnamese nationals with similar medical conditions supposedly caused by Agent Orange exposure.", "Following Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia in 1989, President George H. W. Bush reopened communication with Vietnam. In April 1991, President Bush announced a U.S. \"roadmap\" for normalization of relations that included greater cooperation in locating and returning the remains of approximately 2,200 U.S. soldiers and civilians who were still unaccounted for at that time. Vietnam responded by allowing the United States to open an MIA office in Hanoi and offering greater cooperation and assistance in locating the remains of U.S. personnel. On February 6, 1991, President Bush said,", "I am pleased today to sign into law H.R. 556 [ P.L. 102-4 ], the \"Agent Orange Act of 1991.\" This legislation relies on science to settle the troubling questions concerning the effect on veterans of exposure to herbicides\u2014such as Agent Orange\u2014used during the Vietnam era.", "However, President Bush's approval of assistance for U.S. veterans exposed to Agent Orange did not extend to Vietnamese veterans and civilians; Vietnamese efforts to discuss the issue were generally rebuffed by the United States.", "President William Clinton built on the general thaw in bilateral relations by signaling the end of U.S. opposition to Vietnam receiving international financial assistance. On February 3, 1994, President Clinton announced the end of the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam. In April 1994, Congress passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 ( P.L. 103 - 236 ) that expressed the Senate's support for the normalization of relations with Vietnam. Despite some congressional efforts to tie normalization to the POW/MIA issue, President Clinton continued to advance U.S. relations with Vietnam by appointing the first post-war ambassador to Vietnam in 1996 and signing the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement (BTA) in 2000.", "Towards the end of the Clinton Administration, the United States signaled an increased willingness to address the Agent Orange issue. In March 2000, then Defense Secretary William Cohen pledged greater U.S. cooperation with Vietnam's Agent Orange problems during a trip to Hanoi. Eight months later, during President Clinton's five-day trip to Vietnam, the United States and Vietnam agreed to set up a joint research study on the effects of dioxin/Agent Orange. In March 2002, the United States and Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that specified future collaborative research on the human health and environmental effects of Agent Orange and dioxin, as well as created a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) to oversee such collaboration. ", "However, there continued to be clear limits on U.S. willingness to provide assistance. In August 2000, then U.S. Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Gary Vest traveled to Hanoi for bilateral meetings on environmental security, which included discussions of the Agent Orange issue. Following those meetings, Vest stated, \"It is very important to emphasize we were not here to discuss a U.S. government cleanup of contamination.\" Vest went on to explain that it was his understanding that under current international and U.S. law the U.S. military could only undertake contamination cleanup activities outside of the United States if there is a clear liability under an international agreement or if specifically authorized by Congress.", "Progress towards the resumption of normal bilateral relations continued during the Bush Administration. Congress ratified the U.S.-Vietnam BTA in October 2001; the new agreement went into effect on December 10, 2001. Under the BTA, the United States granted Vietnam conditional normal trade relations (NTR). Vietnam's conditional NTR status was renewed every year until December 2006, when Congress passed P.L. 109 - 432 , a comprehensive trade and tax bill, that granted Vietnam permanent NTR status as part of a wider agreement that saw Vietnam become a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on January 11, 2007.", "Following the lifting of the trade embargo and the granting of NTR status, U.S. trade with Vietnam grew rapidly (see Figure 1 ). In addition, a rising number of U.S. companies invested in manufacturing facilities in Vietnam. Between 2001 and 2011, total bilateral trade between the two nations rose from $1.5 billion to $21.8 billion, according to official U.S. trade statistics.", "Relations between Vietnam and the United States have also improved on matters of national security. In 2005, the United States and Vietnam signed an international military education training (IMET) agreement. Since then, a number of Vietnamese military officials have participated in training programs in the United States, and U.S. naval vessels have been allowed to make port of call visits to Vietnam. In August 2010, the two nations conducted week-long joint naval exercises in the South China Sea, as part of the celebration of 15 years of renewed diplomatic relations. Joint naval exercises were held again in July 2011 and April 2012, off the coast of Da Nang. ", "Despite the general improvement in bilateral relations during the Bush Administration, the joint U.S.-Vietnamese studies of the effects of Agent Orange on Vietnam fell apart among claims of failure to act in good faith by both parties. In a \"sensitive\" (but not classified) dispatch of February 16, 2003, from the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi to the Secretary of State, a State Department official wrote that the Vietnamese government was unwilling to accept internationally recognized scientific methods because the results may not support their claims of widespread environmental damage and severe health effects. The Vietnamese government claimed that U.S. officials were instructed to prevent the completion of the exposure studies by senior government officials. In March 2005, the United States unilaterally terminated the research project.", "Moreover, the Bush Administration was reluctant to provide direct assistance to people with health problems related to exposure to dioxin. During an April 2006 trip to Vietnam, then U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Nicholson was pressed by Vietnamese journalists to explain why the United States offered compensation to U.S. Vietnam veterans with Agent Orange-related medical conditions, but not to Vietnamese veterans and civilians. In June 2006, then U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reportedly stated that the United States would not compensate supposed Vietnamese Agent Orange victims, but would be willing to provide scientific information and technical advice on the effects of dioxin.", "There have been modest efforts to revitalize joint research on Agent Orange exposure and the effect of dioxin on the people of Vietnam. These studies frequently involve non-government organizations (NGOs) in addition to agencies from both the U.S. and Vietnamese governments. In general, the participation of the NGOs has been welcomed by both the U.S. and Vietnamese government. The first meeting of the Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) on Agent Orange and dioxin was held on June 5 and 6, 2006\u2014more than four years after its creation. Since then, the JAC has met every year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Since the resumption of diplomatic relations, the U.S. government has maintained a comparatively consistent policy on the issue of Agent Orange/dioxin contamination in Vietnam.

On the other hand, the U.S. government has repeatedly reiterated that it \"does not recognize any legal liability for damages alleged to be related to Agent Orange.\" In addition, the U.S. government has continually questioned the credibility of Vietnam's evidence that the dioxin contained in Agent Orange and other herbicides sprayed during the war are responsible for the various illnesses, health problems, and birth defects prevalent in the Vietnamese population. For example, then U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Michael W. Marine responded to a question regarding U.S. assistance to \"Agent Orange victims,\" by saying, \"But honestly, I cannot say whether or not I have myself seen a victim of Agent Orange. The reason for that is that we still lack good scientific definitions of the causes of disabilities \u2026 that have occurred in Vietnam\u2026. We just don't have the scientific evidence to make that statement with certainty.\"", "As a result, the United States government has demonstrated a willingness to participate in programs designed to assess, contain, and clean up dioxin found in Vietnam's physical environment.

Similarly, both the South Vietnamese and North Vietnamese governments were not keeping detailed troop deployment information in anticipation of future claims of health problems associated with exposure to Agent Orange and dioxin. In addition, after the war ended, many Vietnamese combatants returned to their home towns, far away from the jungles where they once were sprayed with herbicides from U.S. military aircraft.", "Given that direct information about Agent Orange exposure is not available, the alternative generally used has been to seek indirect evidence of dioxin exposure.

At the same time, blood and tissue samples can be taken from Vietnamese nationals across the country to determine how much dioxin is present in their systems.

Some locations were sprayed repeatedly; other locations only once. Second, millions of Vietnamese were directly exposed to dioxin at the time the herbicides were sprayed, and millions more have been exposed to dioxin that remains in the soil and in the sediment of waterways of southern Vietnam. Third, blood and tissue studies of Vietnamese nationals provide some evidence of higher than normal levels of dioxin in the systems of people presumed to be have been exposed to Agent Orange, but methodological problems make interpretation of the data difficult and open to debate.
