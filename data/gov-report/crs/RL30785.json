Three were associated with the cash welfare system, then Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). At that time, families on AFDC were entitled to free child care. In addition, families who had left the AFDC rolls with employment were entitled to 12 months of \"transitional\" subsidized child care. The third AFDC-related child care program targeted families who, without a child care subsidy, would be \"at risk\" of qualifying for AFDC. These three programs operated under three separate sets of rules, and targeted three separate populations. Critics argued that mothers navigating their way through the welfare system faced unnecessary complexity that could be alleviated with a more unified child care program. ", "All three of the AFDC-related child care programs were funded with mandatory money, and fell under the same congressional committee jurisdiction (the Ways and Means Committee in the House, and the Finance Committee in the Senate). AFDC Child Care and Transitional Child Care were both open-ended federal entitlements (i.e., there was no limit on program funding), with the federal share of payments to states based on the state's Medicaid matching rate. The AFDC At-Risk program, on the other hand, was not open-ended, but was instead authorized as a \"capped entitlement\" to the states at an annual level of $300 million. ", "The fourth pre-1996 child care program for low-income families was the CCDBG. Established in the CCDBG Act of 1990 (a component of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, P.L. 101-508 ), the CCDBG was designed to support child care for low-income families who were not connected to the AFDC welfare system. The CCDBG subsidized child care for children under age 13 whose working family income did not exceed 75% of state median income (SMI), adjusted for family size. In addition, it provided funds for activities to improve the overall quality and supply of child care. Unlike the AFDC-related programs, the CCDBG was funded with discretionary funds appropriated as part of the annual appropriations process. Authorizing legislation fell under the jurisdiction of the Education and Labor Committee in the House (later renamed the Committee on Education and the Workforce) and the Labor and Human Resources Committee in the Senate (later renamed the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions).

Like the earlier three programs, this new block of funding was largely targeted toward families on, leaving, or at risk of receiving welfare (now Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF). However, unlike the three AFDC-related child care programs, each of which was administered under its own set of rules, the 1996 law instructed that the new mandatory funding be transferred to each state's lead agency managing the CCDBG, and be administered according to CCDBG rules. The law authorized and appropriated funding for the new mandatory child care program through FY2002.

As a component of welfare reform, the child care provisions were intended to support the overall goal of promoting self-sufficiency through work. However, separate from the context of welfare reform, the legislation attempted to address concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of child care programs. The previous four separate child care programs (the original CCDBG and the three AFDC programs) had different rules regarding eligibility, time limits on the receipt of assistance, and work requirements.

The Secretary may approve the request after a determination that adequate facilities are not otherwise available and that the lack of such facilities will inhibit the operation of child care programs in the future.

These systems are designed to assess, report, and improve the quality of early childhood programs. A QRIS can be used to rate providers against a set of measures selected to determine program quality. Data collected by a QRIS may be used to hold programs accountable for the quality of care they provide, to target technical assistance to programs in need of support, and to increase parental understanding of the quality of different child care programs. These systems often use simple three- or four-star rating scales to denote program quality on specific measures, such as child/staff ratios and staff credentials.", "While the key components (and benchmarks) of quality measured by QRIS can vary across states, five common elements of these systems include the following:", "Standards: Research-based indicators of quality in early childhood settings (e.g., health and safety requirements, staff qualifications, staff-child ratios). Standards are often linked to licensing and accreditation requirements. Accountability: Regular inspections are usually completed by trained observers. Research-based assessments such as an Environment Rating Scale (ERS) and the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) may be used. Program Support: Providers may receive training, mentoring, or other forms of technical and financial assistance to encourage providers to participate in the rating system and to help their programs achieve higher levels of quality. Parent Education: Systems typically use simple rating scales (e.g., three- or four-star scales or a point-based scale) that are easily understood by parents seeking information on the quality of child care programs in their communities. Incentives: Financial incentives may be used to encourage providers to achieve higher levels of quality. These may include tiered subsidy reimbursement (i.e., paying a higher reimbursement rate to providers meeting higher standards of care), professional development grants to increase staff training and qualifications, and tax credits for parents who enroll children in rated programs.
