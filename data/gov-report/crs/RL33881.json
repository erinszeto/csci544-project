The CSE program is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and is funded by general revenues. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and nine tribal nations operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds. In FY2005, the CSE program collected $23 billion in child support on behalf of more than 17 million children. The CSE program is intended to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on a consistent and continuing basis.", "Although the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (enacted February 8, 2006) included significant changes to the CSE program, it did not include many of the child support provisions that had been considered during the preceding four-year debate within the context of welfare reauthorization. This report discusses 12 such provisions that were passed by either the House or the Senate Finance Committee (or both). The Administration has included several of these provisions in its FY2008 budget. Of the 12 provisions, five aimed at enhancing CSE collection tools would have (1) eased the collection of child support from veterans' disability compensation benefits; (2) facilitated the collection of child support from Social Security benefits; (3) allowed the HHS Secretary to act on behalf of states to seize financial assets (held by a multi-state financial institution) of noncustodial parents who owed child support; (4) facilitated the collection of child support from longshore and harbor workers' compensation; and (5) required states to adopt a later version of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) so as to facilitate the collection of child support payments in interstate cases.", "Other provisions included an array of measures aimed at making the CSE program more efficient and effective. The provisions would have (1) required the HHS Secretary to submit a report to Congress on the problems of undistributed child support collections; (2) designated Indian tribes and tribal organizations as persons authorized to have access to information in the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS); (3) changed the language of current law to require the Secretary of Education to reimburse the HHS Secretary for any costs incurred by the HHS Secretary in providing requested information on new hires (from the National Directory of New Hires, which is part of the FPLS) to help the Education Secretary locate persons who had defaulted on student loans; (4) increased federal funding for the CSE access and visitation program; (5) prohibited states from collecting child support from noncustodial fathers to repay Medicaid costs associated with the birth of a child; and (6) required each health care plan administrator to notify the state CSE agency when a child has lost health care coverage. The final provision discussed in this report would have gradually reduced the federal matching rate for CSE expenditures, from 66% to 50%.

All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and nine tribal nations operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds.", "When the CSE program was first enacted in 1975, one of its primary goals was to recover the costs (of federal and state governments) of providing cash welfare to families with children. Over the years, the CSE program has evolved into a multifaceted program. While cost-recovery still remains an important function of the program, other aspects of the program include service delivery and promotion of self-sufficiency and parental responsibility. In FY2005, the CSE program collected $23 billion in child support on behalf of more than 17 million children, of which $21 billion went to families and $2 billion was retained by the states and federal government as recovered welfare costs. The CSE program is intended to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on a consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain self-sufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite CSE services. In FY2004, more than 331,000 families were able to end their enrollment in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program due to receipt of child support payments according to the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE).", "Although the CSE program generally garners bipartisan support, for most of its history changes to the program have been achieved in tandem with more controversial changes to other social programs. This was illustrated in the 1996 welfare reform law. P.L. 104-193 , the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, was a major piece of social legislation, most known for ending the cash welfare entitlement for needy families with children, creating the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, setting a five-year time limit on aid, and requiring more work from welfare recipients. In addition to making changes to a number of other social programs, the 1996 welfare reform law included over 40 provisions that made significant changes to the CSE program.", "The original funding authority for TANF and mandatory child care provided in the 1996 welfare law expired at the end of FY2002 (September 30, 2002). President Bush submitted his welfare reauthorization proposals to Congress in February 2002. Many policymakers and child support advocates maintained at the start of the welfare reauthorization debates that child support should be included in the discussions in light of the key role that child support plays in promoting self-sufficiency. Though Congress debated welfare legislation throughout the four years 2002 through 2005, it did not pass comprehensive welfare reauthorization legislation (the major areas of contention were work requirements and child care funding, not the proposed CSE changes ). However, a scaled-back version of welfare reauthorization legislation was ultimately included in broader budget spending reconciliation legislation, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 ).", "P.L. 109-171 was signed into law on February 8, 2006. The act, among other things, extended funding for the basic TANF block grant through FY2010, increased the percentage of TANF families that are required to participate in work or work activities, increased funding for child care, established healthy marriage promotion grants and responsible fatherhood initiatives, and revised the CSE program.", "Although P.L. 109-171 included significant changes to the CSE program, it did not include many of the child support provisions discussed and considered within the four-year welfare reauthorization debate.

Although few of the provisions elicited controversy, they were not included in P.L. 109-171 or any other federal law. Because the welfare and child support provisions were included in budget reconciliation legislation, there was concern that some provisions would be struck during the Senate's consideration of the bill due to the Byrd rule.

Income withholding continues to be the most effective method of collecting child support. In FY2005, income withholding accounted for 69% of total child support collections.

Whereas most government payments are subject to being automatically withheld to pay child support, veterans' disability compensation is not subject to intercept. Thus, in general, veterans' disability compensation benefits are exempt from being considered moneys paid or payable to an individual (based on remuneration from pay) for purposes of paying child support or alimony. Prior to 2004, there was one exception to this rule. The exception occurred when a disabled veteran elected to forego some of his or her retirement pay in order to collect additional disability payments. In other words, if a disabled veteran accepted disability compensation instead of retirement pay, he or she was subject to having his or her disability benefits offset to meet child support obligations.", "P.L. 108-136 , enacted November 24, 2003, enables veterans to receive both military retired pay and veterans' disability compensation. P.L. 108-136 eliminated the need to forego retirement pay for disability compensation payments.", "Given that veterans' disability compensation is not subject to intercept, several House and Senate bills included a provision that would have allowed veterans' disability compensation benefits to be intercepted (withheld) and paid on a routine basis to the custodial parent. The proposed provision would have made all veterans' income subject to income withholding for child support obligations.", "Supporters of the provision maintain that the provision would provide more child support collections to families of disabled veterans and make the treatment of veterans' disability payments more consistent with other forms of government payment with regard to obtaining child support obligations. Opponents of the provision contend that Congress should stand by its long history of protecting the payments made to disabled veterans from garnishment or other legal claims. They argue that the federal government should put protections in place so that veterans' disability compensation payments will not be diverted from the children to others (e.g., former spouses) who need them less than the disabled veteran."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Federal Debt Collection Practices", "paragraphs": ["Federal law (the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996\u2014 P.L. 104-134 ) stipulates that the Treasury Department has the authority to compare the names and taxpayer identifying numbers of debtors with the names and taxpayer identifying numbers of recipients of federal payments. The Department of the Treasury (or other designated federal disbursing agency) has the authority to offset Social Security benefits, certain Black Lung Board benefits, and certain Railroad Retirement benefits to collect delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States (if the debt is more than 180 days past-due), subject to an annual $9,000 ($750 per month) exemption. The law only applies to federal debts such as student loans, housing loans, and small business loans. It does not apply to a debt owed to a state. Thus, the law prohibits the offset of federal benefit payments to collect delinquent state-enforced child support obligations because child support debt is owed to states rather than the federal government. Child support arrearage payments, which are enforced by states, cannot be offset from Social Security benefits/payments.", "Generally, Social Security benefits are not subject to garnishment, attachment, or other legal process, pursuant to Section 207(a) of the Social Security Act. However, Social Security benefits are attachable for child support purposes, because Section 207 of the act is expressly overridden by Section 459(a) of the act, which provides that payments from the federal government, the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment, are subject to income withholding, garnishment, or other legal process brought by a state CSE agency or custodial parent for purposes of enforcing child support obligations.", "Over the last several Congresses, both the House and the Senate have considered a provision to expand the federal administrative offset program by allowing states to collect past-due child support via the Department of Treasury's withholding of Social Security benefit payments. This provision also was proposed in the Administration's FY2003 and subsequent budgets. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that these offsets could yield about $65 million annually by 2010, but it notes that some (perhaps half) of this child support money would have been collected anyway through the federal income tax refund offset program.", "The proposed federal debt collection improvement provision would add another enforcement method for states to collect past-due child support obligations.

The data match is intended to identify financial accounts (in banks, credit unions, money-market mutual funds, etc.) belonging to parents who are delinquent in the payment of their child support obligation. Under current law, HHS matches lists of noncustodial parents who owe child support arrearages against data from financial institutions to identify assets that might be seized to pay past-due child support. HHS forwards any matches to states so that states can pursue the collection. When a match is identified, state CSE agencies may issue liens or levies on the accounts to collect the past-due child support from the noncustodial parent. During 2004, the Financial Institution Data Match program found over 1.9 million financial accounts belonging to about 1.1 million noncustodial parents nationwide; child support collections totaling $98 million were seized by the states and distributed to custodial parents.", "State CSE officials maintain that the seizure of assets through the Financial Institution Data Match program has been a successful addition to the array of CSE tools. But, they also state that the financial match program works best when the custodial parent has an account at a bank or banks within the state. This is because in some cases, multi-state financial institutions will not honor a seizure by a state unless the institution has branch offices in the state. Also, some states have policies of pursuing matching only when a large financial asset is identified or only when the arrearage is longstanding or no current payments are being made. Moreover, in some cases, state law prohibits the placement of liens or levies on accounts outside of the state.", "In 1998, Congress made it easier for multi-state financial institutions to match records by permitting the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) to help them coordinate their information. Pursuant to P.L. 105-200 , the FPLS uses its national file of delinquent noncustodial parents (i.e., noncustodial parents who owe past-due child support payments) for the data match with multi-state financial institutions and transfers matched data to state CSE agencies. Under P.L. 105-200 , the state CSE agency and not the FPLS has the authority to seize assets to obtain child support payments.", "Given that interstate cases make up about one-third of the CSE caseload but represent only about 6% of total child support collections, and that effective use of the Financial Institution Data Match program in cases dealing with multi-state financial institutions reportedly has been elusive for many states, several Senate bills (but not House bills) included a provision that would have allowed for federal seizure of accounts in multi-state financial institutions for child support purposes. This proposal was also included in several Administration budgets beginning with FY2004.", "The proposed provision would have authorized the HHS Secretary, via the FPLS, to assist states to perform data matches comparing information from states and participating multi-state financial institutions with respect to persons owing past-due child support. The proposed provision would have authorized the Secretary via the FPLS to seize assets, held by such financial institutions, of noncustodial parents who owe child support arrearage payments, by issuing a notice of a lien or levy and requiring the financial institution to freeze and seize assets in accounts in multi-state financial institutions to satisfy child support obligations. It would have required the Secretary to transmit any assets seized under the procedure to the state for accounting and distribution. The provision would have stipulated that the Secretary must inform affected account holders/ asset holders of their due process rights.", "The proposed provision would have given the federal government the authority to act on behalf of states to seize financial assets for the purpose of paying child support. This proposed authority would have resolved problems of jurisdiction in cases where a state is pursuing an asset in a different state. Supporters of this provision contend that it would make the existing financial institution match program more effective.", "This provision had many opponents. Opponents of the provision contend that federalizing the multi-state financial institution levy process is not the appropriate answer. Instead they say that federal law should be clarified/strengthened by stipulating that a state must have laws requiring all financial institutions doing business in the state to honor levies issued by any CSE agency, regardless of whether it is an in-state or out-of-state financial institution. They argue that a federalized levy program would preempt state law governing property rights. They say that although the levy process should be made more uniform and easier to follow for financial institutions, states should continue to have exclusive control of the levy process.

These benefits are paid directly by an authorized self-insured employer; or through an authorized insurance carrier; or, in particular circumstances, by a Special Fund administered directly by the Division of Longshore Compensation. Benefits paid by the federal Special Fund are subject to attachment or garnishment for payment of child support obligations. However, benefits paid by employers or private insurers of longshore, harbor, or other maritime workers are not subject to attachment or garnishment.", "Several Senate bills (but not House bills) included a provision that would have amended the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act to ensure that longshore or harbor workers benefits that are provided by both the federal government or by private insurers are subject to garnishment for purposes of paying child support obligations. This provision also was proposed in several Administration budgets, beginning with the FY2004 budget. Although some opponents of the provision contend that longshore and harbor workers' compensation should not be subject to further garnishment, supporters of the provision argue that longshore and harbor workers compensation laws are out of sync with federal policy which generally is to make benefits based on remuneration from employment (which includes worker's compensation benefits paid or payable under federal or state law) available for the payment of child support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Law Requirement Concerning the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA)", "paragraphs": ["Several Senate bills (but not House bills) included a provision that would have required that, to receive CSE funding, each state's Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) include any amendments officially adopted as of August 2001 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL).", "Some of the 2001 changes adopted by the NCCUSL included increased emphasis on the need to determine the controlling order in the case of multiple child support orders, modification of current rules regarding the enforcement of modified orders, more direction regarding international child support cases, clarification regarding duration of child support, and procedures regarding use of telephone hearings. With respect to controlling orders, the 2001 changes clarify current law by stipulating that a court of a state that has established a child support order has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order if the order is the controlling order and the state is the child's state or the residence of any individual contestant; or if the state is not the residence of the child or an individual contestant, the court has the contestant's consent in a record or in open court that the court may continue to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order.", "The main reason that Congress (as part of the 1996 welfare reform law) required states, as a condition of receiving CSE funding, to adopt the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) was to reduce the problems associated with the establishment and enforcement of child support in interstate cases. One of the major barriers to interstate collection of child support prior to UIFSA was the \"multiple-order\" world under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA). URESA expressly provided that a URESA order did not nullify, and was not nullified by, any other child support order.", "By the early 1990s, it was universally recognized that uniform processing of interstate cases would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the CSE program. Thus a major purpose of UIFSA was to establish a \"one-order\" world, meaning that a court or child support agency would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction if it has issued a child support order and is the residence of the custodial parent, noncustodial parent, or child.", "The 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ) required that, to receive CSE funding, on and after January 1, 1998, each state must have in effect the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), as approved by the American Bar Association on February 9, 1993, and as in effect on August 22, 1996, including any amendments officially adopted as of such date by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.", "UIFSA requires states to treat past-due child support obligations as final judgments that are entitled to full faith and credit in every state. This means that a person who has a child support order in one state does not have to obtain a second order in another state to obtain child support should the noncustodial parent move from the issuing court's jurisdiction. The 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ) clarified the definition of a child's home state, made several revisions to ensure that the full faith and credit laws can be applied consistently with UIFSA, and clarified the rules regarding which child support orders states must honor when there is more than one order.", "Given that about 33% of all CSE cases involve more than one state, it is generally considered important that states have the same basic laws for handling interstate cases. After all of the states had adopted UIFSA as required by the 1996 welfare reform law, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted amendments in 2001 (at the request of the CSE officials and workers) to improve the processing of interstate child support cases. Supporters of the provision that would require states to incorporate these amendments maintain that it would make the CSE program more effective by requiring all states to adopt the more current version of UIFSA. They contend that the provision would ensure that all interstate cases are handled under a similar statutory framework, thus moving closer to the \"one-order\" world in which a child would not be seriously disadvantaged in obtaining child support just because his or her parents do not live in the same state."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Provisions", "paragraphs": ["In the last section, the five provisions discussed sought to expand and/or enhance the ability of states to collect child support payments by revising some CSE enforcement tools and adding others.

In FY2005, undistributed child support collections as a percentage of total distributed collections ranged from a low of 0.6% in Montana to a high of 6.8% in Hawaii; the percentage for the nation as a whole was 2.2%.

States contend that they have focused on the problem and have made some progress in reducing the amount of undistributed child support collections, but also indicate that there are in some cases good reasons for not distributing some payments. For example, they cite legal issues, such as the pending determination of custody, that may need to be resolved before payments are released; states could lose anywhere from thousands to millions of dollars a year if they prematurely distributed the IRS income tax refund intercept collections from joint tax returns. Parents and advocacy groups maintain that unresolved undistributed child support collections ultimately go into state and federal treasuries.", "According to the National Council of Child Support Directors:", "States support the establishment of a national goal for a reduction in UDC [undistributed collections]. The setting of such a goal can be accomplished once the data from the reporting categories of UDC on the OCSE 34A form and the draft schedule is available. Until such data is available it would be difficult to set a realistic national goal for UDC as we will not have a clear understanding as to the level of UDC for individual states or the nation as a whole. Once such data is available, it will provide the opportunity to establish a benchmark for improvement.", "Until all states know where they are through consistent, nationally standardized reporting of UDC, rather than setting a concrete standard, NCCSD supports a goal of continuous improvement by each state, no matter where they are along the path toward reducing UDC.

Although several other agencies have access to the National Directory of New Hires, they are required to reimburse the HHS Secretary for any cost incurred by the HHS Secretary in providing requested information on new hires, not just the additional costs.", "Pursuant to the 1996 welfare reform law, the HHS Secretary is required to share information from the National Directory of New Hires with state CSE agencies, state agencies administering the TANF program, the Commissioner of Social Security, the Secretary of the Treasury (for Earned Income Tax Credit purposes and to verify income tax return information), and researchers under certain circumstances. Subsequently, the following agencies have been granted access to the National Directory of New Hires: (1) The Department of Education (to collect on defaulted student loans and grant overpayments); (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (to verify the employment and income of persons receiving federal housing assistance); (3) State Workforce Agencies responsible for administering state or federal Unemployment Compensation programs (to determine whether persons receiving unemployment compensation are working); and (4) the Department of the Treasury (to collect non-tax debt (e.g., small business loans, VA loans, agricultural loans, etc.) owed to the federal government).", "Federal law stipulates that a state or federal agency that receives information from the HHS Secretary from the National Directory of New Hires must reimburse the Secretary for costs incurred by the Secretary in providing the information (i.e., meaning \"all\" or \"any\" costs incurred in providing the specified information). Unlike the provisions related to other agencies, the section of the law pertaining to reimbursement of HHS costs by the Department of Education specifies that the Department of Education only needs to reimburse the HHS Secretary for \"additional\" costs incurred. Both House and Senate bills have included a provision that would have amended the reimbursement of costs provision by eliminating the word additional , thereby requiring the Secretary of Education to reimburse the HHS Secretary for any costs incurred by the HHS Secretary in providing requested information on new hires."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grants to States for Access and Visitation Programs", "paragraphs": ["Many noncustodial parents argue that it is unfair to look at the child support issue only from the viewpoint of the custodial parent. Traditionally, courts have sided with mothers in awarding custody, and, in this view, have paid insufficient attention to enforcing visitation rights of fathers. As a result, they say, mothers have had the rewards and obligations connected with rearing children, while fathers have sometimes had no share in the rewards, but have the continuing obligation to pay support. To be fair, some say federal laws and procedures should be reformed not only with respect to enforcement of the child support obligation, but also with respect to visitation and custody rights. Historically, Congress has held that visitation and child support should be legally separate issues; and that only child support should be under the scope of the CSE program. However, Congress also has indicated that fathers should be involved in their children's lives.", "The 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ) authorized grants to states (via CSE funding) to establish and operate access and visitation programs. The purpose of the grants is to facilitate noncustodial parents' access to and visitation of their children. An annual entitlement of $10 million from the federal CSE budget account is available to states for these grants. Eligible activities include but are not limited to mediation, counseling, education, development of parenting plans, visitation enforcement, and development of guidelines for visitation and alternative custody arrangements. The allotment formula is based on the ratio of the number of children in the state living with only one biological parent in relation to the total number of such children in all states. The amount of the allotment available to a state is this same ratio to $10 million. The allotments are to be adjusted to ensure that there is a minimum allotment amount of $100,000 per state for any year after FY1998. States may use the grants to create their own programs or to fund programs operated by courts, local public agencies, or nonprofit organizations. The programs do not need to be statewide. States must monitor, evaluate, and report on their programs in accord with regulations issued by the HHS Secretary.", "Senate bills (but not House bills) included a provision that would have increased funding for the Access and Visitation program. This provision also was proposed in several Administration budgets, beginning with the FY2004 budget. Under the Senate bills, the Access and Visitation grants would have increased from $10 million annually to $12 million in FY2006, $14 million in FY2007, $16 million in FY2008, and $20 million annually in FY2009 and each succeeding fiscal year. The proposed Senate provision would have extended the Access and Visitation program to Indian tribes and tribal organizations that had received direct child support enforcement payments from the federal government for at least one year. The proposed provision included a specified amount to be set aside for Indian tribes and tribal organizations: $250,000 for FY2006; $600,000 for FY2007; $800,000 for FY2008; and $1.670 million for FY2009 or any succeeding fiscal year.", "The provision would have increased the minimum allotment to states to $120,000 in FY2006, $140,000 in FY2007, $160,000 in FY2008, and $180,000 in FY2009 or any succeeding fiscal year. The minimum allotment for Indian tribes and tribal organizations would have been $10,000 for a fiscal year. The tribal allotment would not be able to exceed the minimum state allotment for any given fiscal year.", "Research indicates that children raised by married biological parents (who live together) are more successful in school, are emotionally and socially healthier, more likely to avoid teen pregnancy, delinquency, and crime during their teenage years, and are more likely to have stable above-poverty level incomes as adults. Supporters of the provision contend that families need more than child support alone. They maintain that Access and Visitation programs facilitate noncustodial parents' access to their children and help both parents create a more stable and supportive environment in which to raise their children.
