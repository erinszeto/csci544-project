The Bureau of the Fiscal Service manages the operational aspects of the issuance of Treasury securities, including the systems related to and the monitoring of security auctions.", "During the mid-1970s, Treasury faced a period of rising nominal federal budget deficits and debt requiring unanticipated increases in issuances of securities. Up to that point, debt management was characterized by an ad-hoc, offering-by-offering survey of market participants. At that time, Treasury implemented a new debt management strategy that provided greater transparency and reduced the potential for market volatility. The resulting debt management process modernized the market for Treasury securities, realizing the benefits of predictability in an environment of large deficits. A reliance on auctions became a central part of the strategy's increased focus on regular and predictable debt management.", "Most of the debt sold by the federal government is marketable, meaning that it can be resold on the secondary market. Currently, Treasury offers five types of marketable securities: Treasury bills, notes, bonds, inflation protected securities (TIPS), and floating rate notes (FRNs), sold in about 270 auctions per year. A small portion of debt held by the public and nearly all intragovernmental debt (debt held by government trust funds) is nonmarketable.", "Investors examine several key factors when deciding whether they should purchase Treasury securities, including price, expected return, and risk. Treasury securities provide a known stream of income and offer greater liquidity than other types of fixed-income securities.

Security prices are determined by investors according to the value of such characteristics in the context of the financial marketplace.", "Legislative activity can affect Treasury's ability to issue debt and can impact the budget process. Congress sets a statutory limit on the permissible amount of federal debt to assert its constitutional prerogatives to control spending and impose a form of fiscal accountability. The statutory limit on the debt can constrain debt operations, and, in the past, has hampered traditional practices when the limit was approached. The accounting of asset purchases in the federal budget has created differences between how much debt Treasury has to borrow to make those purchases and how much the same purchases will impact the budget deficit. If budget deficits continue to rise, thereby causing more resources to be devoted to paying interest on the debt, there will be fewer funds available to spend on other federal programs, all else equal.

In addition, long-term obligations resulting from the retirement and rising health care costs of the Baby Boomer generation, in the absence of policy changes, are projected to cause large increases in future federal debt. Given these challenges, the ability to maintain efficient and stable debt markets to ensure confidence and liquidity will remain an issue going forward.", "Treasury's debt management strategy can be complicated by challenges associated with approaches of total federal debt levels to the statutory debt limit. When the total amount of federal debt approaches the statutory debt limit, Congress may authorize the Treasury Secretary to invoke \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent the limit from binding. Those measures may compromise Treasury's ability to reach its borrowing objectives as it seeks to avoid the potential adverse effects associated with a binding debt limit. As the amount of money owed by the United States to holders of Treasury securities rises, interest payments can become a greater burden on taxpayers. If investors choose to purchase Treasury securities, less money is available to fund private sector investments and other financial instruments. To the extent that these securities are held by foreign governments or individuals abroad, those investors will be the beneficiaries of the interest payments.", "This report examines Treasury's debt management practices, focusing on the auction process, how prices and interest rates of securities are determined, and the role of market participants in the process.

Beyond financing the federal government, the success of Treasury's debt management strategy also affects global markets due to the influential role of the United States in the world economy. As noted earlier, Treasury adheres to three debt management principles: (1) to issue debt in a regular and predictable pattern, (2) to provide transparency in the decisionmaking process, and (3) to seek continuous improvements in the auction process. Adoption of this strategy helps to maximize government contributions to growth and efficiency in both the domestic and global capital markets.", "Development of modern debt management dates to the passage of the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917. As amended, that legislation designated the Treasury Secretary as the principal authority to determine the types of issues, terms, and techniques most appropriate to manage public debt. Before this measure, interest rates and maturity periods of bonds were set by legislation and congressional authority. Further refinements in debt management policy came when Treasury established the Bureau of Public Debt within the Office of Fiscal Service in June 1940. In the late 1980s, ODM, formerly known as the Office of Market Finance, became the central office responsible for the decision making behind Treasury's borrowings. The Bureau of the Public Debt and the Financial Management Service (FMS) merged in 2012 to form the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service now oversees the operational aspects of the federal government borrowing process, accounts for and services federal debt, and provides reimbursable support services to federal agencies under the authority of the Treasury Franchise Fund. It also conducts auctions of Treasury securities to allow individuals, institutions, and financial professionals to invest in Treasury bills, notes, bonds, inflation-protected securities (TIPS), and floating rate notes (FRNs).", "The Federal Reserve (Fed) works alongside the Treasury in the debt management process, acting as Treasury's fiscal agent. The Fed was created in 1913 to institute stability in the banking sector following a time of financial panic. Initially, the Fed's role was primarily to oversee the money supply and supervise the banks during a time of increased borrowing needs as the United States sought ways to finance World War I expenses. For the first several decades of its existence, the Fed worked closely with Treasury to implement fiscal policy goals. Since the early 1950s, however, the Fed has operated independently from Treasury and uses its open market operations to manage the amount of money and credit in the economy via monetary policy.

Generally, yield curves are upward sloping (i.e., the longer the maturity, the higher the yield), with diminishing rates of increase over time.

", "Two opposing forces affect the slope and shape of the yield curve. First, investors must be compensated for choosing to invest now even though they may be able to achieve higher interest rates if they invested at a future point in time. This pushes interest rates up. Opposing this increase in interest rates is the fact that the longer the period to maturity, the greater the likelihood that interest rates will fall. This increases the risk to the lender (i.e., Treasury), as they could save on interest costs if they decided to wait before borrowing money. Generally speaking, the first effect will outweigh the second, leading to an upward sloping yield curve. An upward sloping yield curve also illustrates expectations for future economic growth and rising short-term interest rates. A downward-sloping curve implies that investors expect short-term interest rates to rise above long-term rates. These yield curves have frequently occurred before recessions.", "Yields can change for the same maturities from auction to auction and can vary on a daily (business day) basis. Treasury's Office of Debt Management generates the official daily yield curves to calculate a rate of constant maturity on Treasury securities in order to provide a meaningful measure of the yield on a security with a 10-year maturity, for example, even if no outstanding security has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity. All securities with the same length to maturity must have the same yield, even if they were originally issued with different maturities or coupon rates. Yields are equalized through price changes.", " Figure 3 shows the Treasury constant maturity rates for selected maturities since 1962. Rates on securities with different maturities generally track each other. This is because securities with similar maturity periods tend to have similar rates because they offer fixed interest payments over essentially the same period of time. Given that securities with longer maturities tend to reflect expectations about the future path of the interest rates of short-term securities, short-term rates generally provide a picture of the path of their longer-term counterparts. Therefore, over history, movements in constant maturity rates have generally tracked each other, regardless of length of maturity.

Increases in the maturity rates of short-term securities from 2004 through 2007 were followed by sharp declines in rates during and after the economic recession. Trends in nominal rates of Treasury securities varied by maturity length from 2012 to 2015, as securities with shorter maturity periods experienced small increases while those with longer periods decreased. However, as of 2015 all securities remained well below their historical averages. The average spread between 30-year and 1-year securities was about 3.1% from 2011 to 2015, which is much higher than the average 5-year average spread since the creation of the 30-year security in 1977 (1.2%). In a recent statement following a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen reiterated a desire to increase the federal funds rate to a target rate of 2% in the medium term, though the Federal Reserve opted to keep the federal funds rate at between 0.25% and 0.50% in July 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Maturity Mix", "paragraphs": ["Newly issued Treasury securities, sold to finance the operations of the federal government, are offered at a mix of maturities in order to satisfy the provisions of the regular and predictable debt management strategy and to minimize interest payments over time.

Balancing all of these objectives leads to a strategy which offers a mix of short- and long-term securities. ", "Longer-term securities generally command higher interest rates compared to shorter-term securities because investors demand greater compensation for incurring risk over a longer period of time. Generally, a strong economy will be accompanied by higher interest rates. If Treasury issues long-term debt during this time, they are committing to paying higher interest rates for a longer period and may decide to purchase short-term securities. However, this leads to uncertainties over the longer term, since the interest rate will likely change. During periods of economic downturn and low interest rates, Treasury may decide to finance at shorter maturities to take advantage of lower borrowing costs. This, however, may lead to more volatile and uncertain yearly interest payments because Treasury has to enter the market more often. Figure 4 shows the average length of marketable interest-bearing public debt securities held by private investors between 1974 and 2015, as of the end of each fiscal year.", "Since 1974, the average maturity period of Treasury securities reached its minimum point in FY1976 at 31 months and its peak in FY2000 at 75 months. In the mid-1970s, before the initiation of the regular and predictable debt management strategy, the average maturity of Treasury securities declined due to the rapid increase in the deficit during FY1975. To meet the unexpected financing needs, numerous debt offerings took place. However, Treasury officials were generally reluctant to offer long-term securities because they were unsure of investor demand. In contrast, during the surplus years of the late 1990s and the resulting decline in federal debt levels, Treasury did not have immediate financing needs and did not auction new securities as older ones matured. This effectively increased average maturity since greater numbers of long-term bonds remained outstanding.", "Given the nature of current borrowing requirements, coupled with expected future demands on borrowing needs due to long-term obligations related to Medicare and Social Security, Treasury's Borrowing Advisory Committee recommended that Treasury increase the size of issues across the maturity spectrum to allow the Treasury to meet its financing needs over the short to intermediate term and reduce the uncertainty surrounding interest rates over the long term. Effectively, this should reduce risk and ensure adequate financing over the long term, while increasing average maturity. The average maturity period of Treasury securities has increased since the end of the Great Recession, rising from an average length of 49 months in 2009 to 61 months in 2015."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Budgetary Impacts", "paragraphs": ["Legislative activity can affect Treasury's ability to issue debt and can impact the budget process. The statutory limit on the debt can constrain debt operations, and, in the past, has hampered traditional practices when the limit was approached. The accounting of asset purchases in the federal budget has created differences between how much debt Treasury has to borrow to purchase assets and how much the same purchases will impact the budget deficit. If budget deficits continue to rise, thereby requiring devotion of more resources to paying interest on the debt, fewer funds are available to spend on other federal programs, all else equal.", "Some economists have expressed concerns that persistent deficits could drive up interest rates, making it more expensive for the government, businesses, and consumers to borrow money. The government cannot add infinitely to the national debt without facing market consequences or hindering future ability to borrow. In recent testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen warned that failing to address the government's growing debt will likely cause the United States to face higher interest rates, lower levels of investment, and reduced productivity growth in future years than it otherwise would have with more manageable levels of federal debt."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Constraints of the Debt Limit", "paragraphs": ["Congress sets a statutory limit on federal debt levels in an effort to assert its constitutional prerogatives to control spending and impose a form of fiscal accountability. At times, the debt limit has restricted the Treasury's ability to manage the federal government's finances. Standard methods of financing federal activities or meeting government obligations can be hobbled when federal debt nears its legal limit. If the limit prevents the Treasury from issuing new debt to manage short-term cash flows or to finance an annual budget deficit, the government may be unable to obtain the cash it needs. In recent years, when federal debt levels approached the statutory debt limit, Congress and the Treasury were compelled to intervene. Such actions to stay under the debt limit included the authorization of a \"debt issuance suspension period\" and the implementation of \"extraordinary measures\" by the Treasury Secretary, and suspension of the statutory debt limit by Congress. Because the law requires that the government's legal obligations be paid, the debt limit may prevent it from issuing the debt that would allow it to do so. While the debt limit has never caused the federal government to default on its obligations, at times it has added uncertainty to Treasury operations.

Before the creation of this law, asset purchases were recorded on a purchase price or net cash flow basis. If a subsequent sale led the government to recoup some of its investment, that would be recorded in a later fiscal year as negative outlays. Beginning in FY1992, asset purchases were recorded on an accrual basis, which reported the budgetary cost of a credit program equal to the estimated subsidy costs at the time the credit is provided. The subsidy cost was defined as \"the estimated long-term cost to the government of a direct loan or a loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs.\"", "Accounting under FCRA became a more prominent issue due to the federal financial interventions and resulting loans and asset purchases made by the federal government to stabilize the economy during the most recent recession. Because the ultimate value of these assets once they were sold was unknown, the ultimate increase in the federal debt as a result of these interventions was also unknown. Asset purchases financed under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP; P.L. 110-343 ) required outlays to equal the purchase price, which increased the debt held by the public by the same amount. Subsequent proceeds from government sales of those assets are returned to the Treasury's General Fund, thereby decreasing the federal debt.", "However, the budgetary impact of this program was somewhat different. The TARP law (Title II of Division A) contained a provision which required budgetary accountability for these asset purchases to follow the provisions of FCRA with an additional adjustment for market risk. This means that for budgetary purposes, the cost of these purchases was recorded on a subsidy basis, which takes into account the asset's expected return. What the government paid to purchase the assets led to an increase in the debt held by the public, in the amount of the purchase price, that exceeded the increase in the budget deficit, in the amount of the subsidy. The most recent estimates project that the government's financial intervention through TARP will result in total asset purchases of $442 billion ($431 billion of which had already been disbursed in March 2016) at a net cost to the government of $30 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interest and the Debt", "paragraphs": ["Interest paid on the federal debt increases the overall cost of borrowing. As discussed earlier, interest costs can be affected by various conditions, including legislative activity and the economy, as well as actions taken by the Treasury and the Fed. The level of budget deficits and federal debt can also affect the interest rates on Treasury securities . If interest rates are low, interest payments on Treasury securities may also be low, thereby making debt less costly. However, increased borrowing will increase the supply of Treasury securities, which generally leads to higher interest rates and future net interest payments.", "Despite the recent increases in federal borrowing during the recent economic recession and subsequent recovery, the actions of the Fed have kept interest rates near zero since late 2008. Therefore, borrowing costs to the Treasury currently remain low. When setting interest rates, the Fed considers potential effects on employment, prices, and long-term interest rate levels. The Fed cited soft business investment measures and uncertainty surrounding global economic and financial developments in its decision to keep interest rates low in FY2016. However, the Fed also suggested that it will raise interest rates in the near future if the labor market continues to strengthen and economic inflation increases. Interest payments are projected to match historically low levels both as a percentage of gross domestic product and as a percentage of total outlays even as overall debt is increasing.
