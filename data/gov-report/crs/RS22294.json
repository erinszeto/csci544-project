Monthly survivors benefits were established in the Social Security Amendments of 1939 (P.L. 76-379), including those for widows, parents, and children. This was offset by a reduction in the size of the lump-sum death payment, although coverage expanded to both fully or currently insured workers (defined in the \" Lump-Sum Death Benefits \" section), regardless of age.

To become insured for survivors benefits, a worker must have a sufficient work history in covered employment (employment subject to Social Security payroll taxes). A worker can earn up to four Social Security credits each year, based on his or her earnings in a covered job. The number of credits a worker needs to qualify for Survivors Insurance depends on how old the worker is when he or she dies.", "A worker is fully insured for benefits if he or she has earned at least one credit for each year between age 21 and turning 62, dying, or becoming disabled; a worker is permanently insured if he or she has at least 40 credits (at least 10 years of work). In 2017, 87% of Americans over the age of 20 were fully insured.

Benefits are based on the average lifetime covered earnings of the worker who died, so survivors of higher earners tend to receive higher benefits than survivors of lower earners. However, the benefit formula is progressive, so survivors benefits replace a higher proportion of lower earners' wages than of higher earners' wages.", "When a person applies for survivors benefits, the deceased worker's basic benefit amount, called the primary insurance amount (PIA), is determined. Each qualifying survivor will receive a percentage of the worker's PIA, depending on the survivor's age and relationship to the deceased worker. Survivors benefits may be subject to reductions based on earnings and family size. If a survivor qualifies for benefits based on both his or her own work record and a spouse's record, the survivor receives the higher amount of the two. Survivors benefits, like all Social Security benefits, are subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). In most cases, survivors benefits are payable to eligible family members beginning with the deceased beneficiary's month of death, regardless of when the death occurred during the month."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Types of Survivors Benefits", "paragraphs": [" Table 1 , at the conclusion of this report, provides data on the various types of survivors benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Widow's and Widower's Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Surviving spouses of fully insured workers must meet an age requirement to be eligible for widow's or widower's benefits.
