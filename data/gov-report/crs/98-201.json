The formulas that determine payments under these programs are made by long-term farm legislation, andbenefitshave to be provided to any participating producer.

TheFederal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-127 , the 1996 farm bill) replaced the programofmaking direct payments to participating producers when market prices fall below a target level, with pre-determinedanddeclining market transition payments to eligible producers over a 7-year period. Consequently, CCC outlays havebeenmore predictable since 1996 than they were in previous years.", "The Administration estimated earlier this year that total CCC outlays for FY1999 would be $9.0 billion for all CCC-fundedprograms, of which $5.5 billion would be for direct market transition payments to farmers. (1) (All estimates exclude the$5.6 billion in emergency FY1999 CCC spending provided by P.L. 105-277 .) The $9.0 billion estimate is downfrom anestimated $9.3 billion in FY1998 outlays of which $5.8 billion was in market transition payments. Because theseprogramsare funded through the CCC, they do not require annual appropriations. Instead, the CCC borrows funds from theTreasury to fund its operations. However, because CCC outstanding borrowing cannot exceed $30 billion, theannualappropriations bill usually contains funding for a \"reimbursement of CCC net realized losses\" so that the CCC canrepay itsdebt to the Treasury and not exhaust its borrowing authority. This reimbursement is also categorized as a mandatoryexpense and is not included toward the discretionary spending allocation given to the appropriations subcommittees.

Much of the difference can be explained by a change in methodology used by USDA fordetermining how much to request for net realized losses, rather than a change in farm policy. (In brief, the methodologyused before last year based the reimbursement request on an estimate of losses in the previous fiscal year, while thenewmethodology bases the request on actual losses from the second previous fiscal year.) The $783.5 million requestedinFY1998 was unusually low because it was a transition year for switching to the new methodology.", "Although the farm commodity programs do not require an annual appropriation, per se, opponents of these programs havein the past offered floor amendments to agriculture appropriations bills in an attempt to effect changes in farmcommoditypolicy. Separate amendments which would have affected the peanut and sugar price support programs and cropinsurancefor tobacco farmers were offered and defeated on the House floor when H.R. 4101 was debated in June. Anadopted Senate amendment to S. 2159 would have required tobacco growers to be assessed for the cost ofUSDA to administer its tobacco price support programs and related activities, but was deleted in conference.", "Civil Rights Provisions.

P.L.105-277 waives the statute of limitations on civil rights cases for eligible complaints made during the period January1,1981 through December 31, 1996. Eligible complaints included in the conference agreement are those pertainingto casesinvolving potential discrimination within USDA's farm commodity, farm credit, rural housing loan, and disasterassistanceprograms only. Conferees on P.L. 105-277 modified the civil rights provision in the vetoed bill ( H.R. 4101 )toinclude housing loan programs and to extend the statute of limitation back to 1981, instead of 1983 as in the vetoedbill.

P.L. 105-277 contains a House-adoptedprovision that requires USDA to issue its final rule for federal milk marketing order reform between February 1,and April4, 1999, and extend the deadline for implementation from April 4, 1999 to October 1, 1999. No comparableprovision wasin the Senate-passed bill. Federal milk marketing orders regulate the farm price of milk in much of the country. USDA isin the process of consolidating the number of marketing orders, as required by the 1996 farm bill, and reformingdairypricing policy, which has been the center of controversy among dairy production regions, processors and consumers. ", "The conference provision to extend the deadline is supported by Northeast and Southeast dairy producer groups whosupport the current milk pricing system and are concerned that USDA might implement reforms that reduceminimum farmmilk prices while Congress is in recess later this year. Opponents of the provision (mainly Upper Midwest milkproducers)contend that the provision applies pressure on USDA to recommend the status quo, or else be faced with legislativeactionagainst a decision in favor of any reforms that would reduce minimum milk prices. The requirement that USDArelease itsfinal rule between February 1 and April 4, 1999, ensures that the rule will be released at a time when Congress isin sessionand can react to the ruling. An Obey amendment to H.R. 4101 would have removed this provision from thebill, but was defeated on the House floor on June 23 by voice vote.", "The extension of the implementation deadline to October 1, 1999, effectively extends the life of the Northeast DairyCompact to October 1 as well. The Northeast compact establishes higher minimum price for the farm price ofbeveragemilk in New England, and under current law expires at the same time as implementation of order reform. Aproposed Petriamendment to H.R. 4101 would have kept the sunset date for the Northeast dairy compact at April 4, 1999,butthe amendment was not allowed to be considered on the House floor.

The actual level of guarantees in FY1999 could differ from the budget request, and will dependon thedemand for guarantees, market conditions, and USDA decisions about using the programs. ", "Of the $4.6 billion proposed, $4.3 billion will be allocated to the GSM-102 program which provides short-term commercialexport credit guarantees (up to 3 year repayment terms). $100 million will be allocated to the GSM-103 programwhichprovides guarantees for intermediate-term credit (3 to 10 year repayment terms). Two other guarantee programs,thesupplier credit guarantee and the facilities financing guarantee, receive $150 million and $50 million respectivelyinFY1999. Under the supplier credit guarantee, CCC guarantees payments due on financing extended directly byexporters toimporters (due in up to 180 days) for the purchase of U.S. agricultural products. Under the facilities financingguarantee,CCC guarantees the financing of manufactured goods and services exported from the United States to improve orestablishagricultural related facilities, such as port improvements, in emerging markets.", "Agricultural Trade Sanctions. Farm state members voiced concerns inJune 1998 that the imposition of sanctions on Pakistan and India following their nuclear weapons tests would resultin lostagricultural sales, particularly of wheat to Pakistan. This led to efforts to include amendments in the FY1999agricultureappropriations measures reported out by both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to allow Pakistanto regainaccess to USDA's agricultural export credit guarantees. Pakistan, the third largest market for U.S. wheat, has usedthisprogram extensively since the early 1990s to facilitate its sizable purchases of U.S. wheat. When Pakistanannounced thatit would be purchasing a large quantity of wheat on July 15, 1998, Congress approved and the President signedseparatelegislation ( P.L. 105-194 , S. 2282 ) to exempt USDA credits, guarantees, and financial assistance from thenonproliferation sanctions mandated under the Arms Control Act. This action helped facilitate the sale of over600,000metric tons of white wheat to Pakistan during the remainder of 1998. (For more information, see CRS Report 98-770, U.S.Agricultural Exports and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Sanctions on India and Pakistan .)", "Growing recognition of the adverse impact that U.S. trade sanctions have on U.S. agricultural exports prompted considerable debate on this issue during floor consideration of the Senate version of FY1999 agricultureappropriations( S. 2159 ). However, conferees dropped language adopted during Senate floor debate, offered by Dodd andamended by Torricelli, that would have exempted the sale of food, fertilizer, medicine and medical equipment fromcurrentand future U.S. unilateral sanctions, except for those imposed on countries that support terrorism or use food andmedicinefor coercion or punishment.", "Country of Origin Labeling for Agricultural Products. P.L. 105-277 does not contain separate Senate-adopted amendments to require country of origin labeling on fresh cuts of importedmeatsand for imported produce.

The FY1999 agricultural appropriations actplaces no funding limitations on the Market Access Program. The FY1999 budget estimate of $90 million isunchangedfrom FY1998 and is the maximum authorized under the 1996 farm bill. MAP supports, on a cost-sharing basis,foreignmarket development and promotion efforts of non-profit agricultural trade organizations, state and regional tradegroups,and private companies. The 1996 farm bill prohibits providing direct assistance to foreign firms for the promotionofforeign-produced products and to any firm that is not recognized as a small business under the Small Business Act. Popular in the agricultural community, the program is often targeted for elimination as \"corporate welfare\" byopponents inCongress, some consumer organizations, and fiscally conservative groups. ", "MAP is a mandatory program, funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and does not require annualappropriations. Amendments to eliminate MAP spending in FY1999 were defeated in both chambers.

P.L. 105-277 does not provide for any changes in theEEP program and places no limits on the FAIR Act authorized levels for EEP. That means that the full amountauthorizedfor EEP for FY1999, $550 million, will be available. The FY1999 estimated program level is $170 million abovetheFY1998 level, which was capped at $150 in the FY1998 agricultural appropriations act. Like MAP, USDA's exportsubsidy programs are funded through the CCC, and are not subject to direct annual appropriations. Twoprograms--theExport Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP)--offer bonuses to exportersof U.S.agricultural commodities to make them price competitive in markets that are also targets of competitors' countriessubsidies. Only $5 million in EEP bonuses were awarded in FY1996 and none were awarded in FY1997. InFY1998, theavailability of EEP bonuses for 20,000 tons of poultry meat and 30,000 tons of barley were announced. ", "No action was taken on the President's proposal to set EEP spending at $1.2 billion over FY1999 through FY2003 with anallocation of up to $320 million as a first installment of a \"flexible, multi-year program authorization for EEP.\" Under theAdministration proposal, any funding not used in one fiscal year would remain available for use in a subsequentyear, butannual program levels would remain subject to export subsidy reduction commitments made in the Uruguay RoundAgreement on Agriculture. Savings from the proposed multi-year EEP program were estimated at approximately$1.4billion, the difference between the proposed program levels and the amounts authorized in the 1996 farm bill. Authorizingthis multi-year program would have required new authorizing legislation. ", "For DEIP, the President's budget anticipated a lower level of program activity in FY1999 because of a tighter domesticmarket for dairy products. The $82 million proposed is $17 million less than the estimated $99 million for FY1998.

The FY1998 appropriation was $1.063 billion which will provide 3.2 millionmetrictons of commodity assistance. The new budget request thus represents a reduction of $96 million in budgetauthority and700,000 metric tons of commodities, all of it coming from Title I. Agricultural appropriators rejected efforts by theAdministration in FY1997 and FY1998 to cut Title I spending. Similarly, previous Administration efforts to reduceoreliminate Title III were rebuffed. Commodity groups whose products figure prominently in the Title I program(wheat,wheat flour, vegetable oil, rice, among others) have opposed any reductions in Title I; supporters in Congress ofusing foodfor development assistance oppose reducing further or eliminating Title III.
