"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["When a new Congress convenes in January, one of its first orders of business is to receive the annual budget submission of the President for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins later in the session. The President's budget consists of a set of proposals pertaining to spending, revenue, and debt levels. In the course of responding to the President's budget, Congress may accept, reject, or modify the proposals as it sees fit. While much of the spending and revenue in the federal budget is derived automatically each year from existing law, the remainder is provided through the enactment of legislation.", "The deadline for submission of the budget has changed several times over the years, as is discussed in more detail below. Currently, the deadline is the first Monday in February.", "Following receipt of the President's budget, Congress begins the consideration of the budget resolution and other budgetary legislation. The budget resolution, which takes the form of a concurrent resolution, reflects the agreement of the House and Senate on a budgetary \"blueprint\" that guides and constrains the subsequent consideration of individual spending, revenue, and debt measures. The consideration of significant spending, revenue, and debt measures by the House and Senate during a session may entail action on dozens of separate measures.", "In establishing and revising the deadline for submission of the President's budget, Congress has sought to reconcile two conflicting objectives. First, Congress is motivated to set the deadline as early as possible in order to maximize the time available to it for completing action on the budget resolution and other budgetary legislation before the new fiscal year begins. Although the completion of some budgetary legislation typically carries over into the period beyond the start of the fiscal year, the goal is to enact as much significant budgetary legislation as possible in a timely manner.", "Second, Congress also is impelled to afford the President as much time as necessary to finalize his budget submission following the completion of legislative action in the prior session. In recent decades, the House and Senate sometimes have not completed action on significant budgetary legislation until December; in some instances, several major bills spanning hundreds of pages have been finalized in the last few days of the year.", "Seeking to draw a balance between the two competing motivations, Congress has set the deadline as early as the first week in January and as late as the first week in February. Under current law, the President may submit the budget as early as the first Monday in January, but he must submit it no later than the first Monday in February. Beginning with the FY1992 budget, Presidents have taken advantage of the full amount of time afforded them under law and submitted their budgets on the first Monday in February.", "The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, establishes an annual timetable for congressional action on budgetary legislation, beginning with the adoption of a budget resolution by the House and Senate no later than April 15. In an effort to provide Congress with more time to process budgetary legislation during the session, Section 501 (88 Stat. 321) of the act moved the start of the fiscal year from July 1 to October 1. The change became effective for FY1976, following a three-month transition quarter. The congressional budget process established by the 1974 act became fully effective in 1976 for FY1977, following a \"dry run\" in the prior year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Presidential Submission of Transition Budgets", "paragraphs": ["During the period that the congressional budget process under the 1974 act has been in effect, five persons have assumed the presidency \u2013 Jimmy Carter in 1977, Ronald Reagan in 1981, George H.W.

Therefore, under the legal framework for the beginning of a new Congress, the beginning of a new President's term, and the deadline for the submission of the budget, all outgoing Presidents prior to the 1990 change were obligated to submit a budget. All incoming Presidents before 1990, except for Roosevelt, Truman, and Johnson, modified their predecessor's policies by submitting budget revisions within a few months after taking office.

W. Bush chose not to submit a budget for FY1994 (and was not obligated to do so), President Clinton submitted the original budget for FY1994 rather than budget revisions. Similarly, the budget for FY2002 was submitted by the incoming President George W. Bush, rather than by outgoing President Clinton. Presidents Clinton and George W.

During the period from 1980 to 2008, 19 reconciliation measures were enacted into law and three were vetoed.", "The congressional budget process timetable prescribes June 15 as the deadline for completing action on any required reconciliation legislation, but there is no explicit requirement to that effect. The record of experience with all 22 reconciliation measures passed by the House and Senate since 1980 indicates considerable variation in the time needed to process such measures. The interval from the date the reconciliation instructions take effect (upon final adoption of the budget resolution) until the resultant reconciliation legislation is approved or vetoed by the President ranged from a low of 27 days (for the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) to a high of 384 days (for the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005). On average, the process was completed in nearly five months, more than twice the amount of time contemplated by the congressional budget process timetable.", "With respect to the five transition years, Table 3 (at the end of the report) shows that reconciliation was used in four of the five instances.

In addition, the two chambers act on at least one supplemental appropriations act, typically before consideration of the regular appropriations acts begins. Finally, the House and Senate usually consider at least one continuing resolution to provide stop-gap funding after the start of the fiscal year until action on all of the regular appropriations acts is completed.", "During the period that the congressional budget process has been in effect, the House and Senate have completed action on the regular appropriations acts before the start of the year only four times (for FY1977, FY1989, FY1995, and FY1997); action on unfinished regular appropriations acts usually is completed by the end of the calendar year, but sometimes carries over into the following session.

During the Carter administration, 10 appropriations acts were enacted by October 1, but the during the other administrations, the number enacted by this date were none (Reagan, G.W.
