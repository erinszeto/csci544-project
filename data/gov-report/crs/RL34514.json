In FY2007, ATF agents investigated 187 firearms trafficking cases and recommended 465 defendants for prosecution. By the end of FY2008, ATF had deployed 146 SAs and 68 IOIs to the Southwest border to bolster that initiative at an estimated cost of $32.2 million.", "The ATF FY2009 budget request included $948,000 to fund 12 industry operations investigator positions to bolster efforts already underway as part of Project Gunrunner. This was the only program increase/budget enhancement in the ATF FY2009 budget request. As described above, House reported language accompanying the FY2009 CJS appropriations bill indicated that the House bill ( H.R. 7322 ; H.Rept. 110-919 ) included $5 million for Project Gunrunner. Corresponding report language accompanying a Senate bill ( S. 3182 ; S.Rept. 110-397 ) was silent as to whether such an increase would be provided under that bill. The Senate, however, had included $15 million for Project Gunrunner in the FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill ( H.R. 2642 ), but that funding was not included in the enacted appropriation ( P.L. 110-252 ). As described above, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 111-8 ) included $1.054 billion for ATF, including an increase of not less than $5 million for Project Gunrunner. In addition, to ramp up Gunrunner, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ) included $10 for ATF and $30 million to assist state and local law enforcement with counter-narcotics efforts in FY2008 funding.", "The ATF FY2010 budget request includes $1.121 billion for ATF, including a proposed increase of $18 million and 92 permanent positions (including 34 SAs) to support Project Gunrunner. The House-reported FY2010 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill ( H.R. 2847 ; H.Rept. 111-149 ) would have provided ATF with $1.106 billion, including the requested increase of $18 million for Gunrunner. According to the House Committee, such an increase would bring total funding for Southwest border firearms trafficking efforts to $59.9 million. The Senate-reported version of H.R. 2847 ( S.Rept. 111-34 ) would have provided ATF with the same total amount as requested by the Administration, as well as the $18 million increase for Gunrunner. Senate report language noted that under its recommendation total funding for Southwest border gun trafficking would be over $61 million. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ), Congress provided ATF with the same amount as requested by the Administration, including a program increase of $18 million for Project Gunrunner. ", "ATF also maintains a foreign attache in Mexico City to administer an Electronic Trace Submission System (ETSS), also known as the eTrace program, for Mexican law enforcement authorities. From FY2005 through FY2007, ATF traced just over 11,700 firearms recovered by Mexican authorities, and approximately 90% of those firearms were traced back to the United States. Caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions from ATF firearm trace data. Although it is valid to say that 90% of traced firearms originated in the United States, it would be incorrect to conclude that 90% of all guns used in crime in Mexico originated in the United States. Although crime gun trace data are useful measurements of crime gun trends, in most cases the issues of consistent, random, and unbiased data collection have not been adequately addressed through comprehensive tracing and other controls. Hence, it is often not possible to test for statistical significance. Nevertheless, even though a statistically valid percent estimate of U.S.-sourced firearms used in crime in Mexico cannot be made based on trace data, criminal investigations have documented that there is great demand for certain firearms that are available in normal (non-military) commercial channels in the United States and that those firearms have been illegally trafficked to Mexico in large numbers.", "Moreover, successful firearm traces are instrumental in developing investigative leads in homicide and gun trafficking cases. According to ATF, some of those cases uncover corrupt FFLs who were involved in larger criminal conspiracies to smuggle firearms into Mexico. In January 2008, ATF announced that e-Trace technology would be deployed to an additional nine U.S. consulates in Mexico (M\u00e9rida, Juarez, Monterrey, Nogales, Hermosillo, Guadalajara, Tijuana, Matamoros, and Nueva Laredo). The number of traces performed by ATF for Mexican authorities during FY2008 increased markedly. During FY2008, ATF traced 7,743 firearms recovered by Mexican authorities, as compared with the 11,700 firearms traced over a three-year period, FY2005-FY2007. Of those firearms, 63.5% were determined to have been manufactured in the United States and 29.5% were determined to have been manufactured abroad, but imported into the United States. Consequently, 93% of firearms traced by ATF during FY2008 for Mexican authorities were either made in, or imported to, the United States. ", "In the 110 th Congress, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs ordered reported the M\u00e9rida Initiative to Combat Illicit Narcotics and Reduce Organized Crime Authorization Act of 2008 ( H.R. 6028 ; H.Rept. 110-673 ) on May 14, 2008. This bill would have authorized to be appropriated over three years, for FY2008 through FY2010, a total of $73.5 million to increase the number of ATF positions dedicated to Project Gunrunner ($45 million) and assign ATF agents to Mexico ($28.5 million). The House passed this bill on June 10, 2008, by a roll call vote of 311 to 106 (Roll no. 393). Similar authorizations are included in the Southwest Border Violence Reduction Act of 2008 ( S. 2867 , H.R. 5863 , and H.R. 5869 ). In the 111 th Congress, similar bills have been introduced ( S. 205 , H.R. 495 , H.R. 1448 , and H.R. 1867 )."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Arson and Explosives Budget Program", "paragraphs": ["ATF's arson and explosives budget program covers activities related to administering and enforcing federal laws governing the manufacture, importation, and distribution of explosives, as well as investigating arson cases with a federal nexus. Among law enforcement agencies, the ATF is recognized for its investigative expertise in responding to both arson and explosive incidents. The Attorney General (AG), for example, made the ATF responsible for maintaining a consolidated database of all arson and explosive incidents that occur in the United States. Reportedly, as part of the department's law enforcement information-sharing program, this and other databases are to be linked and made Web-accessible, and first responders anywhere in the United States are to have access to critical information about arson and explosive cases nationwide.", "Congress made ATF responsible for more closely regulating the explosives industry in the United States under the Safe Explosives Act. The act made ATF responsible for fully investigating all explosive thefts and losses, as well as providing background checks for licensees and permittees to prevent prohibited persons from acquiring explosives. This act also requires ATF to inspect explosive licensees and permittees every three years to ensure that all explosive materials are properly stored and accounted for. ATF reports that there are about 12,000 licensees and permittees nationwide, so that to comply with the act, about 4,000 inspections would need to be conducted by ATF annually. According to ATF, 3,291 explosives compliance inspections were conducted in FY2007, or about 28% of licensees/permittees. For FY2010, the arson and explosives allocation is $295.8 million, or 26% of the $1.121 billion appropriation.

According to the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office), the illegal diversion and smuggling of cigarettes in the United States results in an unknown but significant loss in tax revenues. In addition, ATF criminal intelligence indicates that cigarette bootlegging is a lucrative criminal venture that terrorist groups have used and would possibly use in the future to finance their activities. Neither the FY2009 or FY2010 budget requests included any new resources for this program. For FY2010, the alcohol and tobacco program allocation is $22.3 million, or 2% of the $1.121 billion appropriation."], "subsections": []}]}}
