Bush and Obama Administrations. Water sharing was addressed through IBWC technical meetings and bilateral talks between government officials; these meetings and talks were the primary forum for addressing treaty compliance and frustrations of water users in Texas with Mexico's water delivery regime. Treaty minutes were used to enhance bilateral cooperation and provide flexibility in how treaty compliance was accomplished. It remains uncertain what principles will guide and what mechanisms will be used during the Trump Administration to address water conflicts and what role enhanced cooperation (e.g., measures similar to recent binational efforts in the Colorado River basin) may play in U.S.-Mexican water sharing.", "Colorado River. The Colorado River flows through seven U.S. states before reaching Mexico; 97% of its basin is in the United States.

This figure represents about 10% of the river's average flow.", "Minute 319 is a set of binational cooperative measures in the Colorado River basin agreed upon in 2012. It provides for more cooperative basin water management, including environmental flows to restore riverine habitat. Minute 319 also provides for Mexico to share in cutbacks during shortage conditions in the basin; such cutbacks are not required under the 1944 Water Treaty. Under Minute 319, Mexico can delay its water deliveries from the United States under the 1944 Water Treaty and store its delayed deliveries in Lake Mead, thereby increasing the lake's elevation. Lake Mead elevation is the baseline used for determining shortage conditions and associated water delivery cutbacks for U.S. lower basin states. Minute 319 is to remain in force through December 31, 2017. It could be extended or replaced with a new minute, or it could be allowed to expire.

", "If Mexico fails to meet its minimum flow obligations for a five-year cycle and there is no agreement that an extraordinary drought existed, Article 24(d) of the 1944 Water Treaty provides certain mechanisms for dispute settlement. First, the IBWC has the authority \"to settle all differences that may arise between the two Governments with respect to ... application of the Treaty, subject to the approval of the two Governments.\" However, if the commissioners are unable to reach agreement on a dispute, the dispute is to be settled through diplomatic channels between the United States and Mexico. Article 24 also provides that the countries may seek recourse in any \"general or special agreements which the two Governments have concluded for the settlement of controversies.\" However, it does not appear that these mechanisms have been necessary in the past. As discussed throughout this report, the United States and Mexico previously have used the minute process and diplomatic efforts to reconcile disputes regarding the 1944 Water Treaty.", "Article 9 of the 1944 Water Treaty provides the IBWC with some flexibility regarding the diversion of water from the Rio Grande. For example, in cases of extraordinary drought occurring in one of the countries, the IBWC may permit water to be withdrawn from the other country in order to help alleviate drought conditions. Further, the IBWC may allow one country to use water allocated to the other country if it can be done \"without injury to the latter and can be replaced at some other point on the river.\" However, if the IBWC authorizes temporary diversions of water from one country to another, the use of such water does not establish a permanent right to divert.

A frequent critique of this hierarchy is that it does not include an obligation to maintain water for ecological purposes. In addition, the original 1944 Water Treaty does not contain provisions that establish requirements for water quality, but only establishes the quantity requirements outlined above. The lack of express language related to water quality led to tensions regarding salinity levels in the United States deliveries to Mexico after the Treaty was ratified.

Support for some of these investments was provided by Minute 309. Although progress has been made, demand still exceeds supply. Some stakeholders have also questioned how much water savings has been accomplished through these investments and whether the investments in Mexico resulted in improved water deliveries by Mexico under the 1944 Water Treaty.", "In coming years, unconventional oil and gas development in northeastern Mexico may represent an emerging water use in the Rio Grande basin that may influence how Mexico uses and manages water in its portion of the basin. The use of water for hydraulic fracturing as well as the disposal of wastewaters from oil and gas development also may draw attention to water quality protections and monitoring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholder Perspectives", "paragraphs": ["Some U.S. interests have contended that Mexico's water-delivery process treats U.S. deliveries as a secondary priority to meeting Mexico's own water uses; unpredictable deliveries from Mexico have angered some U.S. stakeholders because of the more prescriptive nature of the U.S. water-delivery requirement to Mexico (i.e., specified quantities are required to be delivered annually). They have pointed to high storage levels in some Mexican reservoirs as evidence to support their position. They have sought the release of waters from these reservoirs to help with the agricultural water needs in the most eastern portion of the Rio Grande basin. These interests view Mexico's high reservoir levels as its hoarding of a shared resource. ", "Other basin stakeholders have argued that Mexico's delivery flexibility was explicitly provided for in the 1944 Water Treaty to deal with the annual variability of water conditions in the basin. While the flexibility in delivery schedule can be viewed as generous to Mexico, some Mexican interests view the water delivery requirements in the Treaty as generous to the United States. They argue that although 30% of the water in the southeastern Rio Grande basin historically originated in the United States, 50% of the basin's water has been allotted to the United States. This occurs in part because U.S. tributaries are allotted 100% to the United States. ", "For Mexico, conserving water in its reservoirs can be viewed as part of a long-term drought risk management strategy. The strategy in some Mexican sub-basins to conserve water in some reservoirs during drought also may be influenced by the less developed levels of agricultural insurance and government assistance programs in Mexico. These types of programs in the United States reduce the agriculture sector's economic exposure to droughts and other natural disasters.

Since April 2013, U.S. and Mexican political officials have stepped in to support IBWC efforts to resolve the current water dispute. According to U.S. and Mexican officials, the water dispute was a topic of conversation between high-level government officials in 2013. Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto reportedly had instructed his Foreign Ministry to prioritize working with the IBWC, the U.S. Department of State, Mexico's Water Commission, and authorities from Texas to reach a mediated settlement to the dispute as soon as possible. Among the outcomes of diplomatic efforts has been an exchange of technical data to assist in developing options for future water management in the basin. In 2015, the U.S. Department of State raised water issues in meetings with Mexican officials and the IBWC organized a July 2015 meeting in Texas with representatives from the state of Texas and Mexico's national water agency.

Binational cooperation and improved knowledge of the state of border water resources was furthered through data-sharing and joint-research efforts (e.g., aquifer assessments). Binational cooperation also was integral to the pulse flow and habitat restoration pilot in the Colorado River basin and to the ongoing research and monitoring efforts to document the impacts of the flows. The binational developments in water sharing in the Colorado River basin included greater participation by stakeholders in lower basin states, the private sector, and nongovernmental organization.
