DHS is also required to construct reinforced fencing along at least 700 miles of the land border with Mexico (a border that stretches 1,933 miles). Congress has not provided a deadline for DHS to meet this 700-mile requirement, and as of the date of this report, fencing would need to be deployed along nearly 50 additional miles to satisfy the 700-mile requirement. Nor has Congress provided guidelines regarding the specific characteristics of fencing or other physical barriers (e.g., their height or material composition) deployed along the border, beyond specifying that required fencing must be reinforced.", "The primary statute authorizing the deployment of fencing and other barriers along the international borders is Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA; P.L. 104-208, div.

B), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-367), and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161, div. E). These amendments required DHS to construct hundreds of miles of new fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, and they also gave the Secretary of DHS broad authority to waive \"all legal requirements\" that may impede construction of barriers and roads under IIRIRA Section 102. These statutory modifications, along with increased funding for border projects, resulted in the deployment of several hundred miles of new barriers along the southwest border between 2005 and 2011. But in the years following, DHS largely stopped deploying additional fencing, as the agency altered its enforcement strategy in a manner that places less priority upon barrier construction.", "On January 25, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order that, among other things, instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to \"take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border ... to most effectively achieve complete operational control\" of the U.S.-Mexico border. The order defines a \"wall\" to mean \"a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.\" The order does not identify the contemplated mileage of the wall to be constructed.", "Until recently, interest in the framework governing the deployment of barriers along the international border typically focused on the stringency of the statutory mandate to deploy fencing along at least 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. But attention has now shifted to those provisions of law that permit deployment of fencing or other physical barriers along additional mileage. IIRIRA Section 102 authorizes DHS to construct additional fencing or other barriers along the U.S. land borders beyond the 700 miles specified in statute. Indeed, nothing in current law would appear to bar DHS from installing hundreds of miles of additional physical barriers, at least so long as this action was determined appropriate to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry or was deemed warranted to achieve \"operational control\" of the southern border. DHS's policy not to deploy a substantial amount of additional fencing, beyond what is expressly required by law, appeared primarily premised on policy considerations and funding constraints, rather than significant legal impediments.", "This report discusses the statutory framework governing the deployment of fencing and other barriers along the U.S. international borders.

A portion of this infrastructure is fencing that is primarily intended to prevent illegal border crossings by foot (referred to by DHS as \"pedestrian fencing\"). Other types of barriers have been installed to impede vehicles from smuggling persons or contraband into the United States (referred to by DHS as \"vehicle fencing\" ), but do not stop crossings by persons traveling on foot. In some instances, an additional layer of fencing (secondary fencing) may also be installed behind primary pedestrian fencing to further impede illegal crossings.", "The efficacy of deploying additional fencing along the border has been the subject of debate among many policymakers, particularly regarding the cost, environmental impact, and effectiveness of border fencing in comparison to alternative means of deterring illegal crossings. Largely on account of changes in DHS's border enforcement strategy and prioritization of resources during the Obama Administration, the construction of additional fencing along the land border with Mexico has largely halted. In October 2014, DHS indicated that it had constructed a total of 352.7 miles of pedestrian fence (in addition 36.3 miles of secondary fencing), and 299 miles of vehicle fencing along the southwest border. The total amount of pedestrian and vehicle fencing identified by DHS was slightly less than the 653 miles that U.S. Border Patrol had reportedly identified as appropriate for fencing and other barriers. However, it appears that further fencing would need to be deployed in order for DHS to satisfy the statutory requirement that the agency construct fencing \"along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border.\" Proposals were introduced or considered by Congress in recent years to modify statutory authorities governing DHS's deployment of fencing and other infrastructure along or near the border, including by calling for the deployment of additional fencing, but such legislation has not been enacted.", "DHS's policy not to deploy a substantial amount of additional fencing, beyond what is expressly required by law, appeared to be premised primarily on policy considerations and funding constraints, rather than significant legal impediments.

In the preceding years, authority to deploy any such barriers appears to have primarily derived from the general statutory responsibility of the Attorney General (and now the Secretary of Homeland Security) to \"guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against the illegal entry of aliens.\" Perhaps the most prominent example of this general authority being employed to construct barriers occurred in the early 1990s, when the U.S. Border Patrol (with the assistance of the Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers) installed 10-foot-high, welded-steel fencing along roughly 14 miles of the border near San Diego.", "In 1996, Congress passed IIRIRA, which expressly instructed immigration authorities to construct barriers along the international land borders to deter unauthorized migration. This requirement, contained in IIRIRA Section 102, has been amended on three occasions, and its current language can be viewed at Appendix A . Among other things, IIRIRA Section 102 in its current form", "generally authorizes DHS to construct barriers and roads along the international borders in order to deter illegal crossings at locations of high illegal entry; requires the construction of reinforced fencing covering at least 700 miles along the southwest border, though the Secretary is not required to install fencing at any particular location; authorizes for the installation of additional physical barriers and infrastructure to gain operational control of the southwest border; requires a specified amount of fencing in priority areas along the southwest border, which DHS was instructed to have completed by December 31, 2008; and provides the Secretary of Homeland Security with authority to waive any legal requirements which may impede construction of barriers and roads under Section 102.", "The following sections discuss each of these requirements, including how they have been modified over the years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Authority to Install Barriers and Roads to Deter Illegal Crossings", "paragraphs": ["Section 102(a) of IIRIRA provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security \"shall take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads ... in the vicinity of the United States border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.\" Although this provision is fashioned as a statutory command, providing that the Secretary \"shall\" take action, this command is qualified by the language that follows, which affords the Secretary the discretion to determine the appropriate amount of \"additional\" barriers to deploy, as well as the most appropriate locations to install such barriers \"to deter illegal crossings.\"", "To the extent that IIRIRA Section 102(a) constitutes a discrete, judicially reviewable command for the Secretary to construct \"additional\" fencing, immigration authorities seem to have satisfied this mandate by deploying hundreds of miles of additional barriers and roads along the border since IIRIRA was enacted in 1996. Accordingly, this provision perhaps most reasonably could be construed as conferring general authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security to construct barriers and roads along the international borders, so as to deter crossings in areas of \"high illegal entry\" (a term not defined by the statute). As discussed later in this report, more specific requirements are imposed upon the Secretary by IIRIRA Section 102(b), which requires the Secretary, in exercising the authority conferred under Section 102(a), to ensure that fencing and other barriers are deployed along specified mileage of the southwest border.", "Section 102(a) generally authorizes the construction of roads and physical barriers, without specifying any particular form that such barriers may take (e.g., reinforced fencing, multilayered fencing, or concrete barriers).

As a result, there may be some ambiguity as to the authorized distance from the border where roads and barriers may be constructed. The sole federal court to consider the usage of \"vicinity\" in IIRIRA Section 102 interpreted the term as including land \"situated near the border,\" rather than only land directly adjacent to the border.", "Some DHS regulations unrelated to the border fence have described distances up to 25 miles from a location as being within its \"vicinity.\" The Supreme Court, in non-binding dicta, also once characterized a search occurring 25 miles from the border as being within the \"general vicinity of the border,\" though it does not appear that the Court ascribed legal significance to that phrase.

In recent years, however, there have been conflicting views among some policymakers as to the firmness of the general fencing mandate . The following section discusses these views. However, any dispute regarding the inflexibility of the 700-mile requirement may be rendered moot if the Trump Administration goes forward with plans to deploy a physical barrier along a greater portion of the U.S.-Mexico border.", "The rigidity of the requirement that DHS deploy fencing along at least 700 miles of the border turns on the relationship between two clauses in IIRIRA Section 102.

One way to read the clause is simply to reflect the discretion that Congress intended to afford DHS in determining where to deploy at least 700 miles of fencing along the southwest border. As discussed previously, prior to amendments made by the 2008 Appropriations Act, the subsection had required DHS to deploy fencing along specific stretches of the southwest border that were identified within the statutory command. The new proviso could be interpreted to emphasize the discretion that DHS was afforded as a result of the revisions made by the 2008 Appropriations Act. While DHS is required to construct fencing along at least 700 miles of the border, the agency retains discretion to determine the most appropriate stretches along the 1,933 mile-land border where the fencing should be deployed.", "Relatedly, the \"notwithstanding\" proviso to the general fencing mandate affords a potential response to claims that DHS did not place fencing at a location where it would be \"most practical and effective.\" DHS is not required to install fencing at a location if \"the Secretary determines that the placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control ... at such location.\" This is phrased in a manner that suggests that the Secretary's determination not to place fencing at a location would be afforded a very high degree of deference by a reviewing court. In other words, the \"notwithstanding\" clause enables DHS to readily answer claims by parties seeking to compel some portion of the required border fencing at a location where the fencing would allegedly be \"most practical and effective.\" ", "Arguably, however, the proviso could be interpreted more broadly, to signify something other than simply the discretion that DHS possesses in determining the stretches of the border along which to construct fencing. Although the proviso is not crafted as an express waiver, the clause's usage of \"notwithstanding\" could be construed to supersede any conflicting requirements imposed by the general fencing mandate . Under a broad interpretation of the \"notwithstanding\" proviso, it might be argued that the Secretary is not necessarily required to deploy fencing along 700 miles of the border, if the Secretary concludes that fencing is the appropriate means of achieving operational control along a lesser mileage of the border.", "There are difficulties, however, with interpreting the \"notwithstanding\" proviso so broadly. As an initial matter, the proviso does not expressly state that DHS may opt to construct a lesser amount of fencing than is specified elsewhere in Section 102(b). Rather, the proviso states that DHS is not required to construct fencing \"at a particular location,\" if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the installation of that infrastructure is not appropriate for \"such location.\" As noted above, this provision could reasonably be construed to mean that, in carrying out its general fencing mandate to deploy fencing along 700 miles of the southwest border, DHS is not legally required to install any portion of this required fencing at \"any particular location.\"", "The ability to construe the proviso in more than one way may be significant. Courts typically follow the interpretive principle that a \"statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.... \" If Section 102(b)'s proviso is construed to mean that DHS is only required to deploy the amount of fencing along the border that it deems appropriate, the clause would render Section 102(b)'s mandate that fencing be deployed \"along at least 700 miles of the border\" superfluous. On the other hand, if the proviso is interpreted to mean that, in carrying out its mandate to construct fencing along at least 700 miles of the border the border, DHS is not legally required to install the required fencing at any particular location, every provision of IIRIRA Section 102(b) can be given effect.", "The legislative history behind IIRIRA Section 102(b)'s fencing requirements also seems to support a narrow construction of Section 102(b)'s \"notwithstanding\" clause. As discussed previously, the amendments made to IIRIRA Section 102(b) by the 2008 Appropriations Act were originally part of a package of amendments, approved by the Senate as part of a homeland security appropriations bill, which were intended to ensure that fencing along 700 miles of the border would be constructed expeditiously. The legislative history of these amendments' consideration, along with their plain text, seems to indicate that the amendments' purpose was to ensure that fencing was deployed along 700 miles of the border within two years. Indeed, the Senator who offered the amendment to IIRIRA Section 102(b) also co-sponsored these related amendments. While Congress ultimately opted to enact one of these amendments into law but not the other, presumably the Senate would not have originally approved both amendments if they were understood to be conflicting.", "To date, it appears that every federal court which has discussed IIRIRA Section 102(b) has described the provision in mandatory terms: DHS is required to deploy fencing along 700 miles of the southwest border, but it retains discretion to determine the appropriate locations in which to deploy the required fencing. It should be noted, however, that no court has definitively ruled that an alternative interpretation is not permissible, or closely examined the interplay between the \"notwithstanding\" proviso and the general fencing requirement. But the uniform interpretation may suggest that, as a matter of first impression, Section 102(b) may be most reasonably construed as establishing a mandate to deploy fencing along at least 700 miles of the border.", "For its part, DHS has appeared to take conflicting views regarding the firmness of IIRIRA Section 102(b)'s general fencing mandate . Initially, DHS appeared to construe the 700-mile specification as a firm requirement. In notices issued in the Federal Register in 2008 describing border fencing projects undertaken under IIRIRA Section 102(b), Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff stated that \"Congress has called for the installation of fencing, barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors on not less than 700 miles of the southwest border \u2026.\"", "In March 2009, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano wrote to the House Homeland Security Committee in response to questions regarding DHS's obligations to deploy fencing along the southwest border. Secretary Napolitano described IIRIRA as mandating that DHS construct at least 700 miles of fencing, but at least for the immediate future, DHS would focus on fence deployment in priority areas:", "As amended, the Act mandates the completion of 700 total miles of fence. It also mandates that the Secretary identify priority areas \"where fencing would be the most practical and effective in deterring smugglers and aliens attempting to gain illegal entry into the United States.\" As of March 6, 2009, DHS has completed approximately 611 of the 661 miles of fence identified by the Border Patrol as priority areas. While fencing remains an important tool in achieving effective control, it is only one element of our overall border security strategy that incorporates the proper mix of technology, personnel, and tactical infrastructure. Currently, there are no immediate funded plans to construct additional fencing.", "DHS later appeared to modify its interpretation of the IIRIRA Section 102(b), and began to describe the \"notwithstanding\" proviso as permitting it to deploy fencing along less than 700 miles of the border, if the agency deemed a lesser amount of fencing to be appropriate to achieve operational control. Indeed, four years after describing IIRIRA Section 102(b) as imposing a firm mandate, Secretary Napolitano gave testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in which she appeared to take the view that DHS was legally permitted to construct a lesser amount of fencing.", "To date, DHS has not publicly released a formal legal opinion describing its interpretation of the fencing mandate established by IIRIRA Section 102(b), or announced whether or how its opinion has changed over the years. In defending DHS against a legal challenge by the state of Arizona in 2011, in which Arizona sought to compel DHS to complete construction of fencing along 700 miles of the border (and undertake other immigration enforcement actions), the Department of Justice did not dispute the existence of this mandate, but instead argued that DHS decisions as to where to locate such fencing and the speed by which fencing was to deployed were committed to agency discretion.", "It should be noted that, in assessing the permissibility of an agency's interpretation of the laws it administers, reviewing courts typically accord the agency's interpretation of these statutes with some degree of deference, so long as the construction is reasonable. In determining whether an agency's construction of a statute is reasonable, legislative intent is a touchstone for a reviewing court's analysis\u2014an agency's interpretation might be entitled to deference when congressional intent is ambiguous and the agency's construction of the statute is reasonable. Moreover, agency interpretations of statutory requirements are usually afforded a lesser degree of deference when the agency interpretation is not the result of a notice-and-comment rulemaking process or formal adjudication. In such circumstances, the level of deference given to the agency's interpretation \"will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" The appropriate degree of deference to which DHS's interpretation of the statutory requirements imposed by IIRIRA should be afforded may be subject to differing views.", "Assuming that DHS's interpretation of the requirements under IIRIRA Section 102(b) is subject to legal challenge, the degree of deference that a reviewing court gives to the agency's interpretation may be informed by a number of factors, including whether (1) the plain text of the statute is ambiguous, and DHS's interpretation is reasonable; (2) other indicia of legislative intent favor a particular interpretation; and (3) the agency's apparent modification of its interpretation of IIRIRA Section 102(b) entitles its current interpretation to a lesser degree of deference."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Constraints on Judicial Review", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of the appropriate interpretation of Section 102(b)'s general fencing mandate and the \"notwithstanding\" proviso, the statute imposes no clear deadline for when the contemplated fencing must be deployed. In the 2011 litigation in which Arizona sought to compel DHS to complete construction of fencing required under IIRIRA Section 102(b), the reviewing federal district court dismissed Arizona's motion, in part because \"no deadline mandates completion of the fencing and infrastructure developments or any required discrete action by a specified time.\" The court further observed that, although \"the construction of the fencing and infrastructure improvements may be phrased in mandatory language,\" IIRIRA affords DHS \"a great deal of discretion in deciding how, when, and where to complete the construction.\"", "The absence of a deadline for the completion of the fencing requirements of IIRIRA Section 102(b) does not necessarily mean that DHS has no judicially enforceable legal obligation to complete any remaining fencing that is statutorily required. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), for example, provides courts with the authority to compel agency action, when such action has been \"unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\" Determining whether an agency has unreasonably delayed undertaking a required action is a fact-specific determination made on a case-by-case basis, with reviewing courts typically showing more deference to an agency when there is not a statutory deadline for agency action.", "If a court determined that DHS had unreasonably delayed fulfillment of its obligations under IIRIRA Section 102(b), it might deem the completion of at least 700 miles of fence along the southwest border to constitute \"a discrete agency action\" that it would potentially have the power to compel. The district court in the Arizona case found that completion of the border fence was not a \"discrete agency action\" that it could compel DHS to take, but it did not explain the basis for this conclusion.", "Moreover, even assuming that a court might have jurisdiction to review a claim that DHS has unreasonably delayed fence construction, it is not clear who would have standing to make such a claim. To demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must (1) show a concrete and particularized, actual or imminent injury; (2) demonstrate a fairly traceable, causal connection between the injury and the defendant's conduct; and (3) demonstrate that it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable court decision. It may be difficult for a plaintiff to identify a concrete, particularized injury that would be effectively remedied if DHS deployed fencing along an additional 50 miles of the border.

In the years following, the Secretary of Homeland Security employed this waiver authority to facilitate the construction of hundreds of miles of fencing and other infrastructure along several sections of the southwest border. More recently, however, this waiver authority has not been employed to facilitate further large-scale border projects.

More specifically, it has required fencing to be constructed along specified mileage of the southwest border. In recent years, legislative attention has primarily focused upon the fencing requirements contained in IIRIRA Section 102(b). Prior versions of Section 102(b) imposed specific requirements as to the location where fencing was to be installed and the layers of fencing to be constructed. The current provision affords DHS with significantly greater discretion to determine the appropriate location, layers, and types of fencing to be installed along the southwest border.", "Whether DHS has discretion to construct less fencing than the amount specified under IIRIRA Section 102(b), on account of a proviso that posits that the agency is not required to construct fencing at any \"particular location\" where it deems fencing to be inappropriate, has been the subject of disagreement (and apparently inconsistent views by DHS itself). While there appears to be stronger support for construing Section 102(b) to establish a firm mandate for the deployment of fencing along 700 miles of the border, with the agency retaining discretion as to the locations along the border where fencing should be installed, it is not clear whether a court would have the ability to compel DHS to install additional fencing (or that a plaintiff would have standing to bring such a claim). If Congress disagrees with DHS's implementation of the fencing mandate under Section 102(b), it would likely need to enact legislation to modify or clarify the fencing requirements found in current statute.", "But even assuming that DHS satisfies the fencing requirements under Section 102(b), the general authority conferred to the agency under Section 102(a) permits it to construct additional fencing or other barriers along the U.S. land borders. Moreover, Section 102(b) authorizes DHS to deploy additional physical barriers\u2014beyond the mandated fencing along 700 miles of the southwest border\u2014in order to obtain operational control of the southwest border. There is nothing in current statute that would appear to bar DHS from potentially installing hundreds of miles of additional fencing or other physical barriers along the border, at least so long as the action was determined appropriate to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry. In addition, IIRIRA Section 102(c) grants DHS authority to waive any legal requirement that would impede the expeditious construction of additional barriers and roads. DHS's decision not to deploy a substantial amount of additional fencing, beyond what is required under IIRIRA Section 102(b), appears primarily premised on policy considerations and funding constraints, rather than significant legal impediments. Accordingly, policymakers may deem it appropriate to review and assess the scope of DHS's authority to construct barriers, and the manner in which such authority is exercised, even after any requirements under IIRIRA Section 102(b) are satisfied.", "Appendix A.
