Congress, however, has legislated various public access laws.

App.), and the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7552b).", "These four laws provide the foundation for access to executive branch information in the American federal government. The records-access statutes provide the public with a variety of methods to examine how executive branch departments and agencies execute their missions. The meeting-access statutes provide the public the opportunity to participate in and inform the policy process. These four laws are also among the most used and most litigated federal access laws.", "While the four statutes provide the public with access to executive branch federal records and meetings, they do not apply to the legislative or judicial branches of the U.S. government. The American separation of powers model of government provides a collection of formal and informal methods that the branches can use to provide information to one another. Moreover, the separation of powers anticipates conflicts over the accessibility of information. These conflicts are neither unexpected nor necessarily destructive. Although there is considerable interbranch cooperation in the sharing of information and records, such conflicts over access may continue on occasion.", "This report offers an introduction to the four access laws and provides citations to additional resources related to these statutes. This report includes statistics on the use of FOIA and FACA and on litigation related to FOIA. The 114th Congress may have an interest in overseeing the implementation of these laws or may consider amending the laws. In addition, this report provides some examples of the methods Congress, the President, and the courts have employed to provide or require the provision of information to one another.

There were a few instances during this period when the President, arguing the need to maintain the constitutional independence and equality of his branch, vigorously resisted attempts by Congress and the courts to obtain executive records. During this same era, an active federal public printing program was established and effectively developed, making government documents more accessible.", "Following World War II, some information was available from certain federal departments and agencies. The public availability of records held by the executive branch was limited by narrow interpretation of the \"housekeeping\" statute of 1789 (now codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7301), which authorized the heads of departments to prescribe regulations regarding the custody, use, and preservation of their agencies' records, papers, and property. Prevailing law tolerated this state of affairs, offering citizens no clear avenue of access to agency information. Section 3(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7551) indicated that matters of official record should be available to the public, but added that an agency could restrict access to its documents \"for good cause found\" or \"in the public interest.\" These discretionary authorities were relied upon to restrict the accessibility of unpublished agency records and documents.", "Some congressional panels began examining information access issues and seeking responsive legislative solutions.

Pursuant to the statute, FOIA does not apply to the legislative or judicial branches of the federal government or to state, local, or tribal governments. Legislative records were not included in the bill because Congress believed that its own deliberations and proceedings were adequately subject to public observation. For example, the Constitution explicitly permits each house of Congress to keep portions of its journal of proceedings secret and disallows the questioning of Members of Congress \"in any other Place\" regarding official speech or debate. Legislators also were satisfied with the openness of federal court files and hearing rooms. Thus, the departments and agencies were the principal object of government information access reform laws.
