As the 2017 Medicare Trustees report recently noted, Medicare faces \"a substantial financial shortfall that will need to be addressed with further legislation. Such legislation should be enacted sooner rather than later to minimize the impact on beneficiaries, providers, and taxpayers.\" Several proposals have been advanced over the years to create an independent policymaking entity that would (1) be charged with limiting the future growth in Medicare expenditures; (2) be insulated from special interests and lobbyists because its members would be appointed, rather than elected; and (3) be comprised of officials who would serve for extended terms. Such officials were envisioned to be able to make \"hard decisions\" to control rising costs. Moreover, it has been assumed that these officials would possess the specialized expertise needed to make operational decisions regarding payments and focus initiatives on beneficiary interests and the longer-term financial viability of the program. Prior proposals for similar entities include the following:", "In 2000 and 2001, Senators Breaux and Frist introduced reform proposals to increase the budget of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), create separate agencies to administer parts of the Medicare program, and establish a Medicare board to manage competition among private plans and traditional Medicare (referred to as \"Breaux-Frist I,\" S. 1895 , and \"Breaux-Frist II,\" S. 358 ). In 2008, Senator Daschle proposed the Federal Health Board, modeled after the Federal Reserve Board, with broad authority over both private and public health care programs, including benefit and coverage recommendations, regulation of private insurance markets, and improvements in quality of care. In July 2009, then-President Obama submitted a draft proposal to Congress titled the Independent Medicare Advisory Council Act of 2009 (referred to as the IMAC proposal), that would have established a five-member council to advise the President on Medicare payment rates for certain providers. While the council would have had authority to recommend broader policy reforms, its authority outside of Medicare payment policy would have been limited.", "The stated goal of the IPAB, as specified in the enabling statute, is to reduce the per capita growth in Medicare expenditures.

This caused a divergence of the two trends (see Figure 1 ). The first year of the IPAB activation is no longer 2017 but is now 2021, according to the latest IPAB determination. ", "As seen in Table 1 , the actual 2016 Medicare per capita growth rate (1.11%) was less than two-thirds the value of the 2016 determination projected rate (1.79%), whereas the 2017 determination projections for the 2017 (0.44%) and 2018 (1.51%) values are each lower than the 2016 determination projections (1.10% for 2017 and 4.32% for 2018). For the CPI-U and medical CPI-U growth figures, three out of the four overlapping years (out of the five-year moving averages) show higher values in the 2017 determination compared with the 2016 determination. These differences combined to lower the five-year average Medicare per capita growth rate while raising the CPI-U-based IPAB target growth rate, switching the comparison for 2017 from positive in the 2016 determination (Medicare per capita growth rate greater than IPAB target growth rate) to negative in the 2017 determination.", "The projected future IPAB determinations can be seen in Figure 1 . Although the projected Medicare spending per capita growth rate continues to increase from 2017 to 2021, the delay in the first year in which IPAB activity would be required until 2021 is largely a result of changes in the methodology for determining the conditions that trigger IPAB activity, as specified in statute. By law, the methodology for calculating the Medicare per capita target growth rate changes from the five-year moving average of the CPI-U and the medical care expenditure category of the CPI-U for determination years through 2017 to the five-year moving average per capita gross domestic product plus 1% (GDP+1%) in 2018 and in subsequent determination years.

The ACA-established procedures accomplish this goal by mandating the immediate introduction of the legislation in Congress and by establishing strict deadlines for committee and Senate floor consideration, as well as by placing certain limits on the amending process. The procedures established by the act permit Congress to amend the IPAB-implementing legislation, but only in a manner that achieves at least the same level of targeted reductions in Medicare spending growth as is contained in the IPAB plan. The act bars Congress from changing the IPAB fiscal targets in any other legislation it considers as well, and it establishes procedures whereby a supermajority vote is required in the Senate to waive this requirement.

In other words, Congress is not required to amend or repeal the ACA to change the internal congressional procedures these procedures contain. The House or Senate can change the procedures by unanimous consent, by suspension of the rules, or by special rule reported by the House Committee on Rules and adopted by the House.

That estimate is extremely uncertain because it is not clear whether the mechanism for spending reductions under the IPAB authority will be triggered under current law for most of the next ten years; under CBO's current baseline projections such authority is projected to be triggered in 2025. However, given the uncertainty that surrounds those projections, it is possible that such authority would be triggered in more than one of those years; taking into account that possibility, CBO estimates that repealing the IPAB provision of the ACA would probably result in higher spending for the Medicare program in the years 2022 through 2025 than would occur under current law. CBO's estimate represents the expected value of a broad range of possible effects of repealing the provision over that period.", "Although the CMS Chief Actuary makes the official determination regarding the IPAB, CBO makes independent projections of IPAB activity when producing cost estimates, and their conclusions have differed.

IPAB cannot be instructed to increase spending. So, variations in those measures might lead to additional savings but could not lead to added costs. Because of the one-sided nature of the budgetary impact of variations in the spending and economic measures that determine IPAB's savings target, CBO must consider the probabilities associated with such variations when assessing the budgetary effects of possible changes in law.", "CBO concludes that \"repealing the IPAB mechanism would increase expected Medicare spending each year from 2022 through 2027, with the expected value of the net increase in Medicare spending for benefits totaling $17.5 billion over that period.\"", "CBO also has noted that the IPAB could interact with provisions in other bills for which they have provided cost estimates.
