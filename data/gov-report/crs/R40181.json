ARRA directed that the additional $85 million in HIT funds be allocated by the IHS director. IHS distributed the HIT funds for the development of existing management and EHR software, and to telehealth infrastructure and development, with 20% allocated to hardware. IHS identified non-localized HIT projects, with $61.4 million going for EHR development and deployment, $2.45 million for personal health record development, $16.96 million for telehealth and network infrastructure, and $4.0 million for administration. Of the HIT funds, IHS obligated $53.55 million as of January 29, 2010, with the remainder to be obligated by the end of FY2010. ", "Unlike the rest of HHS, IHS received its appropriations under ARRA's title for Interior and Environment appropriations (Title VII). The provision for IHS facilities in Title VII excluded IHS health facilities funds from the Interior and Environment appropriations bill's usual annual spending caps for medical equipment, and also excluded them from ARRA's general provision requiring payment of prevailing wage rates under the Davis-Bacon Act for construction and repair projects. (Separate prevailing wage rate requirements apply to IHS construction activities.) ARRA report language for Title VII allowed agencies covered by the title to expend up to 5% of ARRA funds for administrative and support costs, but also noted that oversight of IHS activities under ARRA was to be included in the general oversight of HHS's ARRA activities funded under ARRA's title for HHS appropriations (Title VIII).", "Further information on IHS's ARRA expenditures, by project category, with links to more detailed implementation plans, is available on the HHS Recovery website.
