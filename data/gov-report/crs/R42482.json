The Court determined that the basic question presented in Cromartie II was whether the legislature drew the district boundaries \"because of race rather than because of political behavior (coupled with traditional, nonracial redistricting considerations).\" In applying its earlier precedents, the Court determined that the party attacking the legislature's plan had the burden of proving that racial considerations are \"dominant and controlling.\" Overturning the lower court ruling, the Supreme Court held that the attacking party did not successfully demonstrate that race, instead of politics, predominantly accounted for the way the plan was drawn.", "In a recent case, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama , the Court clarified that in determining whether race is a predominant factor in the redistricting process, a court must engage in a district-by-district analysis instead of analyzing the state as an undifferentiated whole. It further confirmed that in calculating the predominance of race, a court is required to determine whether the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral redistricting principles to racial considerations. The \"background rule\" of equal population, however, is not a traditional redistricting principle and therefore should not be weighed against the use of race to determine predominance, the Court held. In other words, the Court explained, if 1,000 additional voters need to be moved to a particular district in order to achieve equal population, ascertaining the predominance of race involves examining which voters were moved, and whether the legislature relied on race instead of other traditional factors in making those decisions.

At that time, the Court said, the coverage formula made sense because it tailored the preclearance requirement to those geographical areas where there was evidence of voting discrimination. Therefore, the Court had concluded that the coverage formula was \"rational in both practice and theory.\"", "Almost 50 years later, however, the Court observed that \"things have changed dramatically,\" largely due to the effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act.

H.R. 2758 , the \"Redistricting Reform Act of 2013,\" would have prohibited the states from conducting more than one congressional redistricting following a decennial census and apportionment, unless a state is ordered by a court to do so in order to comply with the Constitution or to enforce the VRA, and would require the states to conduct redistricting through independent commissions. H.R. 2928 , the \"Fair and Independent Redistricting (FAIR) Act,\" would have required the Election Assistance Commission to publish a report containing the commission's best practice recommendations that states may use in establishing and operating independent commissions to develop congressional redistricting plans, to be developed in consultation with states that have implemented, or are considering implementing, such independent commissions. H.R. 2978 , the \"Let the People Draw the Lines Act of 2013,\" would have prohibited the states from conducting more than one congressional redistricting following a decennial census and apportionment, unless a state is ordered by a court to do so in order to comply with the Constitution or to enforce the VRA. It would have required states to conduct redistricting through independent commissions in accordance with certain criteria, including equality among districts, compliance with the VRA, and contiguity, without taking into consideration the political party affiliation of the district's population or the residence of any House Member or candidate, and with public notice and input; and would have provided payments to states for carrying out redistricting. H.R. 3906 , the \"Fixing America's Inconsistent Redistricting (FAIR) Act,\" would have required the states to conduct congressional redistricting through a plan developed by a nonpartisan agency of the legislative branch of the state government in accordance with certain criteria. S. 2910 , the \"Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act,\" would have prohibited the states from carrying out more than one congressional redistricting after a decennial census and apportionment, unless a state is ordered by a court to do so in order to comply with the Constitution or to enforce the VRA, and would have required states to conduct such redistricting through independent commissions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Voting Rights Act Legislation", "paragraphs": ["The following provides an overview of selected legislation that would amend the Voting Rights Act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "114th Congress", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 885 , the \"Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015\" would:", "Modify the current \"bail in\" provision in Section 3(c) of the VRA. Under current law, Section 3(c) generally provides that if a court finds that violations of the 14 th or 15 th Amendment justifying equitable relief have occurred in a state or political subdivision, the court shall retain jurisdiction for a period of time that it deems appropriate and during that period, no electoral change can be made until the court determines that the change neither has the purpose, nor will it have the effect, of denying or abridging the right to vote based on race, color, or language minority status; in addition, if the state or political subdivision submits a proposed electoral change to the Attorney General, and the Attorney General has not issued an objection within 60 days, the new electoral procedure may be enforced. The legislation would add to the types of violations that would qualify for \"bail in.\" Under the legislation, violations of the following would qualify for \"bail in\": the 14 th or 15 th Amendment; the VRA, with the exception of violations of Section 2(a) that are based on a requirement that an individual provide photo identification as a condition of receiving a ballot; or any federal voting rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. Establish a new coverage formula for Section 5 preclearance. The formula would cover any state, and all its political subdivisions, that during the past 15 years had five or more voting rights violations, at least one of which was committed by the state itself (as opposed to a political subdivision within the state). It would also cover specific political subdivisions that during the past 15 years had three or more voting rights violations, or one or more voting rights violations and \"persistent, extremely low minority turnout,\" to be determined by specified voter turnout data from the past 15 years. Each calendar year, the Attorney General would be required to update the list of voting rights violations attributable to each state and political subdivision for the previous calendar year. The legislation would provide that a voting rights violation occurred in a state or political subdivision if, in a final judgment: any court of the United States determined that a denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group in violation of the 14 th or 15 th Amendment occurred; or any court of the United States determined that a voting qualification or standard, practice, or procedure was imposed \"in a manner that resulted or would have resulted in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote based on race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in subsection (f)(2), in violation of Section 2\" of the VRA; or any court of the United States denied a request for a declaratory judgment under Section 3(c) or 5 of the VRA; or the Attorney General interposed an objection under Section 3(c) or 5, other than an objection to a voting qualification requiring photo identification Require public notice of voting changes. Within 180 days of an election, if a state or political subdivision changes any prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure that affects voting in federal elections, the legislation would require the state or political subdivision, within 48 hours of such change, to provide reasonable public notice in the state or political subdivision, and on the Internet. It would require public notice of the allocation of polling place resources, and changes relating to demographics and electoral districts, including redistricting and changing from district-based elections to at-large elections. Provide authority to assign observers. The legislation would amend Section 8(a)(2)(B) of the VRA to provide that observers could be assigned if, in the Attorney General's judgment, the assignment is necessary to enforce, in addition to the 14 th or 15 th Amendment, any provision of the VRA or any other federal law protecting the right of citizens to vote. It would amend Section 8(a) of the VRA to provide that observers could be assigned if the Attorney General certifies, with respect to a political subdivision, receipt of meritorious complaints that efforts to violate Section 203 of the VRA, (bilingual election requirements), are likely to occur or, in the Attorney General's judgment, such assignment is necessary to enforce the guarantees of Section 203. Modify standards under which a court can grant injunctive relief. Under current law, the Attorney General can institute an action for injunctive relief in cases where there has been or is about to be a violation of Section 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, or 12(b) of the VRA. The legislation would amend Section 12(d) in such a manner to permit, in addition to the Attorney General, an aggrieved person to institute an action for injunctive relief; and that violations of the following would qualify for injunctive relief: the 14 th or 15 th Amendment, the VRA, or any federal voting rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. It would require a court to grant relief if it determines that, on balance, the hardship imposed on the defendant by the relief will be less than the hardship imposed on the plaintiff if the relief were not granted. In making its determination, a court would be required to consider several factors, including whether the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure in effect prior to the change was adopted as a remedy for a federal court judgment, consent decree or admission, or served as a ground for dismissal or settlement of a claim, regarding discrimination based on race or color in violation of the 14 th or 15 th Amendment, a violation of the VRA, or voting discrimination based on race, color, or membership in a language minority group in violation of any other federal or state law; the change was adopted less than 180 days prior to the election; and the defendant failed to provide adequate notice of the change as required under federal or state law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "113th Congress", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 3899 and S. 1945 , the \"Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014,\" were identical to the bill introduced in the 114 th Congress, discussed above."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
