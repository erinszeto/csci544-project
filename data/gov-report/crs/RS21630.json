The fourth category of theemployment-based preference system is known as \"special immigrants,\" and the largest number of specialimmigrants are ministers of religion and religiousworkers.

Accompanying spouses and minorchildren of ministers of religion and religious workers are included as special immigrants.", "Prior to the Immigration Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-649 ), ministers of religion were admitted to the United States without numerical limits, and there was noseparate provision for religious workers. Religious workers immigrated through one of the more general categoriesof numerically-limited, employment-basedimmigration that were in effect at that time. The Immigration Act of 1990 amended the INA to redefine the specialimmigrant category to include ministers ofreligion and religious workers, but contained a \"sunset\"of the provision for religious workers on September 30,1994. It was subsequently extended severaltimes, most recently through September 30, 2003.
