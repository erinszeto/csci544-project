In the late 1970s and 1980s, however, the international community began to focus on VAW as a global health problem and violation of human rights. This shift was driven, in part, by an increasingly effective and well-organized grassroots movement of local, national, and international women's non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that brought international attention to the plight of VAW victims and created a more public forum for discussion of the issue.", "U.S. policymakers have generally addressed VAW as a component of other international development efforts rather than as a stand-alone issue.

Members of Congress have also addressed VAW in the context of issues such as HIV/AIDS prevention and democracy promotion. Similarly, in the last decade past and current Administrations have supported initiatives to reduce specific types and circumstances of international VAW through programs addressing humanitarian assistance and healthcare. The lack of U.S. government-wide coordination or overarching framework for addressing international VAW, however, has led some to suggest that U.S. efforts to address VAW, while important, take a piecemeal approach to addressing the problem.

It is used in this report because it is one of the most inclusive and widely agreed to international definitions. In some contexts, VAW may be used synonymously with \"gender-based violence\" (GBV), which describes violence perpetrated against an individual, regardless of sex, because of his or her gender.", "Despite the international adoption of DEVAW, governments, organizations, and cultures continue to define VAW in number of ways, taking into account unique factors and circumstances. How VAW is defined has implications for policymakers because the definition affects the types of violence that are measured and addressed. Some law enforcement organizations and national criminal codes, for instance, do not consider psychological abuse to be a form a VAW because, while harmful, in many cases it is legal.

Research has also found that women who experience violence are less likely to hold jobs and are more likely to live in poverty than those who do not experience violence. Violence and the fear of violence may cause some women to avoid public places such as schools and the workplace. Some research has also found that women may also be less likely to participate in political activities or development projects because of the threat of physical violence. Moreover, some studies have found that harassment and sexual abuse contributes to low female enrollment rates and high dropout rates from secondary schools.", "The health consequences of VAW are significant, with many victims suffering from severe physical and mental health consequences\u2014both immediate and long-term. Numerous studies have found that women and girls who experience violence have an increased risk of poor physical and reproductive health. The physical health impacts of VAW can be divided into two categories\u2014immediate and functional. Immediate consequences directly result from acts of violence, and may include fractures, gunshot wounds, bruises and lacerations, and death. Functional consequences, also referred to as \"functional disorders,\" include long-term health consequences. Researchers have linked these functional impacts to long-term physical or sexual abuse.

Some research indicates that approximately one in five women experiences rape or attempted rape during her lifetime. Surveys in some Asian and sub-Saharan African countries have found high female mortality rates due to female infanticide and nutritional neglect of young girls.", "Many incidences of violence are not reported because of the shame and fear associated with being a victim. Experts generally agree that current levels of violence reported through studies and national and local law enforcement records represent a minimum of actual VAW cases. Rates of sex trafficking, sexual violence in armed conflict situations, female infanticide, and violence in schools and the workplace, for example, are thought to be significantly under-documented, particularly in developing countries. Underreporting may occur because victims view violence as normal or expected behavior. Additionally, in certain circumstances it is difficult for researchers to collect data on VAW prevalence. In conflict situations, for example, potentially dangerous and fluid conditions may affect the ability of researchers to gain access or create conditions conducive to victims coming forward. In addition, some communities, particularly those in developing countries, lack adequate law enforcement infrastructure and reporting services, which may discourage women from reporting abuse.", "VAW can occur in the home as well as in public and private institutions, including the workplace, schools, universities, and state institutions.

Studies conclude that one of the most common forms of VAW is intimate partner violence, which can include forced sex, physical violence, and psychological abuse, such as isolation from family and friends.", "There are many different types of violence against women. Honor killings, for example, occur when women are stoned, burned, or beaten to death, often by their own family members, in order to preserve the family honor. The practice is most common in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries, though it has been reported in other parts of the world, such as Latin America and Africa. Dowry-related violence, where victims might be attacked or killed by in-laws for not bringing a large enough dowry to the marriage, is also prevalent in South Asian countries such as Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Female genital cutting (FGC), which has also been referred to as female genital mutilation (FGM) or female circumcision, is common in some African and Middle Eastern countries. The World Health Organization estimates that between 100 and 140 million women and girls have undergone a form of the procedure, and that about 3 million girls are at risk each year. Some consider child and adolescent marriage, which is particularly prevalent in parts of the Middle East and Africa, to be a form of violence against women.

What constitutes a harmful traditional practice, however, is a matter of perspective. In some cultures, for instance, both men and women may view violence as a legitimate punishment for female disobedience and as a traditional part of male-female relationships. Moreover, some women may not view forced marital sex as rape, or may endure frequent beatings from their husbands, fathers, sons or boyfriends because of cultural or familial legacies. In addition, some do not view child marriage as a harmful traditional practice\u2014instead they see it as a cultural tradition that should be respected.", "In recent years, some international advocates have increasingly argued that harmful traditional practices should be addressed through anti-VAW programs. They maintain that anti-VAW efforts should focus not only on treatment and services for victims of violence, but also on eliminating harmful traditional practices. Because some of these practices are often a part of a community's culture, however, programs that introduce treatment and services may meet resistance. Some experts argue that harmful traditional practices cannot be significantly altered without sustained, long-term efforts on the local level with national and international support.

Severe forms of trafficking in persons is defined by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA, P.L. 106-386 , as amended) as \"(A) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age; or (B) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.\" Examples of human trafficking that affect women and girls include forced labor, including forced child labor, child soldiering, and involuntary domestic servitude, and sex trafficking, including child sex trafficking. Force, fraud, or coercion can take many forms, including physical and psychological violence. Another form is debt bondage, which involves the exploitation of an initial debt to coerce trafficking victims to continue to work.", "Domestic violence is considered a risk factor particularly for sex trafficking and exploitation, and gender-based violence is believed to be a common experience of victims of human trafficking. Trafficking in women and girls gained attention in the United States and worldwide in the late 1990s, and is considered by many experts to be one of the leading criminal enterprises of the early 21 st Century. Studies have found that human trafficking occurs in every country and disproportionately affects women and girls. In 2009, a U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) study found that, on average, 65%-75% of human trafficking victims are women and 15%-25% are minors. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that women and girls account for 56% of victims of forced economic exploitation, such as domestic service, agricultural work, and manufacturing\u2014and 98% of victims of forced commercial sexual exploitation. The vulnerability of women and girls is due to a number of factors in source, transit, and destination countries. Among women victims, while there is no single victim stereotype, the majority of trafficked women are under the age of 25, with many in their mid- to late teens. Women trafficking victims also suffer higher rates of HIV/AIDS infection. In some cases, the fear of HIV infection among customers has driven traffickers to recruit younger women and girls, erroneously perceived by customers to be too young to have been infected.", "Many experts conclude that a country is more likely to become a source of human trafficking if it has recently experienced political upheaval, armed conflict, economic crisis, or natural disaster\u2014phenomena that tend to have a disproportionate impact on women and children. Even in the absence of a major crisis, inadequate legal recognition and protection, discriminatory attitudes toward women, and a lack of educational and job opportunities for women and girls in many source countries place them at-risk for trafficking. Such circumstances often intersect with other racial, ethnic, and class disparities to make poor and minority women and girls especially vulnerable to trafficking. Families in some of the most impoverished countries have sold their daughters to brothels or traffickers for the immediate payoff and to avoid having to pay their dowries in the future. In transit and destination countries, female migrant workers are often at risk of becoming trafficked because of their precarious economic and political status.
