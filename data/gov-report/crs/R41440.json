The CPP\u2014which was granted a stay by the Supreme Court on February 9, 2016\u2014establishes regulations that would reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric power plants. . States are required to reach a state-specific emission reduction goal by 2030 using various options\u2014including biopower\u2014based on guidance provided by EPA. EPA has struggled with accounting for greenhouse gas emissions from bioenergy for various reasons, and it is not clear if this struggle will continue throughout the implementation of the CPP. Further, international demand for wood pellets\u2014primarily to satisfy European Union renewable energy mandates\u2014has increased significantly. This development has prompted environmental organizations and others to express concern about the harvest of increasing amounts of biomass and about possible increases in greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of wood pellets to produce energy.

Challenges to biopower production include regulatory uncertainty (e.g., EPA's CPP), market fluctuation (e.g., natural gas prices), conversion technology development, and tax uncertainty (e.g., extension or termination of renewable energy tax credits), among other issues.

By comparison, electricity generated from fossil fuels and nuclear electric power comprised 87% of total U.S. electricity generation in the same year. When accounting solely for renewable energy sources, biopower constituted close to 12% of U.S. renewable electricity generation in 2014. ", "As a renewable energy source, biopower has benefits and challenges. One of its primary benefits is that it can provide baseload or firm power. If an electric generation plant operates as a baseload plant, the plant can run continually except for maintenance and unexpected outages. In contrast, other renewable energy sources\u2014such as wind and solar energy\u2014are generated intermittently and require either a form of power storage, such as batteries, or another power source, such as natural gas turbines, to provide firm power. Additionally, biopower is not limited to a specific biomass feedstock and therefore is relatively flexible in terms of fuel suppliers. Challenges to biopower production involve infrastructure concerns, such as siting a biopower facility in close proximity to the biomass feedstock to reduce feedstock transportation costs. Moreover, it may be difficult to obtain a continuously available feedstock supply. Lastly, there is significant legislative and regulatory uncertainty surrounding incentives for biopower.", "Congress may view biopower with new interest, especially given recent developments announced by the Obama Administration and mounting discourse between environmental groups and certain biopower feedstock groups (e.g., the forestry industry). For instance, biopower is likely to play a role in the Administration's state-specific rate-based goals for carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector (i.e., the Clean Power Plan). Additionally, international demand for certain U.S. biomass feedstocks may be a part of any future legislative discussions (e.g., demand for wood pellets by European Union [EU] member countries to meet carbon goals using biopower). ", "Congress may debate the future role for biopower in the U.S. electricity portfolio, and as such it may consider whether biopower requires new national policies or incentives to further encourage its use or if its use should be diminished. Congress also may explore biopower feedstock availability and accessibility, technological advancements, and new forms of economic support, along with other items such as environmental considerations. In considering congressional action to broaden or limit legislative authorities for biopower, an understanding of bioenergy, biopower, biomass feedstocks, federal incentives, and challenges to biopower production could be useful to policymakers. This report provides analyses on the aforementioned topics along with legislative issues. The report begins with general summaries about bioenergy and biopower\u2014including potential benefits and challenges, feedstocks, and biopower technologies.

Essentially, biomass is used to produce electricity (biopower), heat (biothermal), and fuels (biofuel). Biomass also can be used to produce combined heat and power (CHP). ", "Using bioenergy has several advantages and several challenges. One advantage to using bioenergy is its classification as a renewable energy source because it uses biomass feedstocks, which may be replenishable in a short time frame relative to fossil fuels. Bioenergy also has the potential to contribute to rural economic development and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The carbon status of most bioenergy types has thus far been treated as neutral or as having a low impact, although this assumption has been questioned. Another benefit is the potential for the production of coproducts at bioenergy facilities, which may be of more value than the bioenergy being produced. ", "Challenges to bioenergy production include limited biomass feedstock availability and, in some cases, limited access to the feedstock. Further, certain biomass feedstocks (e.g., corn stover) may have to be harvested in a way that the soil and water nutrient value they provide to the landscape is not diminished. Moreover, the feedstock condition and arrangement may make it difficult and costly to transport and process for energy generation. In some instances, biomass feedstock storage can be an issue, especially during periods of peak demand. Lastly, biomass feedstocks on average have a lower energy content than fossil-fuel feedstocks, often requiring more feedstock to match the energy potential of fossil fuels.", "Bioenergy is unique among renewable energy sources because it can come in three diverse forms. Each form, thus far, has received a different amount of attention. However, there are some aspects of all bioenergy forms that could be addressed in tandem. For example, as biomass is the foundation of any form of bioenergy, the initial stages of the bioenergy pathway\u2014feedstock production, harvest, and transport\u2014all bear the same environmental and sustainability concerns. Although some stakeholders may voice their concerns more strongly for one bioenergy form than for another, often the concerns are transferable to other bioenergy forms (e.g., the impact of land use change on biofuel production). Congress, the executive branch, and others have tended to focus on one bioenergy form at a time, at the exclusion of others. For instance, in the last decade, legislative, research, and industrial attention have focused more on biofuels (e.g., corn-based ethanol) than on other bioenergy forms. Such focus may occur due to the regulatory requirements necessary for the bioenergy end use as opposed to the bioenergy supply. One issue for Congress is that bioenergy can cross multiple committee jurisdictional boundaries, possibly making it harder to reach a consensus on a more comprehensive approach to bioenergy.

However, other biomass feedstocks have higher logistical and transaction costs associated with their removal and transport (e.g., forestry residues). An overarching concern is maintaining an environmentally and economically sustainable biomass feedstock supply. Collecting or harvesting biomass without regard to replenishment, or in an otherwise unsustainable manner, may lead to the deterioration of certain natural resources, such as soil erosion or the depletion of forested land. Thus far, biomass used for biopower is not subject to the same constraints as biomass used for liquid transportation fuels under federal statute. Additionally, feedstock diversity is a formidable challenge to biopower growth, because cultivation, harvest, storage, and transport vary according to the feedstock type and conventional agriculture is based on mass production of one crop. Another challenge is determining the amount of available feedstock due to market fluctuations and weather variability.

Permitting and transmission for any new or existing power facility also may be difficult given recent federal actions.

The condensed, uniform size of wood pellets\u2014about one inch in length with the diameter roughly matching that of a pencil\u2014makes them easy to transport and store. Wood pellet challenges include the potential to overheat and spontaneously combust when stored and the dust produced during pellet production, which has the potential to become a combustible fuel source. ", "Until recently, U.S. wood pellet production, consumption, and global trade data did not garner much attention, partly because wood pellets were used mostly at a small scale for domestic residential heating. Thus, wood pellet data collection had been disparate and opaque. However, today wood pellet production is on an upswing, with approximately half of U.S. wood pellets being exported for use at large power facilities. International policy, particularly the EU's 2009 Renewable Energy Directive (RED), has encouraged greater use of wood pellets. For a variety of reasons\u2014economic, environmental, and more\u2014better wood pellet data is now available to monitor the fuel's use and trade.

They contend that measures should be implemented to ensure more participation in rigorous forestry sustainability certification programs, prevent harvesting of whole trees, account for the future carbon storage capacity of a forest, and better regulate certain practices occurring in private forests. Some in the wood pellet industry disagree, asserting that they use low-grade wood, mill residues, tops and limbs, and thinnings. Further, they state that any use of whole trees is limited to certain situations and that their practices do not contribute to deforestation. Additionally, several entities within the EU are in the midst of discussing sustainability criteria for biomass energy, including wood used for pellet production. It is not yet known if such a development could result in a hardship for the U.S. wood pellet sector.
