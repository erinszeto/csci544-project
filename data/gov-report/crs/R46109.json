Specifically, while government agencies are, with certain exceptions, subject to management laws and regulations designed to ensure accountability, transparency, and fairness, agency-related research foundations and corporations are generally exempt from them. This situation may raise questions about how Congress and federal agencies can protect the public interest and ensure confidence in the decisionmaking of such entities. Additionally, recent concerns that some have raised related to conflict of interest, the potential for industry influence, and questions about effectiveness may prompt further examination of these entities.", "Among the options that Congress might consider are:", "crafting a broad, general nonprofit research foundation authority that federal science agencies could draw on to create an entity that meets their specific needs; examining the existing authorities of individual federal science agencies and, as appropriate, supplementing those authorities to increase the flexibility of an agency to enter into public-private partnerships; creating additional agency-related nonprofit research foundations on a case-by-case basis, tailored to the specific needs of particular federal science agencies; and maintaining the status quo, i.e., allowing agency-related nonprofit research foundations and corporations that currently exist to continue, and requiring other federal agencies to use their existing authorities to enter into public-private R&D partnerships and transfer federal technologies to the marketplace."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress maintains an ongoing interest in the pace of U.S. innovation and technological advancement due to its influence on the economy, national security, public health, and other national goals.

These changes have led some to call for new approaches and the expansion of existing mechanisms to help the United States maintain its leadership role in innovation and technology. One mechanism that has received some attention is the possibility of establishing additional agency-related entities that would facilitate the use of private donations in federally generated research projects. In addition, such entities might play a role in the commercialization of new technologies. The potential establishment of such entities in statute raises several questions: What kinds of organizations has Congress established in the past to address similar needs in the federal government? What are the strengths and weaknesses of these potential models? What are the opportunities and risks of developing a new entity for federal R&D using one of these models?", "The varied organizational arrangements of the executive branch have resulted from more than two centuries of legislative and administrative actions. These arrangements reflect a diversity of viewpoints, policy preferences, and political goals among the thousands of elected and appointed officials who have played a role in creating and shaping them. During the middle of the 20 th century, hybrid organizational forms\u00e2\u0080\u0094incorporating both public and private characteristics\u00e2\u0080\u0094began to grow in number. These organizational forms, sometimes collectively referred to as \"quasi-governmental entities,\" differ from one another in their specific features, relationship to the federal government, funding mechanisms, purposes, levels of accountability to elected officials, and use of private sector incentives and efficiencies, among other characteristics. Agency-related nonprofit research foundations and corporations fall into this category of organizations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background on Quasi-Governmental Entities", "paragraphs": ["Working with successive administrations, Congress has established, or provided for the establishment of, many quasi-governmental entities. Some of the considerations that contributed to their creation and development were linked to political and policymaking dynamics that were idiosyncratic to the specific time and issue at hand. Nonetheless, observers have identified some common purposes for, and expected benefits of, establishing such entities:", "providing for stable funding during federal budget tightening and uncertainty; freeing a program from general government management laws, particularly those pertaining to caps on personnel and compensation; harnessing business principles and mechanisms with the aim of providing government-driven solutions without the \"red tape\" associated with the federal bureaucracy; and providing authorities tailored to the desired mission and functions that allow flexible approaches not typically allowed under statutes or regulations, such as those in the area of financial management.", "In comparison to traditional government agencies, quasi-governmental entities of various kinds have been touted for their potential to harness business-like entrepreneurial incentives and drive, greater managerial flexibility, and increased employee input in decisionmaking to better carry out the entity's responsibilities.", "As quasi-governmental organizations have grown in number and variety, some observers have criticized the exemption from government management laws of many such entities. A complex legal framework has been established over time to guide government agencies so that their actions adhere to the values of democratic governance, such as accountability, transparency, and fairness. It might be difficult for stakeholders to verify on an ongoing basis that the activities of a quasi-governmental entity, established by statute and vested with the power to carry out some public purpose, are directed to the public good rather than private gain without the routine accountability and transparency provided by this legal framework. Many of these laws and regulations specify the processes by which action must be taken. Some have criticized such governmental processes as \"red tape,\" particularly in cases where they appear to have been applied overzealously, slowly, or seemingly without regard for an individual's or business's need for a service or flexibility. Arguably, quasi-governmental entities involve a tradeoff: What appears to some to be red tape during an administrative encounter may appear to others to be an essential accountability or transparency mechanism.", "Most federal agencies are funded through the annual appropriations process, and Congress has sometimes used the \"power of the purse\" to influence agency priorities and activities. Most federal agencies are headed by appointees of the President subject to Senate advice and consent, and the confirmation process provides Senators with an opportunity to discuss agency issues and concerns with these leaders. Congress establishes, or provides for the establishment of, quasi-governmental entities, but it might not have the same level of influence over them as it does over conventional federal agencies. Congressional committees have reviewed the actions and structure of some of these entities during oversight hearings, and Congress has sometimes enacted changes to their enabling statutes. At the same time, many quasi-governmental entities do not receive appropriated funds and are not led by advice and consent appointees, shielding them from two potential avenues of congressional influence. ", "In addition to criticisms related to oversight, accountability, and transparency, some have questioned whether private sector management techniques are always appropriate for managing government functions. Most public administration scholars have agreed that public enterprises can benefit from some general management mechanisms developed in the private sector. Some scholars have argued, however, that the blanket application of private sector management assumptions to the public sector might miss important differences between the two. ", "These differences include, for example, the role of constitutional law. As one public administration scholar stated, \"although politicians, reformers, and media pundits often call for running government like a business, constitutional law makes the public's business very different from others.\" Some observers also have noted differences in the \"bottom line\" of the two sectors, and the consequent complexity associated with measuring performance in accomplishing a public purpose. ", "This report discusses a specific category of quasi-governmental entities: agency-related nonprofit organizations that have been established in statute for the express purpose of advancing or facilitating the R&D mission of a federal agency. It describes the characteristics of several illustrative organizations of this type. It examines the available record of these entities' performances and discusses related praise and criticism of these organizational arrangements.

It also required the board to ensure that the bylaws do not compromise, appear to compromise, or reflect unfavorably on NIH and the ability of NIH to fulfill its responsibilities to the public. Furthermore, Congress made the board of directors accountable for \"the integrity of the operations of the Foundation\" through the development and enforcement of standards of conduct, financial disclosure statements, and conflict of interest policies and procedures.", "FNIH operations and activities have been funded through a combination of private donations and a share of NIH appropriations. According to FNIH, since its initial incorporation in 1996, the foundation has raised more than $1 billion in support of NIH's mission. According to tax filings, FNIH provided NIH with $22.6 million in assistance in 2017 and $16.9 million in 2016. Congress authorized the Director of NIH to \"provide facilities, utilities and support services to the Foundation if it is determined by the Director to be advantageous to the research programs of the National Institutes of Health\" and to transfer no less than $500,000 and no more than $1.25 million of the agency's annual appropriations to FNIH.

The CIA is the executive agent for IQT. Federal agencies, primarily the CIA, provide funding to IQT, which in turn provides investments to selected firms based on needs articulated by the CIA. The In-Q-Tel Interface Center (QIC), a small group of CIA employees, serves as a liaison between the CIA and IQT.", "IQT investments generally range from $500,000 to $3 million. IQT asserts that for each dollar it has invested, private investors have provided $16. IQT pairs its investment with a development agreement in which IQT and the company work together to adapt the technology to meet IC needs. If successful, IC customers can buy the product directly from the company. IQT asserts that its model delivers rapid, cost-effective solutions:", "IQT identifies and adapts \"ready-soon\" technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0094off-the-shelf products that can be modified, tested, and delivered for use within 6 to 36 months depending on the difficulty of the problem. Approximately 75% of our deals involve multiple agencies from the [IC] and defense communities, which means a more cost efficient use of taxpayers' dollars.", "Profits from the liquidation of an IQT investment are allocated between additional IQT investing activity and other strategic information technology initiatives defined by the CIA, in accordance with a memorandum of understanding between the CIA and IQT.", "Army Venture Capital Initiative. In January 2002, Congress directed the Secretary of the Army to establish a venture capital investment corporation using $25 million previously appropriated to the Army for basic and applied research. The Army and Arsenal Venture Capital (formerly Military Commercial Technologies, Inc. (MILCOM)) jointly manage the AVCI through OnPoint Technologies, LLC (OPT), a not-for-profit corporation. In this relationship, the Army serves as strategic investor; provides guidance on technology priorities to OPT through its Communications Electronics Command (CECOM); and, through CECOM, provides administrative and contractual support to OPT. Army funds provided to OPT support investments and OPT expenses. Proceeds from the liquidation of investments are used in part to pay compensation to Arsenal Venture Capital with the balance used for new investments. In addition to providing $25 million in FY2002, Congress appropriated $12.6 million in FY2003 and $14.3 million in FY2005 for the AVCI. In addition, in FY2004, the Army reprogrammed $10 million for the AVCI. Since FY2005, Congress has not appropriated funds to the AVCI.", "AVCI invests alongside other VC firms at all stages of development, making investments of $500,000 to $2 million. AVCI asserts that for each dollar it has invested, private investors have provided $22. Focused initially on innovative power and energy technologies, AVCI's technology focus areas have expanded to include emerging technologies such as autonomy, cyber, health information systems, and advanced materials. AVCI seeks to foster the development of these technologies and their transfer to the soldier while attaining net returns for the investing organizations from commercial and defense markets. AVCI asserts that it is able to engage technology firms outside the traditional reach of DOD.", "Red Planet Capital. In September 2006, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced a partnership with Red Planet Capital, Inc., a non-profit organization, to establish a venture capital fund, Red Planet Capital (RPC). The fund was \"to support innovative, dual-use technologies [to] help NASA achieve its mission, [and] better position these technologies for future commercial use.\" ", "NASA was to provide strategic direction and technical input to RPC, while the organization's principals were to identify investment opportunities, perform due diligence, and manage its equity investments. NASA intended to invest approximately $75 million over five years. Congress provided $6 million for RPC in FY2007. In FY2008, President George W. Bush proposed termination of the program: ", "Government-sponsored venture capital funds provide a mechanism for Government agencies to indirectly take equity stakes in private firms, which potentially creates significant conflicts of interest and market distortions. The Administration believes that this mechanism poses difficult challenges to Government oversight and should only be used in exceptional situations\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The Administration further evaluated the fund and determined that, for NASA, these funds are better directed towards current priorities that will produce cost-effective, ascertainable outcomes.", "Congress provided no further appropriations for RPC. According to NASA, the fund was eliminated before it took an equity stake in any company. A RAND Corporation study states that RPC made a single investment prior to its termination, though it did not specify the amount."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
