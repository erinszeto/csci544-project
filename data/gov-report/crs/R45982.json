The legislation also included a separate Division B (Health and Human Services Extenders and Other Matters), which extended multiple federal health care programs that were otherwise set to expire September 30, 2019, and provided for some adjustments to additional health programs. This report examines only Division A, the continuing resolution (CR) portion of the legislation. On September 27, 2019, the President signed H.R. 4378 into law ( P.L. 116-59 ).", "Division A of H.R. 4378 was termed a CR because it provided temporary authority for federal agencies and programs to continue spending in FY2020 in the same manner as a resolution enacted separately for that purpose. It provides temporary funding for the programs and activities covered by all 12 of the regular appropriations bills, since none of them had been enacted prior to the start of FY2020. These provisions provide continuing budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2019 by that fiscal year's applicable appropriations acts, with some exceptions. It includes both budget authority that is subject to the statutory discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense spending and also budget authority that is effectively exempt from those limits, such as that designated for \"Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism.\"", "Funding under the terms of the CR is effective October 1, 2019, through November 21, 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0094roughly the first seven weeks of the fiscal year.", "The CR generally provides budget authority for FY2020 for most projects and activities at the rate at which they were funded during FY2019. Although it is effective only through November 21, the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides an annualized projection of the discretionary budget authority provided in the measure. As provided in P.L. 116-59 , the amount subject to the statutory discretionary spending limits is approximately $1.253 trillion. When spending that is effectively not subject to those limits (Overseas Contingency Operations, disaster relief, emergency requirements, and program integrity adjustments) is also included, the CBO estimate is $1.345 trillion.", "CRs frequently include provisions that are specific to certain agencies, accounts, or programs. These include provisions that designate exceptions to the general funding rate formula or otherwise single out a program, activity, or purpose for which any referenced funding is extended (typically referred to as \"anomalies\"), as well as provisions that have the effect of creating new law or changing existing law (including the renewal of expiring provisions of law). The CR includes a number of such provisions, each of which is briefly summarized in this report. CRS appropriations experts for each of these provisions are indicated in the accompanying footnotes and Table 1 .

CRs also contain numerous provisions that may operate as limitations or restrictions to preserve Congress's prerogative to make funding decisions once final bills are agreed to. Numerous exceptions (or anomalies) are also often included in CRs to provide changes to funding rates, or for other purposes, to address special circumstances that may result with only temporary funding. Other rescissions or cancellations of discretionary budget authority may also be included in CRs.", "CRs may be enacted for a period of days, weeks, or months.

The \"duration\" of a CR refers to the period of time for which budget authority is provided for covered activities. 3. CRs usually fund projects and activities using a \"rate for operations\" or \"funding rate\" to provide budget authority at a restricted level but do not prescribe a specified dollar amount. The funding rate for a project or activity is based on the total amount of budget authority that would be available annually for that project or activity under the referenced appropriations acts and is prorated based on the fraction of a year for which the CR is in effect, but it may also be affected by other factors that can have an effect on spending patterns over the course of a fiscal year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coverage", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 4378 (\u00c2\u00a7101) covers all 12 of the regular annual appropriations bills by generally providing continuing budget authority for FY2020 through November 21, 2019, for projects and activities funded in FY2019.", "Budget authority is provided by the CR under the same terms and conditions as the referenced FY2019 appropriations acts (\u00c2\u00a7103).

Once discretionary spending is enacted, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) evaluates that spending relative to the spending limits and determines whether sequestration is necessary.
