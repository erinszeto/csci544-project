In 2012, in his FY2013 budget, President Obama proposed the creation of a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) to help accelerate innovation by investing in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, and to support manufacturing technology commercialization by bridging the gap between the laboratory and the market. The proposal included a request for $1 billion in mandatory funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the establishment of up to 15 NNMI Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs).

The RAMI Act directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Network for Manufacturing Innovation program at NIST. The RAMI Act includes provisions authorizing NIST, the Department of Energy (DOE), and other agencies to support the establishment of IMIs and establishing and providing for the operation of a Network for Manufacturing Innovation. NIST is authorized to use up to $5.0 million per year of appropriated funds for FY2015-FY2024 to carry out its responsibilities under the act. The Department of Energy is authorized, but not required, to transfer to NIST up to $250.0 million of appropriated funds over the same FY2015-FY2024 period. The Secretary of Commerce is also authorized to accept funds, services, equipment, personnel, and facilities to carry out the program. The act also establishes a National Office of the Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program at NIST to oversee and carry out the program.", "Prior to enactment of the RAMI Act, President Obama used existing authorities and regular appropriations of the Department of Defense (DOD) and DOE to establish several NNMI-like institutes. Under the RAMI Act, these and other institutes may be designated as part of the Network for Manufacturing Innovation. As of the date of this report, 14 IMIs have been established, eight by DOD, five by DOE, and one by the Department of Commerce.", "Enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) provided a new impetus for congressional oversight as appropriations were made explicitly for the first time for the NNMI.

Among the issues of interest are the selection of focus areas for the new centers and the integration of these centers with existing ones. Another area of possible congressional attention is to the network of IMIs.

Manufacturing accounts for about 12% of the nation's gross domestic product (G DP). Manufacturing enterprises directly employ approximately 12 million U.S. workers and indirectly support millions of additional jobs in other industries. Manufacturers also fund about two-thirds of the nation's industrial research and development (R&D), providing a foundation for technological innovation and continued U.S. technological leadership. Total average compensation (wages and benefits) for manufacturing workers ($81,347) exceeds total average compensation for all workers ($71,161). With respect to national defense, the United States depends heavily on its manufacturing base to produce military weapons, aircraft, ground vehicles, ships, and other equipment.", "Analysts hold divergent views of the health of U.S. manufacturing. Some see the sector as vibrant and healthy. Those holding this view tend to point to, among other things, the sector's strong growth in output and productivity, as well as the United States' world-leading share of global manufacturing output. From its low point in March 2010, U.S. manufacturing employment has grown by 885,000 (7.7%) to a recent high of 12.338 million in January 2016 (though it subsequently experienced a drop of 73,000 jobs through October 2016).", "Other analysts, however, believe that the U.S. manufacturing sector is at risk. Those holding this view express concerns about a \"hollowing-out\" of U.S. manufacturing resulting from the decision of many U.S. manufacturers to move production activities offshore; policy and program efforts of other nations to attract and grow manufacturing companies; and a decades-long trend in declining U.S. manufacturing employment.", "The 2007-2009 recession and the relatively slow subsequent pace of recovery contributed to increased concerns about the health of U.S. manufacturing. Some stakeholders and policymakers advocate for changes to improve the business environment, including reducing tax and regulatory burdens on manufacturers and reforming the nation's tort laws. ", "Other stakeholders and policymakers support more direct and focused efforts funded by the federal government, such as those that aim to help a particular technology or industry. In particular, President Obama has undertaken and proposed the creation and funding of a variety of initiatives (e.g., the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, the National Robotics Initiative, and the Materials Genome Initiative) to help address concerns about U.S. manufacturing. One of the President's key proposals to help U.S. manufacturers is the establishment of a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI). ", "The NNMI is the main focus of this report. The report begins with a discussion of the NNMI proposal and subsequent legislative action. It reviews related institutes established during the legislative debate.

In March 2010, U.S. manufacturing employment fell to its lowest level (11.5 million) since March 1941, down more than 41% from its peak of 19.6 million in June 1979.", "On the other hand, some analysts argue that long-term employment losses in manufacturing are inevitable and that federal policy should focus elsewhere. In a July 2014 Wall Street Journal article, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers argued that \"the economic challenge of the future will not be producing enough. It will be providing enough good jobs.\" Summers described the loss of manufacturing jobs over the long term as \"inexorable and nearly universal,\" a result of technology and market forces mirroring the earlier loss of agricultural jobs, only this \"change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy.\" Summers did not offer a prescriptive alternative, but rather stated the need for government policies and approaches that \"meet the needs of the information age.\" ", "In support of the President's proposal for a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, DC-based think tank, articulated a variety of reasons why there is a need for an NNMI-like federal program in a report titled Why America Needs a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation . Among the ITIF's assertions:", "An NNMI-like program would address two issues important to U.S. manufacturing competitiveness: technology and talent.

Other types of market failures\u2014for example, the need for large-scale capital investments and training outlays that may require many years to pay off\u2014may \"limit the scale-up of innovative manufacturing processes, the installation of new capital equipment, and the full integration of manufacturing systems across supply chains.\"", "Supporters of the program may note that foreign governments engage in a variety of policy and programmatic activities designed to attract U.S. and other manufacturing firms to their countries; subsidize and protect domestic producers; or \"repress labor, condone intellectual property theft, and manipulate their currency values in order to expand their manufacturing footprint.\" Meanwhile, the federal government provides little support for manufacturing-focused U.S. based research activities: Such funding is scattered among multiple agencies and \"has rarely been a priority for any of them.\" This position contends that U.S. academia, in general, does not incentivize engineering advances and practical problem-solving. Instead, the emphasis on \"engineering as a science\" in U.S. academic engineering programs focuses on \"originality and breakthroughs.\"", "Others may view the U.S. manufacturing sector as vibrant and healthy without a need for the NNMI.

As noted in the introduction, between March 2010 and December 2015, manufacturing employment added approximately 878,000 jobs, growing to 12.3 million. Many analysts attribute the previous long-term trend in U.S. manufacturing employment losses to broader global technology and business trends, such as technology-driven productivity improvements, increases in capital-labor substitution, movement of labor-intensive production activities to lower-wage regions of the world, foreign competition in manufactured goods in both U.S. and foreign markets, and disaggregation of work processes resulting in the contracting of service work previously performed by employees of manufacturing firms as well as the offshoring of manufacturing activities.

The appropriate role of the federal government in fostering technological innovation or supporting a particular company, industry, or industrial sector (e.g., manufacturing) has been the focus of a long-running national policy debate. Views range from those who believe that the federal government should take a hands-off or minimalist approach to those who support targeted federal investments in promising technologies, companies, and industries. While there has been broad agreement on federal support for fundamental research, the consensus in favor of federal support frays as technology matures toward commercialization.

For such reasons, the manufacturing sector has received the attention of the federal government since the nation's founding. ", "Critics of a strong federal role provide a variety of arguments. For example, some contend that the federal government should not favor or subsidize particular companies, industries, or technologies, asserting that such interventions skew technology development and competition by replacing decisions of companies, capital providers, and researchers with the judgment of government bureaucrats or politicians (sometimes referred to as the government \"picking winners and losers\"). Those who hold this view generally assert that this may result in inefficient allocation of capital, development and deployment of inferior technologies, and political favoritism (sometimes referred to as \"crony capitalism\"). Others assert that such interventions often represent a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to already-prosperous companies and their shareholders (sometimes referred to as \"corporate welfare\"). ", "Some critics may assert that the role envisioned for the NNMI should be performed by the private sector; that the NNMI would be ineffective or counterproductive; that the funds that would go to the NNMI should be used to support manufacturing in other ways; that the funds should be used for different federal functions altogether; or that the funds should be directed toward deficit reduction. ", "Others may prefer an approach that is more technology- or industry-neutral, such as reducing costs and other burdens on manufacturers by reducing taxes, regulations, and frivolous lawsuits. ", "Even some advocates of a strong federal role in supporting U.S. manufacturing may prefer alternative approaches, including increasing federal funding for manufacturing R&D, providing grants and loan guarantees for domestic manufacturing, or subsidizing production of products for which there are positive benefits for the nation that cannot be captured by the manufacturer.", "Both supporters and opponents may believe that the NNMI is, in part or in whole, duplicative of other federal programs, such as the Manufacturing Extension Partnership; or, as a new and separate program, represents an increasing fragmentation of federal efforts to help manufacturers. Some may question whether additional federal funding will produce more innovation and whether and how the U.S. manufacturing base will effectively absorb such innovations.", "When considered in the context of the overall U.S. economy, manufacturing output, or federal spending, the scale of the NNMI may seem relatively small.
