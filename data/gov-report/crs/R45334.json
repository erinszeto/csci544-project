Section 1343 of the ACA established the risk adjustment program, which is designed to assess charges to health plans that have relatively healthier enrollees compared with other health plans in a given state. The program uses collected charges from plans with comparatively healthy enrollees to make payments to plans in the same state that have relatively sicker enrollees.

", "Under the ACA's permanent risk adjustment program, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established criteria and methods to determine the actuarial risk of plans within a given state in order to make payments and assess charges. Enrollees in health plans differ in their degree of risk based on such factors as their health status, with sicker individuals considered high risk and expected to have greater health costs than healthier, or low-risk , individuals. Individuals who perceive themselves as high risk, as opposed to those who perceive themselves as low risk, are likely to have different behaviors related to health insurance. High-risk individuals, who perceive that they will need more health services, may be more motivated to seek out and enroll in plans with more comprehensive coverage and benefits than might low-risk individuals. Since individuals have more information about their own health status than does an insurer, they are able to consider this information when choosing a health plan; by contrast, an insurer is not able to take this information into account when establishing coverage, benefits, and premiums for the plan. The risk adjustment program is intended to reduce the likelihood that an insurer will aim to enroll only low-risk individuals and help ensure that price differences of plans reflect the plan design and benefits available rather than risk. ", "Risk adjustment is a risk mitigation strategy that has been incorporated into other insurance programs. It is a component of the Medicare program, as well as some state Medicaid programs. Other countries with regulated, private health insurance markets, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, and South Africa, also have risk adjustment mechanisms. In addition, risk adjustment was part of the Commonwealth Care program in Massachusetts from 2009 through 2016. Although risk adjustment programs may have similar aims, program designs may vary. HHS used the Medicare risk adjustment program as the basis for the ACA risk adjustment program, although HHS made modifications especially to account for the different populations in the programs.", "The risk adjustment program is the only permanent program that was part of the three ACA risk mitigation programs, including the transitional reinsurance program and the temporary risk corridors program.

In any type of insurance arrangement, all parties seek to manage their risk, subject to certain objectives (e.g., coverage and/or profit goals). In health insurance, consumers (or patients, as insurance enrollees) and insurers (as sellers of insurance) approach the management of health insurance risk differently. From the consumer's point of view, a person (or family) buys health insurance to protect against financial losses resulting from the unpredictable use of potentially high-cost medical care. The insurer employs a variety of methods to manage the risk it takes on when providing health coverage to consumers to assure that the insurer operates a viable business (e.g., balancing premiums against the collective risk of the covered population). The insurer uses these methods when pooling risk so that premiums collected from all enrollees generally are sufficient to fund claims (plus administrative expenses and profit). ", "Where insurers have discretion, they are likely to act in their own financial self-interest to limit their exposure to risk. Prior to the ACA, insurers in the individual and small-group markets could assess the risk of an individual or group applying for insurance coverage using characteristics such as health status, gender, and age with certain exceptions. Using such characteristics, insurers could charge higher premiums for higher-risk individuals, or they could deny coverage if an individual represented too much risk, so long as the denial of coverage was permitted under state law. Similarly, before the ACA, an individual with a preexisting condition may have had that condition excluded from coverage or coverage for a preexisting condition may have been delayed for a period of time (e.g., 6 to 36 months, or indefinitely) depending on state laws and other federal requirements. The converse was also true\u2014insurers had been able to charge lower premiums to lower-risk individuals based on health status, gender and age, with some exceptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Why Is the Mitigation of Health Insurance Risk and Uncertainty Relevant Under Current Federal Law?", "paragraphs": ["The ACA includes provisions that aim to restructure the private health insurance market by implementing several market reforms targeting the individual and small-group markets, including some that impose requirements on health insurance plans. As part of a larger set of private health insurance market reforms, the ACA requires private health insurers to provide coverage to individuals regardless of health status, medical history, and preexisting conditions. Prior to the ACA, insurers in the small-group market already were prohibited from denying coverage based on these factors. Under current federal law, insurers can adjust premiums based solely on certain factors (i.e., individual or family enrollment, geographic rating area, tobacco use, and age). ", "Additional market reforms aim to expand the pool of individuals seeking to purchase health insurance coverage. Under the ACA reforms, some individuals may be eligible for financial assistance (i.e., premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies) through the health insurance exchanges (also known as the marketplaces ), which may make these individuals more likely to purchase health insurance. In addition, the ACA, as originally enacted, had required that most individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty for noncompliance (i.e., the individual mandate ), but the penalty associated with the individual mandate will be effectively eliminated beginning in 2019. The expanded pool created by the ACA reforms contributes to the uncertainty that insurers face. (Uncertainty was particularly high in the early years of ACA implementation.) Much of the uncertainty centers on the types of individuals who may or may not seek coverage in the expanded pool. For example, to what extent will healthy individuals decide to seek coverage in addition to unhealthy individuals? Also, will the expanded pool extend to individuals who previously were uninsured and/or may have delayed receiving health care services? Furthermore, what will be the demand for health care services for this expanded pool of individuals?", "In addition to the risks and uncertainty described above, one phenomenon that exists in health insurance markets is that individuals who expect or plan for high use of health services are more likely to seek out coverage and enroll in plans with more benefits than individuals who do not expect to use many or any of the health services.

However, under current federal law, insurers in the individual and small-group markets are unable to set premiums based on gender or health status, and insurers are limited in how much they can vary premiums by age. Notwithstanding this change, and although insurers are limited by other ACA requirements, insurers still could attempt to gain a competitive advantage by avoiding individuals who expect or plan for high use of health services (e.g., sicker, older individuals) by using benefit designs, networks, formularies, and/or marketing techniques that are not likely to appeal to these individuals.", "Financial assistance, such as premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies (and the individual mandate, though the penalty has been effectively eliminated), are intended to encourage enrollment for all individuals and to reduce the risk that only individuals who expect or plan to have high use of health services will purchase health insurance. However, some risk remains, and an insurer may experience losses if it enrolls a disproportionate share of enrollees with high health care claims costs during the year.

Under the risk adjustment program, an insurer can set premiums for plans with sicker-than-average (i.e., high-risk) enrollees lower than the expected cost of claims because the insurer will receive a risk adjustment transfer payment to make up some or all of the difference. Conversely, an insurer of a plan with healthier-than-average (i.e., low-risk) enrollees will set premiums higher than what is anticipated to be needed to cover enrollees' claims cost because part of that premium will be owed to other insurers in the form of risk adjustment charges.

Therefore, Insurer A had a risk adjustment charge of $30 (10% of $300, the state market average premium). Although the $30 charge is 10% of the state average premium, it amounts to about 11% of Insurer A's collected premiums ($270). Given its relative risk, Insurer A would have expected the net premium after the risk adjustment charge to be $243 ($270 in premium charges, minus $27 in risk adjustment charge). However, since the risk adjustment charge of $30 was calculated using the market average premium ($300), as opposed to Insurer A's premium ($270), the net premium is actually $240 ($270-$30) after the risk adjustment charge, so Insurer A is left with a shortfall of 1% of premium. In this example, Insurer B set premiums to match the market average, and also has the largest market share. Insurer's B's relative risk is the market average, so thus there is not a risk adjustment transfer. Insurer C has a premium of $330, and it attracted a sicker-than-average population (relative risk of positive 10%).

", "As discussed in the American Academy of Actuaries report Insights on the ACA Risk Adjustment Program , the relative position of an insurer's premiums within the market will affect whether or not the premium amounts, after accounting for risk adjustment transfers, are adequate for the insurer. An insurer's premiums are designed to reflect the risk of the entire market and not just the risk of the insurer's enrollees. If premiums for an insurer do not correctly account for the difference between their enrollees' risk and the risk of the entire market, then premiums may be incorrect (i.e., too high or too low), which may result in unanticipated losses or gains. For example, similar to Insurer A in Table 2 , if an insurer sets premiums lower than the average within the market because of incorrectly anticipating the risk in the total market and then has healthier-than-average enrollees, the insurer will be assessed a risk adjustment charge. It is possible that the insurer may not have enough premiums to cover the risk adjustment charge and could face solvency issues if there are not enough premiums to cover claims and administrative costs.

If the costs of enrollees in the state and the market are greater than expected, the statewide average premium likely will be too low. Though the risk adjustment program would still transfer funds between insurers, it does not add money into the system, so the premiums may not cover the cost of enrollees in the entire state or market. In addition, the risk adjustment program does not ensure more stable premiums from one year to the next. These forms of risk and uncertainty were supposed to be addressed by the other temporary risk mitigation programs included in the ACA: the transitional reinsurance program and the temporary risk corridors programs (see the section titled \" What Health Insurance Risk Mitigation Programs Are Included Under Current Federal Law? \" for additional information). "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Do Insurers Determine Premiums?", "paragraphs": ["Insurers develop rates for premiums based on a number of factors, including the population covered in the risk pool, projected medical costs, administrative costs insurers face, and laws and regulations. Insurers pool risk so that premiums from enrollees that do not get sick can help cover the costs of enrollees who do get sick, and premiums are set to reflect the health status of the risk pool as a whole at the state level, rather than just the plan's risk pool. Plan design (e.g., services in a plan, expected utilization of health services, cost sharing) and underlying health care costs (e.g., the price for health care services in a geographic area, fees negotiated with providers) also are considered when determining premiums. Most of the collected premiums go to paying medical claims. Premiums also must be able to cover an insurer's administrative costs (e.g., product development, sales, enrollment, claims processing) as well as profit or surplus (for not-for-profit insurers). Some laws, regulations, and policy changes affect premiums as well (e.g., fees, taxes, the presence of risk sharing programs). For example, in 2017, the American Academy of Actuaries cited several factors impacting premiums, including the end of the transitional reinsurance program, the repeal of the expansion of the small-group market, and the delay in the health insurer fee. In 2018, it cited legislative and regulatory uncertainty (e.g., funding cost-sharing subsidies, the enforcement of the individual mandate) as factors influencing premiums.

Although CMS suspended collections and payments on July 7, 2018, based on a court decision related to the risk adjustment methodology, the agency issued a final rule on July 24, 2018, which reissued the risk adjustment methodology with additional explanation, which CMS stated would allow the agency to continue operating the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Has Been the Experience of the Risk Adjustment Program Thus Far?", "paragraphs": ["Since the risk adjustment program is a relatively new program, there has not yet been a lot of analysis done on this program. However, both the American Academy of Actuaries and CMS found evidence suggesting that the risk adjustment program was functioning as intended in 2014. The American Academy of Actuaries reported that risk adjustment transfers reduced the medical loss ratios for insurers with high loss ratios and increased the loss ratios among insurers with low cost ratios, generally bringing the loss ratios closer together for insurers that received payments and those that experienced charges. The medical loss ratio for an insurer is the percentage of premium spent on health care claims and other expenses related to improving health care quality. By bringing the loss ratios for insurers closer together, the risk adjustment program is evening out an insurer's experience in a particular market. Premiums include factors other than risk associated with claims cost, such as administrative costs and profit. Thus, even if risk adjustment perfectly captured each insurer's risk (and compensated accordingly), the American Academy of Actuaries stresses that it would expect to see some variation in loss ratios. Also, CMS found that insurers with risk adjustment charges generally had relatively low plan liability risk scores and relatively low amounts of paid claims per enrollee; conversely, insurers that had a relatively high amount of paid claims per enrollee also had higher plan liability risk scores and were more likely to receive a risk adjustment payment. ", "In their respective reports, both the American Academy of Actuaries and CMS analyzed the relative impact of risk adjustment according to the size of the insurer. Both organizations found that smaller insurers (i.e., those with less market share) had more variability in their risk adjustment payments and charges as a percentage of premium. The American Academy of Actuaries reported that smaller insurers were somewhat more likely than larger insurers to have a higher risk adjustment transfer relative to the percentage of premium. This correlation was attributed to the nature of the risk adjustment program, because insurers with a higher market share are by definition more likely close to the market average than insurers with smaller market share, which are more likely to have enrollees skewed toward either lower-than-average or higher-than-average risk. CMS also reported that the size of an insurer did not determine whether or not it received a risk adjustment payment or charge. ", "In addition, both reports enumerated potential operational difficulties insurers may have experienced during the first year of the risk adjustment program. The American Academy of Actuaries suggested that because risk adjustment was a new program in 2014, some insurers may have experienced technical difficulties with the distributed data collection process and that these difficulties may have impacted small and new insurers more than larger, more established insurers, though not necessarily. CMS noted that some insurers had difficulty submitting data. Both organizations suggested that over time, data submission would become easier. ", "Furthermore, both organizations suggested that pricing premiums to take into account risk adjustment transfers for the first year of the risk adjustment program may have been difficult and that pricing would be more accurate as time passed.

They are (1) adding prescription drugs in the risk adjustment model to help improve the accuracy of an enrollee's risk score and (2) creating a high-cost risk pool. Below is a brief description of the changes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inclusion of Prescription Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Prescription drugs were added to the adult risk adjustment model starting in the 2018 benefit year. CMS created prescription drug categories (RXCs) to group drugs to be included in the risk adjustment model. Some RXCs are used to impute (i.e., ascribe) diagnoses, and some are used to indicate the severity of a diagnosis that is included through medical coding. CMS worked with clinician consultants and staff clinicians to determine RXCs both for ascribing diagnoses and for indicating a more severe case of the related diagnosis (making it likely that the enrollee will incur greater medical expenses than an enrollee who has the diagnosis but not a prescription drug). CMS included prescription drug classes where there is a low risk of unintended impacts on provider prescribing behavior. The agency intends to monitor prescription drug utilization for any unintended impacts and may make changes to the RXCs in the future if it finds evidence of such impacts.", "The American Academy of Actuaries suggested including prescription drugs in the risk adjustment model in its report on risk adjustment. During the rulemaking process for the 2018 benefit year, the academy commented that including prescription drugs would improve the model's accuracy, enhance the prediction of costs for partial-year enrollees, and improve payments for conditions that are treated with high-cost drugs. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High-Cost Risk Pool", "paragraphs": ["Starting in the 2018 benefit year, CMS created a national-level, high-cost risk pool for the individual market and the small group market to remove any potential incentive for insurers to avoid extremely high-cost enrollees and to better capture the risk associated with these enrollees in risk adjustment payments and charges. While an enrollee who is considered high-risk is expected to have higher overall claims cost, other enrollees who are not high-risk may have (one time) expensive claims and thus be considered high-cost in a given year. For high-cost enrollees (whether high risk or not) an insurer will receive an adjustment to their transfer amounts equal to 60% of the costs above a defined threshold (the threshold for high-cost enrollee is defined as enrollees with total claims costs above $1 million in a benefit year). To maintain budget neutrality, CMS first will calculate the total amount of paid claims costs above the threshold to determine the amount to be transferred. Then, CMS will calculate an adjustment as a percentage of an insurer's total premiums in each market. Once determined, this amount will be added to or subtracted from an insurer's transfer amount calculated by excluding costs above the threshold the high-cost enrollees. CMS indicated that it expects this adjustment to be a very small percentage of premiums, estimating less than 0.5% of premiums for either market. ", "The American Academy of Actuaries noted in its risk adjustment report that risk adjustment typically does not compensate insurers adequately for very high-cost enrollees and that it may be appropriate for the risk adjustment program to incorporate a process for transfers for high-cost outliers. CMS also reported that most risk adjustment programs do not predict the existence of high-cost enrollees very precisely because the risk scores reflect the average costs for individuals in a specific age group, with a specific sex, and with specific diagnoses. Since most spending for insurance companies is related to high cost enrollees, insurers may still have an incentive to avoid very high cost enrollees. Additionally, other research also has found that risk adjustment programs do not adequately account for high-cost cases and, as a result, that insurers have an incentive to avoid these high-cost enrollees.", "The creation of a high-cost risk pool to provide payments to insurers for a portion of the costs of high-cost enrollees works similarly to how the ACA's transitional reinsurance program did. However, the attachment point (referred to as the threshold under the high-cost risk pool) is significantly higher (i.e., $1 million) than the attachment points that were used for the transitional reinsurance program (i.e., $90,000 in 2016). See the text box labeled \"High Cost Risk Pool Example\" for an illustration of the difference. "], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
