In thewake of September 11, 2001, interest in this kind of assistance has grown for several reasons: thepossibility of terrorists gaining access to Pakistan's nuclear weapons seems higher, the U.S. militaryis forging new relationships with both Pakistan and India in the war on terrorism, and heightenedtension in Kashmir in 2002 threatened to push both states closer to the brink of nuclear war. InOctober 2001, media reported that the United States was providing assistance to Pakistan to keepits weapons safe, although those reports have not been confirmed. Revelations in 2004 that Pakistaniscientist A.Q. Khan was selling nuclear technology (and reportedly a nuclear bomb design) to Iran,Libya, and North Korea also helped to renew interest in making, in particular, Pakistan's nuclearweapons program more secure from exploitation. The report of the 9/11 Commission also called forcontinued support for threat reduction assistance to keep weapons of mass destruction (WMD) awayfrom terrorist groups.", "In the 108th Congress, the Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act (Section 1308 of FY2004 Defense Authorization Act, PL 108-136) allowed the Department of Defense to spend up to $50 million inunobligated funds on cooperative threat reduction (CTR) measures outside the former Soviet Union. In the 109th Congress, it is likely that similar legislation will be introduced again. The Bushadministration used $20 million of CTR funds to dismantle chemical weapons-related items inAlbania, but proponents of expanding CTR have mentioned many other countries as possiblerecipients: India, Pakistan, China, North Korea, Iraq, and Libya, to name a few.", "This paper describes why Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programs developed for the former Soviet Union are considered models for assistance elsewhere and their potential applicationin India and Pakistan. The paper considers the types of assistance provided under CTR and potentialconstraints on U.S. assistance in this area, including domestic and international legal and politicalrestrictions on cooperation with states outside the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT); the lowlevel of cooperation and transparency exhibited by India and Pakistan; lack of incentives for Indiaand Pakistan to pursue threat reduction measures; and potentially competing objectives of threatreduction and nuclear deterrence.", "This report, which will be updated as events warrant, complements CRS Report RL32359 , Globalizing Cooperative Threat Reduction: A Survey of Options , and CRS Report RS21840(pdf) , Expanding Threat Reduction and Nonproliferation Programs: Concepts and Definitions ."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The September 11, 2001 attacks reinforced the importance of efforts to stop the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction. In particular, many analysts agree that some countries need greaterprotection against terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) on their territories. Thereport of the 9/11 Commission called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to keepWMD away from terrorist groups. ", "Pakistan, because of its location, the nature of its relationship to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and its weapons of mass destruction programs, has generated particular concern. Repeated assassinationattempts on President Musharraf, AQ Khan's nuclear sales to North Korea, Iran, and Libya, and acontinuous battle with terrorist elements within the country, have made Pakistan the most crucialnode of the nexus of terrorism and WMD proliferation. Moreover, a combination of doctrinalpreference (for first use of nuclear weapons) and conventional force inferiority has given Pakistanstrong incentives to forward-deploy its nuclear forces, leading many observers to conclude thatassistance to secure Pakistan's nuclear warheads could be critical. Analysts inside and outsidegovernment have raised the possibility of U.S. assistance to help reduce the threat of nuclearweapons losses in India and Pakistan. (1) Suggestedmeasures have ranged from \"guards and gates\"around nuclear sites to permissive action links (which act as locks) on nuclear weapons to preventunauthorized use.", "In a speech in December of 2001, Senator Lugar noted that concerns had been raised immediately following September 11, 2001 about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weaponsprogram and that \"similar questions will be raised about India's.\" He then noted uncertainties aboutthe WMD programs of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and North Korea. (2) In contrast to those five countries,four of which are on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, Senator Lugar notedthat \"the closer ties that have developed since September 11th with India and Pakistan offer newopportunities to discuss nuclear security with both countries, including safe storage andaccountability. We must attempt to establish programs that respect their sovereignty and go far tohelp insure their security.\" Lugar also suggested that cooperative programs with Iran, Syria, or Libyashould not be ruled out.", "In an article published in July 2002, Senator Lugar explained that ", "The precise replication of the Nunn-Lugar program will not be possible everywhere, but the experience of Nunn-Lugar in Russia has demonstrated that thethreat of weapons of mass destruction can lead to extraordinary outcomes based on mutualinterest...Nations cooperating on securing instruments of mass destruction might also pledge to workcooperatively on measures to retrieve weapons or materials that are in danger of falling into thewrong hands, and to come to the aid of any victim of nuclear, chemical, or biological terrorism (3)", "In the specific case of India and Pakistan, there may be key differences from the FSU that limit the program's applicability. Many of those differences stem from the fact that India and Pakistanare not \"legal\" nuclear weapon states under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), as Russiawas. The United States is currently prohibited from providing many kinds of assistance to non-nuclear weaponstates, particularly those without full-scope nuclear safeguards. (4) Most types ofassistance the United States can feasibly provide would probably focus on helping secure nuclearmaterials and providing employment for personnel, rather than on security of nuclear weapons. Extreme sensitivity in India and Pakistan about their nuclear weapons and programs will also likelyrestrict access to facilities, which in turn will limit how well assistance can be tailored to potentialproblems. Also, technical measures to make weapons safer from unauthorized use may make thoseweapons more deployable or usable and thus inadvertently undermine the goal of reducing thenuclear threat. Nonetheless, some measures may be useful.", "This paper takes CTR programs as a starting point and analyzes their potential application to India and Pakistan. In providing context for assessing U.S. policy options, the paper outlines theproliferation threat in South Asia and U.S. nonproliferation policy. The paper distinguishes betweenassistance oriented toward making nuclear weapons more secure, and assistance oriented towardmaking nuclear material more secure. Given the existing framework of nonproliferation-related lawsand policies, measures focused on nuclear material and personnel may be more feasible in the shortterm.

As of January2005, the Administration had spent such $20 million only in Albania for the purpose of eliminatingchemical weapons stockpiles. On November 16, 2004, Senator Lugar introduced S. 2980 , which sought to remove some restrictions associated with using CTR funds outside of theFSU. In brief, the bill would remove CTR program-wide restrictions on spending the money(including certifications), remove the $50-million cap, remove restrictions on spending money forchemical weapons destruction, and provide \"notwithstanding\" authority.

", "According to Senator Lugar, the CTR program to date has separated 6,564 Russian nuclear warheads from their missiles and stored fissile material from those weapons. Over 30,000 tacticalnuclear weapons have been stored, and non-weapons employment provided for thousands of Russiannuclear scientists. (7)", "CTR programs have encompassed three areas of effort: destruction and dismantlement; chain of custody; and demilitarization. Destruction and dismantlement activities included removingwarheads, deactivating missiles and eliminating launch facilities for strategic weapons under theSTART I agreement. Efforts to improve the safety, security, and control over nuclear weapons andfissile materials have included providing storage containers, bullet-proof blankets, secure rail cars,and building a plutonium storage facility at Mayak. Demilitarization projects have included defenseconversion projects and International Science and Technology Center projects to help WMDscientists pursue work with peaceful objectives and military-to-military contacts.", "CTR programs have evolved and expanded over time, adjusting to Russian, NIS, and U.S. priorities, as well as to changing perceptions about which threats posed the greatest risk. Theprograms have also bowed to bureaucratic intransigence and practical considerations upon occasion. In one notable incident, the Department of Energy provided blankets to facility guards, because DoEofficials discovered that they were leaving their posts to collect wood to build fires. As the economyworsened in Russia in the mid-1990s, CTR projects were developed to provide alternativeemployment and sources of income for unpaid or out-of-work WMD scientists. At the same time,more frequent reports of theft of nuclear material highlighted the need to allocate CTR resources tomaterial protection, control and accounting (MPCA) measures for nuclear material, consolidationof nuclear weapons and material; and secure transportation. The United States developed a practicalapproach: \"quick-fixes,\" like bars on windows, blast-proof doors, fences, followed by a second stagethat included more sophisticated security measures like sensors, cameras, and personnel accessmeasures. (8)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CTR as Precedent", "paragraphs": ["The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, at its inception, was a novel approach to a novel problem. The idea that two former adversaries could cooperate on such sensitive matters as nuclearweapons and material security was radical, but so too was the prospect of Russia's WMDinfrastructure unraveling. Although some of the kinds of assistance and measures undertaken in theCTR program are clearly applicable to India and Pakistan, the circumstances that have led to thedevelopment of a similar nuclear terrorist threat are quite different. Among the many factors thathave made CTR successful, one of the key factors was a basic level of agreement about the threatand a willingness to cooperate. Russia had already agreed to strategic nuclear reductions underSTART I -- the only question was how to implement those reductions quickly and who would payfor them. The fact that Soviet nuclear weapons had been targeted at the United States for so manyyears presented a compelling reason for the United States to help. ", "Obviously, there is no similar agreement between India and Pakistan or with the United States. Moreover, India has long maintained that it will disarm when the other nuclear weapon states reducetheir stockpiles to a similar level. Thus, destruction and dismantlement activities are not nowapplicable. CTR chain of custody programs applied to the weapons and material that were takenout of service and thus did not raise questions about enhancing safety, security and control overRussia's active nuclear weapons stockpile. Doing similar things for India and Pakistan might bedesirable from a security standpoint, but questionable politically. ", "Establishing verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of existing nuclear weapons,components, and materials is the most applicable of all the CTR objectives for India and Pakistan. However, the situation of Pakistan and India is different from that in Russia and offers one majorcomplication: threat reduction measures aimed at an outside/terrorist threat may conflict with nuclear deterrence. For example, making materials and weapons safe from theft or espionage maylogically lead to consolidating material and weapons at as few sites as possible. However, thatconsolidation could increase one's vulnerability to a preemptive strike by an adversary. In the caseof Russia and the NIS, the risk of a preemptive strike did not weigh into calculations of risk; anyobstacles to consolidation have been primarily those of cost and effort in constructing adequatefacilities (like the Mayak plutonium storage facility). For India and Pakistan, however, the fear ofa preemptive strike is prominent. Rumors of an Indian or even Israeli preemptive attack on Pakistaninuclear weapons capabilities have erupted in Pakistan predictably during crises. (9)", "The last objective -- that of preventing diversion of scientific expertise -- is also applicable to India and Pakistan. However, the underlying causes for concern are different, and therefore maycall for different solutions. In the Russian case, the lack of financial security has been a documentedincentive for scientists to offer their services abroad; (10) in Pakistan, the incentive is more likely to beassociated with sympathy for terrorist aims. \"Brain drain\" projects in the NIS have been predicatedon the assumption that there are more scientists than can be paid or are needed, but there are noindications that Pakistani and Indian scientists are superfluous to their nuclear weapons programs. Both India and Pakistan are probably interested in retaining their nuclear experts. Although it hasbeen politically acceptable to fund former WMD scientists in Russia and the NIS to do non-weapons-related work,it might be politically unacceptable to fund current WMD scientists in Indiaand Pakistan at higher levels simply to keep them \"in the program.\" Brain-drain projects in Indiaand Pakistan, if such projects were implemented, would likely focus on personnel reliability testingand psychological profiling.

The threat of accidentalnuclear war calls for safer nuclear weapons, whereas reducing the risk of preemptive or sudden warwould require enhancing command and control and possibly transparency between the two states. Some observers have suggested that making nuclear weapons safer (through insensitive highexplosives or shaping the cores so that they will not give a nuclear yield if improperly detonated)also makes them more deployable and thus increases the risk of their use.

Often, physicalsecurity measures are implemented as a matter of course in implementing safeguards, since stateshave to account for missing material in their physical inventories.

ThisConvention, which entered into force in 1987, was designed to protect nuclear material in transitbetween countries. The CPPNM defines a range of nuclear terrorist activities and requires partiesto criminalize those activities. It does not cover physical protection of domestic nuclear materialin storage or use, nor does it cover byproduct material.

Neither India nor Pakistan has requested such a mission, and in the opinionof some observers, they are unlikely to do so because of the sensitivity of their facilities.

Severalmonths after the test, then Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott stated in Foreign Affairs that theUnited States \"cannot concede, even by implication, that India and Pakistan have by their testsestablished themselves as nuclear-weapons states... To relent would break faith with those states thathave forsworn a capability they could have acquired. Moreover, it might inadvertently provide anincentive for other countries to blast their way into the ranks of the nuclear-weapons states.\" (22) Theinternational community so far has sidestepped questions of nuclear weapons status, but some havesuggested that India and Pakistan have become a model for new nuclear weapon states. (23)", "On the question of nuclear assistance to non-nuclear weapon states, however, consensus in the international community is strong, well-established, and embodied in the NPT. Before the NuclearNonproliferation Treaty entered into force in 1970, views on sharing nuclear technology and evennuclear weapons swung wildly between sharing everything and sharing nothing. According to onesource, the United States contemplated giving India some nuclear weapons to counter the Chinesenuclear arsenal, shortly after China's first nuclear test in 1964. (24) Nuclear weapon states havevoluntarily shared technology among themselves and some have spied on each other. China initiallyadvocated nuclear proliferation as an inevitable and possibly stabilizing factor in world relations(although it joined the NPT in 1992). Nuclear weapon states have also shared technology with thosestates outside the NPT, the most notable example being China's reported sharing of nuclear weaponsblueprints with Pakistan. And, reportedly, Pakistan shared that design with Libya. (25)", "Negotiators of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in the mid-1960s realized that almost any kind of international nuclear assistance is potentially useful to a nuclear weapons program. (26) Nuclear weapons -- more than biological or chemical weapons, or missiles -- require such precisionin design and construction that any assistance, from technical information, to hints about solvingtechnical problems (for example, how to shape the fissile core), to equipment or components --can be valuable to an aspiring nuclear weapons state. Therefore, nuclear weapon states, underArticle I of the NPT, commit \"not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or nuclearexplosive devices or control over such weapons or devices, directly or indirectly; and not in any wayto assist, encourage or induce any non-nuclear weapon state to manufacture or otherwise acquirenuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices.\" (27) In contrast to the obligation of the non-nuclear-weapon states under Article II not to receive nuclear weapons orrelated assistance, this commitmentincurred no verification measures. In part, this omission may have rested on the assumption thatholders of nuclear weapons technology would not impart the most sophisticated and directlyweapons-relevant information to non-nuclear weapons states. Clearly, however, negotiators feltcomfortable with focusing verification on the recipient states. All states are obliged under ArticleIII, paragraph 2 of the treaty not to provide source or special fissionable material or equipment to anynon-nuclear-weapon state unless the material is subject to IAEA safeguards. ", "Nuclear safeguards are the primary means \"to establish and clarify the peaceful purpose of most international nuclear assistance.\" (28) Not simplyan invention of the NPT, safeguards existed inbilateral arrangements since the earliest nuclear trade as a way of preventing the misuse of materialwith obvious military applications. Beyond their technical importance in ensuring that states cannotdevelop nuclear weapons \"the quick way,\" safeguards have become the acid test for a state'snonproliferation-worthiness. U.S. export control laws, arms export control laws and nonproliferationpolicies have incorporated the distinction between those states with full-scope safeguards (on allmaterial in their state) and those without. Moreover, the international nuclear nonproliferationregime has taken its cues from laws and policies developed by the United States. When, forexample, the Nuclear Suppliers' Group adopted full-scope safeguards as a prerequisite for nuclearsupply, it was adopting a policy that the United States had implemented a decade earlier. Since thediscovery of the Khan network, efforts have accelerated to make the new nonproliferation acid testthe adoption of the Additional Protocol.", "At the same time, efforts to prevent proliferation have not blinded states to concerns about the safety and security of proliferant states' nuclear weapons. To some observers, however, proposalsto provide security and safety measures seem to be tainted by a certain hubris -- that is, nuclearweapon states have considered themselves to be responsible with their nuclear weapons, whereaslesser industrialized states could not be as responsible. (29) Until China's nuclear test, the only nuclearweapon states were those with large, industrial economies. To some extent, global concern aboutterrorism might lessen sensitivities about whether or not India or Pakistan \"need\" help. Nonetheless,repeated Pakistani officials' statements to the press about the security of their arsenal appear toreflect a\"hands-off\" attitude, implying that Pakistan is quite able to protect and secure its ownweapons. (30) India, for its part, has remained silenton the subject. More importantly, however, thesensitivity surrounding nuclear weapons is such that even between the closest of allies -- forexample, the United States and the United Kingdom -- proposals to share permissive action links(PALs, which only allow authorized parties to arm the warhead) reportedly have been met withdisinterest.

Other countries also responded to the tests by imposing economic sanctions. Many of those states,including the United States, lifted sanctions quickly thereafter. Nonetheless, prohibitions regardingnuclear trade with countries are still in place.

The history of NPT negotiations reveals that concerns overtransferring \"control\" over such weapons focused primarily on allies (e.g. NATO) being able to makecommand and control decisions for U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in Europe.

There is no currently publiclyavailable legal view from the State Department on what might constitute a violation of Article I, butlegal advisors have considered this question by examining precedents in the application of U.S.domestic law. In general, the closer assistance is attached to the nuclear weapons programs, themore likely that it could run afoul of U.S. legal obligations, both under international treatyobligations and domestic law. Thus, some kinds of aid (e.g., food or humanitarian aid) could beconsidered, in the extreme, to be assisting or encouraging a nuclear weapons program because theyfree up resources that the target government can put towards a nuclear weapons program but arepermitted in practice because they do not have a close association with a nuclear weapons program.

Section 744.2 of the Export Administration Regulations provides eight criteriafor assessing license applications. Potentially, the most significant of these criteria is thenonproliferation credentials of the importing country, which include whether the state adheres to theNPT, has full-scope safeguards, and has an agreement for cooperation with the United States andwhether the actions, statements, and policies of the state support nuclear nonproliferation.
