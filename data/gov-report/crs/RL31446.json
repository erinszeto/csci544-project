Laws may be passed toachieve policy or enforcement objectives and indirectly reorganize internal department and agencystructure in the process. This was certainly the case when Congress passed the Inspectors GeneralAct of 1978, an act that altered the internal structure of agencies and the behavior of agency officials.

Should the principalsupervisor of the administrative agencies be the President, or Congress, or should the President andCongress be co-managers? Should commission recommendations serve to encourage administrativeintegration and centralization or the values of agency particularity and decentralization? Shouldcommission recommendations seek to give a greater or lesser role for government in the social andeconomic life of the Nation? Successive commission reports and recommendations provideevidence of the recurring nature of these and other related value issues.", "With the advent of the 21st century, the question reasonably arises: Has the age ofreorganizational commissions passed? Or, is there a continuing need for periodic reviews andrealignments of the basic organizational structure of government?", "In nearly every Congress, legislation is introduced to establish a commission with a broadmandate. The 106th Congress, the last Congress of the 20st century, proved to be no exception in thisrespect. Senator Fred Thompson, then chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,introduced the \"Government for the 21st Century Act\" ( S. 2306 ). The legislation, whichdid not receive congressional action, sought to establish a nine-member Commission on GovernmentRestructuring and Reform appointed jointly by the President and congressional leadership. Thepurpose of the Commission was to study the entire government and make recommendations \"toreduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of the Executive Branch.\" The Commission was tosubmit its recommendations on restructuring by December 1, 2002. A period of public commentwas to follow. Then, the Commission was to prepare a final report to Congress in a form that wouldpermit its recommendations to have been included in a single implementation bill and referred to theappropriate committees for consideration. An \"expedited procedures\" process for floor considerationand mandatory voting was included. As indicated, Congress chose not to act on the proposal.", "Are reorganization panels now pass\u00c3\u00a9? Or, is the time approaching when a newcomprehensive commission will be viewed as essential?

To what degree shoulddepartments and agencies be able to initiate organizational changes on their own authority or takethe lead with their oversight committees in Congress? Should organizational management beultimately placed under the purview of a central management agency which applies certain principles and general management laws across the board, with the burden of proof for exception resting onthe appealing agency?

Each was concerned principally, if not exclusively, with the organizationand management of the executive branch. The commissions were temporary bodies, normallyunassociated with the legislative institutions of government. They did not conduct their proceedingsin an apolitical environment, however, nor were they able to ignore the work and ideas of those whohad trod this path before. Most especially, these commissions were beholden to the Framers of theConstitution and to an early 20th century political movement, Progressivism. It is therefore necessaryto begin by studying the evolving theoretical foundations of the executive branch to fully understandthe role of landmark commissions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federalist Creation", "paragraphs": ["While the classical works on political theory and government were useful to the Framers indeveloping a coherent political philosophy upon which to construct a \"democratic republic,\" (2) the reading of Montesquieu,Locke, and Blackstone was of little assistance or guidance in the weighty matters of organizing andadministering the executive powers of a new government. The Founders turned away from thebooks for guidance in organizational matters, and reflected instead upon their own experience intrying to wage the Revolutionary War against a global power, and in attempting to manage thenational confederation of states after the close of hostilities in 1781. (3) Their personal experiencesbecame the crucible for political thought. This was particularly true for Alexander Hamilton, whohad found his administrative experiences during the Confederational period to be extremelyfrustrating. (4) ", "It should be noted that while questions regarding how best to organize the executive branchwere raised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the Constitution itself is nearly silent onorganizational matters. (5) The paucity of language in the Constitution respecting organizational matters should not beinterpreted, however, as either lack of interest or concern. Quite the contrary, there was a livelyconcern for organizational matters. There was recognition that the new government would fail if itwas unable to generate energy in the executive branch. In Federalist #70, Hamilton asserted:", "Energy in the Executive is a leading character...of good government.... A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of government. A feebleexecution is but another phrase for a bad execution.... All men of sense will agree in the necessityof an energetic Executive. ", "The Framers, in defending the Constitution, emphasized both its innovative character and itsinstitutional continuity. Pre-eminent among the many innovative provisions of the Constitution wasthe creation of an independent presidency, the term independent meaning in this instance not beingdependent for selection or maintenance upon the legislature. The President was given a differentelectoral base from Congress and also several specific powers, such as the power to veto legislation,to protect itself from an overbearing Congress. It should not be forgotten that their fear was lessabout a too powerful President than about a too-dependent President, one who would be dominatedby Congress which controlled the money.", "As for continuity, not only were the states kept intact geographically, but their authoritiesremained in large part unaltered. Even most laws of the Confederation, such as the NorthwestOrdinance of 1787, were retained. As one student of early administrative history observed: \"Thecontinuity between the old and new systems was made plain by the fact both [John] Jay and [Henry]Knox, secretaries of Foreign Affairs and War, respectively, continued in their offices, withmodifications, under the new government.\" (6) ", "Reflecting upon the writings and decisions of the Framers with respect to the administrativeelements of the new government, one is struck by their willingness to break new ground. (7) Rarely in their discourse isthere reference to the prevailing administrative systems in Great Britain or France, the two majornation-states of the period. This is explained in part because the new government of the UnitedStates was created before (although just before) the French Revolution, and thus tended to reflectthe values of the 18th century Enlightenment, rather than the values of the 19th century socialrevolutionaries. More to the point, however, neither Great Britain nor France had \"modern\"administrative systems at the time. For the most part, their administrative systems were poorlyorganized and managed, and to a large extent corrupted by the widespread selling of offices ofstate. (8) In the case ofFrance, the largely feudal administrative structure would be swept away by the Revolution. (9) ", "Enlightenment philosophy stressed reason, and reason embraced scientific methodology. Alexander Hamilton, held by many to be the \"father of public administration,\" was articulate in hisarguments that public administration was a \"science\" and that the United States could organize agovernment that was at once efficient and representative. (10) Writing in Federalist #9 , Hamilton states: ", "The science of politics, however, like most othersciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of various principles is now wellunderstood, which were either not known at all or imperfectly known to the ancients. The regulardistribution of power into distinct departments; the introduction of legislative balances and checks;the institution of courts composed of judges holding their office during good behavior; therepresentation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their election: these are wholly newdiscoveries, or have made their principal progress toward perfection during moderntimes.", "The important point to recognize is that the Framers believed that it was possible to createa rational and democratically accountable administrative structure. They believed that there wereprinciples of organization that ought to be followed and that deviation from these principles shouldrequire the promoters to meet a higher standard of proof. The role of historical and legal precedentin the evolution of the federal executive establishment came into play during the very first Congress. Much that takes place today in the field of organizational management can be traced back in originto the first years of the Republic.", "One of the first orders of business for the new Congress in 1789 was the establishment ofexecutive departments. Three \"organic\" statutes were passed creating three great departments;Treasury, State, and War. (11) A fourth department, a Department of Home Affairs, wasconsidered and abandoned with the functions likely to have resided in that department being assignedto the other three departments. All the particular functions of the newly created executive branch,save that of managing the federal government's legal affairs, and delivering the mails were entrustedto these departments.", "The decision to establish a unitary administrative structure under the President, a muchadmired innovation at the time, was intended by the Federalists to complement their morecomprehensive theory of government. Leonard D. White, an administrative historian, commentedon this theory:", "The Federalists did not fear administrativepower. To the contrary, they had a deadly fear of governmental impotence. The interests which theycherished had suffered deeply from lack of a government which could govern, and the need forpower was, in their minds, not subject to debate. The Federalists were not, however, in favor ofirresponsible power; they did not propose an American copy of an arbitrary kind from whose controlthey had recently won independence. (12) ", "The first potential challenge to the Federalist theory of organization management arose fromthe election of Thomas Jefferson, a man suspicious of energetic government. Jefferson's theory oforganization began at the local level with emphasis on the citizen as participant in governmentalaffairs. There was a romantic element in Jefferson's political thought that tended to view goodgovernment as utilitarian and minimalist. He believed in rotation-in-office to guard against the\"degeneracy of public servants\" and that governmental service should be \"drudgery and forsubsistence only.\" For Hamilton, on the other hand, government should be a catalyst for great things. Freedom required strength and national purpose. As Lynton K. Caldwell would observe: \"Hamiltonis our great teacher of the organization and administration of public power; Jefferson our chiefexpositor of its control.\" (13) As it turned out, Jefferson was not inclined to dismantle whatorganization was in place, nor to alter its fundamental character."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organizational Management in the 19th Century", "paragraphs": ["Although the main lines of Federalist organization and managerial philosophy remainedgenerally in place through 1829, the institutional presidency gradually declined vis-a-vis theCongress. (14) Congressbegan to assert its authority over executive agencies more energetically with each passing decade,although this had minimal consequences in terms of organizational structure.", "The Federalist concept of an integrated executive branch under the President retained itspersuasiveness throughout the 19th century. Prior to 1860, only four permanent \"detached agencies\"were created: the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the Botanic Garden, and theGovernment Printing Office. When the federal government assumed additional functions, thesefunctions were usually assigned to existing departments, or to new departments created for thatpurpose, such as the Department of the Interior in 1849.", "The first substantial break with Federalist departmentalism did not occur until the creationof the Civil Service Commission in 1883 and the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887. (15) This break fromdepartmentalism was associated in many respects with the newly triumphant civil service reformmovement, which sought to cleanse administration of partisan politics by introducing the meritpersonnel system. (16) ", "The final two decades of the nineteenth century were years when rapid industrialization wasstraining the capacity of the government, which still reflected in many respects a simpler, more ruralperiod of national life. Regulation was being demanded for industries, transportation, and urban life. Government institutions required new cadres of trained, professional personnel, not simply politicalpatronage appointees. In his review of this period, Stephen Skowronek suggests:", "Generally speaking, the expansion of nationalcapacity in America around the turn of the century was a response to industrialism. The constructionof a centralized bureaucratic apparatus was championed as the best way to maintain order during thisperiod of upheaval in economic, social, and international affairs. Viewed at this level, the Americanexperience fits a general pattern of institutional development and rationalization in publicadministration. (17) ", "Congress was able to exercise leverage over administrative affairs through its control of thepurse strings and through its authority to initiate investigations. With respect to the latter authority,Congress had made official inquiries into events and activities since 1789. In the final third of the19th century, however, Congress expanded its investigatory activities to include managementissues. (18) Twocongressional inquiries into the conduct and activities of executive departments stand out as thecentury closed. A Select Committee of the Senate, chaired by Francis Cockrell of Missouri,conducted an investigation of executive agencies to determine why they were so slow in acting andapparently costing so much. (50th Cong., 1st sess., S.Rept. 507, 1888). With a similar objective, ajoint commission of both Houses was established in 1893 (the Dockery-Cockrell Commission),chaired by Senator Cockrell and Representative Alexander Dockery, which issued a report on thelaws managing each department (53rd Cong., 1st sess., H. Rept. 49, 1893). A number of laws alteringthe \"business methods\" of agencies were enacted as a direct result of the commission's work.", "The principal significance for administrative history of these two late 19th centurycommissions, however, lies not in their substantive results, but rather in their attitudes towards theinstitutionalized presidency and its relationship to the departments and agencies. Neither inquirydiscussed the presidential office, nor what role that office might be expected to play in theimprovement of the conduct of the executive branch.", "While the new governmental reform movement enjoyed its first major victories at themunicipal level, its ideals had an impact upon the national government as well, in part becauseCongress was finding it more difficult and less rewarding to manage federal agencies directly. AsPeri Arnold suggests: \"[C]ongressional leaders assumed that only the legislature could imposechanges in administrative practices. But Congress was too unfocused for the task of administrativereform; there were always more pressing issues for the members, and Congress' interests inadministration are necessarily episodic....\" (19) Thus, Congress was increasingly sympathetic to the idea ofdelegating some of its managerial and regulatory authority to the President and executive agencies.", "The problem, however, was that the institutionalized presidency was unable to substantiallyenhance either its political or managerial leverage over the executive establishment. The Presidenthad virtually no staff, no budgetary authority over agencies, and few general management lawsthrough which the agencies could be supervised collectively.

Governmental institutions were growing rapidly, not only in size, but in theirresource requirements. The executive branch needed new forms of management and a skilledmanager, and the President was looked upon to furnish this leadership", "Progressives believed that progress was not only possible, but virtually inevitable if certainsound principles were followed. The first of the two capstone principles was that politics andadministration could and should be separated. Although some scholars attribute this intellectualconcept to Woodrow Wilson, (21) most writing cites a small book by Frank J. Goodnow, Politicsand Administration (1900), with bringing the purported distinction to scholarly consciousness. Goodnow argued: \"Politics has to do with the policies and expressions of state will,\" whereasadministration \"has to do with the execution of these policies.\" (22) This dichotomy led to theproposition that it is the function of the legislative branch to form policy (\"will of the state\") and ofthe executive branch to implement the policy. The executive branch, properly organized andmanaged, would administer the policies in an impartial and apolitical manner. (23) ", "The second capstone principle distinguishing the Progressive era was the belief that theadministration of government agencies and programs was subject to principles of \"scientificmanagement.\" The idea that public sector administration could be made \"scientific\" was first andmost notably promoted by Frederick W. Taylor who wrote on the \"one best way\" to manage amanufacturing activity in his 1911 book, The Principles of Scientific Management . (24) Although he wasspecifically concerned with managing the work process in a private factory, he was convinced, aswere his followers, that the principles of scientific management were applicable to publicadministration as well. (25) ", "Under the banner of Progressivism, the doctrines of \"scientific management\" were promotedfor application in the executive branch. With respect to organizational management, Progressives,by and large, favored four \"reforms\": (1) reorganization of the executive branch into functionaldepartments and agencies; (2) promotion of the President's authority to manage a unified executivebranch; (3) introduction of an executive budget; and (4) development of a \"neutrally competent\"management class for agency leadership. Given the particular focus of this study and the limitedspace, we can discuss only elements (1) and (2) of the general Progressive philosophy: the need fora functionally based, integrated executive branch structure and the evolution of the managerialpresidency. (26) ", "Scientific management was influential not so much because of its specialized procedures asfor the fundamental idea it fostered, namely, the perfectibility of human institutions. (27) Properly constructed andmanaged institutions, it was believed, could overcome many of the structural inadequacies ofcongressionally mandated programs. There was a self-assurance among reformers and publicadministrationists that they could administer anything. Managers could and would ultimatelytriumph over the alleged ineptness and venality of politicians. Managers were to be the elite in thisscientifically ordered world of the future, and the President would be the Chief Manager of arevitalized national government. The Chief Manager must base his overall managerial strategy ona comprehensive plan, and for this plan to be implemented there must be an integrated executivebranch organization with strict lines of responsibility and accountability to him. Thus, the struggleto increase the President's managerial capacity began.", "Reorganization of executive agencies and functions as a systematic tool of governance wasa major component of the multi-faceted Progressive philosophy. The first President to espouse the\"reorganization\" strategy for Progressivism was Theodore Roosevelt. \"President TheodoreRoosevelt, unlike McKinley,\" Herbert Emmerich averred, \"had firm views on presidentialmanagement. He was the undoubted originator of the concept of reorganization as a continuing needfor administrative management and as an executive responsibility.\" (28) ", "Theodore Roosevelt, the embodiment of Progressivism, believed that a corollary of ScientificManagement was the view that there was \"one best way\" to organize the executive branch, and thatthe prerogative to reorganize should rest with the President and his departmental secretaries. He wasable to put this view into law with the passage of the 1903 Act creating the Department ofCommerce and Labor which authorized the President \"... by order in writing, to transfer to the newdepartment any unit engaged in statistical or scientific work, together with their duties and authority\"(32 Stat. 827). The authority to transfer would then be an Executive Order rather than a statute. Roosevelt subsequently asked Congress, unsuccessfully, for broad reorganization authority. (29) Later Presidents wouldpress with greater success for general reorganization authority.", "Progressives believed in information, analysis and experts. There was a working assumptionin much of their writings and activities that if one could somehow seat reasonable people around atable, give them plenty of information on a problem or subject, there would be a high probability ofagreement among the participants. Thus, the idea of \"commissions\" came into vogue. Ideally,commissions would consist of \"experts\" but, if necessary, include some political leaders as well. Thepoint was, however, that a commission was less likely to be subject to political pressures andshort-term perspectives than a regular legislative committee. Commissions would meet, hire expertassistance, define the problem, review the facts, and make recommendations for change to thePresident, to Congress, or to both. The use of advisory commissions became popular during theProgressive era and remains so to this day.", "Progressives wanted the American political system and their government to become bothefficient and politically accountable. The leaders of American commerce wanted a government thatcould support the emerging business culture and thus a \"good government\" alliance was formedconsisting of business leaders, top academics, and social reformers. It was a fragile alliance at bestwhich enjoyed ascendency for less than two decades ending with America's entry into World WarI. (30) But much wasaccomplished by this alliance and 80 years later its influence is still felt.", "In the field of organizational design and management, the Progressive values emphasizedpresidential administrative leadership, hierarchical structure and an integrated executive branch. These values still have appeal as a philosophical norm, even though the administrative history of thepost World War II period is largely a chronicle of rejection of these values in practice. Whereas,Presidents once viewed organizational management as the key to administrative leadership, todaythe tendency by Presidents is arguably to view the design and organizational structures as simply a minor and negotiable element in the larger political equation. The absence of a consensus as tothe principles or doctrines that should guide the process of organizational design and management,coupled with a decline in central management agencies of the U.S. government, (31) has resulted in a highlyfragmented political environment. The present situation finds, in the view of some, that agencies,their interest group constituencies, and relevant congressional committees (the fabled \"iron triangle\") have become the principal initiators and arbiters in organizational design and management.

The idea thatgenerated all this activity was the belief that management, particularly the organizational designaspect of management, was subject to certain theoretical premises applicable throughout the federalgovernment and government in general.", "Writing at mid-century, Wallace Sayre described the prevailing premises of organizationalmanagement:", "Organization theory was stated in 'scientificmanagement' terms; that is, it was seen largely as a problem in organization technology--thenecessities of hierarchy, the uses of staff agencies, a limited span of control, subdivision of work bysuch 'scientific' principles as purpose, process, place, or clientele. The executive budget wasemphasized as an instrument of rationality, of coordination, planning, and control.... A 'neutral' or'impartial' career service was required to insure competence, expertise, rationality. (33)", "These principles acquired the status of received truth, thus becoming what is referred to eventoday as the \"orthodox theory\" public administration. The most refined statement of these principlesis to be found in the 1937 essay by Luther Gulick, \"Notes on the Theory of Organization,\" which wasan edited work that accompanied the Report of the President's Committee on AdministrativeManagement (Brownlow Committee) submitted to President Franklin Roosevelt on January 1,1937. (34) The BrownlowCommittee report was described by Sayre \"as the high noon of orthodoxy in public administrationtheory in the United States.\" (35) ", "Criticism of the orthodox principles of organization was heard from academicians evenduring the period when the principles enjoyed their widest support among political and governmentalleaders. As early as 1946, behaviorists were labeling the principles of organization as mere\"proverbs.\" The problem, they alleged, was not so much that these proverbs were devoid of wisdom,but that the prevailing doctrine was inadequate to help one pick the right proverb from the wrongone. (36) What wasneeded to establish a proper theory of organizational and administrative management was thedevelopment of precise language determined by scientifically based research. Behaviorists,according to skeptics, have been trying unsuccessfully for over half a century now to come up witha comprehensive theory of governmental organization to replace the \"principles\" theydebunked. (37) ", "The consequence of these assaults on traditional public administration principles oforganizing governmental institutions has been to de-legitimate them in academic circles and to alesser degree among practitioners. Public administrators appear to be embarrassed to openly avowthe \"orthodox\" organizational principles, lest they be accused of political na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9. The retreat frompublic law experience and orthodox organizational principles proved to be an invitation to thosepromoting a new, comprehensive management style, called \"entrepreneurial management,\" a subjectto be discussed more fully elsewhere in the report.", "On a practical level, a break occurred in the 1960s between the academics, who tended toabandon orthodox organizational principles and language, and political leaders who, although theyfelt little constraint against breaking orthodox organizational principles in designing agencies andprograms, still felt compelled to use the orthodox rhetoric. Even today, most political leaders justifyreorganization proposals on the grounds of improving \"economy and efficiency,\" \"streamlininggovernment,\" \"reducing overlap and duplication\" and other such phrases which suggest the savingsof money as the primary motive for making organizational decisions.

The next twolandmark commissions, President Carter's Presidential Reorganization Project (PRP)(1977-79) andPresident Reagan's Grace Commission (1984-85), specifically disavowed orthodox organizationalmanagement principles, and by implication, government organizational theory altogether.

Now reform's purpose was to make government fit the expectations of the electoratethat was increasingly hostile to big government. In effect, administrative reform was abandoningone presidential political project regarding administration for another.

One strand consciously assumed the mantle of\"public choice\" theory. At its heart, public choice theory rests on the premise that political as wellas economic behavior is based on rational, self-serving maximization of material income or thesatisfaction derived therefrom. (45) ", "The political impact of this premise has been extraordinary. By the mid-1980s, it had sweptmany nations to varying degrees, including the United States, and contributed its share to thecollapse of the communist world and to centralized government planning and management generally. Planned economies fell from favor. Free market advocates pushed a variety of related conceptsinternationally, many with profound implications for government management. (46) A New PublicManagement (NPM) paradigm (model) emerged in the early 1990s and rapidly gained internationalcurrency through its dissemination, if not uncritical support, by the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD). (47) The underlying premise of the NPM is that the governmentaland private sectors are alike in their essentials and subject to the same generic managementprinciples. Promoters of NPM (\"entrepreneurs\") rely on literature, propositions, and practices thatstrive for convergence of the governmental and private sectors. (48) The acceptance of theconvergence model of public management worldwide has been both rapid and in some instancesdisruptive. (49) ", "The American variation on the New Public Management (NPM) was the \"reinventinggovernment\" exercise, led principally by Vice President Al Gore. The reinventors largely rejectedthe language of public choice, however, preferring instead that of business schools: entrepreneursaccept the underlying premise that the government and private sectors are fundamentally alike andsubject to most of the same economically derived behavioral norms. (50) In the private sector theprincipal, if not exclusive, objective is results, and this principle, in their view, should be applied tothe governmental sector as well. Thus, the first principle of the 1993 National Performance Review(NPR) Report reads: \"Effective entrepreneurial governments cast aside red tape, shifting fromsystems in which people are accountable for following rules to systems in which they are accountablefor achieving results.\" (51) ", "This shift toward results over legal process as the primary value in government managementis a statement about political power as well as administrative management. Vice President Goreindicated as much in 1993 when he stated: \"CEOs--from the White House to agency heads--mustensure that everyone understands that power will never flow through the old channels again.\" (52) The NPR vision was tobreak down the barriers between the sectors and create a society of government/private partnerships. The partnerships, ideally, would be largely autonomous bodies run by managers under contract tomeet negotiated performance standards. The entrepreneurs argue that managers should bederegulated, given freedom from congressional \"micro-management\" (53) and less supervision by thePresident and his central managerial agencies. Since the goal is greater managerial autonomy, thereis relatively little interest in organization per se , or in the legal theories that encourage politicalaccountability for agencies and officers.", "Critics (often self-identified as constitutionalists) challenged the fundamental philosophicalbasis of the entrepreneurial management paradigm arguing, among other things, that it tends tosubvert the intentions of the Constitution and is anti-democratic in thrust, if not intention. Constitutionalists view the government and private sectors as distinct in character, with thedistinctions founded in law. The distinguishing characteristic of governmental management,contrasted to private management, is that government actions must have their basis in public law,not in the financial interests of private entrepreneurs or in the fiduciary concerns of corporatemanagers. (54) Thefrequently criticized hierarchical structure found in the executive branch is designed more to ensureaccountability for managerial action; promoting control over employee is secondary. In this view,the value of accountability to political leadership and the importance of due process indecisionmaking trumps the premium placed on performance and results. However, it is less aquestion of pursuing one value at the expense of the other than it is a matter of precedence in theevent of conflict. ", "According to the constitutionalists, the fundamental purpose of governmental managementis to implement the laws passed by Congress, laws that may be wise or less-wise, not necessarily tomaximize performance (however it is defined and measured) or to satisfy \"customers.\" Whilepolitical accountability and effective performance are generally compatible objectives, when thesevalues come into conflict, the democratic values of legal process and political accountability takeprecedence over the unquestioned entrepreneurial values of efficiency and results.", "The century closed with this debate between the entrepreneurs and constitutionalists over thefuture direction of public administration.

The executive branch is not the result of random political actions. Nor is it a construct of a singlemoment, set in stone to last the ages. Rather, it is a product of several basic theoretical conceptsintended to create a structure that permits and enhances the Founders' goal of creating a democraticrepublic. In the century recently ended, these theoretical concepts underwent periodicreinterpretations to accommodate changing circumstances and administrative values.", "This study covers the period through 1999, but it is already clear in this new century that newinstitutional questions and challenges are facing the President and Congress. For instance, how bestto reorganize the executive branch to pursue effective counterterrorist measures without erodingdemocratic accountability and the proper administration of other agencies and programs? ShouldCongress realign committee jurisdictions to best oversee and co-manage the national counterterrorism strategy?

I recommend that theCongress consider this subject with a view to provide by legislation for the transfer, distribution,consolidation, and assignment of duties and executive organizations or parts of organizations, forthe changes in business methods, within or between the several Departments, that will best promotethe economy, efficiency, and high character of the Government's work.

As a consequence, few outside consultants were hired and the workwas performed almost completely by federal officers and employees on their own time, in additionto their regular duties.

In all, it issued 19 formal reports to the President, although they were never compiled andissued as a single report. Gustavus Weber states: \"It is much to be regretted that ... these reports ofthe Keep Commission were never published as public documents. The result is that they areexceedingly difficult to obtain. The set possessed by the Institute of Governmental research [laterto become The Brookings Institution] is, in fact, the only complete set of which the author of thepresent volume has knowledge.\" (64) ", "While there were hundreds of recommendations ranging from agency specific togovernment-wide proposals, the \"success\" of the exercise was difficult to measure.

It stimulated management improvement in bureau after bureauand in such varied fields as accounting and costing, archives and records administration,simplification of paper work, use of office machinery, personnel administration, procurement andsupply, and contracting procedures.... Congress, however, resented its activities because itthreatened many vested interests and jobs and because it had only presidential sanction.

What, then, was thecontribution of the Keep Commission? First, it produced a quality set of reports that reflected theinitial effort by the executive branch to study itself in a comprehensive fashion. Second, it was acommission that broke with the congressional definition of efficiency, a term associated almostexclusively with \"economy,\" or the spending of less monies, and concentrated instead uponexpanding the capacity of agency heads to manage their agencies. Third, the commission wasresponsible for creating a whole new vocabulary of terms and concepts to be applied to publicadministration.

In effect, Congress was calling for an executive budget to be submitted by thePresident, a practice in use in many states. President Taft and his Treasury Secretary, FranklinMacVeigh, quickly found that they did not have the resources to meet this requirement. As a resultof the Tawney Amendment passed during the Keep Commission days, Taft was not able to establishand fund a commission by presidential directive. Also, Taft, unlike his predecessor, had a lessexpansive view of presidential prerogatives and was more deferential to congressional sensibilities:he requested funds so that he might determine how best to establish a commission to address theexecutive budget issue. Taft requested that Congress appropriate $100,000 for this preliminaryexercise, and Congress appropriated the funds (36 Stat. 703).", "The project was conducted in two phases; phase one, from October 1910 through March1911, consisted of making preliminary studies, largely under the direction of the President'sSecretary, Charles Norton, to determine the scope of the issue areas. Phase two comprised theestablishment of a commission to study the data and make recommendations to the President, andthe Commission on Economy and Efficiency.

Goodnow, professor of administrative law;Harvey S. Chase, a certified public accountant; and Merritt O. Chance, then Auditor for the PostOffice Department, was made secretary and later a member of the commission. ", "Later on, in an economy measure intended to appease a hostile Congress, Taft reduced thecommission in 1912 to three members, Cleveland, Warwick and Chance. Former membersGoodnow and Willoughby maintained close ties to the commission nonetheless.", "Administrative Philosophy.", "There was, at least initially, a division of opinion regarding the appropriate direction for theproposed commission to take. For the most part, Congress wished to have the commission reassertits values, meaning congressional dominance over agency management and funding. Efficiency,defined simply as spending less monies, was the congressional leitmotif and they expected anyreorganization proposal and any executive budget proposal to promote this overall objective. Taft,however, rejected this narrow approach and determined instead to align himself with the newlyemergent field of public administration. In consultation with the New York Bureau of MunicipalResearch, he determined to make this definitely a presidential exercise by having the study based inthe White House. Frederick Cleveland, the director selected by Taft for the initial study was alsodirector of the New York Bureau. By placing the study physically in the White House, Taft wasnot only concerned with protecting the commission from congressional pressures, but from pressuresby cabinet members as well. The study was to be comprehensive in scope, concerned withorganization as well as budgetary matters and management practices.", "In President Taft's message to Congress of January 17, 1912 (H. Doc. 458), he reviewed thestatus of the executive branch as he found it in 1909:", "This vast organization has never been studiedin detail as one piece of administrative mechanism. Never have the foundations been laid for athrough consideration of the relations of all its parts. No comprehensive effort has been made to listits multifarious activities or to group them in such a way as to present a clear picture of what theGovernment is doing. Never has a complete description been given of the agencies through whichthese activities are performed. At no time has the attempt been made to study all of these activitiesand agencies with a view to the assignment of each activity to the agency best fitted for itsperformance, to the avoidance of duplication of plant and work, to the integration of all administrative agencies of the Government, so far as may be practicable, into a unified organizationfor the most effective and economical dispatch of public business. (68) ", "By the comprehensive vision President Taft brought to the project, he significantly redefinedthe debate over organizational management and established the President as the key player for futureorganizational management. As Peri Arnold notes:", "From a modern perspective, it is difficult toappreciate how innovative was Cleveland's model of the organization of the executive branch. Nolonger were these agencies to be understood as single units tied to Congress by an imbilical cord ofstatute and appropriations. Rather, they would be seen as part of a whole that had hierarchy andordered authority--a bureaucracy. When seen through this new conception, the traditional pictureof the dominant tie of agency to legislature is an intrusive element--a pathology. (69) ", "Organization, Staff Support, and Funding.", "Pursuant to its statutory authority, a preliminary investigation was begun under CharlesNorton, Secretary to the President. At the close of the preliminary studies President Taft, as notedearlier, requested an appropriation of $100,000 which Congress granted in a sundry civilappropriation act for 1911. This appropriation was supplemented by one for $75,000 contained inthe sundry civil appropriation act for 1912. Another appropriation for $10,000 passed to meet theexpenses of a special investigation of the Patent Office, which Congress, by joint resolution, directedthe President to make. Finally, Congress appropriated $75,000 in the sundry civil appropriation actfor 1913. The total funding for the commission was thus $260,000 from fiscal years July 1, 1910,to June 30, 1913. (70) ", "Reports and Recommendations.", "The commission, complaining of meagre funding and inadequate congressional support,nonetheless produced many reports, some of which were sent to Congress, others not. The formsof publications included a Message of the President, accompanied by the official reports to Congress;circulars printed by the commission; and miscellaneous documents (e.g., Treasury circulars). Thegreat majority of reports and recommendations were agency-specific (e.g., consolidation of theBureau of Lighthouses with the Life-Saving Service) or process-based (e.g., principles for handlingcorrespondence) and thus constituted what today might be referred to as micro-management issues. Most of the recommendations were concerned with personnel, financial practices, and business typeactivities performed by agencies. (71) The running thread of the various recommendations was thatagencies should be grouped together by purpose and that they should follow similar procedures inthe conduct of their affairs.", "One of the recommendations of the commission proved, however, to be of government-wideand political importance. President Taft forwarded a Message to Congress, attached to thecommission's 568 page supporting report ( The Need for a National Budget ), calling for a nationalexecutive budget. (72) In the meantime, Taft directed that agencies simultaneously assemble an estimate of expendituresusing the traditional congressional method and an executive budget according to a presidentiallydirected format. In 1913, just prior to his leaving Office, Taft proposed that his successor be givena presidential staff agency to support the President in his new budgetary responsibilities.", "Understandably, a major political debate ensued over which institution, the President orCongress, had principal authority and responsibility to oversee the agencies. Opposition to theproposal was not confined to certain Members of Congress, but included some cabinet secretariesas well, secretaries with well developed lines of communications and support from their committees. In the immediate term, Congress, and more particularly the two appropriations committees,prevailed over President Taft, the latter being politically weakened by the congressional electionsof 1910 and the divisive 1912 presidential elections, in which the Democrats swept not only theWhite House but both houses of Congress as well. Some voluntary actions at the agency level wereforthcoming, but generally speaking, little action proceeded directly from the commission report orits leadership. In a post-election gesture, Taft proposed that his successor be given a presidentialstaff agency to support the President in meeting his responsibilities as part of the larger executivebudget reforms.

In hindsight the Commission was strikinglysuccessful, even if that success was longer in coming than any of its members would have preferred. Its work formed the template of modern comprehensive reorganization planning.\" (75) ", "Taft had made a plea to Woodrow Wilson, his successor, to keep the commission alive, butto no avail. Wilson, although considered a successful Progressive in many respects, was notinterested in continuing the life or the work of the commission.", "The major contribution made by the commission was more in the theoretical or conceptualrealm than in the contribution of specific recommendations. With the commission's studies, the casewas made for presidential authority and resources to manage the federal bureaucracy. Congress itselfgradually became persuaded by this argument and also by the experience of World War I, with itsmassive demands upon the administrative system of the nation.", "Congress, early in the Wilson administration, passed a bill, signed by the President (March25, 1913) (38 Stat.1007), establishing the Bureau of Efficiency as a branch of the Civil ServiceCommission. In a sense, Congress looked upon this Bureau as a successor of the President'sCommission on Economy and Efficiency. The Bureau was plagued by the absence of adequatefunding. Nonetheless, the mandate of the Bureau was expanded by act of March 4, 1915, to includethe \"investigation of duplication of statistical and other work and method of business in the variousbranches of government service.\" In 1916, the Bureau was made an independent agency (39Stat.15). Although the Bureau was authorized to investigate the need for administrativereorganization, it never undertook such a project. (76) The Bureau of Efficiency had an ambiguous status. As GustavusWeber noted at the time: \"[T]he Bureau, notwithstanding that its legal status is that of a part of theadministrative branch of the government, is functioning largely as a direct agent of the legislativebranch.\" (77) The Bureauwas abolished in 1933 (97 Stat. 1519)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint Committee on Reorganization (1921-1924)", "paragraphs": ["Context.", "The First World War provided extensive evidence of the need for an integrated executivebranch with the President as chief manager.

To this end, the bill provided for the establishment of a Bureau of the Budget in the Officeof the President. President Wilson announced his support, belatedly in the view of supporters, forthe executive budget concept. The Senate passed a revised version of the bill on May 1, 1920. Thisrevised bill provided not only for a Bureau of the Budget but for a General Accounting Office in thelegislative branch as well. (78) ", "While the bill had some recognized flaws, supporters were nonetheless surprised whenPresident Wilson invoked his veto power, citing constitutional grounds. The President objected toprocedures for removing the Comptroller General. (79) Frantic efforts to refashion the bill before adjournment wereunsuccessful, thus ending the opportunity for President Wilson to take some credit for establishinga national budget and a national budget agency.", "The Republican sweep of 1920 enhanced already strong sentiment for budget reform. Congress altered the Budget bill slightly, hoping to overcome objections. First, the new BudgetBureau was to be \"in but not of\" the Department of the Treasury, with a separate director to beappointed by the President and not subject to Senate confirmation. Second, Congress wouldcontinue to be the initiatory agent for removing the Comptroller General, but removal would requirea joint resolution, a procedure with the effect of law, thereby requiring a presidential signature. Thenew President, Warren Harding, did not challenge this removal procedure (it has never beenemployed), and thus the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 became law (42 Stat. 20). HerbertEmmerich, succumbing to hyperbole, described the Budget and Accounting Act as \"probably thegreatest landmark of our administrative history except for the Constitution itself.\" (80) ", "Authority.", "In the waning days of the Wilson Administration, Congress, by joint resolution of December29, 1920 (41 Stat. 1083), created a Joint Committee on Reorganization, to be composed of threemembers of each house of Congress, appointed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of theHouse. The mission of the commission was \"to make a survey of the administrative services of thegovernment for the purpose of securing all pertinent facts concerning their powers and duties, theirdistribution among the several executive departments and their overlapping and duplication ofauthority....\" (81) ", "At the suggestion of the new President, Warren Harding, Congress passed a supplementaryjoint resolution, approved May 5, 1921 (42 Stat. 3), authorizing the President to appoint arepresentative of the executive branch to cooperate with the Joint Committee on Reorganization,whose salary should be paid in equal parts from the contingent funds of the Senate and House.

(84) As a matter of high priority, Harding successfully pushed forpassage of legislation to establish both a General Accounting Office and a Bureau of the Budget. (42Stat. 20). Next, Harding sought to not only have executive participation on the Joint Committee,but for the executive branch to take the lead. He was committed to submit to Congress acomprehensive executive reorganization proposal, which occurred in the early months of Harding'ssuccessor, President Calvin Coolidge.

No apparent concern was expressed at the time about this extraordinary apparentbreaching of the separation of powers doctrine.", "Administrative Philosophy.", "The principal philosophical underpinning of the joint committee exercise was to reorganizethe executive branch according to \"major purpose.\" In President Harding's letter of June 13, 1921to the joint committee, he stated:", "Since it is extremely difficult to administerefficiently departments which include wholly dissimilar and unrelated services, and quite impossibleto administer economically identical or similar services which are scattered throughout severaldepartments, it would seem necessary at the outset of the work of reorganization to provide astatutory regrouping of governmental activities to the end, as far as practice, that each departmentbe made up of agencies having substantially the same major purpose and, further, that identical orsimilar services shall be grouped together. (86)", "The joint committee, especially its chairman, Walter F. Brown, was receptive to the conceptof reorganizing by major purpose, although this term was as likely to raise questions as to be theanswer. ", "The chief player in developing and sustaining an administrative philosophy for theAdministration was a member of Harding's Cabinet, Herbert Hoover, Secretary of Commerce. Hoover enthusiastically embraced the Brown effort as his own and set about to reassert theProgressive ideal of an efficient, but also effective, executive branch. (87) Peri Arnold provides agraphic description of the dynamic quality that Herbert Hoover brought to the Harding Cabinet:", "The major intellectual thrust in thisreorganization effort came not from the President or Brown, but from the Secretary of Commerce,Herbert Hoover. Hoover was vitally interested in reorganization, and to this day stands out asperhaps the most prominent theoretician-practitioner in American public administration. Beyondthis, Hoover was the pillar of the Harding cabinet. The President trusted his Secretary of Commerceand tended to rely on Hoover for advice on a wide range of policy matters. While President Hardingused his position to support the reorganization planning effort, and Walter Brown offered thelegitimizing aegis of the joint committee and served as coordinator, Herbert Hoover provided theintellectual thrust for the endeavor. (88)", "As Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover set out to reorganize much of the executivebranch. His immediate objective was to alter and expand the functions of the Department ofCommerce. During the course of the discussion in 1921 within the executive branch, he proposedthree great divisions for the Department; one for industry, one for trade, and one for transportationand commerce. A variety of agencies would then be shifted to the Commerce Department. EllisHawley observed of Hoover's early reorganization effort: \"In essence, the Commerce Departmentwas to become a department of economic development and management; other agencies would stillbe responsible for special sectors of the economy, but Commerce would serve as a generalcoordinator....\" (89) ", "Not surprisingly, Secretary Hoover's grand scheme, while enjoying some implicit supportfrom the White House, was viewed by the other departments and agencies as a \"power grab.\" Opposition within the cabinet to the Hoover proposal was immediate and intense. (90) Congress, although it hadbeen waiting for the comprehensive executive reorganization report from the joint committee it hadcreated in cooperation with the White House, was less than enthusiastic with its finalrecommendations and chose to take a pass on this first opportunity to perform major surgery on theexecutive branch. (91) ", "Organization, Staff Support, and Funding.", "Unable to establish its own staff, the joint committee, in the form of Walter F. Brown,requested the assistance of the Bureau of Efficiency under Herbert Brown (no relation). Like thejoint committee, the Bureau tried to straddle the branches. It worked with congressional committeeson budgetary matters and worked with the executive branch to promote central managerial interests. The Bureau was very cognizant of the institutional weakness of the presidential office.", "Under the Constitution, the President isresponsible for the management of the executive branch of the government, but up to the present,Congress has not seen fit to give to the Chief Executive any machinery with which he can effectivelydischarge this responsibility. The President's staff consists wholly of a small number of personalsecretaries and clerks. The time of this staff is taken up with the consideration of legislativebusiness, the preparation of commissions, appointment matters, and so on. Under these conditionsthe President is... unable to function as an administrative officer. (92)", "The Bureau of Efficiency did provide clerical and other support to the Joint Committee. Herbert Hoover's staff at the Commerce Department was also used to develop and promote his viewson the proper direction for the executive branch to take. Hoover, as we will learn, tended to besimultaneously of two minds with regard to executive branch organization. First, he sought to buildup the capacity of the executive branch to meet its responsibilities under a President holdingsufficient authority and institutional support to be the activist Chief Manager. Second, andsomewhat paradoxically to his critics, he believed that government should be limited in its functionsand seek the least claim (economy and efficiency) upon the resources of the taxpayers.", "Reports and Recommendations.", "When the joint committee received the reports and recommendations from theHarding-Coolidge administration, it reviewed the studies without benefit of staff. Nonetheless, thejoint committee held hearings in 1924, but several factors discouraged the committee from pursuinglegislation on recommendations of the report. First, a new President, Calvin Coolidge, had replacedthe recently deceased Harding, and had exhibited little interest in executive branch reorganizationor the development of a White House staff capacity. Second, administration witnesses illustratedin their remarks the strong divisions of opinion on reorganization proposals, especially the proposalto merge the Departments of War and Navy. Third, there was little discussion of how thereorganizations would eventually \"save\" money.", "The plan submitted by the joint committee to the full Congress was essentially the Hardingplan minus the provision to merge War and Navy. Neither Harding's plan or the specific proposalsprovided firm statistics on \"savings\" to be achieved by the reorganization. As it turned out, theattractiveness of reorganization was waning and \"none of the Joint Committee's large-scalerecommendations were given serious consideration.\" (93) ", "The methodology for developing an overall executive branch reorganization plan was to havethe departments themselves take the first shot. Each was to submit a plan to Walter Brown. InBrown's view, such an approach, which was the opposite of the arms-length approach of Taft'sCommission on Economy and Efficiency, was more likely to produce informed analysis by thosemost clearly affected. This approach, however, left most of the department secretaries nonplusedor highly defensive.", "Unlike his cabinet colleagues, Secretary Herbert Hoover saw this approach as an opportunityto recast his Department as the centerpiece of a completely redesigned government. Under hisreorganization plan, submitted to Brown (and also the President) in 1921, the Commerce Departmentwould become a \"super department\" responsible for government's activities in industry, trade, andtransportation. To achieve this objective, many agencies would be taken from their currentdepartments and placed in whole or in part in the new Department of Commerce. A typical transferproposed by Hoover was to move the Bureau of Public Roads from the Agriculture Department toCommerce. Not surprisingly, Hoover's proposals and those of other departmental secretaries,provided the grist for controversy within the Administration. Rather than presiding over a rational,scientific debate on the alternatives of organizational design, Brown found that he was a referee inan amazingly intense political struggle. As if the individual reports of departmental secretaries werenot enough, Brown was the recipient of two major reports from outside organizations, the NationalBudget Committee and the Brookings Institution. (94) ", "The plans submitted by the departments generally called for the aggrandizement of theirfunctions. In no instance did a department propose to limit or shed one of its functions. Brownworked diligently to make a single plan from the many submitted to present to the President for hisreview. Finally, a single reorganization plan was put in front of the President, who was immediatelyfaced with strong opposition from cabinet members. Conflict was intense on certain proposals,especially the proposal to transfer the Forest Service from the Agriculture Department to the InteriorDepartment. For months, the cabinet debated the provisions of the plan, and there was littleprogress. ", "Finally, under pressure from Congress, Harding had Brown produce a single plan, onepresumably representing the President's views, and sent it to the joint committee. TheAdministration's proposals were bold and expansive, but politically unacceptable and no action wasforthcoming.", "Results and Assessment.", "None of the specific recommendations of the joint committee was directly adopted, but theyinfluenced executive organization and management nonetheless. The 1920s were years of transition,with the President gradually emerging as the dominant force in supervising administrativeagencies. (95) A numberof agency-specific reorganization studies were published during the decade, and definite steps weretaken to enhance the managerial capacities of departmental secretaries as well as those of thePresident.

(97) No action was forthcoming on his proposal. In his first yearas President, 1929, Hoover included in his Annual Message to Congress, a request for authority tosubmit proposals for reorganization, subject to some form of congressional disapproval. He said thathe saw \"no hope for the development of a sound reorganization of the Government unless Congressbe willing to delegate its authority over the problem (subject to defined principles) to the Executive,who should act upon approval of a joint committee of Congress or with the reservation of power ofrevision by Congress within some limited period adequate for its consideration.\" (98) ", "During 1930, Hoover was able to secure from Congress approval of two agencyconsolidations. On May 27, 1930, he signed a bill authorizing him to consolidate all the Prohibitionenforcement agencies into the Department of Justice, which he did. On July 8, 1930, under authorityof Congress, he issued an Executive order creating the Veterans' Administration out of some fiveagencies scattered among the departments. The new Administrator of Veterans' Affairs claimed thatthe reorganization and consolidation saved $10,000,000 a year, thus reasserting the standard rationalefor reorganization, the saving of money, and only secondarily the improvement of managerialcapacity.

The President couldtransfer the whole or any part of any independent executive agency, or the functions thereof, to anexecutive department or to another independent executive agency. Functions within a departmentcould be consolidated. This power was conferred upon the President without a time limit (47 Stat.413).", "Reorganization proposals were subject to a one-house veto. The legislation provided that thePresident could propose a reorganization by an executive order, which would be transmitted toCongress while in session, but not become effective until 60 days after its transmittal. Congresscould shorten the period by passing a concurrent resolution of approval.

The delegation of power in that act was extraordinary. The statute did more than allow thePresident to transfer functions.

The philosophy of the commission with respect to theorganization of the executive branch was stated at the outset: \"[We] must reorganize the ExecutiveBranch to give it simplicity of structure, the unity of purpose, and the clear line of executiveauthority originally intended.\" (146) The commission, and in this instance the influence of Mr.Hoover is readily apparent, continued by stating that it was their objective to:", "Establish a clear line of control from thePresident to those department and agency heads and from them to their subordinates with correlativeresponsibility from these officials to the President, cutting through the barriers which have in manycases made bureaus and agencies partially independent of the chiefexecutive.", "Permit the operating departments and agenciesto administer for themselves a larger share of the routine administrative services, under strictsupervision and in conformity with high standards. (147)", "The doctrine underlying most of the recommendations was that responsibility for makingpolicy and setting standards ought to be centralized in the President, central management agencies,and department secretaries, rather than being devolved to the agency level. The commissioncriticized the tendency towards dispersing functions to independent agencies and called for arenewed, hierarchical administrative structure. ", "The section titled \"Departmental Management\" was short. The commission believed that thedepartmental system had deteriorated because Congress, and sometimes the President, had departedfrom the norm of the integrated administrative system they believed was intended by theConstitution.", "The Congress, and sometimes the President,have set up a maze of independent agencies reporting directly to the President; and the Congressfrequently has fixed by statute the internal organization of departments and agencies and has givenauthority directly to subordinate officers. As a result, instead of being a unified organization,responsible to the executive direction of the President and accountable to the Congress for use of thepower and funds granted by law, the executive branch is a chaos of bureaus andsubdivisions.", "The responsibility, the vigor of executiveleadership, and the unity of administration of the executive as planned by the Constitution must berestored. (148) ", "The recommendations were for grouping agencies into departments \"as nearly as possible bymajor purposes.\" Department secretaries should be given full responsibility and authority for theconduct of their department. There should be decentralization into the operating agencies of suchfunctions as accounting, budgeting, recruiting and managing the personnel. And finally, departmentheads should be given increased staff support. The commission concluded, in a rather off-handedmanner: \"We recommend that these various agencies be consolidated into about one-third of thepresent number.\" (149) ", "The commission was generally pleased with the development of the Executive Office of thePresident (EOP) although they called for a new Office of Personnel to be headed by a director whowould also serve as chairman of the Civil Service Commission. It is interesting that the commissiondid not make any recommendations designed to convert the cabinet into a more cohesive policydeveloping unit with a degree of collective responsibility, a favored proposal of reformers. Thecommission recommended that the President be given permanent authority to submit reorganizationplans to effectuate changes in structure and that such plans should not be restricted by limitationsor exemptions. In short, the report on \"General Management of the Executive Branch\" constituteda clear, concise, statement of many of the orthodox principles of public administration as applied ina practical sense to the executive branch.", "Results and Assessment.", "\"The record of results,\" Herbert Emmerich concluded, \"achieved after the Commissionsubmitted its recommendations was extraordinary.\" (150) A number of commission recommendations provided crucialimpetus for the passage of major legislation such as the Federal Property and AdministrativeServices Act creating the General Services Administration. A large number of Reorganization Planswere submitted in 1949 and 1950 which enjoyed a high percentage of success. (151) Six of the plansprovided that responsibilities for performance of all functions within these departments be vestedin the secretary for delegation, not assigned directly to subordinate officers. ", "Not all commission recommendations were accepted. Among the rejected were those tocreate a Water Development Use Service in the Interior Department to consist of a merger of theArmy Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, and the creation of a United MedicalAdministration outside the departmental structure. The latter recommendation failed, in part,because it violated the principles of organization set out by former President Hoover in his openingremarks of the Report.", "Former President Hoover was to prove innovative with respect to gaining public support forthe commission and its recommendations. He believed that prior commissions had enjoyed littlesuccess largely because they had not developed and nurtured a constituency and had been ineffectivein public relations. He set about to remedy these failings with respect to his commission. (152) Under Hoover'sguidance, the commission created its own interest group, the Citizens Committee for the HooverReport (CCHR).", "The CCHR moved in stages, first with more than 700 prominent citizens listed as supporters. Next, Citizens Committees were formed in 45 states with 300 county and local affiliates. Evenallowing for organizational hyperbole, this was an impressive effort. Funding for the commissioncame from foundations, corporations, and individuals. The central office prepared vast quantitiesof materials for distribution and for other national organizations to distribute to their ownmemberships. Finally, the Citizens Committee drafted many legislative proposals and submittedthem to the relevant committees of Congress.", "The principal message of the Citizens Committee, and its tireless leaders, was that savingsof billions, the most common figure cited was $4 billion, was possible if all the recommendationsof the commission were adopted. Even Mr. Hoover made this claim. (153) ", "Claims of savings had been a source of contention throughout the deliberations of thecommission, as well as afterward. To critics, all these figures were sheer \"guesswork\" that misledthe public. Objections to the use of \"savings estimates\" in no substantial way reduced their appealor utility to the Citizens Committee. Compromise was not considered a virtue by the CCHR in thisinstance. Like many successor commissions, supporters relied on \"horror stories\" of allegedgovernment incompetence and downplayed serious recommendations to increase the capacity ofgovernment to perform its statutory missions. The CCHR even refused a White House request thatthe committee drum up support for better pay for government executives.", "The public relations effort, although prone to simplistic interpretations of crude statistics, wasnonetheless considered effective, as Herbert Emmerich later observed: \"The public relations ofHoover I was a serious professional job, a job which the Brownlow Committee had neglected, andwhich supporters of Hoover II pushed beyond the limits of credibility....\" (154) ", "The relationship between the CCHR and the White House was correct, if not cordial, withboth sides seeking to avoid confrontation. Generally speaking, the White House and supporters ofa strong managerial presidency were pleased that the CCHR had chosen \"savings\" as their themebecause this meant, in their opinion, that most of the significant aspects of the Hoover Report wouldbe missed by the press and the public, and thereby engender little opposition.", "A concentration on the reorganization of departments, agencies, and certain functions, whileimportant, tends to obscure what to many was the principal achievement of the first HooverCommission, namely the enhancement of the presidential office as manager of the government. PeriArnold observes: \"It was the supreme political accomplishment of the first Hoover Commission thatit masked the managerial Presidency with the older values of administrative orthodoxy and, to asignificant degree, undercut the conservative and congressional opposition to the expansiveexecutive.... In the end, Mr. Hoover and his Commission provided the bridge over which thecongressional opponents of the Brownlow Committee recommendations and the old politicalenemies of Franklin Roosevelt could embrace the managerial Presidency.\" (155) ", "As the work of the commission was coming to a close, President Truman, in 1949, createdhis own Advisory Committee on Management (Executive order 10072) to study managementproblems in the federal government from a presidential perspective. This committee was also toadvise him with respect to recommendations submitted by the Hoover Commission.

(157) The Administration'sbill was much broader in scope than the 1945 Act. The bill contained no termination date, no agencyexemptions, eliminated the clause calling for a cost saving of 25%, permitted the creation of newexecutive departments (although no new functions) and required both houses of Congress toapprove a resolution (concurrent resolution) of disapproval before a plan could become effective.", "In the House hearings, the perennial issue as to the constitutionality of the legislative vetoprocess was raised. Rep.

Senator John McClellan,chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments, and also one ofthe 12 commissioners on the then Hoover Commission, opposed the transfer of civilian Army Corpsof Engineers functions to the Department of the Interior. The majority of the committee decidedthat the only way to eliminate agency exemptions, while retaining congressional protection forcertain favored agencies, was to institute a single-house veto procedure.", "In order that the President might includeessential Government reorganizations in conformity with the recommendations of the Committeeon Organization of the Executive Branch [Hoover Commission], the committee was reluctant toinclude exemptions for specified agencies or to retain the House amendments placing certain of themin a restricted category, in the belief that such exemptions might interfere with realignments thatwould be desirable and in the public interest....

", "\"[T]he real objective in inserting the one-house veto requirement was not just to get rid ofexemptions, but to stiffen congressional powers of resistance to presidential reorganization plans. The success of this effort in the Senate to shift from the two-house veto to the one-house veto marksa definite withdrawal by Congress of effective reorganization powers which it had been willing todelegate in the 1939 and 1945 Acts.

The pressgave a favorable response to the plans. All were significant in their impact, and in previous yearswould have generated considerable controversy. The Administration, as well as the CCHR,encountered some difficulties, however, as the plans did not provide for any substantial savings. Indeed, Plan No. 1 ran into opposition because it would clearly have expanded the federalgovernment's role in the health field.

The plans fell into groups. PlansOne through Six provided that responsibilities for the performance of all functions within sixdepartments be vested in the secretary of those departments. Previously, the authority to performfunctions had been dispersed by Congress. The purpose of these plans was to establish clear linesof responsibility from the President on down through the lowest level of the department.", "A second group of plans was submitted to improve the internal administration of theregulatory commissions. These plans were designed to enhance the managerial authority of thechairmen. Three plans were proposed to assist the new General Services Administration as thecentral service agency. In an attempt to meet the objections of those opposed to the defeated 1949reorganization plan to create a Department of Welfare, Truman submitted a plan to create a newDepartment of Health, Education and Security, but left the independent statutory authorities of theSurgeon General and Commissioner of Education intact. Overall, in 1950, the President faredreasonably well in having 22 of his 27 plans approved.", "The years 1951 and 1952 were difficult ones for President Truman in a political sense.

Unlike the law creatingthe first commission, the legislation creating what rapidly became known as the second HooverCommission did not impose a partisan parity requirement upon the selection process. Thecommission at its initial meeting, held in the White House with President Eisenhower in attendance,unanimously elected Herbert Hoover as chairman, although the commission did not elect a vicechairman, as authorized in the legislation.

Theseparagraphs are intended to make certain that this Commission has full power to look into theactivities of the Federal Government from the standpoint of policy and to inquire, 'Should theGovernment be performing this activity or service, and if so, to what extent?' This Commission mustask questions of this nature which the original Hoover Commission did not ask. (167)", "Although a broad interpretation of the commission's mandate was held by its sponsors anda majority of its members, it is not surprising that this view generated controversy. Chet Holifield,commission member and chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, disputed theidea that the commission could delve deeply into policy matters. Indeed, he questioned the wisdomof the whole concept of creating unelected commissions to second-guess, in effect, electedassemblies. He concluded that the creation of policy-oriented commissions, such as the secondHoover Commission, was \"an unwise departure from representative government.\" (168) The \"mandate battle\"continued throughout the life of the Commission and indeed remains an issue confronting all \"citizencommission\" proposals to this day.

Similarly, the size of the staffs working fortask forces varied. There is some disagreement as to the total number of person involved with thecommission. MacNeil and Metz estimated that close to 200 persons served on the task forces andcommittees of the commission (169) while James Fesler states that the commission \"was assistedby 513 persons at the peak of employment.\" (170) Regardless of which figure is accepted, there were a largenumber of persons involved, particularly if agency detailees, consultants, and Bureau of the Budgetpersonnel are included.", "The central staff of the second Hoover Commission was relatively small (77 persons) andhighly supportive of the chairman. They generally viewed their task as ministerial and clerical, andleft the great bulk of the investigation, research, and writing to the staffs of the several task forcesand the consulting organizations. In most respects, the central staff was similar to that of the firstcommission except that they were not responsible for developing a set of summary reports in acommon format for submission to Congress.

The draft would be circulated among the members and staff for comment. Theworking paper generally omitted or modified a number of task force recommendations.", "The deliberative process followed by the Commission was limited, for the most part, to theworking papers placed in front of the members. Much time was spent on textual questions with littletime spent on discussing the assumptions underlying the recommendations or the possible impactof the recommendations upon the administrative system as a whole. The Commission took up therecommendations one at a time in a sequential fashion rather than viewing the recommendationscomprehensively. No distinction was made between major and minor recommendations, nor werethey integrated into a single report. Nineteen separate reports were sent to Congress (the legislationhad not provided that the President receive the reports) followed by a relatively short Final Reportto the Congress submitted in June 1955.

The vacuum is not adequately filled by theCommission's effort to state its objectives. The principal explicit statement provides a mixture of goals (national security, fundamental research, private enterprise, common welfare, andstrengthening of 'the economic, social and governmental structure which has brought us, now for 166years, constant blessings and progress') and means (efficiency, elimination of waste, elimination orreduction of government competition with private enterprise), but the means are actually treated asends valuable in themselves so long as they do not war with other ends....

Hoover, personally, had been able to avoid this confrontation in hisown mind for many years. \"Herbert Hoover's perception of the principles of good administration,\"according to Peri Arnold, \"allowed him to skirt effectively the tension between his political values[anti-statism] and his attraction to the apparent efficacy of the positive state.\" (180) This separation wasfragile, however, and broke down when the second commission decided to make overt policyjudgments.", "In retrospect, the executive branch appears to have been reasonably well managed during the1940s and 1950s. The managerial agencies, e.g., Bureau of the Budget, were at the zenith of theirstrength. While a number of factors may be cited as contributing to this felicitous situation, it wouldbe unfair and inaccurate to ignore the contribution of the two Hoover Commissions. The firstcommission, in particular, argued from first principles stressing the need for political and managerialaccountability and clear lines of responsibility.

Secondly, there was a belief that the President and the departments wouldbe benefitted by a regional executive structure in which the vertical program oriented structurereaching to Washington would be altered by having program officers report to a regionalagency/program representative. These regional officials would be appointed by the Secretarythereby, presumably, breaking the \"stovepipe\" to Washington. Regional officials, who tended to begeneralists selected politically, would be more likely to move the management of the agencies andprograms along Administration lines than was the case with narrowly focused, programmatic officerslocated at headquarters.

To providemeans for a rational grouping of the large bureaus and programs to be inherited by the newdepartments, the concept of the \"Administration\" was introduced as a first-tier device for programdirection.

In the Neustadian scheme, the personalized presidency largely replaced theinstitutionalized presidency. President should move away from managing the executive branch,because in so doing they are performing mere clerkship functions and miss their opportunity forheroic destiny.", "Heeding the personalized presidency theme of Neustadt, Mr. Nixon determined that the mosteffective route for reorganization was to rely on \"administrative action --that is,\" in Richard Nathan'swords, \"by using the discretion permitted in the implementation of existing laws rather thanadvancing these policy aims through enactment of new legislation.\" (214) ", "President Nixon attempted to implement as much of the Ash Council recommendations aspossible through administrative orders, e.g., creation of a \"super-cabinet,\" bypassing in the processthe requirement of congressional approval.

The strategyincluded passing laws such as the War Powers Act of 1973 and the Congressional Budget andImpoundment Act of 1974, inserting numerous legislative veto requirements to additional new andexisting laws, and extending Senate confirmation requirements to additional appointees, all actionsintended to combat the administrative presidency strategy and to decrease presidential discretion inadministrative matters.

Its members continued to publicly disavow the \"top-down\" philosophy of reorganizationwhile, in practice, following this approach. For example, they made recommendations to restructurefour departments, even creating two super departments in the process, without first specifying theproblems that warranted such major restructuring.

The Education bill could not be defended as a consolidation bill, however,as it was intended to break up the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the one civilian\"super department.\" The consolidation arguments for this separate department tended to be limitedin scope since few educational activities (e.g., military dependent schools overseas) were slated tobe shifted from other departments. The principal argument favoring the separate departmentproposal was this action would elevate and highlight the Nation's commitment to education.

The Senate and House Government Operations Committees favorably reported thebill, but the House Rules Committee (a major roadblock at the time) declined to clear the measurefor floor action.

When Congress renewed the reorganization authority in 1964, it reacted to what itconsidered a presidential \"end-run\" by prohibiting the President from submitting reorganization plansthat established an executive department (78 Stat. 240) Other restrictions on the reorganization planauthority followed.

Thetwo committees would also be required to make recommendations to the House or the Senate,respectively, within 45 days, or the committee would be deemed as having been discharged fromconsideration of the resolution.

While the use of the reorganization plan process to establish this department was endorsed byChairman Brooks of the House Government Operations Committee, it ran into stiff opposition fromSenator Abraham Ribicoff, who chaired the Governmental Affairs Committee. Ribicoff's objectionwas based on his interpretation of the Reorganization Act's prohibition against such reorganizationplans to create new departments.

The onlychance for success, in their view, lay in a reorganization plan.

President Carter, however, did pay a price. Inresponse to his request for an extension of the reorganization authority, members of Congress gavehim only a one year extension and served notice that they would use the time to review the authorityand its procedures.

Congressional ambivalence over the delegation of reorganizationauthority to the President resulted in misunderstanding, confusion, and recrimination between thetwo branches. On the one hand, Congress gave the President authority to skirt the regular legislativeprocess, yet when the President invoked the power, he risked being accused of violating theestablished system. After each presidential \"misuse,\" Congress responded by adding restrictions andexemptions, gradually circumscribing the power until the reorganization act was but a shadow of the1949 statute. The original design had been so diluted that recourse to the regular legislative processgenerally made more sense--a conclusion especially compelling in view of the 1977 change allowingPresidents to submit amendments to their plans.

Government should be organized like a large commercial corporation (IBMwas their example of choice), that is, with a structure permitting top-down control. Decisions shouldbe brought to the top where a large, central Office of Federal Management would ensure uniformity.", "Organization, Staff Support, and Finances.", "The commission assigned its responsibilities to 36 task forces, and was staffed over time bysome 2,000 people, generally on loan from their corporations, with a cost to these 859 companiesand other organizations of $75 million in cash and services.

The commission attacked Congress directly, and originally included thenames of Members who allegedly accepted favors and made pleadings for special interests.

The answer to thisquestion is complicated. For one thing, it is always difficult to assign credit and parentage to an ideawhich is ultimately implemented. A substantial number of the Grace Commission recommendationshad been around in one form or another (often in a GAO Report) for a number of years. To whomshould credit be assigned? A number of proposals (some old and some new) found their way intolegislation or presidential directive. Arguably, the most significant of the laws that could beattributed in large measure to Grace Commission promotion was the Chief Financial Officers Act( P.L. 101-576 ). While the Act had many sponsors, the critical impetus was provided by the GraceCommission and its interest group constituency in the financial management community.", "Under pressure to show results, OMB announced victory in its Fiscal 1990 AnnualManagement Report to Congress: ", "The President kept his promise.

Savingsin administrative expenses directly attributable to the Grace Commission were modest. (261) ", "By and large, Mr. Grace and his commission were disappointed with the reception to theirreport. What had occurred, in the opinion of many, was that a report had been written with littleunderstanding of the distinctive legal, organizational, and political factors that characterize theactivities of the federal government. Peri Arnold summed up criticism of the Grace Commissionthus: \"[T]he Grace Commission's highly public and very large effort may not be best assessed bywhat reforms and savings it achieved.

Brooks and Representative Frank Horton, as congressional sponsors of the legislation, believed thatthe time frame was overly burdensome, and therefore extended the period for congressionalconsideration to 90 days. Within the 90-day period, other time limitations were extendedproportionately. The 1977 Act allowed 30 days from the date of submission for the President toamend the proposal.

A series of laws set in motion large-scaledivestiture, performance contracting, administrative devolution to sub-national governments, andthe creation of quasi governmental organizations (sometimes called Quangos) were the highlightsnot only of the New Zealand exercise, but of many other of the Commonwealth countries, such asCanada, as well.

The new public management stemmed formthe basic economic argument that government suffered from defects of monopoly, high transactionscosts, and information problems that bred great inefficiencies. By substituting market competition-- and market-like incentives -- the reformers believed that they could shrink government's size,reduce its costs, and improve its performance. Sometimes the argument came from the left, as inNew Zealand. Sometimes the argument came from the right, as in the United Kingdom. However,at its core the movement sought to transform how government performed its most basicfunctions.

The situation in the United States,however, was considerably different from that found in most other countries. First, unlikeparliamentary systems, where the executive is able to change direction with considerable facility, inlarge part because their firm control over disciplined parties holding a majority in parliament, theUnited States operates under a Constitution that intentionally separates powers and brings theexecutive branch, ultimately, under the control of Congress. The President and Congress areco-managers of the executive branch, thus making dramatic and comprehensive shifts less likely tooccur. (273) Second,the United States had never widely accepted the doctrine of government ownership of key industries,thus it had less apparent need to move toward many of the tenets of the New Public Management. And finally, the United States generally followed a constitutional practice of keeping separate anddistinct the government and private sectors. Each had developed its own legal precedents andpractices, with government being required to meet higher standards of behavior toward citizens thanelements of the private sector.

Inthe entrepreneurial management paradigm, the agency manager is central. Congress is viewed asbeing engaged in micro-management. (280) The central management agencies, such as OMB, are tied tothe administrative management paradigm and therefore ought to be downgraded. And the executivebranch is in need of disaggregation. With respect to the latter, agencies should be given widelatitude over their personnel, compensation, acquisition, and contract policies, as well as theapplicability of regulations.", "The administrative philosophy of the NPR set out to \"melt the rigid boundaries betweenorganizations. The federal government should organize its work according to customers' needs andanticipated outcomes, not bureaucratic turf.\" (281) The Report argued to change the public law basis of anagency's mission and replace it with an \"outcomes\" mission orientation as defined by the agency'smanagement.

Think-tanks, both conservative and liberal,actively promoted the legislation in Congress, with a vigorous assist from GAO. Unlike previousbudgetary/management process exercises, such as the program performance budgeting system(PPBS) and zero-based budgeting (ZBB), GPRA had a statutory basis and mandate making it moredifficult for agencies to ignore altogether.

From the turn of the century to the mid-1970s, comprehensive commissions were viewed asinstruments to promote executive branch political accountability to the President, and through thePresident to Congress. The proposal for a Bureau of the Budget, for instance, was strongly favoredby Congress as a means to hold the President responsible for agency budget submissions and forsubsequent agency oversight. To be sure, the Budget Bureau strengthened the institutionalpresidency, but this strengthening was not part of a zero sum game where one institution's gain mustnecessarily be at the expense of another institution. Rather, the centralizing element inherent in theestablishment of the Budget Bureau worked to the benefit of both the President and the Congress intheir relations with the departments and agencies of the executive branch.", "Beginning in the 1970s, and reaching its peak at the end of the century, a differentmotivating force for reorganization emerged. The entrepreneurial values of the NationalPerformance Review (NPR), for instance, were arguably not congenial to central management of theexecutive branch, or to the political accountability associated with central management. Indeed,managerial autonomy at the agency level became one of the highest values of the NPR. Politicalaccountability, in the NPR view, was to be largely supplanted by management processes intendedto provide better results and performance, however those terms might be defined and measured.", "There was nothing modest in the claims of the NPR. The rhetoric tended to be hortatory andthe evidence cited anecdotal. Entrepreneurs prefer to avoid theory and rely instead on \"successstories\" to teach government managers how to perform better. Congress rarely appears in theirwritings or motivational seminars, and their attitude is more likely to be one of confrontation thanconciliation. Vice President Gore's reinventing government exercise measured its success in\"vanquishing big government\" at least in part by the number of civil service positions it eliminated. By and large, the entrepreneurs abjure theory with its requirements of precision, predictability,replicability, and acceptance of disproof, (300) preferring instead the enlightenment of success indicators, suchas customer polling (\"We will ... measure our success by customer satisfaction\").

Or, would acommission naturally gravitate back toward the earlier values of, say, the Hoover Commissions? Can a new set of organizational doctrines be developed to accommodate the traditionalconstitutionalist values with the entrepreneurial values? Or, is there a \"new\" new publicmanagement waiting somewhere to be discovered? (302) Even if some agreement on organizational theory can bereached, at a more practical level has the executive branch simply become too complex for a singlecommission to study and make appropriate recommendations? What about the burgeoningquasi-government; should it be included within the purview of any future landmarkcommission? (303) Finally, should the President and his central management agencies seek to reassert their prior roleover matters of organizational management? (304) ", "Doubts regarding the utility of landmark-type commissions notwithstanding, they retain muchof their appeal to lawmakers. It is a rare Congress indeed in which there is not some effort toestablish a \"new Hoover Commission.\" As mentioned previously, such a bill ( S. 2306 )was introduced in the 106th Congress by Senator Fred Thompson, then-chairman of the SenateGovernmental Affairs Committee. The charge to the nine-member commission was to makestructural recommendations respecting the entire executive branch and incorporate them in a singlebill. This bill would then have to be considered by Congress and voted up or down followingexpedited procedures. Among its supporters was Paul Light of the Brookings Institution whoannounced at a hearings in 2000:", "I believe, too, that there has been a lack ofattention to structural reform.... I think you should pass S. 2306 . I think you shouldattach it to every bill leaving this Committee and every bill leaving the Senate. I have referred to theFederal organization chart as rather like the mouth of the Ulonga-Bora River where the AfricanQueen and Humphrey Bogart got bogged down. I think that S. 2306 could be thatgentle rain that lifts the Federal Government out of the mouth of that swamp and gets it back ontrack. I think it is time for a very detailed look at the structure of the Federal Government, and thathas to be done through legislation. I don't see anyway you can do it otherwise. (305)", "In the late 1980s, Congress passed a law (which President Reagan signed) one provision ofwhich authorized the establishment of such a commission. The public law elevating the VeteransAdministration to departmental status provided for the establishment of a National Commission onExecutive Organization patterned in general outline after the first Hoover Commission of the late1940s (102 Stat. 2635, Sec. 17). This new Commission, however, could be activated only bypresidential initiative. If the President, in this case the newly inaugurated George H.W. Bush,transmitted written notification to Congress within 30 days after the operational date for the VeteransDepartment (March 15, 1989) that such a Commission would serve \"the national interest,\" then, andonly then, would the Commission be activated. President Bush, although he was on the receivingend of some congressional lobbying for the Commission, let the final date, April 15, 1989, passwithout a message to Congress requesting the Commission. (306) ", "If, obstacles notwithstanding, a new landmark-style commission were established to reviewcomprehensively the structure of the executive branch, what sort of situation would this commissionface with respect to the political and institutional presidency and the Congress? Are there unitswithin each of these branches that currently handle organizational management issues that might feelthreatened and offer resistance? Or, have both institutions retreated from their organizationalmanagement responsibilities?", "Looking to the presidency first, it is clear that recent Presidents have been ambivalenttowards management generally, and organizational management in particular. Whereas once,through the mid-1970s, there was a consensus that the President was the \"chief manager\" of theexecutive branch and should have institutional capacity to perform these responsibilities, no suchconsensus exists today. Recent Presidents, beginning with John F. Kennedy, have been warned byscholars and aides to avoid management issues. Stephen Hess, writing in 1976, and read byPresident-elect Jimmy Carter, argued that the President ought to limit himself to political leadership. \"Presidents have made a serious mistake, starting with Roosevelt, in asserting that they are chiefmanagers of the federal government.... Rather than chief manager the President is the chief politicalofficer of the United States.\" (307) This argument was repeated in various forms for theremainder of the century. These scholarly warnings reinforced the inclination of contemporaryPresidents to shy away from management responsibilities. One consequence of this retreat was anerosion in the will and capacity of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to performmanagement functions. In a bit of historical irony, the erosion of OMB's capacity to manage becamepronounced shortly after the implementation of the Reorganization Plan of 1970 that, among otherthings, changed the name of the Bureau of the Budget to that of the Office of Management andBudget. (308) ", "While employee statistics may not tell the whole story, they provide evidence of the declinein OMB's management capacity, and therefore the institutional presidency's decline as well. In 1970,224 employees were on the management side of OMB. By 1980, when Carter left office, the numberhad fallen to 111. The Reagan Administration further reduced this staff to only 47 (compared to8,500 at the staff level of agency Inspectors General). (309) Rather than rebuild the OMB management capacity, asrecommended by NAPA and others, the Clinton Administration decided (\"OMB 2000 Review\") tointegrate most of the remaining staff of the General Management Division into five ResourceManagement Offices (RMOs) structured along budgetary functional lines. (310) In early 2002, thereremained only a skeletal staff of 12 with the position of Deputy Director for Management continuingits pattern of vacancies and short tenures. (311) ", "What does this admitted retreat from management by the President and OMB have to do withfuture proposals for a landmark-style commission? The fact is that the proper design andimplementation of structural management proposals rests with a central management agency thatfunctions from a presidential perspective. Reorganizations that are designed and implemented bythe agencies themselves tend to meet parochial needs that may or may not be in concert with thePresident's interests.", "With respect to Congress, it had been the intention of the Hoover Commission in 1949 tohave most future executive reorganization be the result of ongoing interchange between thethen-Bureau of the Budget and a single committee in both houses of Congress. The House andSenate each established Government Operations Committees, committees that continue to functiontoday with different titles and an altered sense of mission. All presidentially initiated reorganizationplans were to be sent to these committees rather than to the subject field committees to insure thatmanagerial issues were addressed according to executive branch-wide standards. Joint hearings andreferrals yes, but the final response rested with the general management committees. With the endof the reorganization plan process in 1984, reorganization proposals now typically are referred to thesubject field committees none of which have a government-wide perspective. The result isincreasing disaggregation in the organization and management of the executive branch.", "The institutional weakness in the executive and legislative branches with respect to structuralquestions has implications that could well influence the prospects of success any new landmarkcommission might enjoy. A commission cannot successfully function and see its recommendationsimplemented if it does not have institutional support readily available. It cannot work in anenvironment isolated from the ongoing government. A successful landmark commission seeminglyrequires as a necessary, but not sufficient, precondition the proper working of a central managementagency in the Executive Office and jurisdictional support of general management committees in theHouse and Senate.", "Several generalizations may be useful in concluding this review and analysis of landmarkcommissions and their utility for the future.", "1.A focused and limited mandate for a commission (e.g., the need for a separate Officeof Management and Budget) is more likely to provide useful results than acommission with a broad, unstructured mandate with substantial policy implications.", "2.A commission should have ties with central managerial agencies in the executivebranch and with committees with general management responsibilities in Congress. Others besides the commission must have a stake in the success of the exercise.", "3.Commissions should be cognizant of the distinctive legal character of governmentalorganization and activities. Included in any commission review should be a review,with recommendations, of the general management laws pertinent to the mandate ofthe commission.", "4.There should be some consensus in advance among commission members regardingthe organizational principles to be applied in their review and recommendations. Commissions do not tend to be effective vehicles for generating consensus if nonepreviously existed.", "Acceptance of these general propositions for an effective landmark-style commission doesnot guarantee success, but it may be difficult to envision success if they are willfully ignored."], "subsections": []}]}}
