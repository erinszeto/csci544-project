Given that the S&T Directorate is not the only R&D operation within DHS, questions remain about what principles determine the types of R&D it should do, and when another organization should take on a particular R&D topic.", "The scope of research undertaken by the S&T Directorate through its component entities also has been questioned. When DHS was established, Congress also created within the S&T Directorate the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), which was to administer a newly established Acceleration Fund for Research and Development of Homeland Security Technologies. The scope of this agency has evolved since it was created. Initially, it was unclear how the S&T Directorate would implement HSARPA; given the similarity of its name to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), some experts in the scientific community believed that, like DARPA, it would fund high-risk, high-reward R&D. Instead, the S&T Directorate used HSARPA to conduct essentially all of its extramural activities, most of which were conventional R&D with only moderate risk.", "As part of his reorganization of the S&T Directorate, Under Secretary Cohen redirected the work of HSARPA. The role of HSARPA is much reduced from past years, when it was responsible for nearly all of the directorate's extramural R&D. It is now focused on activities with high risk and high reward. Through its Homeland Innovative Prototypical Solutions (HIPS) and High Impact Technology Solutions (HITS) programs, HSARPA now performs research activities more in the DARPA model.", "The best way to use HSARPA may continue to be a topic of congressional interest. Advocates of the DARPA model point out that while its risks are high, and only a small fraction of funded programs achieve their goals, the benefits from the successes can be great. On the other hand, because most programs do not achieve their goals, many will likely need to be funded before a success is realized.

Countermeasures to biological agents have always constituted the largest single component in the directorate's R&D portfolio. The establishment of DNDO and its growing share of the department's R&D expenditures imply a decision to increase the priority of nuclear and radiological countermeasures. (This may affect the S&T Directorate, even though it is no longer involved in nuclear and radiological R&D, because such a decision implicitly reduces the relative priority of other R&D topics that remain in the directorate.) In part, this focus on unconventional, low-likelihood, high-consequence threats may reflect the programs transferred to the directorate at its inception, which were heavily focused on biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. The rapid increase in budget emphasis on radiological and nuclear threats starting in FY2006 appears to be a strategic choice, however.

The rapid growth of DNDO, both in absolute terms and relative to the S&T Directorate, arguably represents a shift of R&D authority away from the Under Secretary. If S&T Directorate budgets decline or remain constant while DNDO budgets increase, the DHS R&D budget may become increasingly weighted towards DNDO efforts.

The S&T Directorate's strategic plan notes that within the directorate, the Interagency Programs Division facilitates government-wide coordination, and the Office of National Laboratories coordinates with DOE regarding the national laboratories. The R&D plan accompanying the strategic plan does not explicitly identify areas of overlap or synergy with other federal agencies.", "One prominent program for which interagency coordination has been an issue is Project BioShield. Under this program, the Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible for assessing whether a particular biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent poses a \"material threat\" to national security. In practice, the analysis that underpins this assessment is performed by the S&T Directorate. (The Office of Health Affairs also participates.) Once the Secretary makes a material threat determination, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may procure countermeasures for that agent using a 10-year block of funds that were appropriated to DHS in FY2004. Congress and other stakeholders have criticized DHS for making material threat determinations too slowly and thereby slowing the pace of countermeasure procurement by HHS. Management and oversight of the program are complicated by discrepancies between DHS and HHS about the amount of funds that remain available. For more details, see CRS Report RL33907, Project BioShield: Appropriations, Acquisitions, and Policy Implementation Issues for Congress ."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Metrics and Goals for Directorate Output", "paragraphs": ["When the S&T Directorate was established, its optimal investment strategy was unclear. The range of threats and vulnerabilities was broad, and the directorate initially placed a premium on identifying technologies in an advanced stage of development, transitioning them into deployable equipment, and providing this equipment to end users. One DHS official believed, \"there's a lot of low-hanging fruit out there, capability that already exists, either commercially or in laboratory prototypes.\"", "As the directorate matures and its R&D results are implemented and deployed, this focus on \"low-hanging fruit\" may need to evolve into a more diverse strategy that also includes more fundamental research and riskier investments. Fundamental or basic research is often identified as a key source of future technologies, and research with innately higher risk, but also higher reward, may have more potential for significant breakthroughs. Some experts advocate more S&T Directorate investment in these types of research:", "Failure to invest in longer-term research limits the prospects for future breakthroughs that could dramatically improve DHS's ability to fulfill its mission. As the S&T Directorate matures, so must its S&T portfolio\u2014which means investing in a portfolio of both near-term and long-term research. I understand that the S&T Directorate's leadership now shares this view. I particularly welcome [the Under Secretary for Science and Technology's] plans to fund some high-risk but potentially very high payoff projects. A serious pathology that can overtake a technology development program is to become failure intolerant, forcing it to settle on safe bets that are less ambitious than its mission requires. Admiral Cohen will need your support if he hopes to avoid this\u2014you will have to make sure he fails often enough, and to hold him accountable if he doesn't.", "A key component of such a strategy is assessing the progress of funded research projects. Without effective assessment, it may be difficult to sustain investment in long-term research activities that appear to be progressing slowly, or conversely, it may be difficult to terminate projects that appear productive but are not leading toward an appropriate goal. Depending on the stage and purpose of the research activity, criteria for success (and thus for continued investment by the directorate) may vary. Substantial investments in planning may be needed to establish appropriate criteria and assess programs effectively.", "The difficulty of establishing quantitative goals and metrics for R&D effectiveness is a well known challenge for the evaluation of R&D programs. The impact of longer-range research may not be evident for years after its completion. Even if success can be measured, success rates may vary widely between programs deemed as effective, depending on the character of the R&D undertaken. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funds high-risk, high-reward R&D. The likelihood of success for any individual DARPA activity is low, but that is expected. The success of the program overall is judged by the impact of the activities that are successful. In contrast, an R&D program engaged mainly in incremental end-stage development, where there is lower risk of failure, might be expected to have a higher project success rate but less impact for each particular result.", "The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA, P.L. 103 - 62 ) attempted to address metrics and goals for federal agencies, creating greater efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in federal spending, and requiring agencies to set goals and to use performance measures for management and, ultimately, for budgeting. Although the outcome of GPRA has been a foundation of performance-based planning for federal agencies, evaluation of strategic planning continues to be a weakness.", "The Bush Administration also set a priority on performance measures as part of the budgetary process, establishing the program assessment rating tool (PART) as part of the performance assessment methodology used under the President's Management Agenda. Some of the S&T Directorate's research portfolios have undergone PART assessments, with a range of results. Some programs, such as the biological countermeasures program, were assessed as effective, while others, such as the chemical and explosive countermeasures program, were not. The PART assessment process highlights the series of factors that complicates assessment of the S&T Directorate programs. Existing programs transferred in whole or in part into the S&T Directorate may have lacked an initial homeland security focus, blunting their efficacy. New programs developed by the S&T Directorate with the necessary homeland security focus lack a history of operation and management, challenging the smooth and efficient implementation of the programs' stated goals.", "Measuring outcomes from programs with long time scales, where results are not expected to be seen for several years, may pose a challenge to the PART technique. As stated by the White House Office of Management and Budget, \"the Administration is aware that predicting and assessing the outcomes of basic research in particular is never easy.\" At a minimum, the PART documentation for S&T Directorate programs aims to provide clearer information about program goals and performance, R&D management, and effective practices. To the extent that this is successful, this information helps to inform outside analysts of the directorate's plans.", "Some observers had hoped that the directorate's strategic planning process would identify quantitative metrics and goals. This was not the case, however. The program work statements in the 2007 R&D plan mostly describe qualitative increases, improvements, and developments, rather than quantitative criteria.", "Another, similar approach would be to use the Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Committee or an outside body, such as the National Academy of Sciences, to independently validate the directorate's strategic planning documents, with goals and metrics for the short, medium, and long terms. Statute has mandated comparable requirements in other S&T fields. While the S&T Directorate uses committees of the National Academies for advice on an ad hoc basis, it has not engaged the National Academies or any other organization to perform a rigorous, end-to-end assessment of the directorate's research activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responsiveness to Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["The S&T Directorate's responsiveness to stakeholders has been a recurring issue since the department's creation.

The S&T Directorate has taken several steps to improve its interactions with industry, including increasing its accessibility through the Internet, expanding stakeholder conference opportunities, and creating the position of a Chief Commercialization Officer. The directorate makes its Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) available on a website and via an e-mail mailing list, and it announces R&D solicitations targeted at small businesses on another website. All funding opportunities are also listed on the government-wide website FedBizOpps. The preferred mechanism for submission of unsolicited proposals is through the Office of Procurement Operations. Such submissions are sent to the Headquarters Office of Procurement Operations rather than directly to the S&T Directorate. The S&T Directorate itself maintains an email address for submissions of concepts and ideas. In May 2007, the directorate held a stakeholder conference for which Under Secretary Cohen at that time described the message as \"we are open for business, and we know how to do business.\" Announcements of subsequent stakeholder conferences have listed goals such as \"describ[ing] the business opportunities for private sector organizations and universities, ... demonstrating business partnership opportunities in S&T research, ... [and] explaining how to do business with the DHS S&T research enterprise.\" The directorate has held annual stakeholder meetings, one on each coast. These stakeholder meetings have been a mechanism to provide industry and other stakeholders with access to S&T Directorate personnel and provide fora for collaboration.", "In January 2009, the directorate released a \"DHS S&T Long Range Broad Agency Announcement.\" This BAA was partly a response to concerns that entrepreneurs and researchers might be unable to bring their ideas to the directorate if there is no open request for proposals or BAA. The long-range BAA is open through December 31, 2009, and provides a vehicle for submission of a broad range of homeland security R&D ideas and proposals. It states, \"Readers shall note that this is an announcement to declare S&T's broad role in competitive funding of meritorious research across a spectrum of science and engineering disciplines.\"", "Former Under Secretary Cohen has also identified continued outreach efforts on the part of the directorate and the components of the directorate as efforts to encourage greater industry participation. The directorate has held or partnered with other groups to hold conferences in the United States and the United Kingdom to engage stakeholders and provide attendees with access and contact. Emphasizing the importance of maintaining good contacts with industry and others, Former Under Secretary Cohen testified in 2008, \"As I have often said, no one knows where good ideas may come from and for that reason I have been personally proactive in both seeking out and receiving technology briefs and opportunities from all sources. This is a culture I am working to instill throughout the DHS S&T Directorate.\"", "The S&T Directorate established a Commercialization Office headed by a Chief Commercialization Officer. This office is responsible for developing and managing the S&T Directorate's outreach efforts with the private sector. Beyond these outreach efforts, the Commercialization Office also is engaged in developing detailed operational requirements documents that reflect the Departmental needs that might be met by private sector developmental activities. By combining these needs with estimates of the potential available market for a given product, the Commercialization Office attempts to induce the private sector to invest its own funds into developing solutions to departmental needs without the investment of federal R&D funds.", "The results of these efforts have reportedly been positively received by industry.

Research areas known as portfolios were established in the Office of Programs, Planning, and Budget (PPB, subsequently the Office of Programs, Planning, and Requirements). The directorate's budgeting aligned with these portfolio topics. Actual management of R&D projects, however, was the responsibility of three other offices, depending on the nature of the work. Intramural R&D was managed by the Office of Research and Development (ORD), extramural R&D by the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), and systems engineering and prototype transition by the Office of Systems Engineering and Development (SED). The heads of PPB, ORD, HSARPA, and SED each reported directly to the Under Secretary. Only the congressionally authorized HSARPA survives in the current structure, and its scope is greatly reduced.", "This particular matrix structure had some potential advantages. The manager of each portfolio could allocate funds flexibly either within the government or outside it. Portfolio managers could facilitate information flow in their research topic between federal researchers and the private sector. Meanwhile, because ORD, HSARPA, and SED each managed parts of multiple portfolios, they could identify and act upon synergies between research areas.", "On the other hand, this matrix structure created management challenges and complicated reporting and oversight. The manager of any given R&D project reported to the head of either ORD, HSARPA, or SED but was funded by a portfolio manager in PPB. Conversely, the manager of a portfolio in PPB had only indirect authority over the project managers who executed the R&D he or she was funding. Management reporting chains and lines of budget responsibility met only in the office of the Under Secretary.
