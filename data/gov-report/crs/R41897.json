However, after increasing to 19.2% of total employment in 1975, the percentage of all jobs that are in the public sector fell to 15.7% in 1999. In 2013, public sector jobs accounted for 16.0% of total employment.", "The recession that officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 affected employment in both the private and public sectors. From 2007 to 2010, the number of jobs in the private sector fell by an estimated 7.9 million, while the number of jobs in the public sector increased by almost 272,000.

By 2013, the situation had reversed; a slight majority of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement were employed in the private sector (8.1 million private sector workers, compared to 7.9 million public sector workers).

Reflecting the aging of the U.S. labor force, workers in both the private and public sectors have become older. Nevertheless, employees in the public sector are older than private sector workers. In 2013, 51.7% of public sector workers were between the ages of 45 and 64, compared to 42.4% of full-time private sector workers. Federal workers are older than employees of state and local governments. In 2013, 56.7% of federal workers were between the ages of 45 and 64, compared to 49.7% of state employees and 52.1% of employees of local governments. Workers who have more years of work experience generally earn more than workers with less experience. Gender. Reflecting the increased participation of women in the labor force, the share of jobs held by women has increased in both the private and public sectors. In 2013, women held almost three-fifths (57.7%) of full-time jobs in state and local governments. By contrast, women held approximately two-fifths of full-time jobs in the federal government and in the private sector (42.2% and 41.7%, respectively). Education. On average, public sector employees have more years of education than private sector workers. In 2013, 53.6% of workers in the public sector had a bachelor's, advanced, or professional degree, compared to 34.9% of private sector workers. Generally, workers with more years of education earn more than workers with less years of education. Occupation. A larger share of public sector than private sector workers are employed in \"management, professional, and related occupations.\" In 2013, 56.2% of public sector workers and 37.8% of private sector workers were employed in these occupations. In part, more public sector workers were employed in these occupations because 25.7% of all public sector workers were employed in \"education, training, and library\" occupations, compared to 2.3% of all private sector workers. Workers in management and professional occupations generally earn more than workers in other occupations. However, comparisons of the compensation of private and public sector workers that use broad occupational categories may miss differences between detailed occupations. Many detailed occupations are concentrated in either the private or public sectors. Nevertheless, many detailed occupations may require similar skills. Union coverage. Although the number of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement is greater in the private sector than in the public sector, the percentage of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement is greater in the public sector than in the private sector.

Of the 2,941,000 \"managers, all other\" employed in the private sector, 1.8% were covered by a collective bargaining agreement, while 19.1% of public sector workers in this occupation were represented by a union. ", "Considering those occupations where less than 90% were employed in either the private or public sectors, occupations that were common to both the private and public sectors include managers; elementary and middle school teachers; registered nurses; secretaries and administrative assistants; accountants and auditors; janitors and building cleaners; managers of office and administrative support workers; and general and operations managers. ", "A disproportionate share of workers in some occupations common to both the private and public sectors were employed in only one sector. For example, for 21 of the 56 occupations in Table A-2 , at least 90.0% of workers were employed in the private sector. These occupations include cashiers; laborers and material movers; stock clerks and order fillers; drivers; customer service representatives; chief executives; maids and housekeeping cleaners; financial managers; automotive service technicians and mechanics; software developers; management analysts; cooks; receptionists and information clerks; electricians; and pipelayers, plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters.", "On the other hand, large shares of workers employed in occupations common to both the private and public sector were employed in the public sector. These occupations include elementary and middle school teachers; postsecondary teachers; education administrators; social workers; counselors; and preschool and kindergarten teachers.", "Table A-3 shows the 44 occupations, among the top 100 occupations in the private sector, that were not present among the top 100 occupations in the public sector. These occupations are listed in descending order by the number of workers employed in the private sector. Of the workers employed in these 44 occupations, 97.6% worked in the private sector. These occupations were mainly in sales, food preparation and serving, construction, production, automotive service, real estate, farming, and the clergy. ", "Table A-4 shows the 44 occupations, among the top 100 occupations in the public sector, that were not present among the top 100 private sector occupations. The occupations are listed in descending order by the number employed in the public sector. Of the workers employed in these 44 occupations, 62.2% worked in the public sector. These occupations were mainly in public safety (e.g., bailiffs, correctional officers, and jailers; police officers; fire fighters; probation officers and correctional treatment specialists; and detectives and criminal investigators); the Postal Service; education (e.g., special education, secondary school teachers, librarians, and teaching assistants) highway maintenance; eligibility interviewers for government programs; and legal occupations (e.g., court, municipal, and license clerks and legal support occupations).", "Data and Methodology", "This report analyzes data from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey and the Current Population Survey (CPS).", "The CES is an employer survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The CES survey counts the number of persons on employer payrolls for any part of the pay period that includes the 12 th day of the month. Persons who are on the payroll of more than one establishment are counted in each establishment. Government employment includes civilian employees only; persons in the military are not included. Also excluded are employees of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency.", "The CPS is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for BLS. The monthly CPS is the source of the national unemployment rate and other labor market information. The survey is representative of the civilian noninstitutional population. The sample does not include persons living in institutions (such as psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, or correctional facilities). The monthly survey does not include individuals who are on active duty in the military. Approximately 55,500 households are interviewed each month. The data for occupations and union coverage ( Table 1 in the text and the tables in the Appendix ) are from the monthly CPS. Union coverage is for a worker's occupation at the time of the monthly CPS.", "Each year, the CPS conducts the Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) supplement to the monthly CPS. The sample for the ASEC supplement is representative of the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. The sample for the supplement includes members of the Armed Forces living in civilian housing units on a military base or in a household not on a military base, provided that at least one civilian adult lives in the same household. The supplement does not ask active members of the Armed Forces the monthly CPS labor force questions. The supplement does not include persons living in military barracks. For the 2013 supplement, 75,500 households were interviewed.", "In this report, data on the characteristics of private and public sector workers are from the ASEC supplement. Data for employment by level of government are for are a person's current job. ", "The data that are available to public users of the CPS may not be the same as the data available to BLS. In order to protect the confidentiality of persons in the survey, the Census Bureau modifies (or \"masks\") the age variable in the data available to public users. As a result, some estimates produced by public users of the CPS may not match estimates published by BLS.", "Changes in the Reporting of Educational Attainment in the Current Population Survey (CPS)", "In 1992, the CPS changed the way educational attainment is recorded. Table A-5 shows the values for educational attainment for the years 1975 to 1991 and the values for 1992 to 2013. For 1976 to 1991, the CPS recorded the number of years of school that a person attended. Another variable recorded whether the person finished that year of school. Since 1992, the CPS has reported whether a person graduated from high school or college.", "Because of the change in the way the CPS records educational attainment, estimates of the number of high school and college graduates for the years 1992 to 2013 are not comparable to estimates for earlier years. For the earlier period, persons who completed 12 years of high school may or may not have graduated from high school. Similarly, persons who finished 16 or more years of education may or may not have received a bachelor's, advanced, or professional degree. Because of the change in coding for educational attainment, changes in educational attainment discussed in this report are the sum of changes over two periods: the period to 1991 and the period since 1992.
