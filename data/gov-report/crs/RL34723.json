Use of these data can assist Congress in itsoversight role of assessing whether the current nature of the international weapons trade affects U.S.national interests. For most of recent American history, maintaining regional stability, and ensuringthe security of U.S. allies and friendly nations throughout the world, have been important elementsof U.S. foreign policy. Knowing the degree to which individual arms suppliers are making armstransfers to individual nations or regions provides Congress with a context for evaluating policyquestions it may confront. Such policy questions may include, for example, whether or not tosupport specific U.S. arms sales to given countries or regions or to support or oppose such armstransfers by other nations. The data in this report may also assist Congress in evaluating whethermultilateral arms control arrangements or other U.S. foreign policy initiatives are being supportedor undermined by the actions of arms suppliers.", "The principal focus of this report is the level of arms transfers by major weapons suppliersto nations in the developing world -- where most of the potential for the outbreak of regional militaryconflicts currently exists. For decades, during the height of the Cold War, providing conventionalweapons to friendly states was an instrument of foreign policy utilized by the United States and itsallies. This was equally true for the Soviet Union and its allies. The underlying rationale for U.S.arms transfer policy then was to help ensure that friendly states were not placed at risk through amilitary disadvantage created by arms transfers by the Soviet Union or its allies. Following the ColdWar's end, U.S. arms transfer policy has been based on assisting friendly and allied nations indeveloping and maintaining their ability to deal with regional security threats and concerns.", "The data in this report illustrate how global patterns of conventional arms transfers havechanged in the post-Cold War and post-Persian Gulf War years. Relationships between armssuppliers and recipients continue to evolve in response to changing political, military, and economiccircumstances. Where before the principal motivation for arms sales by foreign suppliers might havebeen to support a foreign policy objective, today that motivation may be based as much on economicconsiderations as those of foreign or national security policy.", "The developing world continues to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity byconventional weapons suppliers.

This is a decrease inthe total value of arms deliveries from the previous year (a decline from $33.6 billion).

Global arms agreement values for the other years covered hereranged from $48.7 billion in 2005 to $32.6 billion in 2003. Of the major arms orders secured in2007 most were made by the traditional major suppliers. In some instances these orders representedsignificant new acquisitions by the purchasing country. In others they reflected the continuation oracceleration of a longer-term weapons-acquisition program.", "The increase in new weapons sales can also be explained, in part, by the decision of somepurchasing nations to acquire major systems they had deferred buying due to budgetaryconsiderations. Some nations were completing the integration of major weapons systems they havealready purchased into their force structures. Some of the growth in arms transfer agreements morerecently also reflects contracts related to training and support services, as well as upgrades ofexisting weapons systems. Individual orders such as these can be expensive, and in given instancesprove to be nearly as costly as orders for new units of military equipment.", "Because the international arms market continues to be intensely competitive, severalproducing countries have focused sales efforts on prospective clients in nations and regions whereindividual suppliers have had competitive advantages resulting from well-establishedmilitary-support relationships. Arms sales to new NATO member nations in Europe to support theirmilitary modernization programs have created new business for arms suppliers, while allowing theseNATO states to sell some of their older generation military equipment, in refurbished form, to otherless-developed countries.", "There are inherent limitations on these European sales due to the smaller defense budgets ofmany of the purchasing countries. Yet creative seller financing options, as well as the use ofco-assembly, co-production, and counter-trade agreements to offset costs to the buyers continue tofacilitate new arms agreements. It seems likely that the United States and European countries orconsortia will compete vigorously for prospective arms contracts within the European region in theforeseeable future. Such sales seem particularly important to European suppliers, as they canpotentially compensate, in part, for lost weapons deals elsewhere in the developing world that resultfrom reduced demand for new weapons.", "Developed nations continue their efforts to protect important elements of their nationalmilitary industrial bases by limiting arms purchases from other developed nations. However, severalkey arms suppliers have placed additional emphasis on joint production of various weapons systemswith other developed nations as a more effective way to preserve a domestic weapons productioncapability, while sharing the costs of new weapons development. The consolidation of certainsectors of the domestic defense industries of key weapons-producing nations continues, in the faceof intense foreign competition. Some supplying nations, meanwhile, have chosen to manufactureitems for niche weapons categories where their specialized production capabilities give themimportant advantages in the international arms marketplace.", "Despite the recent upward trend in weapons purchases with the developed world, somedeveloping nations have limited their weapons purchases primarily due to their limited financialresources to pay for such equipment. Other prospective arms purchasers in the developing worldwith significant financial assets have been cautious in launching new and costlyweapons-procurement programs. Increases in the price of oil, while an advantage for major oilproducing states in funding their arms purchases, has, simultaneously, caused economic difficultiesfor many oil consuming states, contributing to their decisions to curtail or defer new weaponsacquisitions. A number of less affluent developing nations have chosen to upgrade existing weaponssystems in their inventories, while reducing their purchases of new ones. This circumstance maycurtail sales of some new weapons systems. Yet the weapons upgrade market can be very lucrativefor some arms producers, and partially mitigate the effect of fewer opportunities for the sale ofmajor items of military equipment.", "Most recently, the nations in the Near East and Asia regions have resumed large weaponspurchases in contrast with arms sales activity in the earliest years of this report. These major orderscontinue to be made by a select few developing nations in these regions. They have been madeprincipally by India and China in Asia, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the NearEast. These purchasing tendencies are subject to abrupt change based on the strength of either thethreat assessments of individual states or the strength of their individual economies. For the largergroup of nations in these regions the strength of the economies of a wide range of nations in thedeveloping world continues to be the most significant factor in the timing of many of their armspurchasing decisions.", "Latin America, and, to a much lesser extent, Africa, are regions where some nations wish tomodernize important sectors of their military forces. Some large arms orders (by regional standards)have been placed by a few states in these two regions within the last decade. Yet in Latin Americaand Africa, many countries are constrained in their weapons purchases by their financial resources. So long as there is limited availability of seller-supplied credit and financing for weapons purchases,and national budgets for military purchases remain relatively low, it seems likely that major armssales to these two regions of the developing world will be limited to a small number of nations there."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "General Trends in Arms Transfers to Developing Nations", "paragraphs": ["The value of all arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2007 was nearly $42.3billion, an increase from the $38.1 billion total in 2006 Chart 1 )( Figure 1 )( Table 1A ).

France made nearly $5 billion in agreements or 5.2% ( Table1A ).", "From 2000-2007, most arms transfers to developing nations were made by two majorsuppliers in any given year. The United States ranked first among these suppliers for five of the lasteight years during this period, falling to third place in 2005. Russia has been a strong competitor forthe lead in arms transfer agreements with developing nations, ranking second every year from 2000through 2003, and first from 2004-2006. Although Russia has lacked the larger traditional clientbase for armaments held by the United States and the major West European suppliers, its recentsuccesses in concluding new arms orders suggests that Russia is likely to continue to be, for sometime, a significant leader in arms agreements with developing nations. Russia's most significant highvalue arms transfer agreements continue to be with India and China. Russia has also had somesuccess in concluding arms agreements with clients beyond its principal two. Russia continues toseek to expand its prospects in North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.", "Most recently Russia has increased sales efforts in Latin America, despite having essentiallyabandoned major arms sales efforts there after the end of the Cold War. Venezuela has become asignificant new arms client gained by Russia in this region. The Russian government has adoptedmore flexible payment arrangements for its prospective customers in the developing world, includinga willingness in specific cases to forgive outstanding debts owed to it by a prospective client in orderto secure new arms purchases. Additionally, Russia continues to seek to enhance the quality of itsfollow-on support services to make Russian products more attractive and competitive, and to assureits potential clients that it can effectively provide timely service and spare parts for the weaponssystems it exports.", "Major West European arms suppliers, particularly France and the United Kingdom, haveconcluded large orders with developing countries over the last eight years based on either long-termsupply relationships or their having specialized weapons systems readily available. Germany hasbeen a key source of naval systems for developing nations. Although it faces increased competitionfrom these other major arms suppliers, the United States appears likely to hold its position as theprincipal supplier to key developing world nations, especially those able to afford major newweapons. The United States has developed for decades such a wide base of arms equipment clientsglobally that it is able to conclude a notable number of agreements annually to provide upgrades,ordnance and support services for the large variety of weapons systems it has previously sold to itsclients. Thus, even when the United States does not conclude major new arms agreements in a givenyear, it can still register significant arms agreement values based on transactions in these othercategories.", "The principal arms-supplying nations continue to focus their sales efforts on the wealthierdeveloping countries. Arms transfers to the less affluent developing nations are still constrained bythe scarcity of funds in their defense budgets and the unsettled state of the international economy. The overall decline in the level of arms agreements with developing nations that began after 2001and continued through 2003 has halted. Arms transfer agreements with developing countries reachedtheir highest total value in 2007 at nearly $43.3 billion. From 2004 through 2007 there has been asteady increase in arms transfer agreements with developing countries, aid to an important degreeby sales to the more affluent nations in this group. Those developing nations with notably increasedoil revenues have been particularly active in seeking new weaponry most recently.", "China, as well as other European and non-European suppliers, appears to have increased theirparticipation in the arms trade with the developing world in recent years, albeit at lower levels, andwith more uneven results, than those of the major suppliers. Nevertheless, these non-major armssuppliers have proven capable, on occasion, of making arms deals of consequence. Most of theirannual arms transfer agreement values during 2000-2007 have been comparatively low, although thevalues are larger when they are aggregated together as a group. In individual cases they have beensuccessful in selling older generation equipment, while they procure newer weapons to upgrade theirown military forces. These arms suppliers also are more likely to be sources of small arms and lightweapons and associated ordnance, rather than routine sellers of major military equipment. Most ofthese arms suppliers have not consistently ranked with the traditional major suppliers of advancedweaponry in the value of their arms agreements and deliveries ( Tables 1A, 1F, 1G, 2A, 2F, and2G ). ", "United States. The total value -- in real terms --of United States arms transfer agreements with developing nations rose from $9.1 billion in 2006to $12.2 billion in 2007. The U.S. share of the value of all such agreements was 28.8% in 2007, upfrom a 24% share in 2006 ( Charts 1, 3 and 4 )( Figure 1 )( Tables 1A and 1B ).", "In 2007, the total value of U.S. arms transfer agreements with developing nations wasattributable to a few major deals with clients in the Near East and in Asia. A substantial number ofsmaller valued purchases by a wide number of traditional U.S. arms clients throughout the Near Eastand Asia contributed notably to the overall U.S. agreements total. The arms agreement total of theUnited States in 2007 illustrates the continuing U.S. advantage of having well-established defense-support arrangements with weapons purchasers worldwide, based upon the existing variety of U.S.weapons systems their militaries utilize. U.S. agreements with all of its clients in 2007 include notonly sales of major weapons systems, but also the upgrading of systems previously provided. TheU.S. totals also include agreements for a wide variety of spare parts, ammunition, ordnance, training,and support services which, in the aggregate, have significant value.", "Among the larger valued arms transfer agreements the United States concluded in 2007 withdeveloping nations were: with the United Arab Emirates for 26 UH-60M Black Hawk helicoptersfor over $800 million, and for 20 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) launchers androckets for $595 million. Other U.S. arms agreements in 2007 were with Egypt for co-productionof 125 M1A1 Abrams tanks for $771 million; with Saudi Arabia for 152 GE/Pratt&Whitney jetengines for $386 million, and for F-15 aircraft follow-on services for $319 million; with South Koreafor 58 AN/VRC-90E SINCGAR radio systems for $427 million and for 210 SM-2 STANDARDBlock III missiles for $210 million; with Colombia for 15 UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters for $217million; and with Jordan for a C4SIR system for $208 million.", "Russia. The total value of Russia's arms transferagreements with developing nations in 2007 was $9.7 billion, a decrease from $14.4 billion in 2006,placing Russia third in such agreements with the developing world. Russia's share of all developingworld arms transfer agreements increased, then fell from 37.9% in 2006 to 23% in 2007 ( Charts 1,3, and 4 )( Figure 1 )( Tables 1A, 1B, and 1G ).", "Russian arms transfer agreement totals with developing nations have been notable during thelast four years. During the 2004-2007 period, Russia ranked first among all suppliers to developingcountries, making $37.9 billion in agreements (in current 2007 dollars) ( Table 1F ). Russia's statusas a leading supplier of arms to developing nations stems from a successful effort to overcome thesignificant economic and political problems associated with the dissolution of the former SovietUnion. Traditional arms clients of the former Soviet Union were generally less wealthy developingcountries valued as much for their political support during the Cold War, as for their desire forSoviet weaponry. Several of these Soviet-era client states received substantial military aid grantsand significant discounts on their arms purchases. After 1991 Russia consistently placed a premiumon obtaining hard currency for the weapons it sold. Faced with stiff competition from Western armssuppliers in the post-Cold War period, Russia modified and adapted its selling practices in an effortto regain and sustain an important share of the developing-world arms market.", "In recent years, Russian leaders have made significant efforts to provide more creativefinancing and payment options for prospective arms clients. They have agreed to engage incounter-trade, offsets, debt-swapping, and, in key cases, to make significant licensed productionagreements in order to sell Russia's weapons. The willingness to license production has been acentral element in several cases involving Russia's principal arms clients, India and China. Russia'sefforts to expand its arms customer base have met with mixed results. Russia's arms sales efforts,apart from those with China and India, have been focused on Southeast Asia. Here Russia hassecured arms agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Most recently Russia hasconcluded major arms deals with Venezuela and with Algeria. Elsewhere in the developing worldRussian military equipment can be competitive because it ranges from the most basic to the highlyadvanced. For less affluent developing nations Russia's less expensive armaments are particularlyattractive.", "The sale of military aircraft and missiles continues to be a significant portion of Russia's armsexports. But the absence of major new research and development efforts in this and other militaryequipment areas can jeopardize long-term Russian foreign arms sales prospects. Although militaryweapons research and development (R&D) programs exist in Russia, other major arms suppliers arecurrently more advanced in the process of developing and producing weaponry than in existingRussian R&D programs.", "Despite these potential difficulties, Russia continues to have important arms developmentand sales programs involving India and China, which should provide it with sustained businessthroughout this decade. Through agreements concluded in the mid-1990s, Russia has sold majorcombat fighter aircraft, and main battle tanks to India, and has provided other major weaponssystems though lease or licensed production. It continues to provide support services and items forthese various weapons systems. Sales of advanced weaponry in South Asia by Russia have been amatter of ongoing concern to the United States because of long-standing tensions between India andPakistan. When India acquires a new weapon system this typically leads Pakistan to seek comparableweapons or those with offsetting capabilities. A key U.S. policy objective is keeping a potentiallydestabilizing arms race in this region within check. (1) ", "China has been Russia's other key arms client in Asia, especially for advanced aircraft andnaval systems. Since 1996, Russia has sold China Su-27 fighter aircraft and agreed to licensedproduction of them. It has sold the Chinese quantities of Su-30 multi-role fighter aircraft,Sovremenny-class destroyers equipped with Sunburn anti-ship missiles, and Kilo-class Project 636submarines. Russia has also sold the Chinese a variety of other weapons systems and missiles. In2005, Russia agreed to sell China 30 IL-76TD military transport aircraft and 8 IL-78M aerialrefueling tanker aircraft for more than $1 billion. Russia also signed new arms transfer agreementswith China for a number of AL-31F military aircraft engines for $1 billion, and agreed to sell jetengines for China's FC-1 fighter aircraft at a cost in excess of $250 million. Chinese armsacquisitions are apparently aimed at enhancing its military projection capabilities in Asia, and itsability to influence events throughout the region. These acquisitions continue to be monitored byU.S. policymakers. The U.S. policy interest is, among other things, ensuring that it providesappropriate military equipment to U.S. allies and friendly states in Asia to help offset any prospectivethreat China may pose to such nations, while keeping the U.S. military aware of any threat it mayface in any confrontation with China. (2) In 2007 there were no especially large Chinese arms agreementswith Russia, possibly because the Chinese military is focused on absorbing and integrating previousarms purchases from Russia into its force structure.", "Among the most significant arms transfer deals Russia made in 2007 were with India. Theseagreements included the sale of 347 T-90 main battle tanks, 40 Su-30MKI combat fighter aircraftand a number of MiG-29 fighter aircraft. Also concluded was an agreement for the production ofjet aircraft engines and one for long term defense production cooperation. An important portion ofRussia's $9.7 billion arms agreement total for 2007 was with India.", "In 2007, Russia also made new arms sales with Indonesia for three Su-27SKM and threeSu-30MK2 fighter aircraft for $355 million, and for Mi-17 and Mi35M helicopters for over $100million. Iran contracted with Russia for five batteries of the S-300PMU1 air defense system, andSyria purchased the Buk-M1-2 air defense system.", "China. The Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s providedChina with the opportunity to become an important supplier of less expensive weapons to certaindeveloping nations. During that conflict China demonstrated that it was willing to provide arms toboth combatants in the war, in quantity and without conditions. Since that time China's arms saleshave been more regional and targeted. From 2004-2007, the value of China's arms transferagreements with developing nations averaged about $2.3 billion annually. During the period of thisreport, the value of China's arms transfer agreements with developing nations were highest in 2007at $3.8 billion. A significant portion of that total can be attributed to a significant contract withPakistan associated with the production of the J-17 fighter aircraft. Generally, China's sales figuresreflect several smaller valued weapons deals in Asia, Africa, and the Near East, rather than one ortwo especially large agreements for major weapons systems ( Tables 1A, 1G, and 1H )( Chart 3 ).", "There have been few developing nations with significant financial resources that have soughtto purchase Chinese military equipment during the eight-year period of this report, because mostChinese weapons for export are less advanced and sophisticated than weaponry available fromWestern suppliers or Russia. China, consequently, does not appear likely to be a key supplier ofmajor conventional weapons in the international arms market for the foreseeable future. China'slikely client base could be states in Asia and Africa seeking quantities of small arms and lightweapons, rather than major combat systems. At the same time, China has been an important sourceof missiles in the developing world arms market. China supplied Silkworm anti-ship missiles toIran. Credible reports persist in various publications that China has sold surface-to-surface missilesto Pakistan, a long-standing and important client. Iran and North Korea have also reportedlyreceived Chinese missile technology, which may have increased their capabilities to threaten othercountries in their respective neighborhoods. The continued reporting of such activities by crediblesources raise important questions about China's stated commitment to the restrictions on missiletransfers set out in the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), including its pledge not toassist others in building missiles that could deliver nuclear weapons. Since China has some militaryproducts -- particularly missiles -- that some developing countries would like to acquire, it canpresent an obstacle to efforts to stem proliferation of advanced missile systems to some areas of thedeveloping world where political and military tensions are significant, and where some nations areseeking to develop asymmetric military capabilities. (3) ", "China, among others, has been a key source of a variety of small arms and light weaponstransferred to African states. Although the prospects for significant revenue earnings from thesearms sales are limited, China may view such sales as one means of enhancing its status as aninternational political power, and increasing its ability to obtain access to significant naturalresources, especially oil. Controlling the sales of small arms and light weapons to regions ofconflict, in particular to some African nations, has been a matter of concern to the United States. The United Nations also has undertaken an examination of this issue in an effort to achieveconsensus on a path to address it. (4) ", "Major West European Suppliers. Beyond theUnited States and Russia, the four major West European arms suppliers -- France, the UnitedKingdom, Germany, and Italy -- are the nations that can supply a wide variety of more highlysophisticated weapons to would-be purchasers. They can serve as alternative sources of armamentsthat the United States chooses not to supply for policy reasons. The United Kingdom sold majorcombat fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia in the mid-1980s, when the U.S. chose not to sell acomparable aircraft for policy reasons. These four NATO nations have been allies of the UnitedStates and generally have supported the U.S. position in restricting arms sales to certain nationsduring the Cold War era. In the post-Cold War era, their national defense export policies have notbeen fully coordinated with the United States as likely would have been the case at the Cold War'sheight.", "These leading European arms supplying states, particularly France, view arms sales foremostas a matter for national decision. France has also frequently used foreign military sales as animportant means for underwriting development and procurement of weapons systems for its ownmilitary forces. So the potential exists for policy differences between the United States and majorWest European supplying states over conventional weapons transfers to specific countries. Such aconflict resulted from an effort led by France and Germany to lift the arms embargo on arms salesto China currently adhered to by members of the European Union. The United States viewed thisas a misguided effort, and vigorously opposed it. The proposal to lift the embargo was ultimatelynot adopted, but it proved to be a source of significant tension between the U.S. and the EuropeanUnion. Thus, arms sales activities of major European suppliers continue to be of interest to U.S.policymakers, given their capability to make sales of advanced military equipment to countries ofconcern to U.S. national security policy. (5) ", "The four major West European suppliers (France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy),as a group, registered a significant increase in their collective share of all arms transfer agreementswith developing nations between 2006 and 2007. This group's share rose from 18.5% in 2006 to32.2% in 2007. The collective value of this group's arms transfer agreements with developingnations in 2007 was $13.6 billion compared with a total of $7.1 billion in 2006. Of these fournations, the United Kingdom was the leading supplier with $9.8 billion in agreements in 2007, adramatic increase from $4.1 billion in agreements in 2006. A substantial portion of the UnitedKingdom's $9.8 billion agreement total in 2007 is attributable to an order valued in excess of $9billion from Saudi Arabia for 72 Typhoon Eurofighter aircraft. Germany's $1.5 billion in armsagreements in 2007 resulted primarily from an agreement with South Korea for the purchase of anexisting Patriot PAC-2 air defense system for $1.2 billion ( Charts 3 and 4 )( Tables 1A and 1B ).", "Collectively, the four major West European suppliers held a 32.2% share of all arms transferagreements with developing nations during 2007. In the period from 2004-2007 they have generallybeen important participants in the developing world arms market. Individual suppliers within themajor West European group have had notable years for arms agreements, especially France in 2000and 2005 ($2.2 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively). The United Kingdom also had largeagreement years in 2004 ($4.5 billion), in 2006 ($4.1 billion), and $9.8 billion in 2007. Germanyconcluded arms agreements totaling nearly $2 billion in 2006, and $1.5 billion in 2007. In the caseof each of these three European nations, large agreement totals in one year have usually reflected theconclusion of very large arms contracts with one or more major purchasers in that particular year( Table 1A and 1B ).", "The Major West European suppliers have had their competitive position in weapons exportsstrengthened over the years through strong government marketing support for their foreign armssales. As they all can produce both advanced and basic air, ground, and naval weapons systems, thefour major West European suppliers have competed successfully for arms sales contracts withdeveloping nations against both the United States, which has tended to sell to several of the sameclients, and with Russia, which has sold to nations not traditional customers of either the WestEuropeans or the United States. But the demand for U.S. weapons in the global arms marketplace,from a large established client base, has created a more difficult environment for individual WestEuropean suppliers to secure, on a sustained basis, large new contracts with developing nations.", "Continuing strong demand for U.S. defense equipment as well as concern for maintainingtheir market share of the arms trade has led European Union (EU) member states to adopt a new codeof conduct for defense procurement practices. This code was agreed to on November 21, 2005, atthe European Defense Agency's (EA) steering board meeting. Currently voluntary, the EU hopesit will become mandatory, and through its mechanisms foster greater competition within theEuropean defense equipment sector in the awarding of contracts for defense items. The larger hopeis that by fostering greater intra-European cooperation and collaboration in defense contracting, andthe resulting programs, that the defense industrial bases of individual EU states will be preserved,and the ability of European defense firms to compete for arms sales in the international armsmarketplace will be substantially enhanced.", "A few European arms suppliers have begun to phase out production of certain types ofweapons systems. Such suppliers have increasingly engaged in joint production ventures with otherkey European weapons suppliers or even client countries in an effort to sustain major sectors of theirindividual defense industrial bases -- even if a substantial portion of the weapons produced are fortheir own armed forces. The Eurofighter project is one example; the Eurocopter is another. OtherEuropean suppliers have also adopted the strategy of cooperating in defense production ventures withthe United States such as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), rather than attempting to compete directly,thereby meeting their own requirements for advanced combat aircraft, while positioning themselvesto share in profits resulting from future sales of this new fighter aircraft.

Nations in the Latin America and Africa regions, by contrast, havenot been major purchasers of weapons, except on rare occasions. The regional arms agreement datatables in this report demonstrate this. United States policymakers have placed emphasis on helpingto maintain stability throughout the regions of the developing world. Thus, the United States hasmade and supported arms sales and transfers it has believed would advance that goal, whilediscouraging significant sales by other suppliers to states and regions where military threats tonations in the area are minimal. Other arms suppliers do not necessarily share the U.S. perspectiveon what constitutes an appropriate arms sale. For in some instances the financial benefit of the saleto the supplier trumps other considerations. The regional and country specific arms-transfer data inthis report provide an indication of where various arms suppliers are focusing their attention and whotheir principal clients are. By reviewing these data, policymakers can identify potentialdevelopments which may be of concern, and use this information to assist their review of optionsthey may choose to consider given the circumstances.

(7) The primary catalyst for newweapons procurements in the Near East region in the last decade was the Persian Gulf crisis ofAugust 1990-February 1991. This crisis, culminating in a U.S.-led war to expel Iraq from Kuwait,created new demands by key purchasers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for a variety of advanced weaponssystems. Subsequently, major concerns over the growing strategic threat from Iran has become theprincipal driver of GCC states' arms purchases. Because GCC states do not share a land border withIran, their weapons purchases have focused primarily on air, naval, and missile defense systems. Egypt and Israel, meanwhile, have continued their military modernization programs, increasing theirarms purchases from the United States. (8) ", "Most recently, the position of Saudi Arabia as principal arms purchaser in the Persian Gulfregion has been re-established. In the period from 2000-2003, Saudi Arabia's total arms agreementswere valued at $3.2 billion (in current dollars), less than the levels of the U.A.E., Egypt, and Israel. For the period from 2004-2007, Saudi Arabia's total arms agreements were $23.2 billion (in currentdollars), making it the leading Near East purchaser once again.", "The Near East has generally been the largest arms market in the developing world.

Efforts in several developing nations inAsia have been focused on upgrading and modernizing defense forces, and this has led to newconventional weapons sales in that region. Since the mid-1990s, Russia has become the principalsupplier of advanced conventional weaponry to China -- selling fighters, submarines, destroyers, andmissiles -- while maintaining its position as principal arms supplier to India. Russian arms sales tothese two countries have been primarily responsible for the increase in Asia's overall share of thearms market in the developing world. Russia has expanded its client base in Asia, receiving aircraftorders from Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia. India has also expanded its weapons supplier base,purchasing the Phalcon early warning defense system aircraft in 2004 from Israel for $1.1 billion,and numerous items from France in 2005, in particular 6 Scorpene diesel attack submarines for $3.5billion. In 2007, India made major purchases from Russia of T-90 main battle tanks, Su-30 MKIfighter aircraft, and MiG-29 fighter aircraft. The United States made a multi-billion dollar sale toPakistan in 2006 of new F-16 fighter aircraft, weapons, and aircraft upgrades, while Sweden soldit a SAAB-2000 based AWACS airborne radar system for over a billion dollars. In 2007, Pakistancontracted with China for production of J-17 fighter aircraft. These transactions have placedPakistan among the leading major Asian arms buyers of recent years.
