As such, they are viewed by many as the foundation for modern agriculture and as essential for achieving global food security.

All countries of the world are interdependent when it comes to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture; each relies on others for the genetic basis of its major food crops and for its food security. Interdependence for major food crops\u2014the measure of reliance on nonindigenous staple crop germplasm that comes from other parts of the world\u2014is over 50% for most regions, and ranges from 67% to 84% for countries in central Africa and from 85% to 100% for countries in south Asia.

The treaty sets up a multilateral system of access and benefit sharing, where all members, in exercise of their sovereignty, provide free (or nearly free) access to each other's plant genetic resources for research, breeding, conservation, and training. The multilateral approach allows members access to germplasm to promote food security and improve crop productivity, lowers transaction costs, and redistributes back to the governing body financial benefits derived from the commercial exploitation of the genetic resources.", "Currently, 120 countries are parties to the treaty.

A study conducted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that plants contribute the vast proportion of the world's food supply, particularly for developing countries in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. At a global level, the total dietary energy and protein provided by plants is 84% and 63%, respectively, while animal sources contribute 16% and 37%, respectively ( Table 1 ). Plant resources are even more critical in Africa, where about 93% of food energy and 79% of protein are derived from plant sources. The history of the development and use of PGRFA has been characterized by relatively rapid movements of domesticated crops and animals across and among continents, with ultimately a relatively small number of species representing a very high percentage of the daily diets of people around the world. FAO estimates that four crops\u2014rice, wheat, sugar (beet and cane), and corn\u2014account for over 60% of human calorie intake from plants.

They say that much of the increase in food production over the last half-century can be attributed to innovations achieved through plant breeding, drawing on existing genetic resources. FAO estimates that more than three-quarters of the increased crop productivity of the past 30 years is the result of plant breeding. FAO and other agricultural experts believe that future global food security depends to a large extent on the continued improvement of food crops\u2014for example, developing new varieties that are higher-yielding, resistant to pests and diseases, resistant to extreme weather events such as drought or flood, and/or regionally adapted to different environments and growing conditions. Crop improvement has also resulted in significant gains in the nutritional value of crop plants. Plant genetic resources serve as the raw material used by plant breeders and farmers to create new crop varieties. ", "Feeding a growing global population will require a significant increase in food production. Despite a 70% growth in world population, agriculture today provides over 15% more calories per capita than it did 30 years ago. By 2050 the world's population is estimated to reach 9.1 billion, 34% higher than today. About 70% of the world's population will be urban (compared to 49% today), and income levels will be higher than they are today. FAO estimates that farmers will need to increase production by at least 70% by 2050 to satisfy the demand for food due to population growth, urbanization, and rising incomes.

Modern crops and forages have a multitude of parent materials, as exemplified by the development of rice varieties grown all over the world ( Table 2 ). The diets of people around the world have evolved and adapted to such an extent that most countries and regions rely heavily on nonindigenous, imported germplasm of staple crops from other parts of the world. For example, corn is one of the world's three most important staple crops, especially for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. Corn originated in South America, but the United States is the largest global producer of corn and holds one of the world's largest genebank collections of corn varieties. Cassava, which also originated in South America, is another major food source in Africa today, while African millets and sorghums are major food crops in South Asia and Latin America. Latin America's extensive cattle pastures depend largely on African grasses. Alfalfa from southwestern Asia is now cultivated around the globe. A plate of pasta with red sauce, a dish typical in Italy, relies on crops that originated in South America (tomatoes) and in west and central Asia (wheat). The exchange of plant genetic resources has taken place over centuries, and without it few typical \"local\" meals would exist. A recent study concluded that for the major food crops, all regions were dependent on PGRFA from other regions to a high degree\u2014over 50% for most regions. Interdependence in central Africa ranges from 67% to 84%, and in south Asia ranges from 85% to 100%. No country in the study was ranked as completely self-sufficient.

Intensive agriculture benefits from genetic uniformity in crops, but it can also increase the potential for crop vulnerability to new pests, diseases, and environmental stresses. An example of that vulnerability occurred in 1970, when a widespread outbreak of a disease called southern corn blight hit from the southeastern United States into the Great Plains. The epidemic cost farmers 15% of the nation's corn crop that year because nearly all the corn planted was genetically susceptible to the fungus that caused the blight. Congress responded to this event by establishing the National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) within the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Agricultural Research Service (ARS). The NPGS is a national network of public agencies (federal and state agencies including more than 20 federal gene banks located across the country), private institutions, and individuals. It is the primary entity in the U.S. effort to conserve and use crop germplasm for crop improvement. With a collection that includes about 85 crops, the NPGS collects plant germplasm from all over the world. It is \"devoted to the free and unrestricted exchange of germplasm with all nations and permits access to U.S. collections by any person with a valid use,\" such as for research or breeding, although medical and other uses are included. Germplasm users in other countries have the same privileges as those in the United States. According to ARS, this policy has \"grown out of the belief that germplasm, like the oceans and air, is a world heritage to be freely shared for the benefit of all humanity.\" Through these efforts, NPGS assists in improving the quality and productivity of crops in the United States and in the world.", "The Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) provides support to NPGS and gives germplasm users continuous access to databases for the maintenance of passport, characterization, evaluation, inventory, and distribution data important for the effective management and use of national germplasm collections. GRIN is also administered by ARS.", "In 1990, Congress authorized the establishment of a National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP). NGRP has the responsibility to acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to scientists germplasm of all life forms important for food and agricultural production, which, in addition to plants, includes animals, microbes, and invertebrates. The National Genetic Resources Advisory Council (NGRAC) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary and Director of the NGRP.

The multilateral approach allows members access to germplasm to promote food security and improve crop productivity, lowers transaction costs, and redistributes back to the governing body financial benefits derived from the commercial exploitation of the genetic resources. The treaty is unlike other international laws governing global genetic resources, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD; see text box below), which extends private or sovereign control and limitations over genetic resources through bilateral interactions, and which many feel is inappropriate for food and agriculture. By establishing a multilateral approach that provides for a standardized protocol and framework applying to all contracting parties, the treaty deals with access and benefit-sharing of agricultural biodiversity in a different way than they are treated under the CBD."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of the Treaty", "paragraphs": ["The treaty originated from and eventually replaced the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources (IU), a voluntary non-legally binding agreement adopted by FAO in 1983. The IU was the first international instrument that sought \"to ensure that plant genetic resources of economic and/or social interest, particularly for agriculture, will be explored, preserved, evaluated and made available for plant breeding and scientific purposes.\" The IU reflected the widely held view of the time that plant genetic resources were a heritage of humanity that should be available to all for research and breeding. ", "While the IU attracted considerable support, some countries did not find the concept of free availability of genetic resources under the IU compatible with the intellectual property protection afforded by plant breeders' rights. Some tension existed concerning farmers' rights, in that intellectual property regimes that rewarded formal breeders often ignored the contributions of generations of farmers to the development and conservation of the PGRFA that breeders utilize. Many critics were also concerned that any system addressing PGRFA should reflect more fully the sovereign rights that countries have over those resources. These concerns were addressed in a series of agreed interpretations of the IU, adopted in 1989, that sought to balance the rights of breeders and farmers. A further conference resolution in 1991 reiterated the sovereign rights of states over their plant genetic resources.", "While negotiations proceeded towards the adoption of the CBD, the parties in an appendix to the Nairobi Final Act of the CBD resolved that there were outstanding issues on the interrelationship between the CBD and the promotion of sustainable agriculture. In 1993, the FAO Conference requested FAO to launch a revision of the IU to take into consideration the outstanding issues of access on mutually agreed terms to PGRFA, including ex situ collections and the realization of farmers' rights, in harmony with the CBD, and asked its intergovernmental Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture to act as the forum to negotiate between countries. ", "After seven years of complex and difficult negotiations, FAO members concluded the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. The treaty established the legal basis for the exchange of PGRFA, at least for those covered in Annex 1 by the multilateral system of access and benefits. The treaty was adopted by consensus by the 31 st session of the FAO Conference on November 3, 2001, and would enter into force 90 days after the ratification, acceptance, approval, or accession of the 40 th country, which occurred on June 29, 2004. The treaty currently has 120 contracting parties (see Appendix for list).

", "Article 11 specifies the PGRFA covered by the MLS as those that are listed on Annex I, are under the management and control of the parties, and are in the public domain. The list in Annex I covers 35 crops and 29 forages, including many major crops important to the United States for either domestic use or export. Many countries wanted a broad and comprehensive list of crops to be included in the MLS. Others wanted the MLS to start off with a more limited list of the most important crops. In theory, the negotiators agreed on a list of crops chosen according to their importance for food security and their interdependence. In practice, the list set out in Annex I was negotiated in part on the basis of the perceived interests of individual negotiating parties, with some crops important to food security being excluded, such as soybeans and groundnuts (peanuts). Nevertheless, the list does include most of the major food crops, including cereals such as rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, and millets; grain legumes such as beans, peas, lentils, chickpeas, and cowpeas; roots and tubers such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, and yams; oil crops such as coconut, sunflower, and plants in the mustard family such as cabbage and broccoli; and fruits such as citrus, apple, and banana/plantain. Noticeable absences that would appear to fit the food security and interdependence criteria include soybeans, groundnuts (peanuts), sugar cane, wild relatives of cassava including the genus Manihot , several fruits, and tomato. The MLS also includes PGRFA held in the ex situ collections of the Consultative Group on International Research (CGIAR) Centers as well as those held in other international institutions, by agreement with the governing body as referenced in Article 15. ", "The contracting parties are required to take appropriate measures to encourage natural and legal persons in their jurisdictions to include their holdings of Annex I PGRFA in the MLS. The United States currently encourages private entities to deposit germplasm in the National Plant Germplasm System pursuant to authority derived from 7 U.S.C \u00a7 5841.", "Article 12 creates the core obligation of the treaty, where parties are required to facilitate access to covered PGRFA. Parties are only obliged to provide access to PGRFA under the MLS when the PGRFA will be used solely for the purpose of research, breeding, and training for food and agriculture (not chemical, pharmaceutical, or other non-food or -feed industrial uses). Parties are to provide PGRFA expeditiously and for free or at a minimal charge, and also are to include available passport data for the PGRFA. Article 12 also notes that recipients shall not claim any intellectual property or other rights that limit access to PGRFA or their genetic parts or components, in the form received from the MLS. Recipients are required to continue to make accessed PGRFA available to the MLS under the terms of the treaty. This article also provides for a standard material transfer agreement (SMTA) between germplasm donors and recipients, which is to accompany any transfer of PGRFA under the MLS. The governing body adopted the text of the SMTA in June 2006. ", "The State Department analysis asserts that the obligations in Article 12 could be implemented in the United States using existing authorities, particularly through ARS, which maintains the National Plant Germplasm System, a network of more than 20 federal gene banks that operate under authority derived from 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2204, 3125a, 3291, 5841, and 5924. Under these authorities, the USDA Secretary is authorized to provide, free of charge, samples of germplasm from the federal genebanks to any requestor, so long as such provision is not inconsistent with other laws or regulations. Also, the State Department analysis suggests that in the United States, any recourse required from contractual disputes arising from the SMTA would be available via existing authorities that allow for recognition and enforcement of arbitral judgments in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.", "Article 13 describes the types of benefit-sharing that may result from the provision of access to PGRFA. It recognizes that the provision of PGRFA itself is a major benefit to the world community. Other benefit-sharing takes the form of exchange of information, access to and transfer of technology, capacity-building, and financial benefit-sharing arising from the commercialization of PGRFA. Under the monetary benefit-sharing provision found in Article 13.2d(ii) and the SMTA adopted in June 2006, a recipient of PGRFA who commercializes a product incorporation material accessed from the MLS is to pay 1.1% of gross sales. Recipients who make such a product available without restriction to others for further research and breeding are encouraged but not required to make such a payment. The parties agree in this article that the benefits go back to the governing body and not to any individual country or entity, and that benefits should flow primarily to farmers in all countries who conserve and sustainably use PGRFA.

In June 1993, President Clinton signed the CBD on behalf of the United States and transmitted the CBD to the Senate for advice and consent along with \"seven understandings\" to accompany the ratification instrument. He noted that existing federal, state, and local laws and programs were \"sufficient to enable any activities necessary to effectively implement our responsibilities under the Convention\" and that the \"Administration does not intend to disrupt the existing balance of Federal and State authorities through the Convention.\" The Senate Foreign Relations Committee supported CBD ratification by a 16-3 bipartisan vote, subject to the seven understandings. However, the CBD never received a ratification vote on the Senate floor. The Senate has not revisited CBD ratification for 15 years. ", "Several environmental groups advocate for the U.S. ratification of the CBD because of their support for biological conservation and protection globally. At the same time, other groups are opposed to ratification of the CBD because of the perceived potential restrictions imposed by the CBD on intellectual property rights and the position of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety regarding biotechnology. The Cartagena Protocol, which is an international agreement on biosafety and a supplement to the CBD, claims to protect biological diversity from the potential and perceived risks posed by genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The Cartagena Protocol allows countries to invoke the \"precautionary principle\" when considering the benefits and risks of new technologies such as biotechnology. For example, it allows countries to ban imports of genetically modified crops if they contend that there is not enough scientific evidence that the product is safe. They can also require exporters to label shipments containing genetically altered commodities such as corn or cotton. The United States has been a strong proponent of the use of biotechnology for agriculture and has argued in international trade venues against the blocking of U.S. commodities by the European Community and others because they contain GMOs.", "The 112 th Congress could assess whether ratification of the Treaty for PGRFA would have any bearing on the United States' position on the CBD. While signing on to one does not require the United States to be a party to the other (e.g., becoming a party to the plant treaty without being a signatory on the CBD does not offer up any known policy contradictions), some maintain that consideration of the context and relationship of both treaties is a prudent approach.
