For those receiving paid LTSS at home, the cost for these services can vary depending on the amount and duration of care provided. Assuming full-time care in the home, the median annual cost of home health aide services would have been about $46,000 in 2016.

Federal Medicaid law requires states to cover certain population groups (mandatory eligibility groups) and gives states the flexibility to cover other population groups (optional eligibility groups). Eligibility for the program's benefits has traditionally been linked to eligibility for cash assistance programs. For example, under federal Medicaid law, states are required to provide coverage to aged and disabled individuals receiving cash-assistance through the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.

For example, states may extend Medicaid coverage to individuals who have income up to three times the basic SSI payment level (referred to as the 300% rule) and reside in a nursing facility or other institution. Medicaid also provides states the option of covering elderly and disabled persons who are not poor by SSI standards but who need assistance with medical expenses.

In addition, some states may choose to include LTSS in their ABPs.", "Prior to the ACA Medicaid expansion, eligibility pathways available to adults with disabilities in need of LTSS required both income and resource standards. Under the ACA Medicaid expansion, adults with disabilities may be able to receive LTSS without specified resource standards.

At state option, this limit could be higher (up to $840,000 in 2017). States choosing a home equity threshold above the minimum apply the limit statewide. Such limits do not apply to individuals who have a spouse, child under the age of 21, or a child with a disability of any age residing in the home. Also, states can choose not to apply this rule if it is determined that doing so would cause an undue hardship in a given case. Similarly, MAGI individuals whose home equity exceeds the state limit are not eligible for LTSS coverage.", "For purposes of qualifying for Medicaid LTSS, individuals who have home equity above the state-specified limit could use a reverse mortgage or home equity loan to reduce their total equity interest in the home. In order for the proceeds of a reverse mortgage or home equity loan to be excluded from countable resources for the purposes of obtaining Medicaid coverage, federal guidance specifies that the Medicaid applicant must either spend the transaction amount or repay it to the lender in the month received.

Medicaid specifies rules for equitably allocating how much income and resources, as well as which resources, are to be credited to each spouse for the purposes of determining Medicaid LTSS eligibility. Commonly referred to as spousal impoverishment rules, they are intended to prevent the impoverishment of the spouse remaining in the community. In general, states must establish income and resource amounts that the community spouse may retain within federal limits. These amounts are not applied toward the qualifying spouse's Medicaid eligibility determination or LTSS costs.", "Regarding income, federal Medicaid law exempts all of a community spouse's income in his or her name from being considered available to the other spouse. That is, for any month the qualifying spouse is residing in an institution or receiving certain home and community-based servcies, income solely attributable to the community spouse is not considered available to the institutionalized spouse. For community spouses with limited income, federal law allows qualifying spouses to transfer income to the community spouse up to a state-determined minimum monthly income threshold, referred to as the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, which is set within federal limits. In 2017, the community spouse's minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance must be at least $2,002, but no more than $3,022, as determined by the state.

Specifically, Medicaid may require states to delay Medicaid eligibility for applicants seeking institutional and certain home and community-based LTSS who have disposed of certain assets for less than fair market value (FMV) on or after a \"look-back\" period, or period of time prior to application for services. This look-back period is five years prior to application for Medicaid.

If at least one transfer has occurred during this period, the state must determine whether the transfer was made for FMV. If the transfer was made for less than FMV (often referred to as an improper transfer), a penalty is imposed on the applicant in the form of months of ineligibility. To calculate the penalty period, the monetary value of the transfer, or portion of the transfer, that was made for less than FMV is divided by the average monthly private pay rate for nursing facility services in the state (or at state option, the rate in the community in which the individual resides). For example, an improper transfer of $26,000 divided by an average monthly private pay rate in a nursing facility of $6,500 results in a four-month period of ineligibility for Medicaid LTSS.

Liens may be imposed only when the individual resides in a nursing facility, ICF/DD, or other medical institution determined by the state; after notice of and opportunity for a hearing is given; and it is determined that the individual cannot reasonably be expected to return to the home. Liens may also be placed on property when, based on a court's judgment, Medicaid payments have been improperly paid on behalf of the individual. States are prohibited from pursuing liens under certain circumstances. For example, the state cannot place a lien on an individual's home if any of the following individuals reside in the home: a surviving spouse; a child under the age of 21 or a blind or permanently disabled child of any age; or a sibling of the individual who has equity interest in the property and has resided in the home at least one year prior to the individual entering an institution. Medicaid law also requires states to dissolve any lien placed on a home if the individual is discharged from the institution and returns home. In addition, liens can apply only to beneficiaries receiving institutional care who are also subject to the post-eligibility treatment of income (PETI) rules described in the previous section. Thus, liens cannot be applied to MAGI individuals who are not subject to PETI rules. However, as previously mentioned, CMS is considering rulemaking to expand PETI rules to include MAGI individuals who receive LTSS coverage.", "Furthermore, federal Medicaid law provides for exemptions from estate recovery in situations when such recovery would create undue hardship. Medicaid guidance allows for state flexibility in establishing procedures for an undue hardship waiver. In addition to exemptions for undue hardship, Medicaid permits states to forgo estate recovery in cases where it would not be cost-effective. Federal Medicaid law also prohibits estate recovery in cases when a lien has been placed on the home when certain individuals reside in the home. Such instances include (1) a sibling of an individual who has resided in the home at least one year prior to the individual entering an institution, and (2) an adult child who has resided in the home for at least two years prior to the parent's institutionalization, has resided there continuously since that time, and can establish to the state's satisfaction that the adult child provided care to the parent that delayed the need for nursing facility services. Special provisions apply to persons who become eligible for Medicaid under a more liberal asset standard used in certain states for those who purchase long-term care insurance.", "MAGI individuals who were 55 years of age or older when they received Medicaid benefits are not exempt from these estate recovery provisions; however, the above exemptions from estate recovery also apply. CMS guidance states that Medicaid estate recovery may create a potential barrier to enrollment for some newly eligible individuals in ACA Medicaid expansion states. It further articulates the agency's intention to explore options and use existing authorities to eliminate estate recovery for MAGI individuals who receive Medicaid benefits other than LTSS. CMS also notes that states have existing authority to limit the scope of estate recovery to Medicaid beneficiaries 55 and older who receive LTSS."], "subsections": []}]}}
