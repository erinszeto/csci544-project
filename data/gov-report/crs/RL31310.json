Other major appropriation legislation includes the defenseappropriations bill, which provides funds for all non-construction military activities of theDepartment of Defense and constitutes more than 90% of national security-related spending, and theenergy and water development appropriations bill, which provides funding for atomic energy defenseactivities of the Department of Energy and for civil projects carried out by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers. Two other appropriations bills, VA-HUD-Independent Agencies andCommerce-Justice-State, also include small amounts for national defense.

Traditionally, military construction was funded through annual defense or supplemental appropriations bills. However, the Korean War prompted a surge of military construction, followed by a steady increasein military construction appropriations. Given the strong and enduring security threat posed by theSoviet Union, a relatively high level of spending on military infrastructure appeared likely tocontinue. The appropriations committees established military construction subcommittees andcreated a separate military construction bill. The first stand-alone military construction bill waswritten for FY1959 (P.L. 85-852).", "Military construction appropriations are not the sole source of funds available to defense agencies for facility investment.

In 1996, then-Secretary of Defense William Cohen set FY2010as the target date for the elimination of all substandard military housing. Private development wasseen as a way to speed refurbishment or replacement while concurrently reducing the burden onappropriated funds, and Congress authorized DOD to use a set of \"alternative\" business practicesin its negotiations with private contractors, to include the creation of long-term public-private jointventures at locations where they might prove beneficial.", "Since 1996, when the first agreement was concluded at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi/Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas, contracts for sixteen separate projects have been awarded under this\"Military Housing Privatization Initiative.\" These range in size from 150 housing units in Phase IIof the venture at Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas, to 5,912 units at Fort Hood, Texas.
