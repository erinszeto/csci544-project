GINA was enacted to remedy this situation.", "GINA is divided into two main parts: Title I, which prohibits discrimination based on genetic information by health insurers; and Title II, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on genetic information. Title I of GINA amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as well as the Social Security Act, to prohibit health insurers from engaging in genetic discrimination. Title II of GINA prohibits discrimination in employment because of genetic information and, with certain exceptions, prohibits an employer from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information.

Scientists involved in the Human Genome Project (HGP) reported that the finished sequence consists of overlapping fragments covering 99% of the coding regions of the human genome, with an accuracy of 99.999%. These rapid advances provided resources for determining the causes of, and potentially the cures for, many common, complex diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and asthma. Specifically, scientists hoped that the data generated by the HGP would facilitate the identification of multiple genetic factors that influence a single disease or condition. ", "Although the sequence information was expected to help identify the genetic variants underlying disease and create a foundation for the development of genetic therapies, this scientific accomplishment raised certain considerations. For instance, the presence of a specific genetic variation may indicate a predisposition to disease but does not guarantee that the disease will manifest. An employer or health insurer could decide to take adverse action based on a genetic predisposition, and situations have arisen where discriminatory action based on this type of genetic information did occur. In addition, the fear of this occurring could deter individuals both from seeking genetic testing and services, as well as from participating in genetic research. GINA was enacted to remedy this potential situation. ", "This report provides background on genetic research, considerations with the use and misuse of genetic information, and relevant law at the time of GINA's enactment.

Clinical genetic tests are becoming available at a rapid rate; in addition, private insurers are beginning to include some clinical genetic tests in their health insurance benefits packages as evidence of the tests' clinical validity and utility accumulates. Most recently, genetic research has focused on precision medicine\u2014a relatively new term for what has traditionally been called personalized medicine\u2014the idea of providing health care to individuals based on specific patient characteristics, including genomic information. Researchers hope to combine genetic, environmental, clinical, behavioral, and other data to facilitate precision medicine. Precision medicine is a priority for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is carrying out a Precision Medicine Initiative. Part of this Initiative is the development of a national research cohort, composed of 1 million or more volunteers, whose health, genetic, environmental, and other data would be collected and used in research studies to identify novel therapeutics and prevention strategies.", "The HGP provided the foundational underpinnings for precision medicine. In congressional testimony, Dr. Francis Collins, then Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at the NIH, described the potential that the information generated by the HGP would likely have for clinical medicine and public health. He stated that", "[T]he human genome sequence provides foundational information that now will allow development of a comprehensive catalog of all of the genome's components, determination of the function of all human genes, and deciphering of how genes and proteins work together in pathways and networks. Completion of the human genome sequence offers a unique opportunity to understand the role of genetic factors in health and disease, and to apply that understanding rapidly to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. This opportunity will be realized through such genomics-based approaches as identification of genes and pathways and determining how they interact with environmental factors in health and disease, more precise prediction of disease susceptibility and drug response, early detection of illness, and development of entirely new therapeutic approaches.", "As Dr. Collins stated, with the completion of the human genome sequence, scientists turned their focus to better understanding the clinical and public health implications of the sequence information. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns About the Potential Misuse of Genetic Information Leading Up to GINA", "paragraphs": ["These scientific advances in genetic research, while promising, highlight the potential for misuse of the genetic information that such research generates. This concern, among other ethical, social, and legal implications of genetic research, was considered to be of enough import that a fixed portion of the total funds for the Human Genome Project were set aside to support the analysis and research of these issues. As scientific knowledge about genetics was increasing leading up to the publication of the human genome sequence, researchers and commentators expressed concern about how this information may be used when it became available. In congressional testimony, Dr. Collins stated", "[W]hile genetic information and genetic technology hold great promise for improving human health, they can also be used in ways that are fundamentally unjust. Genetic information can be used as the basis for insidious discrimination.... The misuse of genetic information has the potential to be a very serious problem, both in terms of people's access to employment and health insurance and the continued ability to undertake important genetic research.", "In the years before GINA was enacted, legal cases involving genetic discrimination were few. However, studies have shown that public fear of discrimination existed prior to and after the enactment of GINA, and that it negatively influences the uptake of genetic testing and the use of genetic information by consumers and health professionals. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society (SACGHS) learned that 68% of Americans are concerned about who would have access to their personal genetic information; 31% state this concern would prevent them from having a genetic test; and 68% agree that insurers would do everything possible to use genetic information to deny health coverage. A 2010 survey found that Americans are increasingly concerned about access to their genetic information; specifically, this survey found that 71% of Americans are concerned about storage of, and access to, their information, with the same percentage concerned specifically about access by health insurers.", "In addition, SACGHS as well as its predecessor committee, the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing (SACGT), sponsored two public forums in 2000 and 2004 to gather perspectives on genetic discrimination. Many comments were received from patients, consumers, health professionals, scientists, genetic test developers, educators, industry representatives, policymakers, lawyers, students, and others representing a wide range of diverse ethnic and racial groups. The comments and testimony revealed several anecdotal cases of discrimination. SACGT sent a letter to the Secretary of HHS after hearing about these cases from members of the public:", "During consultations with the public SACGT heard from many Americans who are concerned about the misuse of genetic information by third parties, such as health insurers and employers, and the potential for discrimination based on that information. Many stated that fear of genetic discrimination would dissuade them from undergoing a genetic test or participating in genetic research studies. Others stated that they would pay out of pocket for a genetic test to prevent the results from being placed in their medical record. Such concerns are a deterrent to advances in the field of genetic testing and may limit the realization of the benefits of genetic testing.", "A joint report by the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) summarized the various studies on discrimination based on genetic information. The report stated that \"genetic predisposition or conditions can lead to workplace discrimination, even in cases where workers are healthy and unlikely to develop disease or where the genetic condition has no effect on the ability to perform work\" and that \"because an individual's genetic information has implications for his or her family members and future generations, misuse of genetic information could have intergenerational effects that are far broader than any individual incident of misuse.\" ", "The National Council on Disability (NCD), an independent federal agency that advises the President and Congress on issues affecting individuals with disabilities, published a position paper on March 4, 2002 on genetic discrimination. The NCD stated that recent advances in genetic research have brought an increasing potential for genetic discrimination; that genetic discrimination is a historical and current reality; that genetic discrimination undermines the purposes of genetic research and testing; that genetic test information has little value for purposes of making employment decisions and insurance decisions; and that current law at the time was insufficient to protect individuals from genetic discrimination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Law Relating to Genetic Discrimination Prior to the Passage of GINA", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)", "paragraphs": ["Title I of GINA extended the HIPAA protections against discrimination\u2014by group health plans and issuers of health insurance in both the group and individual markets\u2014as they were at the time GINA was enacted. At the time of GINA's enactment, HIPAA prohibited a group health plan or issuer of a group health plan from using genetic information to establish rules for eligibility or continued eligibility and provided that genetic information shall not be treated as a preexisting condition in the absence of the diagnosis of the condition related to such information. HIPAA also prohibited a group health plan or issuer of a group health plan from using genetic information in setting a premium contribution. These protections applied to individuals within the group plans; however, they did not apply to the coverage of the whole group or to the premiums set for the group. Thus, HIPAA prohibited group health plans or issuers of group health plans from charging an individual a higher premium than a similarly situated individual; however, the law did not prevent an entire group from being charged more. The HIPAA nondiscrimination provisions did not apply to individual health insurance policies, and genetic information was able to be used to set premiums for individual policies (although HIPAA established both guaranteed issue for individuals who lose group coverage and guaranteed renewal for those with existing individual coverage). HIPAA also did not prevent group health plans or issuers of health plans from excluding coverage for a particular condition or imposing lifetime caps on all benefits, or on specific benefits. ", "At the time of GINA's enactment, HIPAA did not prohibit group health plans or issuers of group health plans from requiring or requesting genetic information or testing.", "Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule at the time of GINA's enactment, health plans and insurers were able to use or disclose health information for payment and other health care operations.

The threshold issue in any ADA case is whether the individual alleging discrimination is an individual with a disability. The ADA, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, defines the term disability with respect to an individual as having \"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3)).\" Although the statutory language of the ADA does not reference genetic traits, there was a discussion of the issue during congressional debate of the original legislation. Prior to GINA's enactment, there appears to have been no judicial decisions specifically dealing with genetic predisposition to disease and the ADA, but one case was brought by the EEOC and settled. In another case, an individual filed with the EEOC alleging genetic discrimination and received a determination that the EEOC's investigation supported her allegation of discrimination under the ADA.", "Prior to the enactment of the ADA Amendments Act, the ADA's definition of \"disability\" had been interpreted by the EEOC to apply to individuals \"who are subjected to discrimination on the basis of genetic information relating to illness, disease, or other disorders.\" The legislative history was cited by the EEOC in its guidance to the definition of disability for its compliance manual. In this guidance, the EEOC examined the definition of disability under the ADA and concluded that the third prong\u2014being regarded as having an impairment\u2014prohibited discrimination based on genetic information relating to illness, disease, or other disorders.", "Although this EEOC interpretation was widely heralded as a significant step for the protection of rights for individuals whose genes indicate an increased susceptibility to illness, disease, or other disorders, it was limited in its application and was further narrowed by Supreme Court decisions on the definition of disability. However, at Senate hearings in 2002, EEOC Commissioner Paul Miller stated that the ADA \"can be interpreted to prohibit employment discrimination based on genetic information. Nonetheless, the ADA does not explicitly address the issue and its protections are limited and uncertain.\" In addition, Commissioner Miller observed that even if the ADA were found to cover genetic discrimination, the requirements of the ADA may not protect workers from all types of genetic discrimination. He stated, \"for example, the ADA does not protect workers from requirements or requests to provide genetic information to their employers.... In addition, once the applicant is hired, the employer may request that the employee take a medical exam, such as a genetic test, if the employer can demonstrate that the information from that test is job related and consistent with business necessity.\"", "Although the combination of the ADA's legislative history and the EEOC's guidance raised the possibility that the ADA would cover genetic discrimination, this possibility remained uncertain since there had been no reported cases holding that the ADA prohibited genetic discrimination. This uncertainty increased after Supreme Court decisions on the definition of disability under the ADA, although the Supreme Court's decisions did not directly address ADA coverage of genetic discrimination. ", "The ADA Amendments Act rejected the Supreme Court's limited interpretation of the definition of disability and amended the ADA to provide for broader coverage. However, the ADA Amendments Act does not specifically mention genetic discrimination although the expanded definition would increase the likelihood of coverage.

For example, an employer must make reasonable accommodations, as required under the ADA to enable a person with a disability to participate in a wellness program.", "Finally, it is important to note that several provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, P.L. 111-148 , as amended) address wellness programs. Although the EEOC has indicated that it eventually intends to issue regulations on the subject, it is currently unclear how these provisions interact with the wellness provisions in GINA. In the meantime, the EEOC recently sued a company based on allegations that its wellness program violated the statute's prohibition against genetic information discrimination. Although the case has not yet been decided, the court noted in a preliminary ruling that \"great uncertainty persists in regard to how the ACA, ADA and other federal statutes such as GINA are intended to interact.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certification Procedures Under Medical Leave Laws", "paragraphs": ["The third statutory exception is for information necessary for certification procedures under federal and state family and medical leave laws.

In its discussion of this exception, the EEOC examines the factors used in deciding whether a document is commercially or publicly available and determines that the key criterion is \"whether access requires permission of an individual or is limited to individuals in a particular group, not whether the source is categorized as a social networking site, personal Web site, or blog.\" The EEOC also notes that the exception does not apply to genetic information gathered by actively searching for genetic information from commercially and publicly available sources, or to the acquisition of genetic information from a source likely to contain such information, such as a website that focuses on genetic testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Genetic Monitoring of Toxic Substances", "paragraphs": ["The fifth exception applies when the information involved is to be used for genetic monitoring of the biological effects of toxic substances in the workplace.

In its discussion of the final regulations, the EEOC notes that one commenter had expressed concern that individuals who have a manifested genetic disease that is not yet substantially limiting may not be covered under either law. The EEOC declined to address this issue, stating that it had no authority to expand the coverage of GINA. However, the EEOC observed that with the enactment of the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA), which expanded the definition of disability under the ADA, it is less likely that there would be a significant number of individuals who would not be covered by either Act. ", "Both the EEOC rules and the HHS interim final rules add a definition for the terms \"manifestation\" and \"manifested.\" Specifically, the rules define these terms to mean a disease, disorder, or pathological condition that has been or could \"reasonably be diagnosed by a health care professional with appropriate training and expertise in the field of medicine involved.\" The rules add further that a \"disease, disorder, or pathological condition is not manifested if a diagnosis is based principally on genetic information.\" ", "The addition of these definitions may address the above concern regarding those individuals with a manifested genetic disease that is not yet substantially limiting. The definitions have the effect of expanding the applicability of the protections under both titles by further delimiting their exception through the exclusion of individuals with a manifested disease diagnosed principally on genetic information. This implies that the diagnosis was not carried out in the context of, or made based on, the existence of signs or symptoms of the disease or disorder, and appears likely to include those individuals with a manifested (i.e., diagnosed) genetic disease that is not yet substantially limiting (i.e., no substantial signs or symptoms)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authorization of Appropriations and Effective Date", "paragraphs": ["Such sums as may be necessary are authorized to be appropriated.

Educating the public and health care providers about the scope and application of GINA is important as implementation of the law continues. Recent data indicate that awareness of the law amongst the public is limited. A 2008 survey reported that, \"only 16 percent of respondents to the survey knew that there were laws that protect the privacy of genetic information, and only one-quarter of those felt that protections were sufficient.\" A similar survey conducted in 2010 found that awareness of laws protecting privacy held steady at 16%, with 77% of Americans unsure whether they are protected by law. Educational efforts are particularly relevant because there are several limitations to the scope of the law of which the public and practitioners should be made aware in order to avoid confusion or misunderstanding. ", "Importantly, the scope of the law is limited to the settings of health insurance and employment. It does not cover the following: long term care insurance; life insurance; short-term disability insurance; or long-term disability insurance. Moving forward, this distinction may need to be presented clearly to the public, so there is not an expectation of blanket protection from genetic discrimination in all settings where genetic information may be disclosed, requested, required or used. The HHS final rule implementing Section 105 (\"Privacy and confidentiality\") of Title I extended certain of GINA's protections to additional types of health plans, as defined under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, to which GINA did not expressly apply. This expansion of GINA's applicability is limited to the prohibition on the use of health information, that is genetic information, for underwriting purposes, as required by Section105, and does not act to extend the protections established in Sections 101-104 of Title I to these additional health plan types. Additionally, the final rule does not apply this prohibition to issuers of long-term care insurance, although they are in the HIPAA Privacy Rule's definition of \"health plan\"; the final rule clarifies that this is due to a lack of evidence of the effect that prohibiting the use of genetic information in underwriting may have on long-term care insurance issuers. ", "In addition, GINA does not necessarily extend protections against discrimination in health insurance and employment to individuals with manifested diseases or disorders, genetic or otherwise. Specific provisions in Titles I and II clarify that health insurers and employers will not be in violation of GINA if they use specified information about, or knowledge of, a manifested disease or disorder to establish premiums, set enrollment eligibility or preexisting exclusion requirements, or make employment decisions (this is affected by passage of the ACA; see below). Again, educational efforts may be useful in ensuring that the public is aware of relevant limitations in the scope of the law.", "Finally, the passage of the ACA appears to affect GINA, and Title I provisions in particular. The ACA established a number of reforms to the private health insurance market, limiting insurers' ability in many cases to use health status or factors to discriminate in the issuance or renewal of policies. In addition, provisions in the ACA address employer wellness programs, and the information that such programs may collect from employees. This intersects with GINA in that family history or other genetic information may be requested by the employer in the context of such programs. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
