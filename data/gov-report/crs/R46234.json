Today, federal child nutrition programs support food served to children in schools and a variety of other institutional settings. Administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), child nutrition programs include the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), and Special Milk Program (SMP).", "The child nutrition programs vary in terms of size and target populations. The largest programs are NSLP and SBP (the \"school meals programs\"), which subsidize meals for nearly 30 million children in approximately 94,300 elementary and secondary schools nationwide. The other child nutrition programs serve fewer children. CACFP supports meals served to children in child care, day care, and afterschool settings; SFSP provides funding for summer meals; FFVP sponsors fruit and vegetable snacks in elementary schools; and SMP subsidizes milk in schools and institutions that do not participate in other child nutrition programs. In general, the largest subsidies are provided for free or reduced-price meals and snacks served to children in low-income households.", "Federal spending on child nutrition programs and activities totaled approximately $23 billion in FY2019, the majority of which was mandatory spending. Most child nutrition programs are considered \"appropriated entitlements,\" meaning that their authorizing statutes establish a legal obligation to make payments, but that obligation is fulfilled through funding that is provided in annual appropriations acts. Most of the funding is provided in the form of per-meal cash reimbursements that states distribute to schools and institutions. A smaller amount of federal funding is provided in the form of federally purchased commodity foods and cash for states' administrative expenses.", "The child nutrition programs are primarily governed by two statutes: the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 as amended. These laws were most recently reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296 ), which made several changes to the child nutrition programs. For example, the act created the Community Eligibility Provision, an option for eligible schools to provide free meals to all students. It also required USDA to update nutrition standards in the school meals programs and CACFP within a certain timeframe.", "Certain provisions of the HHFKA expired at the end of FY2015. However, these expirations have had a minimal impact on program operations, which continue with annual appropriations. The 114 th Congress began but did not complete a reauthorization of child nutrition programs. In the 115 th Congress, there was no significant reauthorization activity. As of the date of this report, leadership on both committees of jurisdiction (the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee and the House Committee on Education and Labor) have announced plans to work on reauthorization in the 116 th Congress.

The act formalized federal support for school lunches following early federal aid beginning in the 1930s. Other child nutrition programs were added in the decades to follow as policymakers expanded feeding programs beyond the school setting. The Child Nutrition Act of 1966 formalized SMP and created SBP as a pilot program. Soon after, a program for child care and summer meals was piloted in 1968 and separated into the Child Care Food Program (now CACFP) and SFSP in 1975.

Russell National School Lunch Act (NSLA) and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935, also provides a portion of child nutrition funding.

USDA required recipient organizations, through their agreements with state agencies, to operate school lunch programs on a nonprofit basis, maintain any existing local funding for school lunches, keep records of foods received, serve meals free to poor children, and ensure that such children would not be identified to their peers, among other requirements.", "The availability of federal aid contributed to a rapid increase in the number of school lunch programs. However, in 1943, federal commodity aid declined as Section 32 surplus commodities were diverted to feed U.S. armed forces in World War II. In addition, federal support for lunchroom labor disappeared with the elimination of the Works Progress Administration. In the midst of declining aid, Congress provided the first cash assistance\u00e2\u0080\u0094$50 million in Section 32 funds\u00e2\u0080\u0094for \"a school milk and lunch program\" in the 1944 Department of Agriculture Appropriation Act (P.L. 78-129). The introduction of cash assistance marked a shift in the lunch program. For the first time, schools could purchase their own foods in addition to receiving federally purchased commodities.", "Annual appropriations acts continued cash support for school lunches until 1946, when the National School Lunch Act (P.L. 79-396) was enacted. Signed into law on June 4, 1946, by President Truman, the National School Lunch Act permanently authorized appropriations of \"such sums as may be necessary\" for the National School Lunch Program. (The act would later be renamed the \"Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act,\" recognizing Senator Russell's role in the passage of the legislation and his earlier support for the school lunch program within New Deal programs and during his tenure as the Chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee. ) The law required participating schools to serve lunches for free or at a reduced price to students who were deemed by local school authorities as unable to pay the full cost of a lunch. Funds were to be distributed to states based on the number of school-aged children in the state and the state's need, as measured by per-capita income, and states were to match federal funds dollar-for-dollar. States were to distribute funding on a monthly basis to schools based on the number of meals served that met \"minimum nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary on the basis of tested, nutritional research\" (P.L. 79-396). Cash assistance could not be used for cafeteria equipment, and separate funds were authorized for this purpose ($10 million annually); however, Congress subsequently prohibited appropriations for equipment assistance from FY1948 to FY1967.", "NSLP remained relatively unchanged from 1946 to 1960. However, during this timeframe, concerns emerged over the funding formula. One concern was that the formula prioritized funding for schools with large numbers of school-aged children rather than actual participants in the program. There was also concern that schools with high proportions of needy children received the same amount of aid as those with wealthier families, even though they had to serve a larger number of meals for free or at a reduced-price. In 1962, P.L. 87-823 changed the funding formula to be based on the number of school lunches served in the state in the preceding school year instead of the number of school-aged children. The law also authorized additional \"special assistance\" for state-selected schools in poor economic areas (however, special assistance was not funded until 1966).", "Other notable changes to NSLP occurred in the 1970s. In 1970, P.L. 91-248 extended special assistance to all schools participating in NSLP. The law also reduced the state matching requirement and established the first national eligibility guidelines for free and reduced-price meals at 100% of the federal poverty level (later in the decade increased to 125% for free lunches and 195% for reduced-price lunches). In 1971, another significant change occurred with the enactment of P.L. 92-153, which guaranteed states a certain level of federal cash assistance by specifying average per-meal reimbursement rates for free, reduced-price, and paid lunches.", "The Addition of Other Child Nutrition Programs", "In the 1960s, federal child nutrition efforts expanded beyond school lunches. On October 11, 1966, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-642) was enacted. It formally authorized the Special Milk Program (SMP) and authorized the School Breakfast Program (SBP) as a pilot program. The SMP was based on predecessor USDA school milk programs that had operated since the 1940s. SBP was a newer concept that USDA had piloted in the 1965-1966 school year. In a House Agriculture Committee hearing on the Child Nutrition Act, then-Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman testified that", "These proposals will permit us to begin a comprehensive effort to broaden child nutrition programs in this country. They are based on what we have learned in 20 years of administration of the National School Lunch Act, and they reflect a careful assessment of gaps which now exist in the nutritional needs of children in this country.", "The SMP provided reimbursements for milk in schools, nonprofit child care centers, summer camps, and other nonprofit institutions. At the time, schools and institutions could participate in both SMP and NSLP. Meanwhile, SBP was authorized for two fiscal years and required states to prioritize funds for \"schools drawing attendance from areas in which poor economic conditions exist and to those schools to which a substantial proportion of the children enrolled must travel long distances daily\" (P.L. 89-642). (Congress later expanded priority to include \"schools in which there is a special need for improving the nutrition and dietary practices of children of working mothers and children from low-income families\" (P.L. 92-32).) The Child Nutrition Act of 1966 also gave the Secretary the authority to provide higher reimbursements to schools with \"severe need.\" Like NSLP, the law specified that breakfasts \"meet minimum nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary on the basis of tested nutritional research,\" and be served for free or at a reduced price to children unable to pay the full price of a meal, as determined by local school authorities (P.L. 89-642).", "In 1968, child nutrition efforts were further expanded with the authorization of the Special Food Service Program for Children (SFSPC), a pilot program to fund meals in summer and child care settings (P.L. 90-302). SFSPC provided the first federal assistance for summer meals for children and the first dedicated assistance for meals served in child care settings. Similar to SBP, SFSPC was targeted to areas with poor economic conditions and a high number of working mothers.", "In 1975, the program was split into the separate Child Care Food Program (CCFP) and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) ( P.L. 94-105 ). CCFP was open to public and nonprofit institutions that met child care licensing or other official child care standards, while SFSP retained a focus on institutions in low-income areas. Meals were provided for free to all children at SFSP sites, whereas CCFP conducted free and reduced-price eligibility determinations like NSLP.", "Recent History (1980 to 2010)", "The longstanding growth of child nutrition programs was contrasted with budget cuts in the early 1980s, which were part of larger efforts to reduce federal domestic spending. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-499 ) reduced FY1981 funding for child nutrition programs by approximately $400 million (9%) of the child nutrition budget. The law achieved savings by lowering reimbursement rates in the programs and eliminating commodity assistance for breakfast, among other changes. Larger spending cuts followed with the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, which made changes that collectively cut $1.4 billion (25%) of the child nutrition budget (Title VIII of P.L. 97-35 ). Many of the policy changes made by the law remain in place today. For example, the law restricted eligibility from 195% of poverty to 185% of poverty for reduced-price meals and set eligibility at 130% for free meals in the NSLP, SBP, and CCFP. It also raised allowable charges for reduced-price lunches from 20 cents to 40 cents and for reduced-price breakfasts from 10 cents to 30 cents. In a major change to SMP, the law excluded schools/institutions that participated in another child nutrition meals program from participating in SMP\u00e2\u0080\u0094cutting SMP's budget by 77 percent. In CCFP, the law restricted participation from children ages 18 and under to children ages 12 and under, and reduced the maximum number of reimbursable meals from three meals and two snacks per child daily to two meals and one snack per child daily. The law also eliminated equipment assistance for school meals.", "Child nutrition programs were subsequently excluded from budget deficit reduction measures in the late 1980s and 1990s, and new policies led to the expansion of the programs during this timeframe. For example, amendments to the programs in these years authorized start-up grants for school breakfast programs, expanded CCFP to adult day care centers (and renamed the Child and Adult Care Food Program, or CACFP), and provided new funding for afterschool snacks through NSLP and CACFP. But what had potentially the longest-term impact on expansion was a policy change intended to reduce paperwork in the school meals programs: automatic (categorical) eligibility for free meals for children in food stamp (now SNAP) and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (now TANF) households, which was enacted in 1986\u00e2\u0080\u0094and direct certification of such children for free meals without household applications, which was enacted in 1989.", "Other policies in the late 1980s and 1990s focused on improving program integrity. The 1989 child nutrition reauthorization ( P.L. 101-147 ) required USDA to create a standardized process through which states would review school food authorities' administration of NSLP and SBP (known as administrative reviews). In CACFP, following USDA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audits in the 1990s that found instances of abuse and mismanagement, the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-224 ) made a number of changes aimed at improving program integrity in CACFP. The act required CACFP sponsors to conduct more frequent and unannounced site visits of sponsored centers and homes, restricted nonprofit institutions' eligibility to those with tax-exempt status, and excluded institutions deemed ineligible to participate in any other public program based on violations of program requirements. Other legislation was aimed at improving program integrity in the school meals programs.", "Program integrity continued to be a focus in the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization ( P.L. 108-265 ), which made changes to school food authorities' verification of household applications for free and reduced-price meals. Specifically, the law set a sample size of applications that schools must review, established a focus on \"error-prone\" applications (applications near the income eligibility thresholds), and authorized direct (automatic) household application verification processes. In addition, the law required states to conduct additional administrative reviews of school food authorities with a high level of administrative error or risk of error. ", "The 2004 child nutrition reauthorization also continued the expansion of free school meals to new categories of children. Specifically, the law extended categorical eligibility and direct certification for free school meals to homeless children, migrant children, and children served under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. ", "The most recent child nutrition reauthorization as of the date of this report was the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA; P.L. 111-296 ). The HHFKA continued the expansion of school meals in a few ways. It made foster children categorically eligible for free school meals, and allowed direct certification of such children. It also included a pilot project for direct certification (but not categorical eligibility) of children in Medicaid households for free and reduced-price meals based on an income test. In addition, the HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), through which eligible schools can provide free meals to all students.", "As discussed in this report, the HHFKA also made changes to nutritional requirements in the school meals programs and CACFP. Specifically, the law required USDA to update the nutrition standards for school meals within a certain timeframe and align the standards with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (per an existing statutory requirement). The law also required USDA to issue new nutrition standards regulating all foods sold on school campuses during the school day (\"competitive foods\"). (Previous standards applied only to competitive foods sold during meal service.) In addition, the HHFKA required USDA to update the nutrition standards for CACFP meals and snacks within a certain timeframe and align them with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. USDA and Congress have made subsequent changes to the nutrition standards for school meals and CACFP meals and snacks, and the standards remain a source of debate in the programs."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
