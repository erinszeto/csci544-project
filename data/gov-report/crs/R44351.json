{"id": "R44351", "title": "Derivatives: Introduction and Legislation in the 114th Congress", "released_date": "2016-07-01T00:00:00", "summary": ["Derivatives are financial instruments that come in several different forms, including futures, options, and swaps. A derivative is a contract that derives its value from some underlying asset at a designated point in time. The derivative may be tied to a physical commodity, a stock index, an interest rate, or some other asset.", "Derivatives played a role in the 2008 financial crisis in a variety of ways. The unmonitored buildup of derivatives positions in the largely unregulated \"over-the-counter\" (OTC) market led many major financial institutions into large financial losses. Possibly the best-known example of such losses was the insurance giant American International Group (AIG), whose massive losses from selling credit-default swaps ultimately contributed to the need for government assistance. OTC derivatives, prior to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203), were traded bilaterally rather than cleared through a clearinghouse, and no reporting trail existed, which created uncertainty during the crisis over the web of exposures to large derivatives losses.", "The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to address these policy concerns by bringing the swaps market into a regulatory framework based on that of the futures markets, which had long been regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Security-based swaps tied to equities or narrow-based credit indexes were placed under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within a similar framework.", "Broadly, Dodd-Frank included five major reforms. It required the", "1. clearing of certain swaps through a clearinghouse, entailing the posting of margin, or cash, to cover accumulating losses; 2. trading of certain swaps on an exchange or swap execution facility (an electronic trading platform), with the aim of increasing price transparency; 3. reporting of all swaps transactions to a swaps data repository (SDR) to create an audit trail and more market data for regulators; 4. registration of swap dealers and major swap participants, subjecting them to regulatory oversight; and 5. establishment of margin and capital requirements by regulators for swaps that remain uncleared. Parallel provisions were enacted for security-based swaps under the SEC.", "In the 114th Congress, several bills have been introduced, and two have been enacted as part of other legislation, impacting various aspects of swaps regulation largely stemming from Dodd-Frank. One of the provisions, originally in H.R. 1847 but enacted in P.L. 114-94/H.R. 22, removed a requirement added in Dodd-Frank that foreign regulators indemnify a U.S.-based SDR and the CFTC for any expenses arising from litigation related to a request for market data (with a parallel SEC provision). The other provision, originally in H.R. 1317 but enacted in P.L. 114-113/H.R. 2029, created an exception for certain corporate affiliates of nonfinancial companies, dubbed \"centralized treasury units,\" to the clearing and exchange-trading requirements.", "The House has passed legislation, H.R. 2289, that would reauthorize appropriations to carry out the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA; 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71 et seq.)\u2014a process that historically has recurred every five years. The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry marked up and ordered to be reported S. 2917 which would also reauthorize such appropriations, as well as making other changes to the CEA. S. 2917 and H.R. 2289 would each modify the definition of who is a financial entity\u2014relevant for determining who must clear their swaps\u2014but the bills do so in different ways. H.R. 2289 and S. 2917 would\u2014in substantially identical ways\u2014broaden the definition of bona fide hedging to allow anticipated, as well as current, risks to be hedged, likely increasing the number of swaps qualifying as hedges for position limits, registration requirements, and other purposes. H.R. 2289, S. 2917 and S. 1560 also contain provisions to codify the deadline for brokers to deposit residual interest (capital from a futures broker that temporarily makes up the difference for insufficient margin in a customer's account) as no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the following business day.", "H.R. 2289 (but not S. 2917) includes measures that would increase required cost-benefit analysis by the CFTC in rulemakings. H.R. 2289 (but not S. 2917) would mandate that, starting 18 months from enactment, the swaps regulatory requirements of the eight largest foreign swaps markets must be considered comparable to those of the United States\u2014unless the CFTC were to issue a rule finding that any of those foreign jurisdictions' requirements were not comparable to U.S. requirements."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Derivatives are financial instruments that come in several different forms, including futures , options , and swaps . A derivative is a contract that derives its value from some underlying asset at a designated point in time. The derivative may be tied to a physical commodity, a stock index, an interest rate, or some other asset. Derivatives' prices fluctuate as the underlying assets' rates or expected future prices change, and neither a buyer nor a seller of a derivative need necessarily own the underlying asset.", "Many firms use derivatives to manage risk. For example, a firm can protect itself against potential increases in the price of a commodity that it uses by entering into a derivative contract that will gain value if the price of the commodity rises. A notable instance of this type of hedging strategy was a derivatives position taken by Southwest Airlines that allowed it to buy jet fuel at a low, price in 2008 even as energy prices reached record highs. When used to hedge risk, derivatives can protect businesses (and sometimes their customers) from unfavorable price shocks.", "Others use derivatives to seek profits by betting on which way prices will move. Such speculation adds liquidity to the market\u2014speculators assume risks that hedgers wish to avoid. Some observers believe that the growth of speculative derivatives trading has increased the risks of market instability and volatility, whereas others argue that such speculation adds liquidity and that more liquid derivatives markets are more efficient and more stable. ", "Although derivatives trading has its origins in agriculture, today most derivatives are linked to financial variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, stock prices, and the creditworthiness of bond issuers, as shown in Figure 1 . The market is measured in hundreds of trillions of dollars, and billions of contracts are traded annually.", "Growth in derivatives markets was explosive between 2000 and the advent of the 2008 financial crisis, with some retrenchment after 2008. From 2000 until the end of 2008, the volume of derivatives contracts traded on exchanges, such as futures exchanges, and the notional value of total contracts traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) market grew by 475% and 522%, respectively. Following the 2008 financial crisis, the total notional value of OTC derivatives globally fell by about 13% between June 2008 and December 2008 but then crept upward again. Over the longer term, total global notional values outstanding for OTC derivatives have fallen from $684 trillion as of June 2008 to $553 trillion as of June 30, 2015, and to further to $493 trillion as of December 30, 2015. The drop has been stimulated partly by the movement of derivatives trading to exchanges rather than OTC since the crisis. Trading derivatives on exchanges is also associated with \"trade compression\"\u2014a process that allows economically redundant derivative trades to be terminated early without changing each participant's net position. Trade compression and greater use of clearinghouses has contributed to the gradual drop in notional value. Of the total, 78% of global swaps consisted of interest-rate swaps as of Dec. 30, 2015, illustrating the predominance of financial instruments over agricultural ones. ", "The financial crisis led to intense debate about whether the rapid growth in derivatives markets had contributed to structural instability in the U.S. and global financial systems. The reasons for the crisis are still the subject of wide debate, but most observers believe a major factor behind the severe market turmoil was derivatives exposures, which could not be readily quantified and exacerbated panic and uncertainty about the true financial condition of other market participants, contributing to the freezing of credit markets. Such debates led, in 2010, to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203 ), which required that risk exposures of major financial institutions be backed by capital, minimizing the shock to the financial system should such firms fail. Dodd-Frank also aimed to ensure that large derivatives bets by financial firms would be collateralized by having those firms post margin, or cash, into accounts to pay for potential losses from derivatives. ", "Whether Dodd-Frank has been effective in lowering structural risks to the U.S. and global financial systems remains a subject of debate. In addition, some argue that Dodd-Frank has imposed costs that affect the competitiveness of U.S. financial institutions. This report discusses some of these debates as they relate to selected legislative proposals in the 114 th Congress affecting the regulation of derivatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Market Structure and Regulation", "paragraphs": ["Prior to passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, futures and options were traded on regulated exchanges, whereas swaps were traded OTC. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or asset at a predetermined price at a future date. An option is a contract that gives the holder the option, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset or commodity at a future date at a predetermined price. Swaps are generally agreements between two parties to exchange different cash flows over a set period of time. Although swaps, futures, and options operate differently, they generally are somewhat fungible in the sense that similar investment outcomes can be achieved by employing any one of them. ", "Prior to Dodd-Frank, swaps (also called OTC derivatives) were largely unregulated, whereas futures and options were regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulatory landscape since Dodd-Frank is broadly illustrated in Figure 2 , below. ", "Futures contracts have long been traded on exchanges regulated by the CFTC, and stock options have been traded on exchanges under the SEC. SEC and CFTC regulation of exchanges is generally similar: federal law requires both securities and commodity exchanges to make and enforce rules to ensure fair and orderly trading and to protect public investors from fraud. Many classes of market professionals, as well as the exchanges themselves, are required to register with a federal agency or a self-regulatory organization. Data on price and trading volumes must be publicly available on exchanges. The regulators may amend exchange rules and must approve all rule changes. Both the SEC and the CFTC have their own enforcement powers and staff.", "Exchanges are centralized markets where buying and selling interests come together. Traders who want to buy, or take a long position ( longs )\u2014who benefit if prices of the commodity or asset rise\u2014interact with those who want to sell, or go short ( shorts ). Shorts benefit when prices of the commodity or asset fall. Deals between those on the short and long sides of trades are made and prices are reported throughout the day. In the OTC market, however, contracts are made bilaterally, typically between a dealer and an end user. Prior to Dodd-Frank, the OTC market generally had no requirement that the price, the terms, or even the existence of the contract had to be disclosed to a regulator or to the public. Figure 3 shows the differences between exchange-traded and OTC derivatives.", "Derivatives can be volatile contracts characterized by a high degree of leverage, which can result in big gains and losses among traders. The exchanges have dealt with the issue of credit risk through a third-party clearinghouse. But the credit risk remains: How does the clearinghouse ensure that it can meet its obligations? Clearinghouses depend on a system of margin, or collateral. Before the trade, both the long and short traders deposit an initial margin payment with the clearinghouse to cover potential losses. Then, at the end of each trading day, all contracts are repriced, or marked to market , and those who have lost money (because prices moved against them) must post additional margin (called variation or maintenance margin ) to cover those losses before the next trading session. This process is known as a margin call : traders must make good on their losses immediately or their brokers may close out the traders' positions when trading opens the next day. The effect of the margin system is that no one can build up a large paper loss that could damage the clearinghouse in case of default. It is certainly possible to lose large amounts of money trading on the futures exchanges, but only on a pay-as-you-go basis. Procedurally, the trade is made on the exchange floor (or electronic network) and then is sent to the clearinghouse, which guarantees payment. The process is shown in Figure 3 , above.", "The OTC market, as shown on the right side of Figure 3 , includes a network of dealers rather than a centralized exchange. Firms that act as dealers stand ready to take either long or short positions, and they make money on the volume of trading by charging a spread, or fee, on each trade. The dealer absorbs the credit risk of customer default, and the customer faces the risk of dealer default. The OTC market has been dominated by fewer than a dozen firms\u2014institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and their foreign counterparts. In the OTC market, prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, some but not all contracts required collateral or margin. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade group, published best practice standards for use of collateral, but compliance was voluntary. Since the Dodd-Frank Act, regulators have required the posting of margin for OTC derivatives that are not cleared by a clearinghouse. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Derivatives in the Financial Crisis", "paragraphs": ["Little consensus exists about the relative importance of the numerous factors that have been put forward as causes of the 2008 financial crisis, including the role of derivatives. However, derivatives clearly played some role in transmitting financial shocks from firm to firm and from market to market. Several aspects of derivative finance may be implicated:", "Complexity. At the peak of the housing boom, home mortgage loans were packaged, repackaged, and repackaged again into highly complex securities, many of which incorporated derivatives to increase yield or to obtain AAA bond ratings. As mortgage losses began to grow, no one could be sure what the real value of these securities was. As a result, the true financial condition of banks and other holders of these securities became uncertain and interbank lending slowed, creating the conditions for panic. Opacity. In addition to the complexity of structured financial instruments, the nature of derivatives markets is to create a web of risk exposures among a wide range of markets and firms. Fears about insolvency in individual financial institutions were amplified by the knowledge that those firms might owe billions to derivatives counterparties\u2014default of a single derivatives dealer had the potential to trigger cascading losses throughout the banking system. But no information about the extent or distribution of such potential losses was available, especially where unregulated OTC derivatives were involved. Leverage. In the post-2000 low-interest-rate environment, many market participants sought to boost investment returns through the use of leverage\u2014supplementing their own capital with debt or derivatives. Because all derivatives trading is done on margin, a relatively small initial investment may generate a large return (or loss). Thus, the losses in U.S. mortgage lending were magnified into much greater losses throughout the global financial system. Excessive Speculation. The above factors combined to produce catastrophic losses at a number of systemically important firms that had amassed large speculative derivatives positions. A good example is insurance giant American International Group (AIG), which sold billions of dollars in credit-default swaps and had to be rescued by the government, thus preventing massive losses to AIG's counterparties that could have exacerbated the downward global financial spiral. ", "The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that derivatives contributed to the 2008 financial crisis in three major ways. First, credit-default swaps were instrumental in fueling the securitization of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and in the subsequent housing bubble. Second, credit-default swaps were essential in creating synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), or financial instruments that served as bets on the performance of real mortgage-backed securities. The CDOs amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped to spread the losses throughout the financial system. Third, once the housing boom ended, derivatives were at the center of the crisis due to (1) concerns that losses associated with derivatives would trigger cascading losses throughout the global financial system and (2) the lack of transparency concerning the overall size of the derivatives market and the extent of derivatives transactions between systemically important financial institutions, which directly added to uncertainty and panic in global financial markets. ", "The AIG case illustrates two aspects of OTC markets that were central to derivatives reform. First, in a market with mandatory clearing and margin, in which AIG would have been required to post initial margin to cover potential losses, there was a stronger possibility that AIG would have run out of money long before the size of its derivatives position grew so massive. ", "Second, because most OTC contracts were not reported to regulators prior to 2010, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury lacked information in the crisis about which institutions were exposed to AIG and the size of those exposures. Uncertainty among market participants about the size and distribution of potential derivatives losses flowing from the failure of a major dealer was a factor that exacerbated the \"freezing\" of credit markets during the peak of the crisis.", "One basic theme of derivatives reform proposals in the run-up to the Dodd-Frank Act was to change the OTC market to act more like the exchange-traded futures market\u2014in particular, to have bilateral OTC swaps cleared by a third-party clearing organization. Clearing was expected to reduce counterparty risk and increase transparency. At the same time, borrowing costs can be associated with a clearing regime that requires participants to post margin. ", "Firms that use derivatives to hedge business risks often take positions that move in the opposite direction from the underlying market. Such commercial businesses argued that the costs of posting margin would prevent them from hedging. Nonfinancial commercial firms were ultimately exempted from the clearing and exchange-trading requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act. However, the question of which firms should be required to clear their derivatives, thereby tying up cash for any margin, remains an issue addressed in some of the legislation in the 114 th Congress.

Second, these swaps also are required to be traded on an exchange or an exchange-like electronic platform called a swap execution facility (SEF), with the goal of promoting pre-trade and post-trade price transparency. However, swaps in which one counterparty is a nonfinancial firm (e.g., a farmer, energy company, or airline) are not subject to these clearing and exchange-trading requirements. Third, all swaps must be reported to a database called a swap data repository (SDR) to give regulators a clearer picture of the market. Fourth, financial firms that trade swaps heavily must register with the CFTC or the SEC (the latter if the firms trade swaps related to securities) as swap dealer s or major swap participant s (MSPs), so as to promote more regulatory oversight of major market players.

Section 763 creates largely parallel requirements for security-based swaps, over which the SEC has authority.

That figure is up from about 15% of all swaps in 2007.", "If a swap or security-based swap is subject to the clearing requirement, the Dodd-Frank Act makes it unlawful for parties to enter into that swap or security-based swap unless the transaction has been submitted for clearing. A swap or security-based swap may become subject to the clearing requirement in two ways. First, the agency of jurisdiction is required to engage in an ongoing review of the products under its jurisdiction to determine whether a particular swap, security-based swap, group, or class of such contracts should be subject to the clearing requirement. Second, a swap or security-based swap may become subject to the clearing requirement upon submission to the CFTC or the SEC.

As of the end of the first quarter of 2015, 54.5% of all interest-rate and credit-related swaps were traded on SEFs, globally, in terms of gross notional value\u2014a figure that has increased since the passage of Dodd-Frank. ", "The goal of the trading requirement is \"to promote pre-trade price transparency in the swaps market.\" Because the old OTC market was notably opaque, with complete price information available only to dealers, swaps customers were limited in their ability to shop for the best price or rate. The expectation is that as price information becomes more widely available, competition will produce narrower spreads by lowering prices. ", "SEFs and SBSEFs must comply with a number of core principles set out in the act. Although these principles are somewhat less prescriptive than the regulation of exchanges in which public customers are allowed to trade, the new trading facilities have regulatory and administrative responsibilities far beyond what applied to OTC trading desks in the past. Among other things, SEFs and SBSEFs must", "establish and enforce rules to prevent trading abuses and to provide impartial access to the trading facility; ensure that swap contracts are not readily susceptible to manipulation; monitor trading to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions in the underlying cash market; set position limits; maintain adequate financial and managerial resources, including safeguards against operational risk; maintain an audit trail of all transactions; publish timely data on prices and trading volume; adopt emergency rules governing liquidation or transfer of trading positions as well as trading halts; and employ a chief compliance officer, who will submit an annual report to regulators.", "During consideration of Dodd-Frank, a central issue of debate was the extent to which existing OTC derivatives trading platforms and mechanisms could be accommodated under the new regulatory regime. Before Dodd-Frank, OTC trading practices ranged from individual telephone negotiations to electronic systems accessible to multiple participants. One concern was that if SEFs were too much like exchanges, the existing futures and securities exchanges would monopolize trading. However, if the SEF definition were too vague or general, the OTC market might remain opaque. ", "The bill reported by the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee defined an SEF as \"an electronic trading system with pre-trade and post-trade transparency.\" The explicit reference to \"pre-trade\" transparency does not appear in the final legislation, in part because of concerns that such a requirement was not compatible with the business models of a number of intermediaries, such as interdealer swap brokers providing anonymous execution services.", "As is the case with the clearing requirement, Dodd-Frank provides exceptions to the exchange-trading mandate.

Two categories of regulated market participants are enumerated: swap dealers and MSPs (together with their security-based swap equivalents).", "Because the OTC dealer market is highly concentrated, the proposal that swap dealers be subject to additional prudential regulation was not controversial. Only a few dozen of the largest financial institutions were presumed to be affected. The question of how many firms should be included in the definition of MSP, however, was contentious. How many non-dealer and nonbank firms should become subject to prudential regulation?", "On May 23, 2012, the CFTC and SEC released a joint final rule further defining the terms swap dealer and major swap participant . The final rule defined what constitutes a \"substantial\" position in swaps, for the purposes of being an MSP. The regulators proposed a two-pronged test for a substantial position. First, c urrent exposure , or the current mark-to-market value of a swaps or security-based swaps position, minus the value of collateral posted against the position, constitutes a substantial position if the net uncollateralized exposure exceeds $1 billion or $3 billion for interest- or currency-rate swaps. The second test also involves a calculation, this time relating to future exposure . This figure is calculated by discounting current notional exposure by a risk factor, by the existence of netting agreements, and according to whether the position is cleared or subject to daily margining. A future exposure is substantial if it exceeds $2 billion or $6 billion for interest- or currency-rate swaps. These quantitative tests for substantial position are meant to set a threshold \"materially below\" the level at which a swaps trader's default could pose a threat to the financial system.", "In the joint final rule, the CFTC and SEC's definition of a swap dealer closely followed the Dodd-Frank definition of a swap dealer. The final rule defines a swap dealer as any person (a person, in this case, can be an entity) who holds himself out as a dealer in swaps; makes a market in swaps; regularly enters into swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for his own account; or engages in activity causing himself to be commonly known as a dealer or market maker in swaps. The rule also excludes certain swaps used to hedge or mitigate risk, if the risks arise from a potential change in the value of assets a person owns or produces or services the person provides. In addition, it excludes swaps entered into between majority-owned affiliates. ", "At the same time, the rule includes a de minimis exception. For a person to be regarded as a swap dealer, the aggregate gross notional amount of the swaps the person entered into during the prior 12 months in connection with swap dealing activities must exceed $8 billion during a phase-in period. The phase-in period would last two and a half years from the time data start being reported to swap data repositories (SDRs). After that time, the CFTC would undertake a study of the swaps markets and may reduce this de minimis amount to $3 billion or may propose a new rule for a different de minimis threshold. On November 18, 2015, the CFTC published a preliminary study on the swap dealer de minimis threshold, which laid out a number of policy considerations\u2014including reducing systemic risk, providing protections for trading counterparties, and other issues\u2014and asked for additional public input, without making a direct recommendation regarding the final amount of the threshold.

For swaps that are determined to be subject to the clearing requirement under subsection (h)(2) (outlining the two ways in which swaps may become subject to this requirement; see \" Clearing Requirement ,\" above) but are not cleared, real-time public reporting is required as well.

The SEC, however, proposed a narrow definition of real-time \u2014\"as soon as technologically practicable after the time at which the ... transaction has been executed.\"", "The real-time reporting requirement is qualified in only a few circumstances. In the case of contracts that are not required to be cleared and are not cleared, public reporting for such transactions shall not disclose the business transactions or market positions of any person. In addition, the SEC proposal does not address block trades directly, but it notes that the SEC intends to propose a rule for the reporting of block trades at a later date, after considering comments.", "On April 3, 2012, the CFTC issued a final rule describing reporting, recordkeeping, and daily trading records obligations for swap dealers and MSPs. The CFTC's final rule followed a proposed rule released on December 23, 2010. The final rule calls for electronic reporting to an SDR of swap data from each of two important stages of the existence of a swap: the creation of the swap and the continuation of the swap over its existence until its final termination or expiration. The purpose of this requirement appears to be to create an electronic audit trail of all stages of the swap. The final rule requires swap dealers and MSPs to maintain records of all activities related to their business, regardless of whether they also have a prudential, or banking, regulator with separate recordkeeping requirements.

Dodd-Frank's Section 723 created an exception to these clearing and exchange-trading requirements for swaps traded by nonfinancial commercial companies, known as end users, partly to avoid imposing the cost of posting margin on them.

A 2013 CFTC no-action letter defined CTUs as entities that perform certain limited financial functions on behalf of the larger conglomerate, such as hedging activities, cash management, credit administration, or other financial risk management. In a 2012 final rule, the CFTC found that CTUs operating as separate legal entities and whose primary function is financial would be precluded from the end-user exception, but CTUs housed within nonfinancial corporations, and through which the nonfinancial company enters into the swaps in its own name, could be eligible for the end-user exception. This decision gave rise to what some have called the principal-agent issue, meaning the CTU could use the exception only if it were not structured as a separate legal entity\u2014or if it were not trading swaps as a principal but merely as an agent of the conglomerate.

It states only that the affiliate of the nonfinancial firm or end user may qualify for the end-user exception itself \"only if the affiliate enters into the swap to hedge or mitigate the commercial risk of the person or other affiliate of the person that is not a financial entity.\" H.R. 2289 as passed by the House does not specify that such trades must occur within an umbrella organization. ", "The hypothetical scenario in Figure 4 illustrates the issues: If a nonfinancial firm, such as an energy or metals business, had an affiliate that was a financial firm, could that financial firm engage in swaps trading with an unaffiliated large financial firm and still use the end-user exception under Section 301? Although no restriction appears in Section 301 to prevent this scenario so long as the financial affiliate engaged in the swap \"to hedge or mitigate the commercial risk of the person or other affiliate of the person that is not a financial entity,\" the prohibition on certain affiliates in Section 723 of Dodd-Frank would appear to preclude affiliates that were large banks with more than $50 billion in assets\u2014or were swap dealers, MSPs, hedge funds, or commodity pool operators\u2014from using the end-user exception as an affiliate, even if H.R. 2289 is enacted. Financial firms with fewer assets (and that are not swap dealers, MSPs, hedge funds, or commodity pool operators), however, apparently would not be prohibited from using the exception, so long as the standard for hedging or mitigating the commercial risk of the nonfinancial affiliate was met.

If these entities are not financial entities, then they may use the end-user exception in their own right and need not meet the affiliate requirements of Section 723 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as it would be amended by Section 301 of H.R. 2289 . To use the clearing and exchange-trading exceptions, these entities would only need to use the swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk of other qualifying nonfinancial entities and to notify the CFTC in accordance with agency regulations.", "H.R. 2289 would create a broader, statutory exception from the Dodd-Frank clearing and exchange-trading requirements. It potentially would allow certain nonbank financial entities that do not have banking regulators to be eligible for the exception if these entities could show that they were \"commercial market participants\" or that they met the requirements for trading on behalf of other non-prudentially supervised affiliates. The bill leaves to the CFTC to further clarify who would be a commercial market participant and to determine which types of nonbank financial firms would qualify for the end-user exception.

Language in the two bills on this topic is substantially the same. The concept of bona fide hedging refers to transactions that in some way genuinely offset commercial risks. The CFTC relies on its established rules and guidance on what constitutes a bona fide hedge to help determine which types of swaps count toward the requirement to register as a swap dealer or MSP. The agency also uses the concept to determine which derivatives count toward limits on position size, referred to as position limits , and, similarly, which transactions count toward large trader reporting . ", "Large trader reporting requirements refer to a system the CFTC uses to monitor how large any one trading party's position size is. The broad purpose of this system is to ensure that no one entity wields excessive market power. The CFTC has the discretion to raise or lower the large trader reporting levels in specific markets to strike a balance between collecting sufficient information to oversee the markets and minimizing the reporting burden on market participants. Similarly, a position limit broadly refers to the maximum position in any one type of future, option, or swap for one commodity that may be held or controlled by one person.

In addition, it could potentially allow trades that were needed not only to reduce risks but also simply to manage risks.

Because the swaps market is international in nature, with considerable cross-border trading, this question is material. Section 722(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act stated that swaps reforms shall not apply to activities outside the United States unless the activities have \"a direct and significant connection with activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States.\" ", "This mandate left much discretion to the CFTC as to how to interpret it. Former CFTC chair Gary Gensler, under whom the CFTC first issued rules and interpretations implementing Section 722, stated, \"Failing to bring swaps market reform to transactions with overseas branches and overseas affiliates guaranteed by U.S. entities would mean American jobs and markets would likely move offshore, but, particularly in times of crisis, risk would come crashing back to our economy.\" Gensler and others have noted that derivatives trading by overseas affiliates of U.S. financial conglomerates can and has resulted in significant losses to U.S.-based entities. They cite examples such as AIG's London-based Financial Products Group, which sold credit-default swap derivatives related to mortgage-backed securities that incurred losses during the financial crisis, or the more recent J.P. Morgan London Whale derivatives trading losses of roughly $6 billion.

In it, the agency sought to clarify who would count as a U.S. person for the purposes of meeting the requirements of Dodd-Frank, such as the clearing requirement for swaps, among other questions. Subsequently, on December 21, 2012, the agency issued a temporary exemption, extending the deadline for meeting all the requirements for cross-border swaps, while it continued to work with foreign regulators to create a more uniform system of requirements. Then, on May 1, 2013, the SEC proposed a rule and interpretive guidance on cross-border security-based swaps\u2014swaps related to a security, such as an equity\u2014which the SEC regulates. The SEC's proposed rule has been widely interpreted as taking a narrower approach to defining who is a U.S. person than did the CFTC\u2014and thus restricting the reach of Dodd-Frank requirements on security-based swaps to fewer overseas transactions or entities. ", "The CFTC issued its final guidance on July 26, 2013, setting out the scope of the term U.S. person , the general framework for determining which entities had to register as swap dealers and MSPs, and which swaps involving non-U.S. persons who were guaranteed by U.S. persons were subject to U.S. requirements. On November 14, 2013, the CFTC issued a staff advisory aimed at determining when to apply U.S. derivatives requirements to trades that were booked in an offshore affiliate but in which the non-U.S. affiliate used U.S. personnel to arrange, negotiate, or execute the swap. ", "The CFTC continues to issue rules aimed at clarifying how to apply Dodd-Frank derivatives requirements to cross-border trades. Other issues that have arisen more recently include the need for U.S. and foreign regulators to recognize one another's derivatives clearinghouses, trading exchanges, and data repositories for reporting trades as \"equivalent,\" so that one trade spanning multiple jurisdictions need only be cleared, traded, and reported one time. This issue has proven challenging, as, among other things, the European Union has thus far not granted such an equivalence determination to U.S. clearinghouses and trading facilities.

H.R. 2289 drops the earlier bill's requirement that the CFTC and SEC must jointly issue a cross-border rule. However, similarly to H.R. 1256 , the current bill would mandate that, starting 18 months from its enactment, the swaps regulatory requirements of the eight largest foreign swaps markets must be considered comparable to those of the United States\u2014unless the CFTC issues a rule or order finding that any of those foreign jurisdictions' requirements are not comparable to or as comprehensive as those of the United States. ", "However, listing those eight largest jurisdictions is not entirely straightforward. For one thing, selecting the jurisdictions would depend on how regulators treated the member countries of the European Union for purposes of the statute. For another, the total notional value of swaps traded in a jurisdiction fluctuates over time, so how the 12-month period was drawn likely would impact the results. Further, regulators would have to determine where a swap is traded\u2014that is, in whose jurisdiction it would fall\u2014when a large portion of the market is considered cross-border in nature. This problem is essentially the same one U.S. regulators are already facing in deciding when a swap qualifies as a U.S. transaction. ", "Under H.R. 2289 , absent a CFTC determination of noncomparability, \"a non-United States person or a transaction between two non-United States persons [would] be exempt from United States swaps requirements\" as long as the transaction was in compliance with the regulations of any of the eight permitted foreign jurisdictions. Effectively, the bill would substitute as a default, for trades that involved a non-U.S. person, the swaps requirements of the eight largest foreign swaps markets (which would encompass most of the world of swaps trading, particularly if countries in the European Union were treated as one swaps jurisdiction) for U.S. requirements\u2014unless the CFTC found a foreign jurisdiction to be lacking. ", "One question that presumably would be left to the CFTC to determine in a rulemaking would be how widely to apply this provision to \"a non-United States person or a transaction between two non-United States persons,\" were the bill enacted. For instance, would the provision potentially encompass any swap in which a non-U.S. person was at least one counterparty? If so, the provision could apply to a large majority of swaps, the bulk of which appear to be transacted in some way between a U.S. and non-U.S. person. It would presumably be left to the regulator to interpret and clarify the provision's application. ", "A definition of a U.S. person in Section 314 includes, among other factors, \"any other person as the Commission may further define to more effectively carry out the purposes of this section\"\u2014thereby apparently giving the CFTC some leeway. However, Section 314 also specifies that, in developing its cross-border rules, the CFTC \"shall not take into account, for the purposes of determining the applicability of United States swaps requirements, the location of personnel that arrange, negotiate, or execute swaps.\" This requirement drew some criticism in congressional debate over the bill.", "The provision would appear to overturn CFTC Advisory 13-69, which has drawn much industry opposition. The advisory was aimed at resolving questions regarding the precise conditions in which swaps between U.S. and non-U.S. persons would be subject to Dodd-Frank requirements. The advisory, which technically represented the opinion of only one division of the CFTC, held that the Dodd-Frank requirements would apply to a swap between a non-U.S. swap dealer\u2014even if it were an affiliate of a U.S. swap dealer\u2014and a non-U.S. person, as long as the foreign swap dealer used \"personnel or agents located in the U.S. to arrange, negotiate, or execute such swap.\" The advisory proved controversial and drew strong industry opposition.
