The first restrictions on gifts with specific monetary limitations and detailed guidelines were enacted in the House and Senate in 1977, and under these Rules, provisions were made for Members and staff to accept certain travel expenses and reimbursement for such \"fact-finding\" events. In the House of Representatives in the 95 th Congress, a Select Committee on Ethics was established to provide advisory opinions and guidance on the new restrictions on gifts. The Select Committee noted that although \"there has been some criticism regarding abuses of 'fact finding tours' in the past,\" it would not be in the public interest to prohibit Members from accepting necessary travel expenses for \"fact finding events or activities which have a legitimate purpose directly related to the official duties of the Congress.\" The Committee noted that \"although a Member of Congress may render some personal services in the course of a fact-finding event, the primary purpose of the trip is for the Members, officers, or employees to become better informed regarding subject matters closely related to their official duties,\" and found:", "Therefore, the Select Committee holds that necessary expenses paid by an organization sponsoring a fact-finding event are exempted from the limitations of Rule XLIII, clause 4 [now XXV, clause 5], provided that the fact-finding event or activity is directly related to the official duties of the Member, officer, or employee. Any such reimbursement or payment of travel expenses aggregating over $250 in value from one source would be subject to disclosure .... This public disclosure will guard against the potential abuse of converting this kind of activity from an official business purpose to that of personal pleasure or entertainment. Gifts of that nature exceeding $100 [now $50] in value were clearly intended to be prohibited ....", "To protect against potential abuses, the Select Committee narrowly defined \"fact-finding\" tours and activities to exclude reimbursements or provision to a Member of transportation by a corporation to his home district \"on the grounds that he would 'tour' the corporate facilities there,\" and such things as \"ship-launchings\" or inaugural airline flights, which were considered more in the nature of promotional events. The Committee further emphasized that Members may only accept necessary expenses incurred in a fact-finding activity, and may not accept even entertainment, or expenses or reimbursements for entertainment, which, among all other reimbursements, expenses or things of value beyond necessary expenses , would be considered gifts to the Member subject to the specific dollar limitation on gifts:", "Additionally, the Select Committee emphasizes that the definition of a \"fact-finding event\" must be interpreted narrowly. House Rule XLIII, clause 2 [now XXIII, clause2] puts Members on notice that not only the \"letter\" but also the \"spirit\" of House Rules must be adhered to....", "The intended definition of a fact-finding event would also not extend to expenses incurred during such an event which are unrelated to the specific fact-finding activity.... Similarly, this exemption for fact-finding activities applies only to necessary expenses (transportation, food, lodging) and not to entertainment.

In addition to the prohibition of lobbyists funding such fact-finding trips, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct has expressly noted in an official publication issued in April of 2000, that \"The prohibition against accepting travel expenses from a registered lobbyist, an agent of a foreign principal, or a lobbying firm applies even where the lobbyist, agent or firm will later be reimbursed for those expenses by a non-lobbyist client.\" While the lobbyist may not pay for the travel expenses, even if later reimbursed by a client, the Rules do not expressly prohibit the lobbyist from accompanying the Members and attending such event paid for by the lobbyist's clients or employers. The Senate provides that the lobbyist is not prohibited from \"assisting the organization in arranging the event, for example, by issuing the invitations on behalf of the organization or attending the event.\" The discussion of the House Rules notes that a private entity paying for officially connected travel should \"both organize and conduct the trip, rather than merely pay for a trip that is in fact organized and conducted by someone else,\" but the House Rules do not expressly prohibit a lobbyist either accompanying a Member on such event, nor personally extending the sponsoring organization's invitation to the Member."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "3.

As explained by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, for example: \"[D]uring the course of a trip, entertainment or recreational activities may be accepted from a private source only if their total value is less than $50, and the overall gift limit of less than $100 in any calendar year is complied with.\" Additionally, \"entertainment\" expenses are not considered \"necessary expenses,\" and may not be accepted unless the entertainment is \"provided to all attendees as an integral part of the event.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "5. \"Reasonable\" Expenses", "paragraphs": ["The Rules of the House and Senate provide that the \"necessary\" expenses which are and may be accepted in relation to officially connected travel must also be \"reasonable.\" There appear to be, however, no published guidelines or tables delineating any specific monetary amounts considered within, or outside of, the range of \"reasonable\" expenses for travel and lodging. It should be noted that the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct explains that the qualifiers \"necessary\" and \"reasonable\" may also limit the time frame for which expenses may be accepted, depending on the nature of the event. Thus, a Member, officer or employee \"may accept only such expenses as are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the trip, and thus it may not always be proper to accept expenses for the full four- or seven-day period.

The \"bribery\" provisions of federal law prohibit the \"corrupt\" receipt of something of value \"in return for\" being influenced in any official act, while the \"illegal gratuities\" clause of that law requires merely the receipt of something of value with the knowledge that one is being compensated or rewarded \"for or because of\" any official act done or to be done."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
