In 2011, coal was the fuel used for almost 42% of power generation in the United States. However, coal use for power generation seems to be on the decline. In April 2012, for the first time in history, the amount of electricity generated from natural gas equaled that of coal (according to Energy Information Administration statistics) with each fuel claiming about 32% of the market. The future of coal as a fuel for power generation seems to be in question. Two major reasons are generally seen as being responsible: the expectation of a dramatic rise in natural gas supplies, and the impact of environmental regulations on an aging base of coal-fired power plants. The electric utility industry values diversity in fuel choice options since reliance on one fuel or technology can leave electricity producers vulnerable to price and supply volatility. However, an \"inverse relationship\" is developing for coal vs. natural gas as a power generation choice based on market economics alone, and policies which allow one fuel source to dominate may come at the detriment of the other.", "Upgrading the nation's transmission system to accommodate current and future uses, and ensuring the reliable functioning and the security of the grid, has been a major concern for the federal government.

The recent damage sustained to the electrical grid by Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey and difficulty in restoring electricity service underscore the age and fragility of the power system, and how electricity service might benefit from hardening and modernization of various power systems. Growing concerns over greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, other environmental costs associated with burning fossil fuels, and existing or anticipated state and federal policies addressing these issues are leading some utilities and energy providers to deploy more renewable energy technologies to meet power demands, and potentially increasing the need for new transmission lines to incorporate clean energy sources.", "New environmental regulations under development would impose new requirements on coal-fired power plants. Some of these rules would be implemented at the federal level, while others would be implemented at the state level.

Electric power generation in the United States is currently dominated by the use of combustible fuels, such as the fossil fuels coal and natural gas, or from biomass. These fuels are burned either to produce steam in boilers which is used to turn turbine-generators or burned directly in combustion turbines which turn generators to produce electricity. Nuclear power uses heat from the fission of radioactive elements to produce steam. However, electricity can also be generated directly by wind turbines, solar power, geothermal energy, and hydropower. Generally, electricity must be used as soon as it is produced, because large amounts of electricity cannot be easily stored. ", "Originally, the individual utility company systems were not linked, but with greater electricity demand came the necessity of sharing generation resources. This sharing of generation resources required an interconnection of separate company systems to enable power sales and transfers. These aggregated power systems form three major \"interconnections\"\u2014the Eastern and Western interconnections, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which includes most of that state. Within these interconnections are reliability regions, and a number of balancing authorities which \"integrate resource plans ahead of time, maintain load-interchange generation balance\" within a balancing authority area, and \"support interconnection frequency in real-time.\" The grid also connects the many publicly and privately owned electric utility and power companies in different states and regions of the United States (and in Canada and Mexico).", "Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-617 ), creating a class of non-utility power producers (i.e., qualifying small power and cogeneration facilities) which resulted in the introduction of competition into wholesale power markets (e.g., for the sale of electricity to entities other than the end-user of power). The passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 ) served to further promote greater competition in the bulk power markets. As a result, in many parts of the United States, the electric power industry began to transition from highly regulated, local monopoly companies which generated, transmitted, and distributed electricity to end-use customers, to a business in which power generation is competitive while the industry's transmission and distribution functions are still highly regulated. ", "In these regions with restructured electricity industries, competitive markets largely set the price of power. The rates consumers ultimately pay for electricity are based on auctions in regional transmission organization (RTO) or independent system operator (ISO) systems wherein generators competitively bid to provide energy for a particular time period. Rates for wholesale transactions of RTOs and ISOs are under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) regulatory jurisdiction. Wholesale power rate components depend upon the market structure of the RTO or ISO, and generally have cost components for energy, capacity, transmission, ancillary services, operating reserves, and general system costs and regulatory fees. Non-RTO transmission costs and distribution costs are generally added to arrive at the rate end-use customers pay. While FERC is largely responsible for regulation of the electric power transmission system and wholesale power markets, regulation of the distribution function of the electric power business is still largely carried out by state government agencies. ", "The choice of power generation technology in the United States is heavily influenced by the cost of fuel. Historically, the use of fossil fuels has provided some of the lowest prices for generating electricity. Figure 1 shows that, as of 2011, coal accounts for approximately 42% of net generation by the electric power sector, followed by natural gas at 25%, and nuclear power at almost 20%.

However, the average age of power plants is now over 30 years, and the life expectancy of most power plants is about 40 years. While most of these plants are well-maintained, they are generally not as efficient as newer power plants. As power plants age, they are generally upgraded to continue operations, but the least efficient plants may be retired. Other plants may be shifted from base load operations (in which they essentially operate around the clock) to less demanding intermediate or peaking schedules. The cost of building a power plant is generally recovered over the depreciable life of the asset, such that operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses become the major component of an older power plant's continuing costs. A major component of O&M is the cost of fuel. However, the costs of modernizing older plants to meet new regulatory requirements can be relatively high. When the cost of upgrades to meet new environmental requirements is considered along with (perhaps increasing) O&M expenses, many older power plants become subject to retirement decisions.", "Electric power generation is responsible for 37% of U.S. domestic carbon dioxide emissions (the primary anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG)), and over one-third of all U.S. GHG emissions. Growing concerns over GHG emissions, other environmental costs associated with burning fossil fuels, and existing or anticipated state and federal policies addressing these issues are leading some utilities and energy providers to deploy more renewable energy technologies to meet power demands. As of 2011, hydropower represented 8% of all U.S. electric power industry net generation, with all other renewable energy accounting for a further combined total of 4%.", "Renewable energy has been used since before the Industrial Revolution, but not on the scale of steam power generation. Renewable energy technologies use the power of the sun, wind, water, and heat from the earth, offering the possibility of producing electricity on a large scale without most of the environmental and climate consequences of electric power generation using fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources have the potential to provide inexpensive, almost limitless electricity with minimal adverse environmental impacts. However, some of the technologies used today to generate electricity from renewable energy sources are variable in nature, and produce higher cost power than conventional fossil or nuclear sources of electricity (if environmental externalities are not considered). Practical energy storage technologies can potentially be a game-changer for greater renewable energy deployment. State governments have generally led the way in encouraging deployment of renewable energy technologies, using a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to create a market for renewable energy via mandated requirements. While most RPS goals are expected to be met, about 12 states have existing provisions expiring by 2015, and approximately 14 states and the District of Columbia have existing RPS or related provisions scheduled to expire by 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Events", "paragraphs": ["Electricity today is widely viewed as a commodity. As a commodity, electricity is primarily bought and sold as both power and energy, with various attributes being traded in electricity markets. Competitive electricity markets have enabled a variety of wholesale electricity products and services to facilitate the sale and transmission of power. These involve both physical transactions (i.e., electricity is generated and sent to or taken off the grid), and financial transactions (i.e., the purchase and sale of electricity). Services have also arisen to provide transaction flexibility, and to manage (or hedge) the risks of various transactions. Some purchasers of electricity as a commodity do so solely for financial reasons. With the California (or Western) energy crisis of 2000 to 2001, the susceptibility of electricity markets to manipulation became evident. Enron and its affiliates were principally found liable for \"engaging in various gaming and market manipulation schemes,\" with an initial decision ordering the disgorgement of $1.6 billion in unjust profits. FERC continues to investigate allegations of energy market manipulation, with nine actions in FY2012 resulting in civil penalties of $148 million assessed, and disgorgement of unjust profits of another $121 million.", "Increases in the domestic production of natural gas (primarily due to hydraulic fracturing of gas shales) are causing a dramatic change in electric power production decisions.

Many in the energy industry believe that a structural change in the economics of natural gas use has begun.", "While coal is projected to retain the largest share of the electricity generation mix through 2035, analyses included in the Annual Energy Outlook 2012 ... anticipate its share declining as more generation comes from natural gas and renewable technologies. Coal's role as the preeminent source of electricity generation in the United States has lessened in recent years, declining from 49% of total electricity generation in 2007 to 42% in 2011.\u2026 Projected fuel prices and economic growth are key factors influencing the future electricity generation mix. The price of natural gas, coal's chief competitor, has dropped significantly in recent years due to the increase in domestic production of natural gas.", "The electric utility industry values diversity in fuel choice options since reliance on one fuel or technology can leave electricity producers vulnerable to price and supply volatility. However, an \"inverse relationship\" is developing for coal vs. natural gas as a power generation choice based on market economics alone, and policies which allow one fuel source to dominate could increase industry vulnerability to volatility.
