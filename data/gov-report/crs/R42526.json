{"id": "R42526", "title": "Federal Labor Relations Statutes: An Overview", "released_date": "2014-09-05T00:00:00", "summary": ["Since 1926, Congress has enacted three major laws that govern labor-management relations for private sector and federal employees. An issue for Congress is the effect of these laws on employers, workers, and the nation's economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that, in 2013, an estimated 14.5 million employees were union members. In the 113th Congress, more than 25 bills were introduced to amend federal labor relations statutes. The proposals ranged from repealing provisions that permit employers to require employees to join a union as a condition of employment to requiring mediation and, if necessary, binding arbitration of initial contract negotiation disputes. These legislative activities, and the significant number of employees affected by federal labor relations laws, illustrate the importance of labor relations issues to legislators and their constituents.", "The three major labor relations statutes in the United States are the Railway Labor Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. Each law governs a distinct population of the U.S. workforce.", "The Railway Labor Act (RLA) was enacted in 1926. Its coverage extends to railway and airline carriers, their employees, and unions. The RLA guarantees employees the right to organize and bargain collectively with their employers over conditions of work and protects them against unfair employer and union practices. It lays out specific procedures for selecting employee representatives and provides dispute resolution procedures that aim to resolve labor disputes between parties, with an emphasis on mediation and arbitration. The RLA provides multiple processes for dispute resolution, depending on whether the dispute is based on a collective bargaining issue or the application of an existing collective bargaining agreement.", "The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) was enacted in 1935. The NLRA's coverage extends to most other private sector employers that are not covered by the RLA. Like the RLA, the NLRA guarantees employees the right to organize and bargain collectively over conditions of employment and protects them against unfair employer and union activities. However, its dispute resolution system differs from the RLA's in that it is arguably more adversarial in nature; many disputes are resolved through adjudication, rather than through mediation and arbitration.", "The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) was enacted in 1978, and its coverage extends to most federal employees. The basic framework of the FSLMRS is similar to that of the NLRA; however, employee rights are more restricted under the FSLMRS, given the unique nature of their employer, the federal government. Federal employees have the right to organize and bargain collectively, but they cannot strike. Most federal employees cannot bargain over wages or benefits. Additionally, the President can exclude a federal agency or subdivision from coverage if the organization's primary work concerns national security."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Congress has enacted three major laws that govern labor-management relations.

It helped connect the coasts, making settlement of the western United States much easier. Farmers were able to ship their goods to cities hundreds of miles away, and consumers were able to purchase products made in factories across the nation. The railroad industry was also a major consumer of U.S. goods. It used over 75% of the steel produced in the United States and a large portion of the United States' extracted coal, and was the nation's primary employer.", "As the public began to depend on railroads and their regular availability, railroad workers also began to unionize. Because the nation grew dependent on railroads, labor-management disputes that grew into work stoppages adversely affected the nation's welfare.", "Enacted in 1926, the Railway Labor Act (RLA) continued a pattern of federal attempts at regulating labor relations in the industry. The act was the product of an agreement between industry and labor. The statute was intended to help maintain labor-management peace in the railway industry and thereby avoid work stoppages that could carry with them adverse economic and social effects. The act's five major purposes are to:", "prevent any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier; ensure employees the right to organize or join a labor union; ensure railway carriers and employees the right to select bargaining representatives without interference from the other party; provide timely settlement of disputes over rates of pay, rules, or working conditions; and provide timely settlement of disputes growing out of grievances or over interpretation or application of existing union contracts.", "To accomplish these goals, Congress established a system based on collective bargaining between labor and management, relying on mediation facilitated by the newly created National Mediation Board (NMB) and voluntary arbitration if neither collective bargaining nor mediation worked."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Amendments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "1934 Amendments", "paragraphs": ["The original RLA called for parties to establish by agreement special adjustment boards (SBAs) to resolve disputes over contract interpretation or application concerning changes in rates of pay, rules, or working conditions. These boards could be national, regional, or local in scope and would typically be composed of an equal number of carrier and employee representatives. If an adjustment board was unable to resolve a dispute because of a deadlock, the dispute could be referred to the Board of Mediation. In the 1934 amendments, Congress created the National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB), which has jurisdiction over contract interpretation and administration disputes that cannot be resolved through direct negotiations. If the NRAB is deadlocked, it selects a referee to make an award in the dispute. A referee is a neutral person who sits with the NRAB as a member and makes an award in the dispute at issue. Congress later replaced the Board of Mediation with the NMB, which can resolve disputes between parties concerning changes in rates of pay, rules, working conditions, and any other dispute not referable to NRAB.", "Congress also strengthened the RLA's provisions that allow carriers and employees to select representatives freely and without interference from each other. It added language specifically stating that employees have the right to organize and bargain collectively and added a provision requiring that a majority of employees in a craft or class must support a union before it is recognized as their representative. Additionally, the amendments prohibited carriers from denying or questioning an employee's right to organize or join a union and tasked the NMB with investigating representation disputes. The amendments also provided for both civil and criminal means to enforce the RLA's provisions.", "Congress explicitly prohibited carriers from unilaterally changing pay rates, rules, and working conditions and added a \"status quo\" provision, which prohibits changes to pay rates, rules, and working conditions for 30 days after parties are released from the NMB's services.

Although the airline industry was relatively new in 1936, Congress acknowledged that it was part of the national transportation system that was vital to the economic well-being of the nation and that it too would need mechanisms to assist in dispute resolution and avoiding work stoppages. Although the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which covers most private sector employees, was enacted in 1935, labor wanted airline carriers to be included under the RLA, because it believed the RLA's mediation/arbitration dispute resolution mechanisms provided more flexibility for the constantly changing, fledging industry.

It provides parties with a standard process for choosing a union to act as an employee representative in the collective bargaining process and details which individuals can participate in the process. Once a union is chosen, the RLA governs which subjects workers and unions can negotiate. The RLA also regulates how workers, carriers, and unions should behave towards each other during the union selection and collective bargaining processes and prohibits certain unfair actions.", "The RLA provides for several entities to administer and enforce its provisions. The National Mediation Board (NMB) is the primary agency charged with administration and enforcement of the act. It also provides mediation services to parties that cannot reach a resolution in a dispute. The National Railway Adjustment Board (NRAB) is an NMB tribunal that hears and decides (arbitrates) grievances in the railway industry. Additionally, in the railway industry, the RLA allows parties to a dispute to establish their own arbitration tribunals, known as Special Boards of Adjustment (SBAs), or a single party to request that the NMB create a Public Law Board (PLB) to arbitrate the dispute. Various System Boards of Adjustment (System Boards), created jointly by labor and management, arbitrate disputes in the airline carrier industry.
