It is projected to grow nearly 4% in 2004. These meager growth results under Fox contrastwith economic growth averaging over 5% in the previous six years. President Fox has been forcedto operate under austere budgets in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, reducing the funding for promisedhealth and education programs. Lacking majority support in Congress, Fox has been unable toobtain approval of major legislation, including a proposed tax reform and a proposed energy reformthat would permit greater private participation in the hydrocarbon and electricity sectors, althoughCongress did pass a social security reform in July 2004.

However, the U.S. trade balance with Mexico has shifted from a surplus of $1.3billion in 1994 to a generally growing deficit of $54.1 billion in 2003 (exports of $83.1 billion;imports of $137.2 billion), in part because of the late 1994 devaluation of the peso which madeMexican products cheaper. This change in the trade balance has caused some Members of Congressto question the benefits of NAFTA. Despite the deficit, Mexico is one of the fastest growing exportmarkets for the United States in recent years, and it became the second most important tradingpartner after Canada in 1999.", "The NAFTA agreement was negotiated in 1991 and 1992, side agreements on labor and environmental matters were completed in 1993; and the agreements were approved by the respectivelegislatures in late 1993 and went into force on January 1, 1994.

", "Functioning of NAFTA Institutions. Several NAFTA institutions mandated by the agreements have been functioning since 1994. The tripartiteCommission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC) was established in Montreal, Canada; and theCommission for Labor Cooperation (CLC) was established in Dallas, Texas. In addition, thebilateral Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC), located in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico;and the North American Development Bank (NADBank), headquartered in San Antonio, Texas,were created to promote and finance border environment projects along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Bush indicated a willingness to implement theprovision, but the U.S. Congress required additional safety provisions in the FY2002 Departmentof Transportation Appropriations Act ( P.L. 107-87 ). On November 27, 2002, with safety inspectorsand procedures in place, the Administration announced that it would begin the process that will openU.S. highways to Mexican truckers and buses, but environmental and labor groups went to court inearly December to block the action. On January 16, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit ruled that full environmental impact statements were required before Mexican trucks wouldbe allowed to operate on U.S. highways. On June 7, 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed thelower court decision brought by environmental and labor groups and agreed with the BushAdministration that an environmental impact statement is not required before Mexican trucks maygain access to U.S. highways.

OnMarch 12, 2004, the WTO dispute panel issued its final report, generally upholding U.S. claims andfinding that Telmex interconnection fees were above what cost-oriented rates should be.

Mexico also complains thatimports of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) sweeteners from the United States constitute dumping,and it imposed anti-dumping duties for some time, even though NAFTA and WTO disputeresolution panels upheld U.S. claims that the Mexican government colluded with the Mexican sugarand sweetener industries to restrict HFCS imports from the United States. In the last days of 2001,the Mexican Congress imposed a 20% tax on soft drinks made with corn syrup sweeteners to aid theailing domestic cane sugar industry. President Fox suspended the duties until September 30, 2002,in part because of U.S. objection to the tax and the devastating impact on HFCS and corn sales fromthe United States, but Mexico's Supreme Court overturned his action. In late 2002, the MexicanCongress extended the 20% tax on soft drinks made with HFCS.", "During 2003, there were various efforts to achieve a compromise that would increase Mexican exporters' access to the U.S. sugar market and U.S. exporters' access to the Mexican HFCS market,but no agreement was reached, and in late 2003 the Mexican Congress extended the 20% tax on softdrinks made with HFCS. In October 2003, Corn Products International, Inc., based in Illinois,announced that it was filing a claim for $325 million under NAFTA's investment provisions againstMexico for losses caused by the tax on HFCS-sweetened drinks, and Archer Daniels Midlands(ADM) said that it was planning similar action for over $100 million in damages. In November2003, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley introduced a bill ( S. 1952 )that would impose retaliatory tariffs on Mexican tequila and other agricultural products unlessMexico rescinded the tax on HFCS products, and in January 2004 he urged USTR to initiate WTOdispute settlement proceedings against Mexico's HFCS tax. On March 16, 2004, USTR announcedthat it was initiating WTO dispute settlement proceedings against Mexico's HFCS tax, and on June22, 2004, the United States formally requested that the WTO establish a dispute settlement panel toconsider the U.S. claims.

However, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that the standards of the law had not been met, andthe Federal Appeals Court in San Francisco sustained the ruling in July 2001. Under the BushAdministration, the Commerce Department ruled on December 31, 2002, that the dolphin-safe labelmay be applied if qualified observers certify that no dolphins were killed or seriously injured in thenetting process, but Earth Island Institute and other environmental groups filed suit to block themodification. On April 10, 2003, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Californiaenjoined the Commerce Department from modifying the standards for the dolphin-safe label.

In early March 2004, following theannouncement of new U.S. procedures that would exclude unhealthy or downer cattle from the foodchain, Mexico announced that it was resuming beef trade with the United States, with somerestrictions, and it expanded the list of eligible beef products in early April 2004.", "With respect to other issues, both countries have alleged dumping of beef and cattle; Mexico has alleged U.S. dumping of apples, cotton, and sorghum; and the United States has alleged Mexicandumping of tomatoes and steel, although many of these complaints have been resolved to someextent. Mexico as a NAFTA partner was exempted from the Bush Administration's imposition oftemporary safeguard tariffs on steel in March 2002. The United States has also claimed thatMexican sanitary standards have posed barriers to U.S. exports, and that Mexico's lax enforcementhas permitted widespread piracy of recording and software products. Mexico has objected to U.S.sanctions against third countries with investments in Cuba under the Cuban Liberty and DemocraticSolidarity Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-114 ), commonly called the Helms-Burton legislation. ", "In early October 2002, the U.S.-Mexico working group on agriculture dealt with major agricultural issues, including Mexico's recent anti-dumping decisions on apples, rice, swine, andbeef, and safeguard actions on potatoes. In January 2003, the countries agreed to permit Mexicansafeguard measures against U.S. imports of chicken legs and thighs, and in July 2003, thesesafeguard measures were extended until 2008, with tariffs declining each year. In October 2003,Mexico demanded further consultations on a U.S. request for a WTO dispute panel to rule onMexico's imposition of anti-dumping duties on U.S. beef and rice imports, but a panel was formedin February 2004 and after a requested delay is expected to make a ruling in March 2005.

Mexico regularly voicesconcern about alleged abuses suffered by Mexican workers in the United States, and for the loss oflife and hardships suffered by Mexican migrants as they utilize increasingly dangerous routes andmethods to circumvent tighter border controls. Mexico benefits from illegal migration in at least twoways: (1) it is a \"safety valve\" that dissipates the political discontent that could arise from higherunemployment in Mexico; and (2) it is a source of remittances by workers in the United States tofamilies in Mexico, estimated to be about $10 billion per year.", "One of the main U.S. mechanisms for controlling illegal immigration is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-603 ).

At the same time, Mexico and theUnited States formalized consultations through the Border Liaison Mechanisms, issued a BinationalStudy on Migration in 1997 that found that unauthorized migration carries costs for both countries,and pursued a Border Safety Campaign to reduce violence on the border through public informationcampaigns, search and rescue programs, and bilateral cooperation.", "Congress passed two major immigration reform measures in 1996 to control illegal immigration and to limit the eligibility of aliens for federal programs. One was the Illegal Immigration Reformand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of the Omnibus Consolidated AppropriationsAct for FY1997 ( H.R. 3610 / P.L. 104-208 ). The other was the 1996 welfare law entitledthe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ( H.R. 3734 / P.L. 104-193 ). The first measure sought to control illegal immigration by adding 1,000 BorderPatrol agents per year for five years (FY1997-FY2001), along with additional personnel, equipment,and procedures.

During floor consideration on July 15, 2003, the House approved Amendment 27 proposed by Representative McKeon thatexpresses in Section 744 the sense of Congress that the U.S. government should encourage theMexican government to work closely with the Mexican Supreme Court to persuade the Court toreconsider its October 2001 ruling so that the possibility of life imprisonment in the United Stateswill not have an adverse effect on the timely extradition of criminal suspects from Mexico to theUnited States. ", "Consular ID Cards. In floor action on July 15, 2003, the House voted 226-198 to accept Amendment 17 by Representative John Hostettler thatwould establish in Section 232 a series of restrictions on the issuance of consular identification cardsby foreign missions. In recent years, the Mexican consulates have been issuing matr\u00c3\u00adcula consularcards for identity purposes, and they have been increasingly accepted in the United States insituations where proof of identity is required, such as for establishing banking accounts andobtaining credit cards and transferring funds from the United States to Mexico. Critics argue thatthe cards are used primarily by illegal aliens seeking to obtain benefits not achieved through regularimmigration law and procedures, and that they might facilitate money-laundering and terroristactivity. The amendment would have required that foreign missions issue consular identificationcards only to bona fide citizens of the country as verified by birth certificates, voter IDs, andpassports; that card recipients be required to notify the mission of any change of address; thatautomated records be kept by the missions to prevent duplicate or fradulent issuance; that recordsbe subject to audit by the United States; and that the United States be notified of each issuance,including the name and address. In the event that a foreign mission has issued consular ID cards inviolation of these provisions, it could be required to suspend the issuance of cards; and in the eventof noncompliance, the State Department would suspend the issuance of immigrant or nonimmigrantvisas, or both, to nationals of that country until it was in compliance with the requirements. Supporters of the amendment argued that the issuance of the cards was out of control and needed tobe controlled. Opponents argued that it was an attack on the Mexican identity card and persons ofHispanic heritage, and that the requirements were onerous and excessive.", "Rural Development. When the Senate considered S. 925 on July 10, 2003, it adopted an amendment offered by Senator Reid to provide$100 million in assistance to Mexico to deal with the existing rural development crisis in thecountry. The Senate did not complete action on S. 925 in 2003, and there is no similar provision inthe Senate bill (S. 2144) reported out by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authorizing Amendment of Mandates of Border Environment Cooperation Commission and North American Development Bank (H.R. 254 / P.L. 108-215)", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 254 was introduced on January 8, 2003, to authorize amendment of the mandates of the jointly established Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) and theNorth American Development Bank (NADBank). The authorized amendments would permit theNADBank to make grants and below-market-rate loans in the U.S.-Mexico border region, with thedefined border region being expanded to extend to 300 kilometers into Mexico from the border,while remaining 100 kilometers on the U.S. side. This was in keeping with a March 2002 agreementby Presidents Bush and Fox in Monterrey, Mexico, to broaden the mandate of the NADBank and toexpand its loan portfolio, especially in support of water conservation projects.

The sponsors of the amendment argued that the existing regulations were working effectively andthat they had the support of the Administration. Opponents of the amendment argued that theTreasury regulations were too lax in that they permitted the use of documents that are easily forged,that might be used by terrorists, and that are largely used by persons who are illegally in the UnitedStates. After consideration of other amendments, the overall measure was passed by the House onSeptember 22, 2004, thereby restoring previous authorities with respect to consular ID cards.
