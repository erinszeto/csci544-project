The act provides that domestic law prevails over conflicting provisions of WTO agreements and prohibits private remedies based on alleged violations of these agreements. As a result, provisions of WTO agreements and WTO panel and Appellate Body reports adopted by the WTO Members that are in conflict with federal law do not have domestic legal effect unless and until Congress or the executive branch, as the case may be, takes action to modify or remove the conflicting statute, regulation, or regulatory action. Violative state laws may be withdrawn by the state or, in rare circumstances, invalidated through legal action by the federal government.", "The URAA also contains requirements for agencies to follow where a change in a regulation or the issuance of a new agency determination in a trade remedy proceeding is needed to comply with a WTO decision and existing law may be sufficient to carry out the action.", "While the URAA prohibits private rights of action based on Uruguay Round agreements, plaintiffs, in cases brought under other statutes, have argued that the agency actions they are challenging in court are inconsistent with a WTO agreement or a WTO decision and should conform with U.S. WTO obligations. Although courts have deemed WTO decisions to be persuasive, they have also held that they are not binding on the United States, U.S. agencies, or the judiciary, leaving the issue of whether and how the United States complies in a particular WTO proceeding to the executive branch.", "Legislation introduced in recent Congresses generally reflected congressional concerns that the WTO Appellate Body had interpreted WTO agreements in an overly broad manner to the detriment of the United States and that the executive branch had in some cases too readily used existing statutory authorities to comply with these decisions, particularly where U.S. trade remedies were involved. Legislation particularly focused on WTO decisions in which the U.S. use of \"zeroing\" in antidumping proceedings was successfully challenged."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA)", "paragraphs": ["The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, initiated in 1986 under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), concluded in 1994 with the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement). The WTO Agreement, which entered into force January 1, 1995, requires any country that wishes to be a WTO Member to accept all of the multilateral trade agreements negotiated during the Round. The Uruguay Round package of agreements not only carries forward long-standing GATT obligations (such as according goods of other parties nondiscriminatory treatment, not placing tariffs on goods that exceed negotiated or \"bound\" rates, generally refraining from imposing quantitative restrictions such as quotas and embargoes on imports and exports, and avoiding injurious subsidies), but also expands on these obligations in new agreements.", "The Uruguay Round package also includes the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (Dispute Settlement Understanding or DSU), which applies to disputes between WTO Members arising under virtually all WTO agreements. Dispute settlement is administered by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), an entity consisting of all WTO Members. The dispute settlement process consists of consultations, panels and possible appeals, and adoption by the DSB of the resulting panel and appellate reports. If the defending Member is found to have violated a WTO obligation, it must implement the decision within an established \"reasonable period of time.\" If the Member has not complied within the established time period, the prevailing Member may seek compensation from the non-complying Member or obtain authorization from the DSB to impose retaliatory measures, such as increased tariffs on selected products exported from the non-complying Member's territory.", "Congress approved and implemented the WTO Agreement and the other agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round in the Uruguay Round Agreement Act (URAA). In enacting the URAA, Congress comprehensively dealt with the legal effect in the United States of both the Uruguay Round agreements and WTO decisions adverse to the United States resulting from dispute settlement proceedings under the new DSU. The URAA addresses the relationship of WTO agreements to federal and state law and prohibits private remedies based on alleged violations of WTO agreements. It also requires the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to keep Congress informed of disputes challenging U.S. laws once a dispute panel is established, any U.S. appeal is filed, and a panel or Appellate Body report is circulated to WTO Members.

To this end, the URAA approves the agreements and contains provisions \"necessary or appropriate\" to implement them, including provisions setting out new and revised authorities as well as any needed repeals. In addition, Section 102 of the URAA, as well as its legislative history, indicates that domestic law supersedes any inconsistent provisions of WTO agreements approved and implemented in the URAA and that WTO decisions involving U.S. laws or regulatory actions that are successfully challenged in the WTO do not have direct or automatic legal effect in the United States.

The proceedings may be initiated on the basis of a domestic industry petition, executive or legislative branch request, or its own motion. If injury is found, the President may temporarily restrict imports or take other measures to remedy the harm to U.S. firms.", "Antidumping and countervailing duty investigations, which are authorized in Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, may be initiated by petition or on the motion of the Department of Commerce, and involve determinations by both the Commerce Department and the USITC. DOC determines whether the product under investigation is dumped, that is, sold in the United States at less than fair value, or subsidized by a foreign government. The USITC determines whether the dumped or subsidized imports cause material injury or threat of material injury to a domestic industry. If dumping and injury are found, antidumping duties will be imposed on imports of the product under investigation in the amount of the dumping margin. If subsidization and injury are found, countervailing duties will be imposed on the imported good in the amount of the net subsidy conferred.", "In the event of an adverse WTO decision involving one of the above-described DOC or USITC determinations, Section 129 requires that, upon USTR request, the affected agency must first determine if it may take action to comply with the WTO decision under existing law. If it finds that it may do so, the USTR may request the agency involved to issue a determination\u2014referred to by the Commerce Department as a \"Section 129 Determination\" and the USITC as a \"Section 129 Consistency Determination\"\u2014that would render the agency's action \"not inconsistent with the findings\" of the WTO panel or Appellate Body. The statute also requires consultation with Congress at various stages of the implementation process.", "Where an antidumping or countervailing duty order is no longer supported by an affirmative injury determination\u2014that is, where the USITC no longer finds material injury or threat from the dumped or subsidized imports\u2014the USTR may direct DOC to revoke the order in whole or in part. Where a new DOC determination is issued, the USTR may direct DOC to implement the new determination in whole or in part.

Section 129 determinations issued by the USITC and the Commerce Department to comply with WTO decisions are also reviewable under this statute. These cases are heard in the U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT), which has exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions brought under Section 516A. The USCIT's decisions may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, whose decisions are reviewable by the U.S. Supreme Court. ", "Federal courts must hold a final agency determination in an antidumping or countervailing duty proceeding or a Section 129 Determination unlawful if it is found to be \"unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" To determine whether an agency determination is in accordance with law, the court employs the two-step analysis for review of agency implementation of a statutory provision set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council . First, the court, using tools of statutory construction, determines whether Congress has clearly spoken to the issue at hand. Second, if the underlying statute is silent or ambiguous, the court decides whether the agency's construction of the statute is permissible and will defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute provided it is reasonable. It has also been argued that, in considering whether an agency construction is reasonable, the court should apply the canon of construction articulated by the Supreme Court in 1804 in Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy . This canon guides that where a statute does not require a specific interpretation (that is, it permits more than one interpretation), it should be interpreted consistently with U.S. international obligations \u2014in this context, a provision of a WTO agreement either by itself or as interpreted in one or more WTO decisions. When read with C hevron , the Charming Betsy argument would come into play only where a statute is unclear as to the matter at hand; where the statute is unambiguous, the statutory language prevails and the question of international obligation would no longer be pertinent.", "Because the underlying cause of action in domestic legal challenges to the agency actions described above is based in the Tariff Act and not on a provision of a WTO agreement, courts have not viewed Section 102(c) of the URAA as preventing them from hearing a WTO-based argument in these challenges. When faced with such arguments, some federal courts have deemed WTO decisions to be \"persuasive\" or a source of useful reasoning to inform a court's decision, but have stated that WTO decisions are not binding on the United States, U.S. agencies, or the judiciary. More commonly, however, federal courts have made clear that, given the statutory scheme established in the URAA for implementing adverse WTO decisions, questions as to whether the United States should comply with an adverse WTO decision and what the extent of U.S. compliance should be are matters falling within the province of the executive branch. As a result, in ruling on whether an agency action is reasonable, courts have declined to base their decision making on a WTO decision adverse to the United States where the executive branch has not taken the necessary domestic action to comply.", "The issue of the interaction of Chevron and Charming Betsy appears to have arisen most frequently in court cases challenging Commerce Department antidumping determinations in which dumping margins were calculated with the use of \"zeroing,\" a practice under which the department considers only sales below fair market value\u2014generally the price in the exporting country\u2014and assigns a zero value to sales at or above this price. The U.S. practice, which is alleged to improperly create or inflate dumping margins, has been successfully challenged in numerous WTO dispute settlement proceedings as violative of the WTO Antidumping Agreement. At the same time, U.S. courts, using the Chevron standard of review, have regularly held that, although the U.S. antidumping statute does not unambiguously require zeroing, the Commerce Department's interpretation of the statute as allowing the practice is a permissible one. To respond to these adverse WTO decisions, the Commerce Department used Section 123(g) authority to prospectively abandon the practice in original antidumping investigations in early 2007 and has recently proposed modifications in the use of zeroing in subsequent phases of U.S. antidumping proceedings. In addition, where a specific antidumping order has been challenged in a WTO proceeding, the Commerce Department has utilized Section 129(c) authority to issue a new antidumping determination in which the dumping margin was calculated without the use of zeroing and, as a result, has either amended or, in some cases, revoked the antidumping order involved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Legislation introduced in recent Congresses generally reflected congressional concerns that the WTO Appellate Body had interpreted WTO agreements in an overly broad manner to the detriment of the United States and that the executive branch had in some cases too readily used existing statutory authorities to comply with these decisions, particularly where U.S. trade remedies were involved.
