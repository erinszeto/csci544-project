The 2008-2009 election marks the first presidential transition in the post-9/11 era, and is of concern to many national security observers. While changes in administration during U.S. involvement in national security related activities are not unique to the 2008-2009 election, many observers suggest that the current security climate and recent acts of terrorism by individuals wishing to influence national elections and change foreign policies portend a time of increased risk to the current presidential transition period. Whether the enemies of the United States choose to undertake action that may harm the nation's security interests during the 2008-2009 election, or the new President experiences a relatively peaceful period during the transition, many foreign and domestic policy and security challenges will await the new Administration. How the new President recognizes and responds to these challenges will depend heavily on the planning and learning that occurs prior to the inauguration. Actions can be taken by the outgoing President and President-elect that may ameliorate decision-making activities in the new administration.

On a given day the outgoing administration has the ability to change the policies of a nation and possibly affect the international security environment, yet the following day the President and the national security leadership team are replaced by a new set of leaders who may have very different strategy and policy goals. This political dynamic, coupled with the inherent uncertainty accompanying a presidential transfer of power, may provide a target of opportunity that may be too enticing to resist by those who wish to harm U.S. security interests. Unlike other man-made incidents that may occur with little warning, the presidential transition offers a broadly defined time frame in which an enemy of the United States may decide to undertake an incident of national security significance with the hope of manipulating the electoral process or changing the nation's foreign and domestic policies.", "Presidential transitions during times of U.S. involvement in military operations and national security-related activities are not unique to the 2008-2009 presidential transition period (see Appendix A ). However, based on the current international security environment and recent attempts to disrupt transfers of power in other countries, many observers see the United States as lurching toward a period of uncertainty and increased risk (see Appendix B ). While the mere presence of a upcoming presidential transition does not ensure an incident of national security significance will occur, security experts argue that this window of potential risk is not lost on the enemies of the United States. At present, the intelligence community assesses that \"Al-Qaida will increase the frequency, sophistication, timeliness and Western targeting of its propaganda statements as the United States advances toward the presidential election.\" While many terrorism experts are concerned about the internal and external threats to the United States during the presidential transition period, the intelligence community is \"uncertain what impact [terrorist propaganda] statements will have on the Western Muslim community and other individuals who are Al-Qaeda's primary target audience.\"", "According to a presidential transition-related report provided to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by the Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC), \"briefings, research, and recent history have provided an appreciation of the potential vulnerabilities during transition periods.

Bush,", "I worry about the period of vulnerability between the time we have nominees for each party through and just after the inauguration of a new President. I think that's a particular period of vulnerability, because of what we know about Al Qaeda's attempts to influence the elections in Spain. We've seen the attacks after [author name scrubbed] took over as Prime Minister in the U.K. We see in the 2004 election where they were issuing videos days before the [United States] election, including bin Laden talking about the streets in the United States running with blood.

Whether the enemies of the United States choose to undertake action that may harm national security interests during this period of transition or the new President experiences a relative peaceful period shortly after entering office, many national security issues will be awaiting the new Administration. How the newly elected president recognizes and responds to these challenges will \"depend heavily upon the planning and learning that takes place during the transition from one Administration to another.\" During recent presidential transitions, the current and incoming administrations and Congress have traditionally undertaken numerous activities to facilitate a smooth transfer of executive branch power. Some of the actions often taken during presidential transitions include", "consulting with government and private sector experts who have presidential transition expertise, providing information to the President-elect after the election and prior to the inauguration, offering operational briefings on ongoing national security matters to prospective presidential nominees and their staff, preparing briefings books and policy memos detailing the issues of most concern to the current administration, and expediting security clearances for president-elect transition team members.", "Other activities that the current and incoming administrations and Congress may wish to consider undertaking during the presidential transition period include", "undertaking public outreach efforts to discuss possible risks to the nation, involving the national security representatives of presidential hopefuls in all transition-related discussions, establishing joint advisory councils responsible for addressing all transition-related risks, requiring the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to undertake efforts to support the nation's awareness of risks, reflecting the national security priorities of the new Administration in the 2009 budget, passing the FY2009 appropriations without undue delay; quickly assigning newly elected and existing Members of Congress to committees focused on national security, holding hearings comprised of national security experts to gather ideas on prospective U.S. national security policies and goals, and holding hearings soon after the inauguration of the new President to determine the Administration's national security-related priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Security Issues the Next Administration Is Likely to Encounter", "paragraphs": ["The next Administration is likely to face many national security challenges on taking office.

However, such acts at anytime during the presidential transition period could have desired and unintended effects on the presidential election and resulting policies. Conversely, while many national security experts speculate that Al Qaeda, other extremist groups, and some foreign powers may see the presidential transition period as a desirable time to undertake action against U.S. interests, the mere fact that such activity occurs may not necessarily indicate that the act was committed with the desire to manipulate the results of the election.

Also, the organizations that existed during the last presidential transition and the new agencies may have employed many new personnel who are not well-versed in addressing matters of national security during times of presidential transition. Additionally organizations that pre-date the attacks of September 11, 2001, and that previously had national security responsibilities, may be asked to devote additional attention and resources to presidential transition-related issues. Based on the length of time between the previous presidential transition, the departure of senior political and career officials, and the influx of new personnel addressing national security issues, it is possible that some federal agencies may not be properly anticipating the attention required or resources needed to support the incoming Administration's preparation and policy familiarization efforts.

Chairperson Soaries stated that DHS and the federal interagency structure provide assistance to federal, state, and local government's by collaborating on a plan to address voting options should a terrorist attack occur around the time of the election. Many security experts argue that federal, state, and local election-contingency planning and coordination should occur during the early phases of the transition period. It is further suggested that, barring such discussions, the issuance of general guidelines, or a genuine effort toward collaboration, the prospects for electoral chaos might occur should an incident of national security significance take place just before or on the date of election.", "During all phases of the presidential transition process, many national security experts suspect the federal government will receive information that heightens the risks to U.S. national security interests that may be, in part, based on activities by enemies of the United States attempting to influence the upcoming election. Should such a heightened risk environment occur, some observers suggest that one of the best ways to meet this challenge is by a showing of national unity among the outgoing Administration and individuals vying for the presidency. To support a collegial and collaborative environment, the Homeland Security Advisory Council (HSAC) suggests the nominees issue a joint statement addressing potential threats to the nation or in response to an incident of national significance. Some foreign policy experts suggest joint statements and activities by the current President and the prospective Presidents-elect take place with regularity to put forth a common voice to both the American public and the enemies of the United States that security issues will be addressed in a unified and coordinated manner.", "Throughout the presidential transition period the federal government may wish to undertake outreach and education efforts directed at the American public. A public awareness campaign, led by the federal government, discussing a need for citizens to be more-vigilant during the election period and providing insight into what the federal government will do in the event of an incident prior to election day may provide confidence to a concerned voting public. Activities such as this may prove useful in preparing the voting public to be aware of the possibility of an incident of national security significance occurring during the presidential transition period and also may lower the anxiety of citizens planning on participating in the electoral process. With respect to security-related issues in the homeland, many observers argue that awareness on the part of the citizenry offers the best opportunity to provide indicators of anomalies that might be indicative of a group's preparation to undertake criminal activity to affect the presidential election process. To this degree, the DHS HSAC contends that continuous interaction with the media and the public regarding potential threats during this time period will maximize the chances of having a nation prepared for harmful activities that may occur during any phase of the presidential transition. The DHS HSAC specifically opined:", "It is important that the American public become engaged in understanding the unique vulnerabilities posed by this transition period. This will require public education and media engagement during this critical period in our history. Before, during, and after the transition, the public must learn about the choices faced by the Nation, communities, families, and individuals.

Generally speaking, as the campaign for President progresses through the spring and leading up to the presidential conventions, relatively few leading candidates will emerge as viable contenders for gaining the nomination of a given political party. The current Administration could bring this relatively few number of individuals, and their designated senior national security staff, into briefings and discussions regarding national security issues that will likely be of concern to incoming Administrations.

There are over 7,000 federal government leadership, management, and support positions that are non-competitively filled by political appointees. Some observers suggest that many of the 7,000 positions have, as part of their primary function, national security responsibilities. Should large numbers of political appointees depart in the months preceding the inauguration, the federal government would likely rely on Senior Executive Service personnel, career diplomats, senior military officers, and senior general-schedule employees for continuity of operations, leadership, and management of most national security related activities.

As a proponent of converting some of the federal government's national security leadership positions to career civil servants, DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Schneider noted \"it's important to realize that major terrorist attacks, both here and abroad, are often launched shortly before or after national elections or inaugurations. By promoting dedicated civil servants who've proven their mettle, we're not only building for the future, but are helping ensure that during the transition, as the perceived weakness grows, our Department is prepared.\" While the promotion of civil servants into federal agency deputy positions is welcomed by many national security observers, others are concerned with the selection process that supports this activity.

Some suggest that the exercises should focus on catastrophic issues; nuclear terrorism (at home or abroad), major natural disaster, major offensive against deployed military forces, or some other significant national security incident. Others opine that the most likely non-catastrophic scenarios should be used as a basis of these exercises: increased threat environment, detonation of an improvised explosive device in the homeland, or some less significant incident.
