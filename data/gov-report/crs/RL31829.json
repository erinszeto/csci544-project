For homeland security, the Housemeasure was slightly below the President's request, mainly because of the denial of funding for theWhite House's proposed emergency fund, while the Senate increased homeland security by about$770 million to $5.14 billion. H.R. 1559 provided $3.2 billion for airline industry reliefwhile S. 762 included an estimated $3.5 billion.

As passed, H.R. 1559 appropriates most of the funds to regular appropriations accounts. However, it also sets up a new$15.7 billion Iraq Freedom Fund to give DOD additional flexibility. Within the new fundestablished for Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction, the conference bill appropriates funds to thePresident, giving him the flexibility to allocate those funds to various agencies, including theDepartment of Defense. In response to Administration concerns, the conference version eliminatedrestrictions that would have prevented DOD from administering any of these funds. The enactedappropriation, however, provides that the funds are to be designated as bilateral economic assistanceand spent consistent with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.

Under the proposal, most of the fundswould be have been placed in emergency response funds which the President, the Secretaries ofDefense, Justice, and Homeland Security could draw upon. Purposes for which the resources wouldbe used were justified in general terms, but extensive discretion would have been allotted toexecutive officials.

The Iraqi Relief and ReconstructionFund is the exception where Congress gives the President flexibility to allocate funds to five federalagencies, including the Department of Defense.

The White House suggested thatSenate language allocating defense funds to specific accounts might \"slow timely and effectingfunding of urgent needs.\" The Administration raised the same concern regarding House text thatallocated homeland security resources to specific activities rather than placing the money in a centralfund. This, the White House claimed, would \"hinder\" the Homeland Department's Secretary fromapplying the funds to the most critical threats. The executive further expressed concerns about theHouse bill which directed that Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund resources be managed by theState Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), removingPresidential flexibility over involving multiple agencies in reconstruction operations.

In the enacted supplemental, Congress increases imminent danger pay and family separation allowancesfor those forces deployed for the Iraqi conflict, an increase in compensation that was not proposedby DOD.

Senator Durbin, who originallyproposed higher levels, emphasized that these levels have not been adjusted since 1991 after the firstGulf War in 1991. The levels adopted represent a compromise between higher levels originallyproposed by Senator Durbin and those offered by Senator Stevens. (28)", "These higher levels could offset some of the difficulties experienced by activated reservists serving longer than anticipated tours, an issue of concern to Congress.

(33)", "The adequacy of the supplemental may depend on how many U.S. troops need to be kept in Iraq now that hostilities have ended. Assessing the adequacy of the supplemental for the remainder ofthe year (or the potential cost in FY2004) is difficult because DOD has not provided its assumptionsabout troop levels. That may become possible when DOD submits reports of its expenditures forthe war, as well as a financial plan covering all of FY2003.

H.R. 1559 , as approved, includes$4.52 billion in additional aid to countries and regional programs, about $180 millionless than requested. Nearly all of this reduction, however, comes from Congress'decision not to fund the President's $150 million emergency account for complexcrises. In most other cases, the Administration will be able to allocate these foreignaid resources has it had intended. Congress earmarked funding at the requestedlevels for Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan, while adding resources for Afghanistanand the Philippines (see Table 6 ). Turkey may receive \"not to exceed\" $1 billion,aid that is conditioned on a requirement for the Secretary of State to certify thatTurkey is cooperating with the United States in Operation Iraqi Freedom, includingthe facilitation of moving humanitarian aid into Iraq, and has not unilaterallydeployed forces in northern Iraq.

Throughout the supplemental request, in both thedefense and Iraq reconstruction/international assistance sections, the President soughtauthorities that would maximize flexibility in responding to fluid and rapidlychanging demands. Among the most significant authorities affecting the use offoreign aid funds were:", "Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund -- The Administration's budget justification for the White House managed $2.44 billion Fund offered onlybroad purposes for which the money would be used and divided the money into threegeneral categories. Iraq reconstruction plans submitted by the State Department toCongress offered some details on specific sectors, how the U.S. would respond, andthe timing of actions over the next year. Funding amounts for each activity, however,were not provided, as is usually the case with foreign aid justifications. Moreover,since the funds would be appropriated into a Presidential fund, it would be possiblefor the White House delegate the resources to any agency, including the DefenseDepartment, for reconstruction implementation. As noted above, this prospect ofDOD management raised disputes within the Administration and the Americaninternational NGO community, with critics arguing that it would be inappropriate forthe military to control a civilian operation. The proposal to establish a central Fundmost closely resembled how the Administration programmed U.S. relief for victimsof Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1999 and Bosnia reconstruction efforts in1996. In both cases Congress appropriated money into special funds, but placedthem under the control of USAID and added numerous directives over how portionsof resources should be used and various notifications for informing Congress inadvance of committing the money. Moreover, the supplemental request for theRelief and Reconstruction Fund would make the appropriations available\"notwithstanding any provision of law.\" This would remove any of the numerousrestrictions and conditions that generally apply to U.S. foreign assistance, includingprovisions relating to human rights, proliferation, government legitimacy, contractnegotiations, among others. Waivers of these restrictions are generally applied onlyto humanitarian programs. Congress rejected a similar request last year forsupplemental economic and military aid to the front-line states in the war onterrorism. ", "U.S. Emergency Fund for Complex Crises -- For many years, Administrations have asked Congress for various types of contingency resources thatcan be drawn upon immediately to address unanticipated foreign policy emergencies. Except in the case of humanitarian situations, however, Congress has been reluctantto support such requests, stating that the President has other mechanisms and specialauthorities for temporarily \"borrowing\" funds from other aid accounts over whichCongress can more closely maintain scrutiny and consult in advance as the purposesof the transfers. The President's $100 million FY2004 request to create the CrisesFund had already raised concerns among some Members during hearings on nextyear's budget request. ", "Transfer of funds among different accounts -- The supplemental proposed that up to $200 million of international assistance, StateDepartment money, and the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund could betransferred between the accounts for any purpose. Longstanding foreign aid lawsplace percentage caps on the amount that can be taken from most accounts (10%) andhow much the receiving account can increase (20%). (58) Annual Foreign Operationsappropriations further require the President to consult and justify the transfer inadvance with House and Senate Appropriations Committees. In some circumstances,the Administration's supplemental proposal could have resulted in transfersexceeding the percentage caps. The request further did not require any congressionalnotification or consultation.", "As noted above, the enacted supplemental establishes the Relief and Reconstruction Fund proposed by the President, but with added oversightmechanisms put in place. While the President may apportion resources directly toDOD, as well as the Departments of State, Treasury, Health and Human Resources,and USAID, the Iraq Fund falls under the authority of existing foreign aid laws. H.R. 1559 also adds several reporting requirements, as mentionedabove, and requires notification 5 days in advance of any Fund obligations. Theenacted supplemental further deletes appropriations for the President's emergencyfund for foreign crises and limits to $100 million the amount that can be transferredamong the various aid accounts.", "Costs of Iraq Reconstruction and the Impact on Other Aid Programs. Like the costs of military operations, it isnearly impossible to estimate what the longer-term expenses of humanitarian reliefand reconstruction in Iraq will be. The Administration's $3.5 billion included in thesupplemental request represented a general projection of needs over the next 12months. But State Department activity justifications cautioned that the timetable wastentative, dependent largely on the extent of damage that resulted from the conflictand how future assessments might alter aid priorities. Some believed thatreconstruction needs beyond this initial allotment would be met largely throughproceeds from the sale of Iraqi oil and the release of frozen assets. The internationalaid community is currently discussing how post-conflict relief efforts will proceed,but there is a great deal of uncertainty over the Administration's intentions and theactual final outcome. How soon and in what amounts Iraq might gain access toborrowing from the International Financial Institutions will also be a factor in howmuch additional resources will be needed or expected from the United States. (59)", "In the meantime USAID and the State Department have been drawing resources for Iraq from emergency refugee and disaster relief accounts, and from othereconomic aid programs that had been intended for other countries and purposes. Asof March 25, USAID had utilized an estimated $506 million, including drawdownsfrom the Child Survival and Health (CS/H), Development Assistance (DA), andEconomic Support Fund (ESF) accounts. For Child Survival and Developmentprograms, amounts diverted to Iraq contingency activities represented nearly 8% ofFY2003 appropriations. The supplemental request included about $410 million foreither replenishing CH/H, DA, and ESF accounts, or increasing disaster and refugeeresources so that future \"borrowings\" might be avoided and adequate funds wouldbe available for contingencies that might arise later in the year in other regions. Butthe supplemental did not appear to fully cover USAID transfers already made for Iraqprograms. Moreover, the supplemental provided \"up to $200 million may be used\"out of the Relief and Reconstruction Fund to repay these accounts. This discretionarylanguage left the final decision up to the White House as to whether these fundswould be available for the purposes and programs for which they were originallyintended.", "The conference agreement on H.R. 1559 adds substantial amounts, as noted above, for replenishing foreign aid accounts from which money has beendrawn for Iraq operations. The enacted supplemental provides over $900 million torestore funds for several programs, including the addition of $369 million in foodassistance that had not been requested.", "Country Assistance. The Administration asked not only for funds to assist coalition partners and nations thatface significant economic and political risks due to the Iraq conflict, but also toaugment support for a broader set of countries cooperating in the global war onterrorism. Some questioned whether a supplemental appropriation intended toprovide resources specifically related to the Iraq situation should include nearly $700million for this latter group, especially since Congress approved in mid-FebruaryFY2003 money for this purpose ( P.L. 108-7 ). Among the countries covered by therequest, but which are outside the conflict in Iraq were:", "Afghanistan -- The Administration proposed $325 million to\"meet immediate shortfalls\" in Afghanistan's FY2003 program, including resourcesfor the Kabul-Kandahr-Herat road, budget support for the Afghan government,President Karzai's protective detail, demining, and military training and equipmentcosts. Although the Administration did not submit an official FY2003 Afghan aidrequest, Congress increased assistance to over $300 million.", "Pakistan -- The supplemental proposed an additional $175 million in military aid to strengthen Pakistan's ability to track and disable terroristsoperating in its own territory and $25 million for better bordersecurity.", "Colombia -- Included in the supplemental request was $71 million in military and counter-narcotics assistance for supporting Colombia'sunified campaign against drug cartels and terrorists. The proposal also included anadditional $34 million of DOD funds for narcotics interdiction operations. In theFY2003 Foreign Operations Appropriation, Congress approved $700 million for theAndean Counter-narcotics Initiative for Colombia and other countries in the region,$31 million less than the President had requested.", "Palestinians -- The request would extend $50 million to support Middle East peace objectives generally, and specifically for humanitarianactivities in the West Bank and Gaza and for Palestinian civil reforms. Congress hadappropriated in August 2002 a similar $50 million package, together with $200million for Israel, in the FY2002 Supplemental Appropriation. President Bush chosenot to spend the funds because they were part of a much larger appropriation forprograms he had not requested. Instead, he amended the FY2003 Foreign Operationsrequest to include the Palestinian and Israeli funds but Congress did not increaseoverall appropriations to accommodate these additions.", "Philippines -- The $30 million in military support would allow the Philippines to upgrade its counterterrorism capabilities. Like the Palestinianfunds above, Congress provided $30 million for the Philippines in the FY2002supplemental which the President chose not to spend.", "Slovenia -- Not a member of the coalition, Slovenia would receive $5 million in military assistance in recognition of its efforts in providingaccess and overflight rights in Operating Enduring Freedom and contributing to theAfghan National Army and demining program.", "Beyond this list, some questioned the Administration's $1 billion request for Turkey that could be converted into as much as $8.5 billion in loans. The UnitedStates had negotiated with the Turkish government for months over allowing thedeployment of U.S. forces in Turkey for military operations for a second front innorther Iraq. Reportedly, the United States offered a $6 billion aid package thatcould be leveraged into $26 billion in combined grants and loans. On March 1,however, the Turkish parliament rejected the U.S. request to base troops foroperations in Iraq and the United States withdrew the aid offer. Turkey's governmenthas subsequently granted U.S. overflight rights for the Iraq campaign. TheAdministration justifies the $1 billion request on the basis of Turkey's role as an allyand frontline state in the war on terrorism, and for the significant political andeconomic risks faced by Ankara due to the Iraq conflict.", "As noted above, the enacted supplemental, for the most part, supports the President's foreign aid allocations for requested countries. Conditions are added tofunds for Turkey but amendments to eliminate or reduce the $1 billion package failedin the House. H.R. 1559 , as approved, however, will require theAdministration to make some economic aid reductions for some countries andprograms not earmarked, possibly including those for the Palestinians, Djibouti,Turkey, or the Middle East Partnership Initiative.", "DOD Authorities to Provide Military Aid. Under sections relating to Defense Department funds andauthorities, the supplemental proposed two items that drew particular congressionalattention. The key issue was whether they infringed on congressional oversight andthe State Department's traditional role in directing foreign aid policy and resourceallocations. They were both similar to proposals made last year in the FY2002supplemental that focused on the war on terrorism and were closely scrutinized byCongress. ", "The first would provide $1.4 billion for the Defense Department, \"notwithstanding any provision of law,\" to pay Jordan, Pakistan, and other nationsthat have provided logistical and military-related support to U.S. military operationsin Iraq or in the global war on terrorism. In the past, Defense officials argue,competing demands on regular military aid resources have delayed reimbursementto key friends that provide services to American forces. Congress approved fundingin the FY2002 supplemental for this purpose, but included a 15-day prior notificationrequirement that is not part of the FY2003 supplemental draft legislation.", "The more controversial authority concerned DOD's request for $150 million to support \"indigenous forces\" assisting U.S. military operations, including those aimedat the global war on terrorism. Decisions to draw on these funds would be made bythe Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State. TheDefense Department defines indigenous forces as \"irregular forces and resistancemovements\" and notes that such forces \"generally conduct military and para-militaryoperations in enemy-held or hostile territory and conduct direct offensivelow-intensity, cover, or clandestine operations.\" (60) Although it was unclear from thebudget justification and bill text exactly what groups and under what scenarios theAdministration would utilize these resources, a senior Administration officialsuggested that the intent was to have resources available for groups in Iraq. DeputySecretary Richard Armitage testified on March 27 that because of the uncertainty ofthe war's duration, it might be necessary to transfer additional arms and equipmentfor Kurdish and other forces, and that the $150 million would provide a \"hedge\" incase of a more prolonged conflict. (61) In last year'ssupplemental appropriation debate,DOD had asked for $30 million to support indigenous forces, funds that would beexclusively under the control of the Secretary of Defense. Congress rejected theproposal, however. The House Appropriations Committee observed in deleting therequest that the Secretary of State's primary responsibility over U.S. militaryassistance programs is well established and that the Administration has the necessaryauthorities under existing foreign aid laws to undertake the requested activities.
