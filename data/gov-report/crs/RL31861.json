The events of September 11, 2001, increased Congressional attention towardsreducing the vulnerability of the United States to such attacks. High-threat chemical agents, whichinclude chemical weapons and some toxic industrial chemicals, are normally organized by militaryplanners into four groups: nerve agents, blister agents, choking agents, and blood agents. While therelative military threat posed by the various chemical types has varied over time, use of thesechemicals against civilian targets is viewed as a low probability, high consequence event.", "High-threat chemical agents, depending on the type of agent used, cause a variety of symptoms in their victims. Some cause death by interfering with the nervous system. Some inhibit breathingand lead to asphyxiation. Others have caustic effects on contact. As a result, chemical attacktreatment may be complicated by the need to identify at least the type of chemical used. Differencesin treatment protocols for the various high-threat agents may also strain the resources of the publichealth system, especially in the case of mass casualties. Additionally, chemical agents trapped onthe body or clothes of victims may place first responders and medical professionals at risk.", "Protection from and detection of chemical agents is an area of much concern. The range of protection and detection equipment available to first responders has led to questions regardingequipment standardization and state and local preparedness.", "Whether terrorist groups are capable of using chemical agents as weapons of mass destruction is unclear. Some have asserted that the volumes of chemicals required to cause mass casualtieswould make that scenario unlikely. They claim that chemical terrorism is more likely to be smallin scale. Others have suggested that there has been an increase in terrorist interest regardingchemical agents, and that this interest could lead to their use in terrorist attacks.", "Current policies seek to reduce the proliferation of chemicals that could be transformed into chemical weapons, prevent unrestricted access to large amounts of toxic chemicals, provide federalassistance to locations that are affected by chemical terrorism, and support research and developmentactivities. It is expected that the Department of Homeland Security will take a major role in federalpolicy efforts.", "Additional measures suggested for addressing potential chemical terrorism vulnerabilities include further restricting domestic access to precursor chemicals and technologies required tomanufacture high-threat chemical agents; directing continued research and development intoselective, sensitive chemical agent detectors; implementing air monitoring equipment to detectchemical releases in, for example, public transportation or urban spaces; and overseeing furtherresearch into protective equipment, prophylaxis, and treatment against high-threat chemicals.

While there is still debate over whether terrorist groups have anincreased interest in chemical acquisition and use, the domestic vulnerability of the United Statesto chemical attack remains high. Policy approaches to reducing chemical vulnerability havegenerally treated chemical agents as a group, rather than addressing specific agents. Additionally,military and civilian chemical agent detection have developed with little coordination, so thatcivilian toxic industrial chemical kits and military chemical weapons detectors having varyingsensitivities and detection capabilities. Treatments for chemical exposure vary as well, dependingon the type of chemical, and so must be addressed on a chemical by chemical basis. Becausecomparatively few individuals have been exposed to modern chemical weapons, practical experiencein treatment of chemical casualties is limited, especially among civilian health care providers.

(1) Some may havebeen developed and used for commercial purposes. Others may have been used or developed by militaries as chemical weapons. ", "Different chemical weapons cause different symptoms in and injuries to their victims. Because of this range of potential symptoms, it can be difficult to know what treatment will be most effectivefor a victim until the chemical or chemical type has been identified. Also, chemical weapons mayproduce their effects by different exposure routes, for example, by skin contact or by inhalation. Asa consequence, depending on what chemical is encountered, different protective equipment must beemployed; for example, a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection against chemicals which candamage through skin contact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Chemical Agents", "paragraphs": ["Military planners categorize such agents into four classes: nerve, blister, choking, and bloodagents. (2) This categorization groups chemicals bythe effects they cause to those exposed to them. While the nerve and blister agents are predominantly only manufactured and used by militaries asweapons, both choking agents and blood agents include chemicals widely used in industrialprocesses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nerve Agents", "paragraphs": ["Chemical weapons affecting the nervous system are called nerve agents. Nerve agents do not occur naturally. Rather, they are manmade compounds that require manufacture and isolation forhigh toxicity and purity. Most nerve agents belong to a group of chemicals called organophosphates. Organophosphates have a wide range of toxicity, and some are commercially employed asinsecticides, though these are significantly less toxic than those developed as chemical weapons. (3) Nerve agents are mainly liquids.", "Production. The first nerve agent developed for military use, called Tabun or GA, was made in Germany in the 1930s. (4) Following this discovery,a series of nerve agents similar to Tabun were developed. This series, known as the G-series, includethe weapons Sarin (GB) and Soman (GD). In the late 1940s, another series of nerve agents, theV-series, was invented in England. Both the British and the United States chemical weaponsprograms investigated these compounds. The United States manufactured and stockpiled VX. (5) Arelated compound, V-gas, was manufactured and stockpiled by the Soviet Union. Military use ofnerve agents has been rare. Nerve agents were not used during World War I or World War II. During the 1980 -- 1988 Iran-Iraq war, Iraq reportedly used nerve agents against Iranian troops andlater against members of its Kurdish population in northern Iraq. (6)", "National chemical weapons programs have produced nerve agents for decades. The technological barriers for a terrorist group to synthesize these agents might be overcome by usingcommercially available equipment, though there would be appreciable danger to the manufacturerdue to the extreme toxicity of these compounds. Nerve agent production requires the use of toxicchemicals during synthesis and specialized equipment to contain the nerve agent produced. Of thenerve agents, VX has been identified as the most difficult to manufacture. (7)", "Effects. Nerve agents are extremely dangerous and can enter the body through the lungs or by skin contact, though for the G-series nerve agents, theinhalation toxicity is significantly greater than the dermal toxicity. Of the nerve agents, VX is themost deadly and Tabun is the least deadly, though all are exceedingly toxic.", "Nerve agents interfere with the nervous system, causing overstimulation of muscles. Victims may suffer nausea and weakness and possibly convulsions and spasms. At high concentration, lossof muscle control, nervous system irregularities, and death may occur. The action of nerve agentscan be irreversible if victims are not quickly treated.", "Treatment. Two drugs, atropine and pralidoxime chloride, are used as antidotes for nerve agents. (8) Atropine prevents muscle spasm and allows thebody time to clear the nerve agent. Pralidoxime chloride limits the effects of nerve agent exposureby reversing the agent's action. Both of these drugs were issued to U.S. troops during the PersianGulf War in the form of an antidote kit called the Mark I. Diazepam (Valium) may be used to reduceconvulsions and seizures brought on by exposure to nerve agents. (9)", "The treatment window for nerve agent exposure is agent-dependent. Some agents quickly and irreversibly react to enzymes within the body, while others require a much longer time topermanently bind to these enzymes. The most effective treatment occurs before such permanentbinding has taken place. Soman, for example, is permanently bound within minutes, while Tabunis not and can be treated up to several hours after exposure. Prophylactic use of some compounds,such as pyridostigmine bromide, may create a larger window for effective treatments for some nerveagents. (10)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Blister Agents", "paragraphs": ["Blister agents, also known as vesicants, are chemicals that cause painful blistering of the skin. While such blistering is not generally lethal, the excruciating pain caused by blister agents requiresfull body protection against these chemicals. Militarily, blister agents produce casualties and reducethe combat effectiveness of opposing troops by requiring them to wear bulky protective equipment. (11) The most common blister agent is mustard agents, which includes nitrogen- and sulfur-basedcompounds. Mustard agents are oily liquids which range in color from very pale yellow to darkbrown, depending on the type and purity, and have a faint odor of mustard, onion or garlic. (12) Theseliquids evaporate quickly, and their vapors are also injurious.", "Blister agents are not naturally occurring compounds. Mustard agents, for example, were first developed in the late 1800s. During World War I, both sides in the conflict used these weaponsagainst their enemies, and the mustard-type blister agent produced the greatest number of chemicalcasualties during World War I, though fewer than 5% of these casualties died. Many countries havestockpiled blister agents in their chemical weapon inventories. Mustard agent was also reportedlyused in the Iran-Iraq war. (13) The United States iscurrently destroying its stockpile of blister agents. ", "Production. Production of blister agents is considered less complicated than that of nerve agents. (14) Likenerve agents, it requires the use of some toxicchemicals and specialized equipment to contain the agent produced. The most common blisteragents have many different methods for their production published in the open literature. (15)", "Effects. Blister agents can enter the body through the lungs or by contact with the skin or eyes. Some can penetrate through normal clothing material,causing burns in areas that were covered by cloth. While blister agents react quickly upon skincontact, their symptoms may be delayed. In the case of mustard agent, damage occurs within 1-2minutes of exposure, but symptoms do not manifest for several hours. (16) As even low concentrationof vaporized blister agent quickly causes damage, it is unlikely that agents will be removed from theskin prior to injury. ", "The initial symptoms of blister agent exposure are a reddening of the skin, resembling sunburn, combined with pain in the effected area. Swelling, blisters, and lesions may then develop dependingon the degree of exposure. Systemic symptoms such as malaise, vomiting, and fever may alsodevelop in extreme cases. (17) Exposure to largeamounts of liquid mustard agent may prove fatal. (18)", "The eyes are also very sensitive to blister agents. At high vapor exposures, great pain, corneal damage, and scarring between the iris and lens may occur. The most severe eye damage is oftencaused by liquid agent, either from contact with airborne droplets or by self-contamination of theeyes from contaminated clothing or body parts. (19)", "Victims inhaling blister agents may suffer damage to their lungs. While a single, low-level exposure will likely produce only temporary impairment, high concentrations or repeated exposuresmay cause permanent damage. Inhalation victims may have symptoms ranging from mild bronchitisto blistering of the lungs. (20)", "Treatment. Damage from blister agent exposure, lesions and other skin irritations, is symptomatically treated. Hospitalization may be required forrespiratory tract injuries. Victims who suffer severe lung damage may require mechanicalventilation. An additional complication after exposure to large amounts of mustard agent is ageneral weakening of the whole immune system. Because of these systemic effects, specialprecautions must be taken against opportunistic infections in the case of exposure to highconcentration of mustard agent. (21)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Choking Agents", "paragraphs": ["Chemicals that act on the lungs, causing difficulty in breathing and, potentially, permanent lung damage are known as choking agents. Examples of choking agents include chlorine, ammonia, andphosgene. Choking agents have historically been used during wartime, and are sometimesencountered during industrial accidents. (22) Choking agents are generally gases that have markedodors and may color the surrounding air. ", "Production. Many choking agents are dual-use chemicals with both a civilian and a military purpose. Chlorine and ammonia are both used in largequantities for commercial applications, while phosgene is used within the chemical industry. Methods for producing choking agents are well known, but may be technically challenging. Chokingagents require specialized equipment to produce, compress, and contain them. Choking agents werealso manufactured for wartime use, and were extensively used during World War I. The first major,successful, chemical attack of the war used chlorine gas at Ypres in 1915. (23) Chlorine gas was latersupplemented by phosgene use, which caused greater casualties. (24)", "Effects. Choking agents injure their victims through inhalation, with a comparatively mild effect on the skin. Exposure to low chemical concentrationscauses chest discomfort or shortness of breath, irritation of nose and throat, and tearing eyes. Highagent concentrations may quickly cause swelling of the lungs, respiratory failure, and possibly death. Symptoms of lung damage can occur up to 48 hours after inhalation of moderate concentrations, andoften do not manifest themselves until the lungs are aggravated by physical effort. (25)", "Treatment. Victims of choking agents are generally treated symptomatically. Because lung damage may be exacerbated by exercise, victims are kept atrest until the danger of fluid in the lungs is past. Symptoms such as tightness of the chest andcoughing are treated with immediate rest and comfort. Shallow breathing and insufficient oxygenmay require supplemental oxygen. (26)", "Swelling and accumulation of fluids in the lungs are likely after exposure to a high dose of choking agent. Administration of corticosteroids has been recommended in cases of fluidaccumulation, but their beneficial effects have not been proven. (27) Rest, warmth, sedation, andoxygen are still the primary treatments, even in the case of marked edema."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Blood Agents", "paragraphs": ["Blood agents are chemicals that interfere with oxygen utilization at the cellular level. Hydrogen cyanide and cyanide salts are agents in this group. Hydrogen cyanide is a very volatile gas, smellingof almonds, while cyanide salts are odorless solids.", "Hydrogen cyanide was considered for use as a chemical warfare agent, but was rarely used in military situations because its effectiveness was limited by its quick dispersion. The Frenchmanufactured hydrogen cyanide as a military agent during World War I. (28) Hydrogen cyanide wasused in other situations though; the principle agent used to kill individuals in German World WarII concentration camps, Zyklon B, used hydrogen cyanide as its active agent. (29) Hydrogen cyanideuse has been attributed to both sides during the Iran-Iraq war. (30)", "Production. Hydrogen cyanide and cyanide salts are now used as industrial chemicals, having application in the chemical, electroplating, and miningindustries. As with choking agents, methods for producing blood agents are relatively well-known. However, the gaseous nature of hydrogen cyanide complicates production and storage. ", "Effects. Blood agents act through inhalation or ingestion and impair cellular oxygen use. (31) Thecentral nervous system is especially susceptible tothis effect, and blood agents usually cause death through oxygen starvation of brain cells. Thesymptoms of blood agent exposure depend upon the agent concentration and the duration ofexposure. In mild cases, there may be headache, dizziness, and nausea for several hours, followedby complete spontaneous recovery. Higher concentration or longer exposure may additionally causeconvulsions and coma. Very high concentrations may lead to powerful gasping for breath, violentconvulsions, and cardiac failure within a few minutes. (32)", "Treatment. The effects of blood agents are reversed through treatment with specific antidotes: either amyl or sodium nitrite combined with sodiumthiosulfate. The combination of these two chemicals removes cyanide, the active compound in bloodagents, from the body. When symptoms such as convulsion or depressed breathing are present,ventilation with oxygen and administration of anticonvulsants are used. Cyanide is metabolizedmore readily than most chemical weapons; with prompt treatment, victims may recover fromotherwise-fatal doses.

Gas mask filters equipped with chemical filters are effective against inhaled chemical agents, butmay not provide sufficient protection against chemical agents active on skin contact, such as VX ormustard agents, or high concentrations of other nerve agents.", "Gas mask filters are normally constructed from layers of activated charcoal and fine porous material to remove particles and chemicals from the airstream. The activated charcoal bindschemicals, preventing them from being inhaled. Each gas mask filter has a finite capacity,proportional to the amount of unbound activated charcoal remaining, and so has a limited lifetimeonce put into operation. (34)", "For those chemical weapons that cause effect upon skin contact, a protective garment is required. These garments range in complexity and protective ability. Hazardous materials suits aretypically suits made of layered rubber with activated charcoal. In comparison, military battle dressovergarments designed to protect against chemical weapons in the battlefield are generally cloth,sometimes treated to resist absorbing liquids, containing a layer of charcoal-impregnated foam.

The combination of mask and suit providesfull protection against most chemical exposures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medical", "paragraphs": ["There are few examples of medical prophylaxis against chemical weapons. Unlike some biological pathogens, there are no vaccines to provide immunity from the effects of these weapons. However, some protection against the nerve agent Soman can be achieved by the pre-exposure useof pyridostigmine bromide. Pyridostigmine bromide acts to supplement post-exposureadministration of the nerve agent antidotes atropine and pralidoxime chloride. Use of pyridostigminebromide prevents permanent binding of nerve agents within the nervous system. Pyridostigminebromide use is recommended only when there is a high imminent threat of chemical weapon use, asit has noticeable side effects. (36)", "As an added protection against chemical weapons which cause their effects through skin contact, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense has developed a chemicalresistant topical skin cream.

(39) Decontamination is especiallyimportant in those cases where victims have encountered liquid chemical agents, and may havesignificant amounts of chemical agent trapped in their garments. In events with gaseous agents,decontamination may be less critical.

The Department of Defense currently employs a series of technologies to detect and identifychemical agents, including personal sensors, automated atmospheric sampling, and field-adaptedlaboratory methods for battlefield use.", "Detection of chemical agents can serve many purposes. One is to provide warning of a chemical attack, allowing additional time to react to a terror event. Another is to identify thechemical agent used in an attack. This might provide for better treatment and more effectiveresponse. Finally, determining when an area is clear of chemical agents after a terror attack requiressensitive post-event detection.", "There are techniques for detecting chemical agents that are based on sampling the local environment. Detection paper, tickets, and tubes are examples of such techniques. Detection paperis absorbent paper impregnated with special dyes. When a drop of chemical agent is absorbed bythe paper, it dissolves one of the pigments, causing the paper to change color. Detection tickets areused in a manner similar to detection paper. The ticket is waved in the air or used with a hand pumpto determine if chemical agents are present. Detection tubes use a similar technology, but rely ona hand pump to draw air samples through the tube, which discolors in the presence of an agent. Adisadvantage to these techniques is that other substances can also dissolve these pigments, causingfalse positives. (40) The pigments involved can bespecific to a type of agent, so an array of papers,tickets, or tubes may be required to identify the exact agent encountered.", "Handheld detectors, such as the Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM), are able to detect some chemical agents, namely mustard agents and nerve agents, at levels that are below the lethalthreshold, but above the acceptable daily exposure limit for civilians. (41) Automatic sampling devices,such as the Automatic Chemical Agent Detector/Alarm (ACADA), are also employed to provideautomated, constant atmospheric sampling. (42) These devices sometimes use a technique called ionmobility spectroscopy to detect the presence of chemical agents.", "Much of the above equipment is commercially available, and could be used by hazardous material response teams to assess potential terrorist activity. Typically, hazardous material responseteams are equipped with detection paper, tickets, or tubes, but these teams have differingrequirements regarding equipment standardization.

(50) On the other hand, chemicalagents might be effectively used as weapons of terror in situations where limited or enclosed spacemight decrease the required amounts of chemical. That is, the use of the weapon itself, even ifcasualties are few, could cause fear that would magnify the attack's effect beyond what would beexpected based solely on the number of casualties.", "There have been few examples of successful chemical terror attacks. In 1995, Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese apocalyptic cult, used Sarin on the Tokyo subway. The attack killed 12 people and sentmore than 5,000 to the hospital with some degree of injury. (51) This same cult reportedly carried outan attack in Matsumoto as well, where 7 people were killed and over 200 injured. (52) Both of theseattacks used G-series nerve agents, which are more toxic through inhalation than by contact. V-series agents employed in a similar manner might have caused greater fatalities.", "In comparison, blister agents would likely be less lethal, but more injurious, if used in a similar manner. Blister agents are dermally active, so inhalation of the agent would not be necessary tocause injury.

Some chemicals, notably those with commercial or industrial use, are available for over-the-counter purchase from chemical suppliers. Because thesechemicals have a legitimate civilian use, there is little oversight of such sales. Consequently, thesechemicals may be available for purchase or theft in large quantities. (85)", "Regulatory mechanisms designed to increase the barriers to illicit acquisition of dual-use chemical agents, such as mandatory identity or use verification for domestic purchases, might reducethe relative threat. Such a proposal might add a significant burden to chemical manufacturers anddistributers, as well as end-users of these chemicals, since verification paperwork and procedurescould increase manufacturing and overhead costs. Additionally, increasing acquisition barriers viapurchase of such agents would not address the threat posed by theft of these agents. ", "Dual-use chemical agents are transported, and occasionally stored, in large quantities, and it is possible that they might be stolen, or even intentionally damaged while in transit, as part of a terrorattack. Some have advocated that the transport and storage of these chemicals be regulated withgreater strictness, with their transport limited to less populated areas and the amounts transportedor stored limited, (86) and that such facilities be mademore secure. (87) Others have pointed to effortstaken by water officials to reduce on-site stockpiles of chemicals and to use alternate purificationmethods as a model for reducing vulnerability. (88)", "Such proposals raise the question of what an acceptable threshold for stored or transported chemical agents might be. Railcars may contain up to ninety tons of chemical, while other storagefacilities may contain comparable amounts. Anhydrous ammonia used for refrigerant purposes issometimes stored in fifty to one hundred ton amounts. Proposals involving increasing security orlimiting the size of allowed transfer or storage of chemicals might have significant economic costs. Additional security at manufacturing and transport facilities may increase the cost of these chemicals,while requiring end-user security improvement may prove impractical. Assessing the success ofsuch plans may also be complicated. Legislation has been introduced in the 108th Congress toaddress some of these issues.

Some companies have instituted a greater degree of identity and use verification for thesepurchases. There are many potential manufacturing methods for chemical weapons, and so it ispossible to make them from simpler, unregulated compounds.

Any such system would need to besensitive and provide timely data, while also providing detector coverage for an appreciable outdoorarea. In the prototype biological detection system being implemented, samples are taken back to alaboratory and there tested for biological material. This may be an effective method for testing forbiological weapons, as there is usually a multi-day incubation period for infection. In contrast tobiological weapons, chemical weapons cause their effects quickly. Any detector system designedto monitor ambient air would need to respond immediately, a key criterion in a \"detect-to-warn\"system. A chemical weapon's effects would be detected through the arrival of victims in hospitalsbefore a laboratory test of detector samples could be performed.
