In states that have STC programs, workers whose hours are reduced under a formal work sharing plan may be compensated with STC, which is a regular unemployment benefit that has been pro-rated for the partial work reduction.", "Although the terms work sharing and short-time compensation are sometimes used interchangeably, work sharing refers to any arrangement under which workers' hours are reduced in lieu of a layoff. Under a work sharing arrangement, a firm faced with the need to downsize temporarily chooses to reduce work hours across the board for all workers instead of laying off a smaller number of workers. For example, an employer might reduce the work hours of the entire workforce by 20%, from five to four days a week, in lieu of laying off 20% of the workforce.", "Employers have used STC combined with work sharing arrangements to reduce labor costs, sustain morale compared to layoffs, and retain highly skilled workers. Work sharing can also reduce employers' recruitment and training costs by eliminating the need to recruit new employees when business improves. On the employee's side, work sharing spreads more moderate earnings reductions across more employees\u2014especially if work sharing is combined with STC\u2014as opposed to imposing significant hardship on a few. Many states also require that employers who participate in STC programs continue to provide health insurance and retirement benefits to work sharing employees as if they were working a full schedule.", "Work sharing and STC cannot, however, avert layoffs or plant closings if a company's financial situation is dire. In addition, some employers may choose not to adopt work sharing because laying off workers may be a less expensive alternative. This may be the case for firms whose production technologies make it expensive or impossible to shorten the work week. For other firms, it may be cheaper to lay off workers than to continue paying health and pension benefits on a full-time equivalent basis. Work sharing arrangements in general also redistribute the burden of unemployment from younger to older employees, and for this reason the arrangements may be opposed by workers with seniority who are less likely to be laid off.", "From the perspective of state governments, concerns about the STC program have included the program's high administrative costs. Massachusetts has made significant strides in automating STC systems and reducing costs, but many other states still manage much of the STC program on paper.", "Currently, approximately half of the states and the District of Columbia have enacted STC programs to support work sharing arrangements. However, few UC beneficiaries are STC participants. At the peak of its use in 2010, the STC beneficiaries totaled nearly 3% of regular unemployment compensation first payments. The reasons for low take-up of the STC program are not completely clear, but key causes include lack of awareness of the program, administrative complexity for employers, and employer costs. P.L. 112-96, passed in February 2012, offered grants to states to help bring attention to the states' STC laws. In addition, P.L. 112-96 provided temporary federal funding to states that have existing STC programs or to create a new one.

As will be discussed below, approximately half of states have enacted STC legislation and, within these states, few firms and workers have participated. The reasons for this seem to be a combination of difficulty the U.S. Department of Labor (U.S. DOL) has had in implementing the 1992 authorizing legislation, lack of awareness on the part of employers, unsuitability of work sharing arrangements for some firms or workers, and costs of the program.

Workers whose hours are reduced are sometimes compensated with STC, which is equivalent to regular unemployment benefits that have been pro-rated for the partial work reduction. In this example, workers' STC benefits would be 20% of the unemployment benefit they would have been entitled to had they been laid off. As unemployment benefits generally replace almost half of an average worker's wages (with considerable variation among states), STC benefits for a worker who has experienced a 20% reduction in hours would amount to about 10% of the worker's wages before the reduction in hours. Employees would therefore receive a combined income of about 90% of their full-time wages as compensation for four days of work: 80% as wages plus 10% as STC.", "Working reduced hours because of economic conditions is currently quite common. In September 2016, an estimated 61% (3.5 million) of all part-time workers were employed part-time because of slack work or business conditions.", "Work sharing has a decades-long history in the United States. For example, in the early 1930s, President Hoover encouraged employers to reduce employees' hours instead of laying them off. In 1932, the President's Organization on Unemployment Relief issued a report that concluded, \"Reduction in the working time is the principal method of spreading employment\" through such means as reduced days per week, reduced hours per day, or rotating time off.", "The federal government introduced a temporary, national STC program in 1982 with the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA; P.L. 97-248 ), which expired in 1985. The U.S. DOL did not curtail the program's operation in existing states, nor did it stop new states from adopting the program. The recession of 1990-1991 brought renewed attention to STC, leading Congress to enact permanent STC legislation, the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 (UCA; P.L. 102-318 ). However, at the time, government officials argued that the 1992 law was restrictive in application and would have put many existing state STC programs out of compliance and required clarification.

Wholesale trade was the other sector more likely than average to use STC. Firms that used STC were generally older and larger than non-STC users. The average employment in STC firms was 239, compared to average employment of only 40 workers in firms that generated UI charges through layoffs in 2002. Older and larger firms were also more likely to have human resources departments to assist with implementing STC. In Connecticut in 2009, manufacturing firms were more likely than other firms to use STC.", "An interesting finding in the California study is that STC firms often have jobs that require lengthy apprenticeships or on-the-job training programs in which workers learn skills not taught in school. Within the manufacturing sector, the industries that used STC the most were manufacturers of electronics, industrial machinery, fabricated metals, instruments, furniture, primary metals, leather, rubber and plastics, and paper products.

As is well known, widespread unemployment leads to lower consumer spending and sales tax revenues. In addition, state employment services realize savings through work sharing because they are not called on to provide job search and other assistance. In 2010, the National Governors Association promoted STC as one of a number of recommended policies for assisting workers in an economic downturn.", "The administrative costs of STC programs have been a concern for state labor agencies. In many states, STC is still paper-based and states approve employers' work sharing plans on a case-by-case basis. In addition, STC may increase processing costs for the state agency relative to layoffs because, for a given firm, work sharing affects a larger number of workers than if the firm were to lay off workers. Some suggest that states would experience at least partially offsetting savings as a result of not having to administer certain components of the regular unemployment system, such as the requirements that a worker be actively seeking work and that he or she not refuse suitable work. No studies have attempted to quantify STC's net administrative cost to states, however.", "Some states have responded to high administrative costs by reducing the layers of approval for plan submissions, by automating the claims process, and by switching from employee-filed claims to employer-filed claims. States that have developed strategies to automate STC filing, approval, and ongoing claims have been able to reduce administrative costs, according to a study by Berkeley Planning Associates and Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (hereinafter, Berkeley Planning Associates and Mathematica). Massachusetts has gone the furthest by fully automating its STC program in 2001 and 2002. The system is Internet-based, and employers use it to submit their work sharing plans and their weekly STC transactions. Massachusetts has offered to make its software available at no cost to other states.", "The impact of STC benefits on the solvency of state unemployment programs, as reflected in the balance of state unemployment trust fund (UTF) accounts, is likely small. The immediate impact is negative as STC benefit payments increase with the onset of a recession. Increased state unemployment tax receipts respond with a lag. STC benefits are experience-rated in approximately the same manner as regular unemployment benefits. As a result, the study by Berkeley Planning Associates and Mathematica concluded that the long-run effect on a state's UTF account, relative to layoffs, is probably minimal, although the impact could potentially be more serious if STC participation rates were very high and tax schedules were constrained.", "When STC was first implemented in some states in the late 1970s and 1980s, proponents argued that it would help protect the gains made by affirmative action. Because women and minorities were newer to the workforce, they were considered more vulnerable to layoffs than workers with seniority. However, the 1997 study by Berkeley Planning Associates and Mathematica found no evidence that STC disproportionately benefits ethnic or racial minorities, or women, although it is still possible that the program could help entry-level and newer workers in general.", "Under P.L. 112-96 , the Labor Secretary was authorized to award grants to eligible states for STC programs, with one-third of each state's grant available for implementation and improved administration purposes and two-thirds of each state's grant available for program promotion and enrollment of employers.

If a work sharing arrangement that involves all employees is the alternative to laying off low-seniority (and generally lower paid) employees, then STC would presumably save the employer in wage costs.", "Work sharing and STC arrangements can also reduce recruitment and training costs for employers. When business improves, employers can increase the hours of existing employees rather than recruit and train new ones.", "Some employers find work sharing and STC programs attractive because they prevent the firm from losing skilled employees during an economic downturn and reduce the risk that skilled employees may leave for other companies. According to the MaCurdy et al. study of STC in California, employees of STC firms tended to be older and better paid than workers collecting regular unemployment benefits, suggesting that employers were using STC to retain highly skilled workers. Some employers use work sharing and STC to protect specific groups of highly skilled workers within a larger organization that is undergoing layoffs. For example, New York State's STC program allows employers to apply different percentage reductions to hours and wages in different departments, and STC may be implemented at the level of one or more departments, shifts, or units. Berkeley Planning Associates and Mathematica, as part of their 1997 study of STC, surveyed 500 employers who used work sharing in combination with STC and found that the ability to retain valued employees was a major attraction.", "Most employers who used the STC program reported that they were satisfied and would use it again, according to the same 1997 survey. In fact, many firms used STC repeatedly, with some firms using it in every quarter over a three-year period.", "Work sharing and STC arrangements may help sustain employee morale and productivity compared to layoffs. Even employees who survive a layoff may be vulnerable to \"survivor's guilt\" and emotional contagion (picking up on the despair of laid-off employees) that can reduce productivity.", "The most frequent complaint found in the survey conducted by Berkeley Planning Associates and Mathematica was that firms' state unemployment taxes increased following use of the STC program. In the survey, firms using STC experienced higher unemployment insurance (UI) charges compared to firms that had not used STC. The STC firms, however, also continued to lay off workers. One interpretation offered by the survey's authors is that STC firms were experiencing greater economic distress than similar non-participating firms.", "In states where STC is charged to the firm according to the experience rating rules of the regular unemployment program, the firm incurs no more in UI tax costs by using STC than it would through layoffs. For example, MaCurdy et al. wrote about California's STC system that \"it does not matter for UI tax calculations whether a firm generates $1,000 in UI benefits through work sharing or layoffs.\" Seven states also impose additional tax provisions on work sharing employers, in order to ensure that employers who already pay the maximum state unemployment tax rate share in the burden. According to the Berkeley Planning Associates and Mathematica study of STC, states appear to experience-rate STC claims at least as well as regular unemployment compensation claims.", "Certain nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, and federally recognized Indian tribes are permitted to reimburse their state unemployment funds for unemployment benefit payments attributable to service in their employ, instead of contributing taxes to the state's trust fund. Most state laws provide that reimbursing employers will be billed at the end of each calendar quarter, or another period, for benefits paid during that period. For these \"reimbursing\" employers, STC is not a cost-effective option.", "There likely are several reasons why most reductions in hours take the form of layoffs rather than shorter work schedules. Employers' lack of awareness of STC has been cited as one reason for low employer participation. In addition, production technologies may make it expensive or impossible to shorten the work week. This is the case in some manufacturing industries, for example, where the costs of shutting down and starting up equipment are high. Moreover, a work sharing arrangement may not reduce total costs to employers in exact proportion to the reduction in work hours. Some non-wage employment costs\u2014referred to as \"quasi-fixed\" costs\u2014are largely independent of the number of hours worked. Health and pension benefits are among those that fall into this category. P.L. 112-96 required employers to certify that health insurance and pension benefits during the period of the work sharing arrangement will not be reduced. Thus, STC firms continue to bear the full (rather than the pro-rated) costs of the two benefits.

One worker who received STC in 2009 in conjunction with a work sharing arrangement told a Rhode Island newspaper, \"Versus being totally unemployed, it's a big plus. There aren't any jobs out there.\"", "Analysts have suggested that work sharing could shift the impact of an economic downturn from younger workers to older workers because it spreads the pain of a workforce reduction among workers of all ages. Younger employees, who are often the first to be fired in a downturn, presumably have the most to gain by work sharing combined with STC. More experienced and more highly paid workers would presumably have the most to lose, particularly in firms where jobs are protected by seniority. Consequently, employees with seniority may oppose a program that shares reductions across the labor force.", "Some research suggests that reduced work hours may have different implications for professional employees compared to hourly workers. Professional employees sometimes welcome a better work-life balance, while in some cases hourly workers rely not just on a full work schedule but also on overtime in order to make ends meet.", "When STC was introduced in the 1970s and 1980s, labor groups warned that safeguards were necessary to avoid reducing workers' health insurance and pensions. One concern had been that reduced work hours and pay could result in smaller contributions to pension plans. Traditional defined benefit pension plans generally calculate benefits based in part on a worker's high three or high five earnings years, so that workers close to retirement could be directly affected by a reduction in work hours and pay. As will be discussed below, Congress included protections for health and pension benefits when it authorized a temporary STC program from 1982 to 1985. These concerns seem to have died down during the 1980s, however, and Congress did not include health or pension safeguards when it passed a permanent law authorizing STC in 1992. By 2012, these concerns had resurfaced and as a result P.L. 112-96 requires employers to certify that health insurance and pension benefits during the period of the work sharing arrangement will not be reduced.", "An argument can be made that, in declining industries, work sharing and STC arrangements may cause some workers to delay serious job searches or retraining efforts.

TEFRA also provided that employees who received STC benefits would not be required to meet a state's work search and refusal of suitable work requirements for unemployment benefits. Employees would, however, be required to be available to work a normal work week. TEFRA required employers to continue to provide health and pension benefits to employees whose workweek was reduced as if the employees worked their normal hours. The act required that employers who used STC be charged in the same manner as other UI taxes, in order to ensure that STC costs were paid by participating employers instead of being passed on to other employers.

The maximum amount of all grants was limited to $100 million, less a small amount to be used by U.S. DOL for outreach. U.S. DOL was required to develop model legislative language and to provide technical assistance and guidance to states, in consultation with employers, labor organizations and state workforce agencies. U.S. DOL was directed to establish reporting requirements concerning the number of averted layoffs and participating employers. States had to apply for the STC grant(s) on or before December 31, 2014. Finally, P.L. 112-96 provided $1.5 million for U.S. DOL to report to Congress and the President, within four years of enactment, on the implementation of the legislation, including a description of states' best practices, analysis of significant challenges, and a survey of employers in all states to determine the level of interest in STC."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "paragraphs": ["STC is currently legislated in just over half of the states and the District of Columbia. In these states, it has never reached a large number of workers, although there is evidence of increased use in 2009 through 2011. Congress passed P.L. 112-96 in February 2012 to promote state adoption and implementation of STC programs; however, STC remains a little-used program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. State Implementation of Short-Time Compensation Programs", "paragraphs": ["Currently, 27 states and the District of Columbia have active STC programs. Table A-1 displays how STC is implemented in those states. The basic structure of each state's STC program is broadly similar: eligible individuals have had their workweeks reduced by at least 10%, and this reduction in work hours must be in lieu of temporary layoffs. The amount of unemployment compensation payable to an individual is a pro rata share of the unemployment compensation to which that individual would have been entitled if he or she had been totally unemployed. Eligible employees are not required to meet the \"able and available for work\" requirement of regular unemployment compensation, but they must be available for their normal workweek. Finally, eligible employees may participate in an employer-sponsored training program.", "Within these broad outlines there is considerable variation among states. An employer's STC agreement cannot exceed a period of 6 months in 5 states but may span up to approximately 1 year in 20 states and the District of Columbia. An individual may receive STC benefits for up to 18 weeks in Colorado or for up to 52 weeks in 8 states. Alternatively, California, Michigan, Washington, and Wisconsin place no limits on the number of weeks a worker may receive STC benefits, although these states have caps on total benefits paid to an individual to the maximum potential total UC entitlement."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
