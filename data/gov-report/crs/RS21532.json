President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was first elected in 1999 amid the waning of Algeria's decade-long counterinsurgency against armed Islamist groups. His reelection to a fourth five-year term in April 2014, despite his evident ill health, has focused popular attention on succession issues. Bouteflika has initiated a process aimed at revising Algeria's constitution, but reforms proposed to date appear unlikely to substantially affect the political system. Algerians use the term Le Pouvoir (the powers-that-be) to refer to the opaque elite political and military networks that are widely viewed as driving policy decisions.", "Strong global prices for Algeria's energy resources have allowed the country to amass large foreign reserves as a buffer against economic instability, despite declining export volumes in recent years. However, bureaucratic red tape, corruption concerns, and stringent restrictions on foreign investment have inhibited growth and job creation. Localized public unrest over political and economic grievances periodically occurs, and ethnic violence has recently afflicted parts of the country. Yet public enthusiasm for dramatic political change appears limited, potentially due to factors such as the memory of violence during the 1990s and more recent examples of turmoil in Libya, Syria, and elsewhere.", "A terrorist attack at a natural gas compound in southeastern Algeria in January 2013, in which three Americans were killed, highlighted the challenges the United States faces in advancing and protecting its interests in an increasingly volatile region. The group that claimed responsibility is a breakaway faction of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), a regional network with Algerian roots and leadership. Given its large military, available financial resources, and desire to avert direct Western military intervention in neighboring states, Algeria has periodically sought to lead a regional response to security threats. Yet Algeria's complex and sometimes distrustful relations with neighboring states may hinder cooperation. Meanwhile, U.S. unilateral action in response to security threats may present significant risks and opportunity costs.", "Algeria's foreign policy has often conflicted with that of the United States. Strained relations with neighboring Morocco continue, due to the unresolved status of the disputed territory of Western Sahara and a rivalry for regional influence. Morocco claims Western Sahara; Algeria supports and hosts a long-running independence movement. The legacy of Algeria's anti-colonial struggle contributes to its leaders' stance on the Western Sahara, their emphasis on sovereignty as a principle of foreign relations, and their frequent skepticism of Western and NATO intentions.

In April 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry visited Algiers for a session of the dialogue and stated that \"there is much to be done to be able to advance our mutual interests,\" adding, \"We need to build trust.\" Broadly, Algeria has the financial and human resources to support its claims to regional leadership. Yet Algerian officials are often preoccupied with domestic politics, and the country's opaque internal decision-making processes and regional rivalries have, at times, limited its ability to fulfill such aspirations in practice. Tensions within the elite establishment could signal potential fracture points if new pressures arise, for example, from succession disputes, security threats, large-scale public unrest, or regional developments.", "U.S. concerns with security threats in the region surrounding Algeria have heightened since 2011 as violent extremist groups such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)\u2014an Algerian-led network and U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO)\u2014have exploited regional political instability and gaps in state capacity to expand their activities and influence. AQIM has spawned several splinter factions and offshoots in recent years, while reportedly pursuing ties to extremist groups operating in Libya, Tunisia, Nigeria, and potentially farther afield. The United States has attempted to work through regional partners, such as Algeria, to counter violent extremist groups in Africa, with mixed results. U.S. officials have also debated the degree to which the United States can or should intervene directly against terrorist actors in the region.", "Large-scale terrorist attacks within Algeria have significantly decreased in frequency over the past 15 years, although terrorist threats persist. In January 2013, an AQIM splinter-faction carried out a mass hostage-seizure in southeast Algeria in which three Americans were killed. In April 2014, AQIM claimed responsibility for killing 14 Algerian soldiers in Kabylie, a mountainous area east of Algiers where the group's leadership is reportedly based. Amid rising insecurity along Algeria's borders, preventing the spillover of political and security crises in Libya and Mali is likely to absorb Algerian policymakers' attention.

Benflis alleged that the election was marred by fraud and \"serious irregularities,\" and some opposition figures claimed that official turnout figures of 52% were inflated. Some analysts noted that official turnout was nonetheless lower than in the past four presidential elections, and that Bouteflika had thus apparently received millions fewer votes than in his last reelection in 2009. Still, for some analysts, the results demonstrated that Bouteflika has few opponents of national stature, and that he remains broadly popular. After the vote, the president reappointed as Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal, a technocrat who has served in that position since 2012 and has a reputation for competence.", "Algeria's political system is dominated by a strong presidency and security apparatus. Bouteflika first ran for president as an independent, but he is strongly connected to the National Liberation Front (FLN), the former nationalist movement and, for decades, the sole legal political party (see \" Background \"). Algeria's factionalized and opaque decision-making process often appears to inhibit a clear trajectory on political and economic reforms, as well as a more proactive Algerian foreign policy. Algeria also faces an uncertain transition as members of the \"revolutionary generation\" that fought for independence from France either retire or pass away.", "Algerians refer to Le Pouvoir (the powers-that-be) to designate opaque political and military elite networks that are broadly thought to control major policy decisions. Many analysts view President Bouteflika as having sought to (re-)establish the authority of the presidency by diminishing the influence of senior military commanders in state decision-making. Yet, the military intelligence service or DRS (after its French acronym) appears to wield significant power. Networks within Le Pouvoir are widely viewed as internally divided, with the DRS, at times, seeming to oppose Bouteflika's presidency. The DRS is led by General Mohamed \"Toufik\" Medi\u00e8ne, reportedly the sole general involved in the 1992 military coup to have remained in the same leadership position since then. ", "Starting in 2013, Bouteflika has taken steps to reorganize the military command structure in an apparent effort to exercise more direct control over operations and decisions. He has also reshuffled several DRS directors and removed from the DRS's mandate several key authorities\u2014reportedly including a role in investigating state corruption. The latter had enabled several high-profile investigations of Bouteflika allies, particularly in the energy sector, and broadly appeared to provide DRS leaders with leverage over rival factions. The cumulative practical impact of Bouteflika's actions is difficult to assess; some commentators have portrayed them as routine and/or an empty effort to portray the president as acting decisively. ", "The bicameral, multiparty parliament is weak. The presidency plays a prominent role in drafting legislation, initiating reforms, and making budget decisions. The president also appoints the Prime Minister as well as one-third of the upper house of parliament, known as the Council of the Nation. (The remaining two-thirds are selected by indirect elections.) Members of the 462-seat lower chamber or National People's Assembly are directly elected to five-year terms, most recently in 2012. While some observers expected the 2012 legislative elections to empower Islamist parties, the results instead favored the FLN and the National Rally for Democracy (RND), considered close to the military. Islamists, in contrast, were unable to unite around a shared platform and, in the end, trailed in the polls. Notably, a coalition led by the Movement of Society for Peace (MSP)\u2014a party that participated in the pro-Bouteflika ruling coalition until shortly before the election\u2014performed below some observers' expectations.", "Bouteflika has initiated a process to revise Algeria's constitution, which many observers expect to provide clues on potential succession should he die or become incapacitated while in office. A presidentially-appointed commission released a number of proposed changes in May and July 2014, having sought the input of a wide range of political and socioeconomic stakeholders. The publicly released proposals would notably reintroduce presidential term limits (abolished in 2008 to allow Bouteflika to run for a third term), permit the president to delegate executive powers to the Prime Minister, and provide greater prerogatives to the legislature and protections for civil liberties. The full scope of potential changes and the means through which they may be adopted remain to be seen. Some opposition parties and civil society figures have reportedly declined to participate in the ongoing constitutional revision process. Critics charge that the reform process is top-down, non-inclusive and has not addressed systemic issues such as the role of the military.", "The political opposition is diverse and divided: it includes leftist, Berber-led, Islamist, and regionally focused groups. Many parties\u2014including the FLN\u2014face significant internal divisions along ideological and/or personal lines. Some analysts argue that political Islam has lost its popular luster in Algeria due to the 1990s conflict, and/or that some Islamist leaders have lost credibility due to their accommodation with the regime. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), whose electoral gains in 1991 sparked a military coup and the ensuing civil conflict, remains banned. Religiously conservative Salafist social movements, most of which do not seek a direct role in politics, have grown in prominence in recent years.", "Civil society groups and the media represent a wide spectrum of opinions and are often critical of the government, despite a law on associations that some characterize as restrictive (see \" Human Rights \"). Algeria has a history of leftist economic policies, and the country's trade unions are influential political players. \"Autonomous\" unions, which portray themselves as resisting state cooption and control, have less influence over policy than the quasi-official General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA). Some U.S.-funded civil society groups are active in Algeria, such as the National Democratic Institute (NDI).

The conflict was notable for its brutal tactics: the guerilla National Liberation Front (FLN) carried out urban terrorist attacks and violent retribution against competing factions, while French commanders oversaw torture, extrajudicial killings, and other abuses targeting the FLN and local civilians suspected of supporting it. After the war was brought to an end through an independence referendum on July 1, 1962, the FLN became the ruling party in a single-party system. Backed by the powerful military, it remained politically dominant until the 1980s. The anti-colonial struggle remains a key foundation of Algeria's political identity; many of the country's aging political and military elites view their political legitimacy as closely tied to their role as former freedom fighters. Algeria was a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War; the government was ideologically leftist and engaged in military cooperation with the Soviet Union.", "Infighting among the revolutionary leadership, first reflected during the anti-colonial struggle, continued after independence and foreshadowed factional competition within the government and security sector. The 1980s saw the rise of Islamist ideology, escalating from university activism into a growing challenge to the FLN's leadership. Economic hardships contributed to a sense, among many Algerians, that those who had led the country to independence, and their professed socialist ideology, had failed to deliver on a promised social contract. In October 1988, mass protests erupted, altering the political landscape. A violent crackdown by the military damaged its prestige and deepened popular frustrations. The government then changed tack by initiating rapid political liberalization, ushering in a new constitution in 1989 that opened the way to multiparty competition. These changes placed Algeria far ahead of other countries in the region, at the time, in terms of introducing the mechanisms of democratic governance.", "Amid this political upheaval, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was formed as a broad and fractious coalition of Islamist groups. The movement used religious terms to criticize the FLN government from a populist and \"moral\" stance. FIS leaders also called for an Islamic state and denounced democracy as \"infidel.\" The FIS was granted legal status and made huge gains in local/municipal elections in 1990. It performed well in parliamentary elections held in December 1991, and was expected to win a majority of seats in a run-off round of voting scheduled for early 1992. Instead, the army intervened in January 1992, forcing the president to resign and canceling the election. The FIS was banned and its leaders imprisoned or exiled; thousands of FIS activists were detained, many of them at prison camps in the Sahara. ", "The thwarted Islamist movement fractured, with some factions turning to violence. A decade of conflict between security forces and Islamist insurgents ensued, resulting in as many as 200,000 deaths. During this period, factional competition within the government and security forces reportedly influenced politics and the conduct of the state's counterinsurgency campaign. The conflict was characterized by atrocities against civilians. Islamist militants, divided over tactics and ideology, targeted intellectuals, journalists, foreigners, artists, and musicians, along with ordinary citizens and each other. The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) engaged in an escalating cycle of brutality that included terrorist attacks in France and massacres of civilians. The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), which split from the GIA, initially differentiated itself by disavowing attacks on civilians and focusing instead on the Algerian military. ", "Questions remain about the government's culpability in violence against civilians during the conflict. Most analysts contend that the security forces committed serious abuses, including torture and disappearances. The government also restricted freedom of the press, assembly, and association. Some opposition parties sought common ground with exiled FIS leaders in support of a return to civilian governance and the democratic process. Others backed the military's strategy as necessary to neutralize the Islamists. Supporters argue that Algeria was unfairly isolated by Western critics for doing what they viewed as necessary to prevent the country's disintegration. ", "Relative stability was restored by the early 2000s, aided by the introduction of an amnesty for former militants. An initiative of President Bouteflika after his 1999 election, the amnesty was approved in a referendum and was expanded, again by referendum, in 2005-2006. The Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), the armed wing of the FIS, declared a unilateral ceasefire in 1997. The GIA has been inactive since 2002, and is widely viewed as defunct. The GSPC, however, merged with Al Qaeda in 2006 and changed its name to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) (see \" Terrorism ,\" below). In recent years, GSPC/AQIM attacks have targeted the military, state institutions, the police, and civilians, including Westerners in the region.

The government has also instituted de-radicalization programs and seeks to control the content of religious sermons. While it opposes direct foreign military intervention, Algiers welcomes indirect outside counterterrorism support, such as arms, surveillance equipment, and intelligence sharing. Algiers also regularly urges greater international efforts to impede AQIM's ability to extract large ransoms from Western (i.e., European) countries through kidnappings.", "The U.S. State Department considers the potential terrorist threat to U.S. personnel in Algiers \"sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under significant security restrictions,\" and the Algerian government requires U.S. personnel to \"seek permission to travel to the Casbah [old city] within Algiers or outside the province of Algiers and to have a security escort.\" AQIM-produced Internet videos have shown images of the U.S. Embassy and have condemned Algeria's security cooperation with the United States and France.", "Long-reported fractures within AQIM erupted in 2012, with several of AQIM's southern-based commanders joining or founding new groups.

Bel Mokhtar claimed responsibility for the January 2013 In Amenas hostage seizure (see text-box below). Both AQIM and Al Murabitoun have reportedly pledged support for Al Qaeda in the context of its struggle for primacy against the Islamic State (formerly ISIL/ISIS), but some analysts have speculated that the issue is divisive among these groups' adherents.", "AQIM was formed when the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), an Islamist insurgent faction in Algeria's 1990s civil conflict (see \" Background \"), declared allegiance to Al Qaeda in 2003 and, after Abdelmalik Droukdel became its leader, \"united\" with Al Qaeda on September 11, 2006, and renamed itself the following year. The practical meaning of AQIM's union with Al Qaeda is uncertain, and links between the two may be nominal but mutually beneficial.

", "Secretary of State Kerry stated during his visit to Algeria in April 2014 that \"We will look to increase our security assistance.\" In a televised meeting, President Bouteflika urged Secretary Kerry to share \"real-time\" U.S. intelligence on the Sahel and Sahara. The United States and Algeria have a Joint Military Dialogue to foster exchanges, training, and joint exercises. Algeria participates in the NATO-Mediterranean dialogue and in NATO naval exercises. A bilateral contact group on counterterrorism was launched in 2011, and the two countries signed a mutual legal assistance treaty in 2010. Algeria has recently pursued purchases of U.S.-origin defense materiel and services, particularly related to enhancing its maritime and aerial surveillance capacity\u2014part of an apparent Algerian effort to diversify its military acquisitions, for which it has historically relied primarily on Russia. Congressionally mandated end-use monitoring requirements have sometimes been an obstacle to U.S. arms sales, as Algeria considers them an infringement on its sovereignty. ", "U.S. officials often refer to relations with Algeria as an important \"partnership,\" a term that emphasizes mutual benefits and responds to Algerian concerns over sovereignty. U.S. military leaders, while pointing to the importance of bilateral cooperation, have also regularly emphasized that the United States does not seek to impose its views or install a military footprint in the region, in apparent recognition of Algerian sensitivities. U.S. officials also often note that the United States opposes paying ransoms for terrorist-held hostages, a policy that Algeria shares. ", "The Obama Administration has occasionally publicly urged political and economic reforms. For example, Secretary of State Kerry stated that the United States would work with Algeria \"in order to bring about the future that Algeria and its neighbors deserve. And that is a future where citizens can enjoy the free exercise of their civil, political, and human rights, and where global companies, businesses, are confident in being able to invest for the long haul.\" Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to Algeria's May 2012 legislative elections as \"a welcome step in Algeria's progress toward democratic reform,\" but later stated that \"Algeria has a lot of work to do to uphold universal rights and create space for civil society.\" ", "U.S.-Algerian ties date from a Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1795. In 1860, after the Algerian anti-colonial resistance fighter El Emir Abd el Kader protected large numbers of Christians from attack, President Abraham Lincoln honored him with a gift of guns that remain on display in Algiers; the town of Elkader, Iowa, was named after the emir. Older Algerians have fond memories of President Kennedy's support for their independence struggle. Relations suffered later due to Cold War differences, although Algerian diplomats played a key role in facilitating the release of U.S. hostages from Iran in 1981."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Trade and Investment Issues", "paragraphs": ["The United States imports Algerian crude oil, and was the largest destination for Algerian crude oil exports prior to a decline in 2013. U.S. investment is concentrated in the oil and gas sector, and U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz led a U.S. delegation to the Algerian International Trade Fair in June 2014. U.S. firms specializing in shale gas exploration and production are reportedly particularly interested in Algerian opportunities. The United States and Algeria signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in 2001, and to a limited extent, economic ties have also broadened beyond the energy sector, to include financial services, pharmaceuticals, and other industries. For example, in 2013, General Electric won a $2.7 billion contract to supply technology for Algerian power plants. In 2007, the two countries signed an agreement to cooperate in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, albeit with no apparent plans to build a U.S. reactor in Algeria. U.S. imports from Algeria totaled $4.8 billion in 2013, and U.S. bilateral exports totaled $1.8 billion, making Algeria the United States'56 th largest trading partner.", "Although Algeria's natural resources, sizable domestic market, and economic diversification efforts present potential substantial opportunities for U.S. investors, they continue to confront bureaucratic and policy obstacles. The State Department's latest Investment Climate Statement indicates that the climate for international investors has \"stabilized\" in the wake of laws enacted in recent years requiring at least 51% local ownership (see \" The Economy \"). However, the report relays investor complaints that \"laws and regulations both are constantly shifting and are applied unevenly, raising the perception of commercial risk.\" It further notes that \"business contracts are likewise subject to interpretation and revision, which has proved challenging to U.S. and international firms.\" The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has listed Algeria on its \"Priority Watch List\" as a country of particular concern with regard to the protection of intellectual property rights."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Algeria receives relatively little U.S. bilateral aid, but it participates in U.S. military and counterterrorism cooperation. In addition to aid administered on a bilateral basis, the State Department's Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) has funded projects in Algeria to promote democratic governance, improved education, and an enhanced financial sector. The Administration has also sought to increase educational exchanges with young Algerians. Assistance for counter-extremism efforts and border security has been provided through the State Department-led multi-country Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP). The Defense Department also administers some security cooperation programs.", "Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (Division A of P.L. 106-386 ), as amended, Algeria's poor ranking in the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons report potentially makes it ineligible for certain types of foreign aid. Aid to Algeria's central government has also been restricted under provisions in recent annual appropriations measures that pertain to budget transparency. A similar provision is contained in the FY2014 appropriations act ( P.L. 113-76 ).

The Administration's FY2015 proposal for a global Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund could potentially lead to greater U.S. cooperation with Algeria, including, conceivably, increased intelligence-sharing, which the Algerians have requested. Still, cooperation may continue to face obstacles related to the opaque nature of Algerian decision-making, as well as occasionally divergent foreign policy priorities. ", "Algeria's role in regional security is of potential interest to Congress, as is, potentially, the degree to which U.S. policy toward Algeria includes the encouragement of human rights and greater democracy. The role and influence of Algerian Islamist political parties and movements may also be of interest in the context of regional developments. Another area of potential interest concerns bilateral trade and investment. Algeria's energy resources, economic diversification and privatization efforts, and relatively large domestic market present opportunities to U.S. firms and prospective investors, although Algeria's business environment remains challenging.
