{"id": "R40703", "title": "Guinea: In Brief", "released_date": "2015-08-06T00:00:00", "summary": ["Guinea is one of three countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has affected the country's economy, social relations, food security, and politics. A former French colony on West Africa's Atlantic coast with a population of about 11 million, Guinea is rich in natural resources, but poverty is widespread. President Alpha Cond\u00e9, a former opposition leader, was voted into office in 2010 in Guinea's first ever presidential election organized by an independent electoral commission and without an incumbent candidate. His inauguration brought an end to a turbulent period of military rule that followed the death in 2008 of longtime leader Lansana Cont\u00e9 (who himself came to power in a military coup).", "As president, Cond\u00e9 has focused on containing the political influence of the military and improving economic governance, including by overhauling the mining code. However, state institutions remain weak; living conditions remain overwhelmingly poor; ethnic tensions have risen; and opposition activists accuse Cond\u00e9 of authoritarian tendencies. Political unrest appears likely ahead of presidential elections scheduled for October 2015, in which Cond\u00e9 is seeking a second term. Local-level elections have been repeatedly delayed and are the subject of a stand-off between the government and opposition over electoral procedures.", "U.S. engagement in Guinea is focused on health assistance, military professionalization, counter-narcotics issues, and concerns about regional peace and stability. Following the 2008 military coup, the United States identified Guinea's political transition as a key policy goal in West Africa and made significant diplomatic and financial contributions toward the success of Guinea's 2010 election process. U.S. bilateral aid is now overwhelmingly focused on health issues. Guinea's large mineral deposits, including the world's largest known reserves of bauxite (an ore used in producing aluminum), represent potential strategic and commercial interests for U.S. actors. Guinea's extractive industries have also drawn recent attention from the U.S. Department of Justice for potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.", "Congress plays a role in shaping U.S. engagement through its authorization and appropriation of aid funding, and its oversight of U.S. policies and aid programs. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) restricts Guinea's ability to receive International Military Education and Training (IMET) assistance, except for certain purposes. Similar restrictions have been contained in previous annual foreign aid appropriations measures. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 112-81) authorized Guinea, among several West African countries, to receive Defense Department-administered counter-narcotics assistance. During the 111th Congress, two resolutions condemning a massacre of civilian protesters in the capital, Conakry, in September 2009, passed their respective chambers: H.Res. 1013 (Ros-Lehtinen) passed in the House; and S.Res. 345 (Boxer) passed in the Senate.", "See also CRS Report R43807, FY2015 Funding to Counter Ebola and the Islamic State (IS), coordinated by [author name scrubbed]; CRS In Focus IF10022, The Global Health Security Agenda and International Health Regulations, by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report R43736, Ebola Virus Disease (Ebola or EVD): Experts List, by [author name scrubbed]."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["During the 1990s and early 2000s, Guinea was considered a locus of relative stability as civil conflicts raged in neighboring Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Mali. However, Guinea subsequently came to be viewed as a potential source of regional instability due to its fractious and sometimes restive military, periodic political unrest, ethnic tensions, and the rise of transnational drug trafficking and maritime piracy. Poor governance, corruption, weak or nonexistent infrastructure, and other factors have prevented Guinea's population from benefiting from its rich natural resource endowments, and average living conditions are poor even by regional standards in West Africa.", "The ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa has highlighted stark gaps in Guinea's healthcare infrastructure. It has also cast a spotlight on deep mistrust between local communities and historically absent or abusive state institutions. Such tensions are particularly evident in the remote southeast \"Forest\" region, where the epidemic reportedly originated in December 2013. However, now that dwindling Ebola cases are concentrated in the capital, Conakry, and along the coast, communities in those areas have also resisted Ebola education and treatment campaigns.", "The outbreak has affected Guinea's economy, social relations, and politics. Previously, Guinea had seen a relative increase in stability since elections in 2010 brought an end to two years of turbulent military rule. Longtime opposition leader Alpha Cond\u00e9 was elected president in the country's first ever open elections organized by an independent electoral commission. As president, Cond\u00e9 has enacted economic reforms and has largely confined the military to the barracks. Critics, however, accuse him of ruling unilaterally, and his time in office has been characterized by severe political tensions. The Ebola crisis, at its height, led to a hiatus of political demonstrations and protests. However, as the urgency of the crisis has faded, political leaders have turned to a dispute over the timetable and appropriate sequencing for presidential and local elections, currently scheduled for October 2015 and early-to-mid-2016, respectively.", "In 2010, significant election-related violence along ethnic lines revealed latent tensions and damaging the social fabric in ethnically mixed areas. These events left scars that continue to affect political dynamics. At the local level, in the Forest region, tensions between ethnic Malink\u00e9s (who trace their heritage to northeastern Guinea) and diverse groups viewed as the area's indigenous inhabitants (known collectively as Forestiers) also spark periodic violence. Ethnic differences sometimes map onto religious identity, particularly in the Forest region, but religion alone is not a major factor in national politics.", "The United States played a key role in Guinea's 2010 political transition by isolating the military junta and providing high-level support for elections. U.S. bilateral aid has since decreased, and is overwhelmingly focused on health. Congress has appropriated funds for U.S. aid to Guinea, including for Ebola response, and some Members have periodically expressed interest in Guinea's political stability, democratic trajectory, human rights record, and role in regional security."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The past seven years have seen dramatic political changes for a country that previously had had two presidents since independence from France in 1958. In 2008, President Lansana Cont\u00e9, who came to power in a military coup in 1984, died after a long illness. Mid-ranking military officers seized power upon his death, initiating a period of chaotic state decision-making. Popular opposition to the junta grew, and the security forces violently attacked peaceful protesters at a stadium in Conakry in September 2009, killing over 150 people and raping over 100. This sparked international condemnation. In December, Junta leader Captain Moussa Dadis Camara was shot and wounded by a member of his personal guard. His departure into exile paved the way for a military-led transitional government formed in early 2010 with international backing. A new constitution was drafted and adopted in May 2010 by a National Transitional Council (CNT).", "In June 2010, Guineans voted in their country's first presidential elections organized by an independent electoral commission and without an incumbent candidate. Former Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo came in first but did not get enough votes to avert a run-off against Alpha Cond\u00e9, which took place in November. The two candidates had widely divergent political backgrounds: Diallo was widely seen as a political insider, while Cond\u00e9 was a longtime opposition activist who had lived in exile during most of Guinea's post-independence history. The vote was nevertheless perceived by many as a contest between Guinea's two largest ethnic groups: the Peul, seen as constituting Diallo's base, and the Malink\u00e9, seen as Cond\u00e9's. ", "Cond\u00e9 ultimately benefitted from cross-ethnic support, in part because other groups apparently feared political consolidation by the already economically influential Peul community. (There has never been a Peul president in Guinea, but Peuls are prominent in domestic and regional commerce.) International election observers ultimately concluded that the overall conduct of the elections was acceptable, while noting concerns regarding logistical shortcomings, delays between the first and second rounds of voting, political polarization, and election-related violence. Diallo contested but ultimately accepted the results. Some opposition activists continue to claim that Cond\u00e9's 2010 electoral victory itself was illegitimate.", "Legislative elections held in 2013 allowed an elected parliament to replace an appointed, quasi-legislative body created under the junta. The election process was contentious, however, and the ability of opposition groups to participate in legislative deliberations has not eased political polarization (see \" Politics \" below). "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Politics", "paragraphs": ["Guinea's political system concentrates substantial power in the presidency. President Cond\u00e9 has arguably deepened this tendency through the elevation of presidential advisors and a pattern of unilateral decision-making. Although Cond\u00e9 appears to have consolidated political power, he has not been able to fulfill campaign promises to raise living standards, and analysts periodically express concerns about political stability. Cond\u00e9's leading opponent remains Cellou Dalein Diallo, his top rival in 2010, who leads the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG) party and the opposition block in parliament.", "Political dynamics in 2015 have been dominated by entrenched disputes over the upcoming electoral cycle. In early 2015, the national electoral commission (CENI, after its French acronym) scheduled the presidential election for October 2015 and local elections for 2016. Opposition leaders, however, assert that a 2013 political agreement between the government and opposition requires local elections to be held before the presidential vote. They accuse Cond\u00e9's administration of politicizing the CENI and seeking to manipulate the electoral process\u2014including through the appointment of partisan individuals to replace elected local-level officials. ", "The opposition withdrew its representatives from parliament in March 2015 in protest against perceived political interference in election preparations and staged multiple anti-government protests in April-May, several of which turned violent. An investigation by Human Rights Watch (HRW) found that on numerous occasions, security forces responding to the protests used excessive force, engaged in theft and banditry, and employed \"ethnic slurs\" against opposition supporters. HRW also reported that protesters engaged in criminal conduct. In response, the Guinean government blamed these issues on a lack of training. The protests have also exhibited a new trend of civilian-on-civilian violence, often along ethnic lines.", "Many Guineans view the crux of national politics as a power-struggle between Guinea's two largest ethno-regional communities, the Peul and Malink\u00e9, with other communities forced to choose sides or else face political irrelevance. Given Cond\u00e9's past electoral success in Malink\u00e9 areas and Diallo's in Peul areas, the presidential contest is thus expected to be hard-fought in the melting pot of Conakry and in potential \"swing districts,\" such as the ethnic Soussou-dominated coastal region and the ethnically diverse Forest region in the southeast. Perhaps as a result of ethno-regional calculations, in June 2015, Diallo's UFDG announced an electoral alliance with former military junta leader Moussa Dadis Camara, a Forestier, who is in exile in Burkina Faso. Soon after, the Guinean government\u2014after years of delay\u2014brought criminal charges against Dadis Camara for the massacre of protesters by security forces in 2009, while he was president. Whether Dadis Camara will return to Guinea is a matter of intense speculation. ", "Legislative elections were held in September 2013, following the aforementioned political agreement, which was brokered by the Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General for West Africa and backed by the European Union (EU). The elections were initially supposed to take place in 2011 but had been repeatedly delayed due to a dispute over electoral procedures. The elections were widely viewed as a key step in Guinea's political transition, and the EU had conditioned the full resumption of its development aid on completing them. The lead-up to the vote was violent, however, and the opposition contested the results. Cond\u00e9's RPG won a plurality of seats (53 out of 114), which, in coalition with smaller parties in the ruling Rainbow Alliance, allowed it to control a slim majority of 59 seats. ", "The State Department's annual human rights report lauded the 2013 elections as \"the first competitive and inclusive legislative elections in the country's history.\" However, EU election observers criticized both technical shortfalls and the overall political climate. For example, EU observers stated that \"the transmission of results suffered from a lack of transparency\" and reported that a number of problems had \"a negative impact on the quality of operations and lessened public confidence in electoral administration,\" including \"the absence of detailed data on the revision of the electoral registry, the release of provisional voter lists that had not been purged or corrected, the unilateral and tardy announcement of a new map of polling stations that did not conform to legal requirements, concerns regarding the contractor in charge of the electoral registry, the inversion of key steps in the process, and the removal of proxy voting a week before the polls.\" EU observers also criticized aspects of Guinea's legal electoral framework."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Economy", "paragraphs": ["Guinea boasts bountiful natural resources, including the world's largest known reserves of bauxite (aluminum ore); sizable deposits of high-grade iron ore, diamonds, gold, and uranium; and potential offshore oil and gas reserves. It also has significant hydroelectric and commercial agricultural potential. The economy relies heavily on mineral exports, notably joint-venture bauxite mining and alumina operations. Extractive industries are estimated to account for over 30% of gross domestic product (GDP). Over three-quarters of the labor force, however, works in the largely subsistence-focused agricultural sector.", "Economic hardship has contributed to periodic unrest, including general strikes in 2007 that turned into a national anti-government protest movement. Economic growth has been buffeted by regional instability and swings in global mineral prices, and growth rates of 2%-4% per year from 2010 to 2013 were insufficient to reduce poverty or improve living standards. Since 2014, Ebola has substantially reduced growth and investment, with a slight recession projected in 2015. President Cond\u00e9 has worked to attract greater foreign investment, particularly in the mining and electrification sectors. Investors nonetheless face sharp obstacles, including electricity shortages, poor infrastructure, and a lack of skilled workers.", "Cond\u00e9's administration has improved macroeconomic stability by addressing key aspects of poor economic governance under past regimes\u2014such as unsustainable spending and the printing of extra currency to meet budget shortfalls, which caused high inflation. Cond\u00e9's reforms secured $2.1 billion in debt relief in 2012 under the World Bank- and International Monetary Fund (IMF)-managed Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. As a result, Guinea's debt decreased from 100% of GDP in 2010 to 37% in 2014. The reforms also enabled the restoration of international financial institution aid, which had been suspended due to payment arrears and policy concerns.

According to the State Department's human rights report, \"the judicial system lacked independence and was underfunded, inefficient, and overtly corrupt.\" The 2010 constitution contains a number of provisions aimed at improving the functioning of political institutions and protecting human rights, but implementation has been slow and incomplete.", "The military and other state security forces were implicated in allegedly systematic and widespread abuses against civilians during large political demonstrations in 2007 and 2009. A Human Rights Watch investigation of security forces' actions during post-election unrest in November 2010 found that the security forces \"demonstrated a lack of neutrality in responding to the political and ethnic violence, and for targeting members of the Peuhl [Peul] ethnic group,\" possibly because the latter were seen as opposition supporters. Security forces' actions during more recent protests have also resulted in civilian deaths and injuries.", "Some Guinean activists contend that a truth and reconciliation process is needed to address allegations of state-backed human rights abuses stretching back to Guinea's first post-independence regime. The Guinean government, a U.N. Commission of Inquiry, and the International Criminal Court (ICC) have each conducted investigations into the 2009 brutal crackdown on civilian demonstrators, also known as the \"stadium massacre.\" A Guinean Panel of Judges has interviewed victims, sought to locate mass graves, and summoned senior officials and military officers. In 2013, charges were brought against several key commanders\u2014but only one low-level gendarme has been tried and convicted, and some of those who face charges have retained high-level state posts.

Prior to President Cond\u00e9's election in 2010, the country was ruled for 26 years by presidents who came to power in military coups. Successive army mutinies, a pattern of serious human rights abuses against civilians, and the incomplete integration of waves of irregular recruits significantly undermined the military's reputation, and the 2008 military coup revealed serious internal divisions along generational, ethnic, and factional lines. The military is disproportionately large by regional standards (estimated at over 45,000 personnel in 2010), with an aging force and a corps of officers that far outweighs the number of enlisted soldiers. ", "President Cond\u00e9 has leveraged a combination of strategic appointments, promotions, and forced retirements to exercise control over the armed forces. Cond\u00e9's home came under armed attack in July 2011, reportedly by disgruntled soldiers, after which several prominent officers were arrested or dismissed. There have not been episodes since then to suggest high-level civil-military tensions. The police and relatively professional gendarmes, not the military, have led the security response to recent protests in Conakry, lessening the potential for military abuses.", "Cond\u00e9 has pledged to prioritize security sector reform (SSR), for which the United States has provided support (see \" Foreign Assistance \" below). In November 2011, Cond\u00e9 announced the retirement of over 4,000 soldiers and paramilitary officers, with U.N. assistance to finance the cost of severance.

Some analysts posit that narcotics flows have increased in recent years, with a Reuters investigation in 2014 reporting that traffickers may have relocated to Guinea from Guinea-Bissau following the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency arrest of a top Guinea-Bissau military commander in 2013. The report also found that traffickers are operating in Guinea \"with the protection of senior civilian, military and police officials.\" The head of the country's top counter-narcotics agency is an individual implicated in the September 2009 security force massacre of protesters in Conakry, potentially complicating international cooperation efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Mining Sector", "paragraphs": ["Guinea's economy and budget depend on mineral exports, but erratic government decision-making and regulatory uncertainty have historically constituted serious concerns for mining firms. President Cond\u00e9 has identified mining sector reform as a priority, and in 2011 his administration promulgated a new mining code, amending it in 2013 in response to industry input. The code increases the required ownership stake for the Guinean government in all mining projects; introduces new procedures for obtaining mining permits; and raises taxes on mineral exports, among other provisions. Industry reactions have varied between strident criticism and a wait-and-see attitude. In February 2013, the government published all mining contracts online, an unprecedented move. The decision led Guinea to be determined \"compliant\" with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), an international effort to foster open and accountable management of natural resource revenues.
