According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), at the end of 2007, an estimated 33.2 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, of whom 2.5 million were newly infected, and 2.1 million died in the course of that year. More than 2 million of those living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2007 were children, and some 290,000 of those who died of AIDS that year were under 15 years old. On each day of 2007, some 1,000 children worldwide became newly infected with HIV, due in large part to little access to drugs that prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child. An estimated 9% of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries were offered services to prevent HIV transmission to their newborns.", "UNAIDS asserts that an effective fight against the global spread of HIV/AIDS would cost $15 billion in 2006, $18 billion in 2007, and $22 billion in 2008. In FY2006, Congress provided about $3.1 billion for international HIV/AIDS programs and U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria, $4.3 billion in FY2007, and $5.7 billion in FY2008. Most recent statistics indicate that in 2005, some $8.3 billion was spent on HIV/AIDS globally, though UNAIDS estimated that $11.6 billion was needed. About $4.3 billion of those funds were provided by donor governments. The Kaiser Family Foundation asserts that in 2005, the United States provided the largest percentage of HIV/AIDS assistance in the world, comprising some 49% of all donor spending.", "Although the United States is the leading provider of international HIV/AIDS assistance, some argue that it needs to give more, particularly to the Global Fund. Critics of increased AIDS spending, however, question whether the most affected region\u2014sub-Saharan Africa\u2014can absorb increased revenue flows. Some also contend that additional HIV/AIDS allocations will yield limited results, as poor health care systems and health worker shortages complicate efforts to scale up HIV/AIDS spending. While this report describes how HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are interlinked and exacerbate efforts to control each disease, it primarily addresses funding issues related to U.S. global HIV/AIDS initiatives. It provides background information on the key U.S. agencies that implement global HIV/AIDS programs, analyzes U.S. spending on HIV/AIDS by U.S. agency and department, and presents some issues Congress might consider, particularly as debate on PEPFAR reauthorization ensues. This report will not be updated; PEPFAR authorization expires in FY2008. Subsequent reports will analyze additional funding should the initiative be reauthorized."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["It is estimated that HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria together kill more than 6 million people each year.

An estimated 9% of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries were offered services to prevent HIV transmission to their newborns.", "Although tuberculosis (TB) is curable, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by the end of 2005 (the year for which the most current data are available), the disease killed 1.6 million people, including 195,000 who were also infected with HIV/AIDS. Some 8.8 million people were estimated to have contracted the disease in 2005, with about 84% of the cases having occurred in 22 countries. All but three of those high-burden countries were found in Africa or Asia. About half of all new TB cases were in six countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. More than 80% of those living with TB in 2005 were in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with the greatest per capita rate found in Africa.", "According to WHO, each year there are about 300 million acute malaria cases, which cause more than 1 million deaths annually. Health experts believe that between 85% and 90% of malaria deaths occur in Africa, mostly among children, killing an African child every 30 seconds.", "While HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are preventable diseases, their impacts have been catastrophic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Researchers have found that people infected with one of the three illnesses are more likely to contract either of the other two, and the symptoms are more severe in people with two or more of the diseases. According to WHO, 90% of people living with AIDS die within four to twelve months of contracting TB if they do not receive TB treatment. TB/HIV co-infection is a considerable burden in sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of the world's 14 million co-infected people live. As many as half of all HIV-positive people in Africa have TB (and one out of three dies of TB), and up to 80% of all African TB patients have HIV. Research has demonstrated that treatment of TB or HIV in co-infected patients has positive effects on halting the advancement of both diseases. Studies have shown that HIV replication increases during the active phase of TB and returns to baseline after successful TB therapy. Conversely, anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment may decrease the progression of latent TB to active TB, allowing those infected with HIV to live longer.", "Some research has also found that malaria contributes to the advancement of HIV replication, greater sexual transmission of HIV, and higher mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) rates among the co-infected. For example, one study in Malawi found that adults with acute malaria had a seven-fold increase in their HIV viral load. However, HIV viral loads decreased when malaria treatment was offered to some patients. Conversely, HIV-positive pregnant women were more likely to contract malaria than HIV-negative pregnant women. Additionally, malaria-HIV co-infection was associated with an increased risk of maternal, perinatal, and early infant death compared to infection of either disease alone. Researchers are also beginning to explore whether HIV-positive pregnant women who are co-infected with malaria are more likely to transmit HIV to their children. In Uganda, co-infected women had an HIV-transmission rate of 40%, while HIV-positive women not infected with malaria had an HIV transmission rate of 15.4%.", "Drug resistance complicates efforts to halt the spread of TB and malaria. WHO estimates that about 450,000 new multi-drug-resistant TB cases occur each year. In September 2006, WHO expressed concern about an increase in treatment-resistant TB cases, particularly in the Soviet Union, Asia, and South Africa. WHO found that Extensive Drug Resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant not only to the two main first-line TB drugs\u2014 isoniazid and rifampicin \u2014but also to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs. Health experts are particularly concerned about the most recent outbreak of XDR-TB in South Africa, which killed 52 out of 53 patients within 25 days on average, including those being treated with anti-retroviral medication. On October 9 and 10, 2006, WHO convened a meeting of a Global Task Force to review available data on XDR-TB incidence, and to develop an emergency XDR-TB action plan focused on containing the deadly strain and advising health practitioners on XDR-TB case management.", "Some experts believe that a steady rise in malarial deaths in sub-Saharan Africa is due in large part to an increase in treatment resistance. One of the commonly used drugs, chloroquine , is quickly becoming ineffective in treating those infected with malaria. Chloroquine is affordable to many, as it costs approximately 10 cents per course of treatment. Because it has been used for more than 50 years, however, resistant strains of malaria are rapidly developing, rendering the drug useless in a growing number of cases. Newer treatments that are more effective and have no observable resistance are considerably more expensive. The new drugs, called \"artemisinin-based combination therapies\" (ACTs), cost about $2 per treatment course, which is beyond the financial reach of many in the most affected regions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of Funding for U.S. Global HIV/AIDS Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "LIFE Initiative", "paragraphs": ["In July 1999, then-President Bill Clinton requested that Congress provide an additional $100 million to fund his Leadership and Investment in Fighting an Epidemic (LIFE) Initiative.

Specifically, President Clinton proposed that Congress allocate $48 million to global AIDS prevention, $23 million to home- and community-based care, $10 million to children orphaned by AIDS, and $19 million to infrastructure and capacity development.", "In FY2000, Congress provided more for global HIV/AIDS programs than President Clinton requested for his LIFE Initiative, directing $189.3 million to USAID for global HIV/AIDS activities; and appropriating $46.7 million to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Global AIDS Program (GAP), providing the first bilateral HIV/AIDS appropriation to an U.S. agency other than the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).", "In FY2001, Congress expanded appropriations for global HIV/AIDS programs to the Departments of Agriculture ( P.L. 106-387 ), Defense ( P.L. 106-259 ), and Labor ( P.L. 106-554 ); and provided funds for the first U.S. Global Fund contribution ( P.L. 106-429 ). Some HIV/AIDS analysts contend that the LIFE Initiative raised congressional awareness about potential implications of a global HIV/AIDS epidemic, led to an increase in U.S. spending on global HIV/AIDS, and enhanced congressional receptivity to President George Bush's Emergency AIDS Plan, which he would announce three years later. While advocating for the LIFE Initiative, U.S. officials argued that HIV/AIDS was more than a health issue.

In May 2003, Congress authorized sufficient funds to support the initiative through P.L. 108-25 , the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act (the Leadership Act).", "Each fiscal year since the inception of PEPFAR, Congress has allocated more than the Administration has requested for global HIV/AIDS programs. Congress exceeded the President's five-year spending proposal for PEPFAR by nearly $5 billion. From FY2004 through FY2008, Congress provided almost $20 billion to fight the global spread of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, of which $18.3 billion was appropriated for global HIV/AIDS programs and the Global Fund ( Table 2 ). The President's FY2008 budget request included about $5.8 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts.

Meanwhile, U.S. agencies and departments implement additional international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs not funded through PEPFAR. In each fiscal year since PEPFAR was launched, appropriators have included a chart in the foreign operations appropriations conference reports that itemizes how global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria funds are authorized to be spent (see Table 2 ). Most public documents refer to this chart as \"PEPFAR appropriations.\"", "Since FY2007, however, Congress has not included appropriations to global malaria efforts in the \"PEPFAR appropriations.\" Instead, global malaria funds are provided through the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). In June 2005, President Bush launched PMI to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by more than $1.2 billion between FY2006 and FY2010 in 15 countries. Since launching PMI, the Administration has requested that all support for bilateral malaria efforts be provided to USAID as the coordinating agency for the initiative. When the Administration shifted leadership for bilateral malaria programs to USAID in FY2005, it determined that the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) would no longer include malaria spending in its annual PEPFAR reports to Congress and that budgetary requests for the disease would be made separately from HIV/AIDS and TB requests.", "While authorizing legislation for PEPFAR requires the President to submit to appropriators an annual report that describes how U.S. funds support the prevention of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, as well as care and treatment for those affected by the three diseases, the annual reports that OGAC has submitted have reported only on U.S. global HIV/AIDS activities and services provided to those co-infected with HIV/AIDS and TB. There is some debate about whether malaria should be included in PEPFAR spending estimates. U.S. spending on international malaria activities are included herein, because in the first two fiscal years that PEPFAR was implemented, the Administration included spending on HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria in its reports to Congress; the Leadership Act authorized support for all three diseases; and the act required that the President report on progress made in addressing HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "PEPFAR-Participating Departments and Agencies", "paragraphs": ["A number of U.S. departments and agencies are responsible for implementing PEPFAR programs, though OGAC coordinates the distribution of most U.S. global HIV/AIDS spending.
