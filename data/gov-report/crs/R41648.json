The Social Security payroll tax rate in 2011 was 4.2% for employees and 10.4% for self-employed workers. P.L. 111-312 made no changes to the Social Security payroll tax rate for employers (6.2%) or to the amount of wages and net self-employment income subject to the Social Security payroll tax ($106,800 in 2011). It provided general revenue transfers to the Social Security trust funds to make up for the loss of payroll tax revenues. A worker's future benefits are not affected.", "The temporary reduction in the payroll tax for employees and the self-employed in 2011 was intended to provide an economic stimulus by increasing workers' take-home pay. For example, the annual Social Security withholding for a worker earning the average wage in 2011 (an estimated $44,687) was lower by about $894. The annual Social Security withholding for a worker earning the maximum taxable wage ($106,800 in 2011) was lower by $2,136.", "On December 23, 2011, a measure to extend the payroll tax reduction for workers for two months (through February 2012) was passed by the House and the Senate and signed into law by President Obama (H.R. 3765, P.L. 112-78). On February 17, 2012, the House and the Senate agreed to the conference report on H.R. 3630, which further extends the payroll tax reduction for workers through the end of calendar year 2012. H.R. 3630 was signed into law by President Obama on February 22, 2012 (P.L. 112-96). The Social Security payroll tax for workers in effect through December 2012 is 4.2% (rather than 6.2%). In March 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the transfers from the general fund to the Social Security trust funds resulting from the 2 percentage point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax for workers in calendar years 2011 and 2012 will total $224 billion in FY2011-FY2013.", "The temporary reduction in the Social Security payroll tax for employees and the self-employed has drawn mixed reactions from policymakers. Some observers express concern about the potential impact of the payroll tax reduction on Social Security's long-term finances, despite the general revenue transfers to protect the trust funds from a loss of payroll tax revenues. These observers point out that, although the payroll tax reduction is temporary, the possibility remains that Congress could continue to extend the payroll tax reduction or make the payroll tax reduction permanent in response to political or other pressures.

FICA taxes are paid by both employers and employees, but it is employers who remit the taxes to the U.S. Treasury. Employers remit FICA taxes on a regular basis throughout the year (for example, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually), depending on the employer's level of total employment taxes (Social Security, Medicare, and federal individual income tax withholding).", "The FICA tax rate of 7.65% each for employers and employees has two components: 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI). Under current law, employers and employees each pay 6.2% of covered wages, up to an annual limit, in Social Security payroll taxes. The SECA tax rate is 15.3% for self-employed individuals, with 12.4% for Social Security and 2.9% for Medicare HI. Self-employed individuals pay 12.4% of net self-employment income, up to an annual limit, in Social Security payroll taxes. One-half of the SECA taxes are allowed as a deduction for federal income tax purposes. SECA taxes are normally paid once a year as part of filing an annual individual income tax return.", "In addition to Social Security payroll taxes, the Social Security program has two other sources of income. Certain Social Security beneficiaries must include a portion of Social Security benefits in taxable income for the federal income tax, and the Social Security program receives part of those tax revenues. In addition, the Social Security program receives interest from the U.S. Treasury on its investments in special U.S. government obligations.", "As the Managing Trustee of the Social Security trust funds, the Secretary of the Treasury is required by law to invest Social Security revenues in interest-bearing federal government securities (special issues) held by the trust funds. The revenues exchanged for the federal government securities are deposited into the general fund of the U.S. Treasury and are indistinguishable from revenues in the general fund that come from other sources. Because the assets held by the trust funds are federal government securities, the trust fund balance represents the amount of money owed to the Social Security trust funds by the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. Funds needed to pay Social Security benefits and administrative expenses come from the redemption or sale of federal government securities held by the trust funds.", "Based on the program's current financing and benefit structure, the Social Security Board of Trustees projects that Social Security expenditures will exceed tax revenues (or non-interest income) each year from 2012 to 2086 (i.e., the program will operate with annual cash-flow deficits). When interest income to the trust funds is taken into account, the trustees project that the Social Security trust funds will have a total surplus each year from 2012 to 2020 (i.e., total income\u2014tax revenues plus interest income\u2014will exceed Social Security expenditures). As a result, the balance in the Social Security trust funds (the amount of assets held by the trust funds in the form of federal government securities) is projected to increase each year from 2012 to 2020. Beginning in 2021, however, trust fund reserves will begin to be drawn down to help pay benefits and administrative expenses.", "Over the next 75 years (2012 to 2086), the Social Security trustees project that program costs will exceed income on average by an amount equal to 2.67% of taxable payroll (stated another way, on average, costs are projected to exceed income by approximately 19%). The trustees also project that the assets held by the trust funds will be exhausted in 2033. Social Security benefits scheduled under current law can be paid in full until trust fund assets are exhausted (2033). After the trust fund reserves are exhausted, incoming Social Security receipts are projected to be sufficient to pay 75% of benefits scheduled under current law in 2033 and 73% of scheduled benefits in 2086."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Temporary Payroll Tax Reduction for Workers in 2011", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, the Social Security payroll tax rate is 6.2% for employers and employees (each) and 12.4% for the self-employed.
