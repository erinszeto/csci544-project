It was created by Congress in 1970 to preserve some level of intercity passenger rail service while enabling private rail companies to exit the money-losing passenger rail business. It is a quasi-governmental entity, a corporation whose stock is almost entirely owned by the federal government. It runs a deficit each year. Congressional appropriations cover about half its total loss, and represent essentially all of its funding for capital maintenance and improvements.", "Amtrak can be divided into three parts. There is its Northeast Corridor (NEC) service between Washington, DC, and Boston, where Amtrak owns much of the infrastructure and operates frequent service using its fastest trains. There is its long-distance service, in which infrequent trains crisscross the country over tracks owned by freight rail companies. And there is its state-supported service, in which Amtrak operates shorter-distance trains under contract with states. Amtrak was last authorized in 2008, in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act. That authorization expired at the end of FY2013. Amtrak's annual appropriations do not rely on separate authorization legislation, but authorization legislation does allow Congress to set multiyear Amtrak funding goals and federal intercity passenger rail policies.", "Since Amtrak's inception, Congress has been divided on the question of whether it should even exist. Amtrak is regularly criticized for failing to cover its costs, and thus requiring federal assistance. The need for federal financial support is often cited as evidence that passenger rail service is not financially viable, or that Amtrak should yield to private companies that would find ways to provide rail service profitably. Yet it is not clear that a private company could perform the same range of activities better than Amtrak does. Indeed, Amtrak was created because private-sector railroad companies in the United States lost money for decades operating intercity passenger rail service and wished to be relieved of the obligation to do so.", "By some measures, Amtrak is performing as well as or better than it ever has in its 44-year history. For example, it is carrying a record number of passengers, and its passenger load factor and its operating ratio are at the upper end of their historic ranges. On the other hand, Amtrak's plans do not envision significant decreases in its need for federal funding. Among the perennial questions that Congress may examine in considering reauthorizing Amtrak are whether Amtrak should continue to exist, what range of services it should offer, the appropriate level of federal financial support for Amtrak, its relations with states and with private rail companies, and its level of accountability to Congress.", "On March 4, 2015, the House passed H.R. 749, the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015. This bill would authorize $7 billion for federal passenger rail programs over FY2016-FY2019, including $5.8 billion for grants to Amtrak and $1.2 billion for grants to states. It would also restructure Amtrak's financial structure, provide grants to states on the NEC for passenger rail improvement projects, streamline environmental review for passenger and freight rail construction projects, and make a variety of other changes in federal passenger rail policies."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Amtrak\u2014officially, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation\u2014is the nation's primary provider of intercity passenger rail service.

Amtrak was created by Congress in 1970 to preserve a basic level of intercity passenger rail service, while relieving private railroad companies of the obligation to provide money-losing passenger service. Although created as a for-profit corporation, Amtrak has never made a profit; in this it resembles both the experience of the private-sector companies that preceded it and of intercity passenger rail operators in many other countries. During the 44 years from 1971 to 2015, federal assistance to Amtrak amounted to approximately $78 billion in constant 2015 dollars (see Appendix , Table A-1 ).", "Amtrak's approximately 20,000 employees operate trains and maintain its infrastructure. It carries around 31 million passengers annually, providing slightly less than 1% of total U.S. intercity passenger miles traveled by common carrier (see Table 1 ). The company operates approximately 44 routes over 21,000 miles of track. Most of that track is owned by freight rail companies; Amtrak owns about 625 route miles. The primary section it owns\u2014the Northeast Corridor (NEC)\u2014includes some of the most heavily used segments of track in the nation. The NEC is used not only by Amtrak's intercity trains, but also by regional commuter lines and some freight trains. By far, the greatest volume of NEC traffic consists of commuter trains, not Amtrak trains. Amtrak also operates corridor routes (covering distances under 400 miles) and long-distance routes (over 400 miles in length). Some of Amtrak's corridor routes are financially supported by states they serve.

That loss was covered by federal capital and operating grants which are made to Amtrak by the DOT. In recent years, these federal grants have often covered Amtrak's operating loss, with some funding left over. The federal grant in excess of the operating loss and debt service essentially represents the funding Amtrak has available to undertake activities outside of keeping its trains running and covering depreciation of its assets, such as improving its infrastructure and bringing station platforms into compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements.", "Amtrak's federal funding is primarily provided within the Department of Transportation's appropriation.

Like other railroad companies, Amtrak's operations require extensive spending on the maintenance and improvement of track, rolling stock, signaling systems, and other facilities. Roughly half of Amtrak's budget comes from federal funding appropriated on a year-to-year basis by Congress. The Department of Transportation's Inspector General has noted that the lack of long-term funding \"has significantly affected Amtrak's ability to maintain safe and reliable infrastructure and equipment, and increased its capital program's annual cost.\" Amtrak has long sought some measure of certainty in its level of federal funding.", "Amtrak authorization legislation has often authorized federal funding over a period of several years. But those authorization levels are not binding on appropriators. By contrast, the authorizations for highway and transit programs in surface transportation authorization legislation are typically in the form of a special form of budget authority (contract authority) drawn from a trust fund, which provides more predictable funding. There have been proposals to create a trust fund for Amtrak, in order to provide a greater level of stability to Amtrak's federal funding.", "Such efforts have faced both a policy challenge and a practical challenge. The policy challenge is related to the issue of funding uncertainty; one reason that Amtrak's federal funding is uncertain is that some Members of Congress are opposed to Amtrak receiving federal funding, and therefore oppose providing a more predictable level of future federal funding. The practical challenge is to identify where the revenues for an Amtrak trust fund would come from. The level of federal funding that Amtrak receives could not be provided solely from a tax on Amtrak passengers; to provide the same level of federal funding Amtrak currently receives, the tax on passengers would have to be roughly two-thirds of the current ticket cost. Such a large cost increase would likely reduce ridership, so the tax would probably not raise the desired amount of revenue.", "Another means of providing a reliable funding source might involve setting aside money from the existing Highway Trust Fund (HTF). This approach has met with opposition on the basis of both principle (the argument being that the HTF's revenue comes from road users, mainly through motor fuels taxes, and should be used for road-related purposes) and practicality (the revenues flowing into the HTF are far below the level required to maintain the existing level of federal highway and transit spending provided by the fund).", "In recent years, the shortfall in revenues to the highway trust fund, compared to its level of expenditures, has led Congress to transfer significant sums from the general fund of the Treasury to maintain the trust fund's solvency: $34.5 billion during the period FY2008-FY2010, and another $18.8 billion during the period FY2013-FY2014. Joseph Boardman, the CEO of Amtrak, has pointed to these transfers as undermining the principal argument against providing HTF funding to Amtrak, since a significant portion of HTF funding now comes from general revenues rather than highway-related taxes. He has urged that intercity passenger rail be eligible for funding from the portion of HTF funds coming from general fund revenues.

The Northeast Corridor traverses one of the most densely populated and economically important corridors in the world and carries over 259 million passengers annually (the vast majority aboard trains run by regional commuter operators). The NEC also carries freight trains run by private railroads. (Amtrak also inherited 96 miles of track in Michigan, and controls short lengths of track in other locations.)

This has caused problems for Amtrak's efforts to improve service on the NEC.

A 2008 analysis by the DOT IG estimated that reducing the New York-Washington travel time from nearly three to two-and-a-half hours and the New York-Boston travel time from over three-and-a-half to three hours would result in an average of $500 million in annual benefits (in 2006 dollars). Most of that was estimated to come from air passengers shifting to the train as its travel times shrank. The impact might be less now, as Amtrak's share of the air/rail market on the NEC has increased since that report was written.", "Amtrak has published a plan for improvements to the NEC.

Recognizing that improvements to the NEC would require collaboration between many groups, in PRIIA Congress directed the DOT to create a Northeast Corridor Infrastructure and Operations Advisory Commission.

Amtrak replaced the Niantic River Bridge in Connecticut in 2012, where trains were restricted to 45 mph, at a cost of $140 million. Amtrak also seeks to replace the Portal Bridge in New Jersey, the Susquehanna River Bridge in Maryland, and several bridges in Connecticut. In Baltimore, trains must slow to 30 mph through a series of three tunnels.

Amtrak estimates that the new tunnels will take 12 years to construct at a cost of $1.26 billion. Once the new tunnels are functional, Amtrak would repair the old tunnels, eventually using both rights-of-way. Amtrak received $450 million to upgrade electrical power, signal systems, and overhead catenary wires on a 24-mile section of track between New Brunswick, NJ and Morrisville, PA. The upgrades will allow train speed to increase over this section from 135 mph to 160 mph, shaving 15 to 20 minutes from the trip time between New York City and Philadelphia. The estimated completion date is September 2017.

These include the following:", "High costs due to lack of scale economies. Amtrak does not purchase enough equipment with enough frequency to establish a robust domestic manufacturing base. The Sumitomo purchase of 130 bi-level cars represents a step towards forming an equipment pool of standard cars that will be used on shorter-distance corridor services, as called for in Section 305 of PRIIA. The intent of this provision was to achieve economies of scale not only in the cars' manufacture, but also in repair and parts replacement. However, there is a risk that equipment standardization could retard development of innovative car designs and dampen competition among manufacturers. Lack of import competition. By law, passenger rail equipment must abide by certain domestic manufacturing requirements. Also, FRA safety standards put greater emphasis on crash survivability than crash avoidance compared to foreign standards. The need for bulkheads at the ends of cars generally makes U.S. equipment much heavier than foreign equipment, meaning that foreign car designs cannot simply be produced in U.S. plants. This likely increases Amtrak's cost to acquire equipment. Equipment lease arrangements. Amtrak does not actually own much of its rolling stock. Amtrak has sold locomotives and passenger cars to banks that can claim tax benefits (depreciation) while Amtrak rents the equipment from them. In Section 205 of PRIIA, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with Amtrak and the Secretary of Transportation, to restructure Amtrak's capital leases. This authorization expired in October 2010. Under this authority, Amtrak restructured 13 capital leases, including sale and lease-back arrangements for its locomotive and passenger car fleet, at a cost of $420 million, but with ultimate savings of $152 million. The Amtrak IG has reported that 39 additional capital leases that could result in savings of $426 million, at a cost of $638 million, are still available if Congress were to extend the authorization to negotiate early buyout options.

Concrete ties are supposed to last twice as long as wood ties (50 to 60 years instead of 25 to 30), can be spaced a few inches farther apart than wood ties, and are better at withstanding certain train forces. For this reason, they are a cornerstone to upgrading track for higher speed passenger service.", "In 2007, Amtrak began finding that relatively new concrete ties on the NEC were cracking and required replacement. Amtrak replaced 95,000 ties in FY2008, 130,000 ties in FY2009, 207,000 ties in FY2010, and is planning to replace 170,000 ties per year from FY2011 through FY2013 and 120,000 ties per year from FY2014 through FY2016.

Amtrak has also disclosed that its New England Division has budgeted $64 million for concrete tie replacement, of which $50 million is provided from ARRA and $14 million is from its FY2009 federal grant, and that its Mid-Atlantic Division is using $51 million of stimulus funds to replace failing concrete ties. Amtrak states that replacing the ties can cost up to three times the original cost of installation. Amtrak's Office of Inspector General concluded in a September 2013 report that the railroad had taken positive steps to minimize the risk of procuring more defective concrete ties.", "Other railroads have also encountered problems with concrete ties. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which operates Metro-North and Long Island commuter railroads in New York, sued Rocla in 2006 and is receiving 260,000 replacement ties from the supplier and $1 million per year for 10 years to defray the labor costs of installing them. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) sued Rocla for the estimated $92 million cost of replacing 147,000 concrete ties with wood ties on 61 miles of track, but settled for $6 million.

Another complicating factor is that most station platforms used by Amtrak are owned by freight railroads, which generally do not permit platforms higher than 8 inches above the top of the rails in order to prevent physical conflicts with the freight rail rolling stock. Consequently, in most stations where freight and passenger trains operate on the same track, it is difficult to provide wheelchair-accessible level boarding platforms.", "In 2011, after five years of consideration, DOT issued a final rule on ADA compliance for intercity and commuter passenger rail stations. The rule requires passenger railroads to provide level-entry boarding at stations not shared with freight rail operations. At stations that are shared with freight rail operations, passenger railroads may choose among several options to provide access to rail cars for persons with disabilities.

The distinctive feature of PTC is that an automatic override system or a dispatcher from a remote location could slow a train down or stop it in order to avoid a collision if the engineer fails to comply with a signal indication. The system relies on radio communications among a locomotive, track-side equipment, and a control center. PTC is intended to prevent accidents due to excessive train speed or conflicting train movements. As currently conceived, it will not address accidents caused by trespassers on railroad property, vehicles blocking tracks at grade crossings, or other factors.", "Before enactment of Section 104, passenger and freight railroads were developing systems that could remotely control train movements, but there was no requirement that these systems be interoperable. Interoperability is a significant concern for Amtrak, which operates its trains over track owned by many different railroads and hosts freight and commuter railroads' trains on its own tracks.", "Amtrak began installation of a PTC system in 2000 on some NEC tracks as part of FRA requirements for higher speed Acela service. Amtrak stated that it would complete installation of PTC over the tracks it owns by the end of 2012, with installation on the NEC estimated to cost $264 million. Amtrak has had to install a different version of PTC on tracks it owns in Michigan, and must install PTC equipment on its diesel locomotives that is compatible with the host railroads' versions of PTC. ", "In some cases, the presence of Amtrak trains on freight lines is the sole trigger of the PTC requirement, because the lines in question do not carry poisonous or toxic products. As Amtrak is required to pay host railroads for the incremental costs of operating its trains, it would be responsible for PTC installation in these circumstances, but Amtrak has stated it does not have the funds to install PTC on tracks it does not own.

First and foremost, poor on-time performance reduces ridership (and ticket revenue). Secondly, it increases crew, fuel, and other operating costs. For Acela service, a train is considered on-time if it arrives at its final destination within 10 minutes of the scheduled time. This is also the standard for any routes less than 250 miles. For longer routes, the standard depends on distance, with 30 minutes being the allowance for trips over 550 miles.", "Amtrak's on-time performance over a recent three-month period is shown in Table 7 .", "Outside of the NEC, Amtrak trains run predominantly on track owned by freight railroads, and much of the delay on these routes is related to sharing track with freight trains. The host freight railroad controls all the trains running on its network, including Amtrak trains. Freight railroads use automated systems that dispatch trains when all trains are running on schedule, but delays or unanticipated problems usually require that a human dispatcher intervene to make train control decisions. According to data recorded by Amtrak train conductors, interference from freight trains was the leading cause of Amtrak delays in FY2012. \"Slow order\" track\u2014track that is subject to a temporarily reduced speed limit until repair or maintenance can be performed\u2014was the second-leading cause of Amtrak delays. Signal problems and interference from other passenger trains were the third- and fourth-leading causes of delay. ", "Figures on the causes of delays are based on the recordings of Amtrak train conductors. Freight railroads contend that the data are inaccurate because conductors may not be aware of the root causes of delay; for instance, the conductor of an Amtrak train stuck behind a freight train might record the cause of delay as \"freight train interference\" even though the freight train could be stopped because of a railroad crossing accident further ahead. ", "Several circumstances exacerbate interference between freight and Amtrak trains. A surge in rail shipments of oil from the Bakken formation in North Dakota has led to frequent delays on routes in the upper Midwest. In some areas, construction to add additional trackage in response to this additional traffic has caused delays in train movements. On some route segments, Amtrak uses a secondary route of the owning freight railroad, which may not want to invest in improving the performance of that segment. Off the NEC, about 70% of the mileage over which Amtrak operates consists of a single track with sidings, meaning that a single late train can cause many other trains to be delayed. Amtrak trains, which travel faster than most freights, require more headway clearance, complicating operations on a heavily used freight corridor."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Amtrak's Terms of Access to Freight Track", "paragraphs": ["In 1973, shortly after Amtrak's creation, Congress granted Amtrak \"preference\" over freight trains in using a rail line, junction, or crossing ( P.L. 93-146 , \u00a710(2), 87 Stat. 548). In Amtrak's view, this \"preference\" should be enforced each time a dispatcher makes a decision involving an Amtrak train and a freight train. The freight railroads believe that the entire fluidity of the route has to be taken into consideration, and that this sometimes may involve giving priority to a freight over an Amtrak train in order to avoid delays on a larger scale. ", "Under the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-518, 84 Stat. 1327), Amtrak pays the host railroads for the incremental costs specific to Amtrak's usage of track, for instance, the additional track maintenance costs required for passenger trains. Amtrak is not required to contribute any share to a freight railroad's overhead costs. Based on agreements it has negotiated with each freight railroad, Amtrak provides incentive payments to host railroads when its trains arrive on time. Part of this negotiation involves agreeing on a schedule for Amtrak trains. The DOT IG reported in 2008 that three of the four host freight railroads visited regard the incentive payments as insufficient to influence the way they dispatch Amtrak trains. There are also penalty provisions for late trains, but they only come into effect if the host railroad has received incentive payments within the last 12 months. In recent years, Amtrak has paid an average of $100 million annually to the freight railroads for track usage and on-time incentive payments. This equates to about 0.2% of the freight railroads' annual freight revenues and about 1% of their annual capital expenditures.

If the STB determines that a host freight railroad has failed to provide preference to Amtrak trains, the STB may award damages against the host freight railroad and order other relief. The freight railroads challenged the constitutionality of this statute, arguing that Amtrak, as a private corporation, cannot have rule-making authority in developing performance standards and that the statute violates their due-process rights. On March 9, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that Amtrak is a government entity for the purpose of developing the performance standards; it remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to consider the lawfulness of the standards.", "In January 2012, Amtrak filed its first complaint with the STB under the PRIIA on-time performance provision. The complaint is against Canadian National Railroad (CN) for failing to comply with the metrics and standards on several routes serving Chicago. This STB case illustrates the key issue for Congress: can passenger trains be accommodated on busy freight tracks without jeopardizing another national policy goal\u2014supporting freight railroads' effort to divert freight traffic from trucks on congested highways. As one freight rail executive has stated, \"Taking rail capacity from freight to provide rail capacity for passengers is not the answer to America's congestion problems, as it will only shift thousands of trucks onto highways.\"", "Interestingly, Amtrak's complaint is against the freight railroad and over the same routes where the concept of the \"scheduled\" freight railroad originated. In its pleading with the STB, CN refers to erratic and unpredictable Amtrak trains that regularly miss their allotted time slots on CN tracks due to Amtrak trains running out of fuel, locomotives breaking down, and crews reaching their hours-of-service limit at unscheduled locations. CN claims that Amtrak's poor performance is interfering with its tightly scheduled freight operations, while Amtrak claims that its delays on CN's track are far worse than on any other Class I railroad. Amtrak has since narrowed the scope of its petition, which is still before the STB.", "In November 2014, Amtrak filed its second complaint against a host freight railroad for causing delays to its passenger trains, in this case against Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads for delays on Amtrak's Capital Limited route between Washington, DC, and Chicago."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Is Delay an Operations or Infrastructure Issue?", "paragraphs": ["It is not clear to what extent more infrastructure (parallel tracking, upgrading signal systems, etc.) is necessary to alleviate the conflict between freight and Amtrak trains.

The study also found that the amount of delay due to host railroad practices varied considerably among host railroads. These findings suggest that modifying the dispatching practices of host freight railroads and improving track maintenance could be the primary means of improving Amtrak's on-time performance, while investment in expanding capacity may be less important.", "As economic growth returns and freight traffic increases, and states begin implementing plans to increase passenger train speeds over certain routes (from a prevailing maximum of 79 mph to 110 mph), tension between freight and passenger use of track is likely to intensify. However, the freight railroads do have an economic incentive to build sufficient infrastructure to allow for faster freight trains. This would allow them to capture cargo that is both more lucrative and has tremendous volume potential: parcel, refrigerated, and short-haul intermodal. Freight railroads are trying to \"win back\" some of the refrigerated cargo they have lost to trucks. They realize that there is a large untapped market (especially in the eastern United States) if they can make rail service competitive with trucks for shipments of 350 to 750 miles.
