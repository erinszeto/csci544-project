The authority to issue these national security letters (NSL) is comparable to the authority to issue administrative subpoenas. The USA PATRIOT Act (P.L. 107-56) expanded the authority under the original four NSL statutes and created a fifth. Thereafter, the authority was reported to have been widely used. Then, a report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General (IG) found that in its use of expanded USA PATRIOT Act authority the FBI had \"used NSLs in violation of applicable NSL statutes, Attorney General Guidelines, and internal FBI policies,\" although it concluded that no criminal laws had been broken. A year later, a second IG report confirmed the findings of the first, and noted the corrective measures taken in response. A third IG report, critical of the FBI's use of exigent letters and informal NSL alternatives, noted that the practice had been stopped and related problems addressed.", "The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act (P.L. 109-177, and its companion, P.L. 109-178) amended the five NSL statutes to expressly provide for judicial review of both the NSLs and the confidentiality requirements that attend them. The sections were made explicitly subject to judicial enforcement and to sanctions for failure to comply with an NSL request or to breach NSL confidentiality requirements. Prospects of its continued use dimmed, however, after two lower federal courts held that the absolute confidentiality requirements and the limitations on judicial review rendered one of the NSL statutes constitutionally suspect.", "The President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies recommended several NSL statutory adjustments designed to eliminate differences between NSLs and court orders under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"\u00a7215 orders\"), including requiring pre-issuance judicial approval of NSLs. Instead in the USA FREEDOM Act, P.L. 114-23 (H.R. 2048), Congress opted to adjust the NSL judicial review provisions governing the nondisclosure requirements which may accompany NSLs. It also precludes the use of NSL authority for bulk collection of communications or financial records. Finally, it adjusts existing reporting requirements to permit recipients to publicly disclose the extent to which they have been compelled to comply with NSLs.", "The text of the five NSL statutory provisions has been appended.

Congress initially acted, without a great deal of analysis on the record, to be sure the exception was not too broadly construed. But the exception was just that, an exception. It was neither an affirmative grant of authority to request information nor a command to financial institutions to provided information when asked. It removed the restrictions on the release of customer information imposed on financial institutions by the Right to Financial Privacy Act, but it left them free to decline to comply when asked to do so.", "[I]n certain significant instances, financial institutions [had] declined to grant the FBI access to financial records in response to requests under [S]ection 1114(a). The FBI informed the Committee that the problem occurs particularly in States which have State constitutional privacy protection provisions or State banking privacy laws. In those States, financial institutions decline to grant the FBI access because State law prohibits them from granting such access and the RFPA, since it permits but does not mandate such access, does not override State law. In such a situation, the concerned financial institutions which might otherwise desire to grant the FBI access to a customer's record will not do so, because State law does not allow such cooperation, and cooperation might expose them to liability to the customer whose records the FBI sought access.", "Congress responded with passage of the first NSL statute as an amendment to the Right to Financial Privacy Act, affirmatively giving the FBI access to financial institution records in certain foreign intelligence cases. At the same time in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, it afforded the FBI comparable access to the telephone company and other communications service provider customer information. Together the two NSL provisions afforded the FBI access to communications and financial business records under limited circumstances\u2014customer and customer transaction information held by telephone carriers and banks pertaining to a foreign power or its agents relevant to a foreign counter-intelligence investigation.", "Both the communications provider section and the Right to Financial Privacy Act section contained nondisclosure provisions and limitations on further dissemination except pursuant of guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General.

The FBI asked for the Fair Credit Reporting Act amendment as a threshold mechanism to enable it to make more effective use of its bank record access authority:", "FBI's right of access under the Right of Financial Privacy Act cannot be effectively used, however, until the FBI discovers which financial institutions are being utilized by the subject of a counterintelligence investigation. Consumer reports maintained by credit bureaus are a ready source of such information, but, although such report[s] are readily available to the private sector, they are not available to FBI counterintelligence investigators....", "FBI has made a specific showing ... that the effort to identify financial institutions in order to make use of FBI authority under the Right to Financial Privacy Act can not only be time-consuming and resource-intensive, but can also require the use of investigative techniques\u2014such as physical and electronic surveillance, review of mail covers, and canvassing of all banks in an area\u2014that would appear to be more intrusive than the review of credit reports.

Maryland , Court precedent suggested that the scheme must include prompt judicial review at the petition and burden of the regulator.", "Yet, the courts had been unwilling to classify as constitutionally suspect all instances of apparent prior restraint. The government in its presentation to the Second Circuit pointed to a number of instances where withstanding an apparent prior restraint regulators were held to a less demanding standard\u2014citing cases involving pre-trial discovery gag orders, grand jury secrecy, the confidentiality surrounding inquiry into judicial misconduct, and the secrecy agreements signed by national security employees. ", "In fact, when the Supreme Court had assessed the First Amendment validity of a pre-trial discovery gag order, it concluded that the relevant questions were two: first, \"whether the practice in question furthers an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression;\" and second, \"whether the limitation of First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved.\"", "The members of the Second Circuit panel could not agree on whether the NSL statute, as amended, constituted a prior restraint subject to strict scrutiny analysis, or should be judged by a somewhat less demanding standard. The lack of consensus proved of little consequence, because the government conceded that strict scrutiny analysis was appropriate, and because the panel agreed the result would be the same under the factor common to both standards\u2014whether the restriction on expression crafted to protect the government's interest was narrowly tailored for that purpose.

If the NSL recipient declines timely to precipitate Government-initiated judicial review, the nondisclosure requirement would continue, subject to the recipient's existing opportunities for annual challenges to the nondisclosure requirement provided by subsection 3511(b). If such an annual challenge is made, the standards and burden of proof that we have specified for an initial challenge would apply, although the Government would not be obliged to initiate judicial review.", "Given the possibility of constitutional application, the court saw no reason to invalidate the NSL statute and Section 3511(b) in toto.

A federal district court there agreed with the Second Circuit that the NSL confidentiality and judicial review provisions were constitutionally suspect.

[T]he sorts of multiple inferences required to save the provisions at issue are not only contrary to evidence of Congressional intent, but also contrary to the statutory language and structure of the statutory provisions actually enacted by Congress.", "The district court also concluded that, if the confidentiality and judicial review provisions could not survive, neither could the remainder of the NSL authority.

NSL procedures, it said, should more closely resemble those of FISA \"business record\" court orders (\"\u00a7215 orders\"). Thus, it proposed that (1) the courts approve all NSLs except in emergency circumstances; (2) Section 215 orders be used only in international terrorism and international espionage investigations; (3) the NSL statutes be amended to track Section 215 minimization requirements; (4) both NSLs and Section 215 orders should be subject to greater oversight and public reporting requirements. ", "Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act had amended the business records provisions of FISA. As amended, FISA authorizes court orders for the production of tangible items held by individuals and private entities in certain foreign intelligence cases. Section 215 orders provide government access to business records in certain intelligence investigations; NSLs also provide government access to business records in certain intelligence investigations. FISA court judges issue Section 215 orders; FBI officials issue NSLs. The Group recommended that \"statutes that authorize the issuance of National Security Letters should be amended to permit the issuance of National Security Letters only upon a judicial finding that: (1) the government has reasonable grounds to believe that the particular information sought is relevant to an authorized investigation intended to protect 'against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities' and (2) like a subpoena, the order is reasonable in focus, scope, and breadth.\" It explained that", "For all the well-established reasons for requiring neutral and detached judges to decide when government investigators may invade an individual's privacy, there is a strong argument that NSLs should not be issued by the FBI itself.... [F]oreign intelligence investigations are especially likely to implicate highly sensitive and personal information and to have potentially severe consequences for the individuals under investigation. We are unable to identify a principled reason why NSLs should be issued by FBI officials when [Section] 215 orders and orders for pen registers and trap-and-trace surveillance must be issued by the [FISA court].", "Without further adjustments, the proposed Section 215-NSL symmetry would be less than perfect. Requiring judicial approval of both would be a first step in that direction. The Group, however, did not suggest that the FISA court should approve all NSLs. It readily conceded that the 60-a-day rate at which the FBI issues NSLs would overwhelm the FISA court as currently constituted. It offered several alternative solutions, including enlarging the FISA court, but endorsed none of the alternatives.", "The Group would also eliminate the gap that exists between when an NSL may be issued and when a Section 215 order may be issued. Section 215 orders are available for investigations in addition to the international terrorism or international espionage inquiries that support NSL issuance under most statutes. Beyond terrorism and espionage, Section 215 orders are available to secure \"foreign intelligence information\" as long as it does not relate to a \"U.S. person.\" Foreign intelligence information encompasses information about foreign nations and foreign entities useful for the conduct of U.S. foreign relations. The Group endeavored to create compatibility by shaving off the difference; it would allow Section 215 orders only in conjunction with international terrorism or espionage investigations. ", "Section 215 orders are subject to limitations as to how the information they generate may be used, stored, shared, and kept or disposed of (minimization standards). The Group considered \"the oversight and minimization requirements governing the use of NSLs ... much less rigorous than those imposed in the use of [Section] 215 orders.\" Consequently, it recommended that NSLs be held to Section 215 standards.", "Finally, the Group made a series of recommendations with an eye to greater oversight and public disclosure. Their proposals would apply to NSLs, Section 215 orders, trap and trace orders, Section 702 orders, and orders of the kind that gave rise to the purported NSA bulk meta-data collection. It suggested as a general matter that information concerning these authorities should be available in detail to Congress and the public, consistent with the need to protect classified information. More specifically, it recommended that nondisclosure orders (gag orders) issued to communications carriers and other recipients should be limited to cases involving human safety, maintaining congenial diplomatic relations, or similar substantial governmental concerns. The Group would allow recipients to periodically disclose the number of times they had received NSLs, Section 215 orders, and the like. It also proposed that the government be required to issue regular public reports on the use of such orders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USA FREEDOM Act", "paragraphs": ["Congress did not adopt the recommendations of the President's Review Group, but the USA FREEDOM Act addresses the judicially perceived NSL shortcomings in other ways. It eliminates the prospect of Section 215-like bulk metadata collection under NSL authority. It revises the procedures for the issuance of NSL nondisclosure provisions and for judicial review of their issuance. Finally, it augments existing reporting requirements for greater transparency. ", "Each of the NSL statutes now includes a requirement that the NSL demand be limited to specifically identified information rather than insisting on delivery of record information for all of a recipient's customers. ", "The USA FREEDOM Act handles the judicial review of nondisclosure orders with complementary amendments to the NSL statutes and to Section 3511. Nondisclosure orders under the amended NSL statutes are available only if the issuance officials notify recipients of their right to judicial review and certify that disclosure may result in a danger to national security; in interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation; in interference with diplomatic relations; or in the endangerment of an individual's physical safety. ", "A nondisclosure order notwithstanding, a recipient may disclose to those necessary for execution of the order, to an attorney for related legal advice, and to anyone else approved by the issuance agency. The exception is conditioned upon the recipient's notification of the issuance agency and advising those he tells of the nondisclosure requirements binding each of them.", "The USA FREEDOM Act amends Section 3511 so that the issuing agency must petition for judicial review upon request of the recipient. The petition must include a statement of specific facts evidencing the risks that warrant a nondisclosure order\u2014a risk of a danger to national security, of interference with diplomatic relations or with particular investigation, or of physical injury. The court must issue the order if it finds reason to believe disclosure \"during the applicable time period\" would bring with it such risks.", "The reference to \"the applicable time period\" is the only indication of the permissible tenure of a nondisclosure order. The phrase seems to contemplate that the petition will propose a time limit on any nondisclosure order or at least the court will impose one. The legislative history suggests that this reflects the practice immediately prior to enactment of the USA FREEDOM Act. Of course, the government was operating at the time under the pre-USA FREEDOM Act version of Section 3511, which afforded the opportunity for annual (and only annual) judicial review, and in the shadow of the Second Circuit's John Doe, Inc. decision. ", "The USA FREEDOM Act's final NSL adjustment occurs in the area of public disclosures. It directs the Director of National Intelligence to post on his website annually the number of NSLs issued and the number of requests covered by those NSLs during the previous year. It also permits a recipient of a FISA order or an NSL to publicly report, in one of four statutorily defined alternatives, the total number of such FISA orders and NSLs and the total number of customers covered by such orders or requests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current NSL Attributes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Addressees and Certifying Officials", "paragraphs": ["The five NSL statutes share a number of common attributes, although each has its own individual features as well.

Those issued under the authority of the Right to Financial Privacy Act may be directed to financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions, credit card companies, car dealers, jewelers and a number of entities that are likely to be involved large cash transactions. The Fair Credit Reporting Act NSLs may be addressed to consumer credit reporting agencies. Recipients of the National Security Act NSLs may include financial institutions and consumer credit reporting agencies, as well as any commercial entity with information concerning an agency employee's travel.", "FBI officials are authorized to provide the initial certification required for issuance of an NSL under any of the five statutes. In three instances, the authority is exclusive; in the other two, it is enjoyed by other federal officials as well. In the case of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act NSL section, the Right to Financial Privacy Act section, and one of the Fair Credit Report Act NSL sections, issuance requires the certification of either the Director of the FBI, a senior FBI official (no lower than the Deputy Assistant Director), or the Special Agent in Charge of an FBI field office.", "Certifying officials under the other statutes are described more broadly. The National Security Act NSL section contemplates certification by officials from a wider range of agencies; the second Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL section allows certification by both a wider range of agencies and a wider range of officials. Senior officials no lower than Assistant Secretary or Assistant Director of an agency whose employee with access to classified material is under investigation may certify a National Security Act NSL request. A designated supervisory official of any agency \"authorized to conduct investigations of, or intelligence or counterintelligence activities and analysis related to, international terrorism\" may certify an NSL request under the second, more recent Fair Credit Reporting Act section."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purpose, Standards, Information Covered", "paragraphs": ["Although variously phrased, the purpose for each of the NSLs is to acquire information related to the requesting agency's national security concerns.

The National Security Act NSL authority is available to conduct law enforcement investigations, counterintelligence inquiries, and security determinations. As to standards, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act authorizes NSLs for relevant information. The same standard may apply to the others, which are a little more cryptic, authorizing NSLs when the information is \"sought for\" or \"is necessary\" for the statutory purpose.", "The communications NSL provision and the earlier of the two credit agency NSL statutes are fairly specific in their descriptions of the information that may be requested through an NSL. An Electronic Communications Privacy Act NSL may request a customer's name, address, length of service, and billing records. The older of the two Fair Credit Report Act sections authorizes an NSL to acquire name, address or former address, place or former place of employment, and the name and address of any financial institution with which the consumer has or once had an account. The Right to Financial Privacy Act NSL provision covers the financial records of a financial institution's customers; the second and more recent Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL provision covers a consumer reporting agency's consumer reports and \"all other\" consumer information in its files. The National Security Act provision is at once the most inclusive and the most restricted. It authorizes NSLs for financial information and records and consumer reports held by any financial agency, institution, holding company, or consumer reporting agency, and for travel information held by any commercial entity.

The communications NSL provision for example declared, \"No wire or electronic communication service provider, or officer, or employee, or agent thereof, shall disclose to any person that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has sought or obtained access to information or records under this section.\" The statutes did not indicate whether a recipient might consult an attorney in order to ascertain his rights and obligations, or whether the clause might ever be lifted. It was this silence in the face of a seemingly absolute, permanent nondisclosure command that the early Doe courts found constitutionally unacceptable and that perhaps led to the reconstruction of the NSL confidentiality requirements.", "After amendment, secrecy is not absolutely required. Rather, NSL recipients are bound to secrecy only upon the certification of the requesting agency\u2014and the agreement of the court should the recipient seek, or ask that the requesting agency to seek, judicial review\u2014that disclosure of the request or response might result in a danger to national security; might interfere with diplomatic relations or with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation; or might endanger the physical safety of an individual.", "A recipient may disclose the request to those necessary to comply with the request; to an attorney the recipient, consulted for related legal advice or assistance; and to others with the government's approval. In doing so, the recipient must advise them of the secrecy requirements. Aside from its attorney and at the agency's election, the recipient must identify for the requester those to whom it has disclosed the request. ", "If an NSL contains a nondisclosure notice, it must advice the recipient of its right to seek, or to have the agency seek, judicial review. At the recipient's request, the issuing agency must petition the court for review, stating the specific facts that support its belief that disclosure might result in one or more of the statutorily identified adverse consequences. If the court agrees that such a risk may exist, it must issue a nondisclosure order.", "Failure to honor a nondisclosure order is punishable as contempt of court, and if committed knowingly and with the intent to obstruct an investigation or related judicial proceedings is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for an organization)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Judicial Review and Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["In addition to authority to review and set aside NSL nondisclosure requirements, the federal courts enjoy jurisdiction to review and enforce the underlying NSL requests.

The standard is reminiscent of the one used for subpoenas issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. There a subpoena may be modified or quashed if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. The Rule affords protection against undue burdens and protects privileged communications. ", "Compliance with a particular NSL might be unduly burdensome in some situations, but the circumstances under which NSLs are used suggest few federally recognized privileges. The Rule also imposes a relevancy requirement, but in the context of a grand jury investigation a motion to quash will be denied unless it can be shown that \"there is no reasonable possibility that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce information relevant\" to the investigation. The authority to modify or set aside an NSL that is unlawful affords the court an opportunity to determine whether the NSL in question complies with the statutory provisions under which it was issued.

Consequently, regular reports on the use of NSL authority must be made to the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees and in some instances to the banking committees. Moreover, Section 119 of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act instructs the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to audit and to report to the judiciary and intelligence committees as to the Department's use of the authority in the years following expansion of the authority in the USA PATRIOT Act.
