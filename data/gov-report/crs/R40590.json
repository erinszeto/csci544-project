Its supporters point to more informed consumers who then visit their doctors and become more involved in their own treatment, leading to better and earlier diagnosis of undertreated illnesses. The critics believe that industry's presentation of the balance of drug benefit and risk information may encourage the inappropriate use of advertised products and lead to higher than necessary spending. In addition to concerns with accuracy and balance, health professionals point out that DTC ads rarely mention alternative treatments, such as other or generic medications or non-drug interventions.", "In 1962, Congress gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certain authorities to regulate prescription drug advertising. Except in extreme circumstances, the law does not allow FDA to require pre-release review of ads. Regulations\u2014written at a time when most ads were printed in medical journals for a physician audience\u2014require that all drug ads disclose all of a drug's known risks.", "However, as drug makers considered moving into broadcast advertising and wanted to get their messages to consumers, they noted, without explicit guidance from FDA, the difficulty in including all risks in the format of a 30-second commercial. FDA issued guidance in 1999 stipulating that broadcast ads had to include the advertised product's most important risks in the audio portion of the advertisement and should give sources where more complete risk information about a drug would be available.", "FDA reviews ads once they are launched, and its enforcement options are notice-of-violation and warning letters, criminal prosecution (through the Department of Justice), civil monetary penalties, product seizures, and withdrawal of approval for sale. Despite these activities, Members of Congress and the public ask what FDA could do differently in light of the safety problems involving some heavily advertised medications.", "Congress could consider a variety of options to allay concerns about DTC drug advertising. It could encourage FDA to expand activities allowed under current legislative authority, including provisions in P.L. 110-85 (the FDA Amendments Act of 2007): FDA could increase post-publication review of ads, expand its role in consumer education, and increase its enforcement activities. Other possible options would require Congress to grant new authority so that FDA could require pre-release review and approval; require changes to ads; use stronger enforcement tools; require data collection; require public posting of risk information; prohibit DTC ads when a drug is first approved; and set limits on the timing and placement of ads. Congress could go beyond FDA to encourage other industry-independent entities to provide public education or set standards; it could also use tax and other financial incentives to make DTC advertising less profitable to industry.", "This report will be updated periodically."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, pharmaceutical companies spent $4.774 billion on DTC advertising. It was the first year such spending had declined, but it was still six times as much as the industry had spent in 1996. DTC advertising of prescription drugs attracted enough congressional attention to warrant at least six bills in the 110 th Congress as well as concerns from members in the 111 th . Beyond the sheer size of this marketing operation, what are the issues that concern Members? What actions do critics propose\u2014and supporters of DTC ads oppose? Is there common ground between both groups?", "There is a spectrum of opinion about DTC ads.", "Proponents of DTC advertising say the ads:", "educate consumers about medical conditions; alert them to treatments that exist; fairly present risks as well as benefits; detail non-drug approaches to improve health; remind and motivate consumers to comply better with drug therapy regimes; and help to de-stigmatize conditions.", "Critics of DTC advertising say the ads:", "minimize the risks of some medications while promoting their benefits; lure patients into expensive drugs when cheaper ones work as well, thus increasing healthcare costs; persuade patients to ignore other medications with fewer side effects and more established safety track records; provide information that would be more credible coming from non-industry sources; and are susceptible to marketing needs that interfere with objective presentations.", "Not all of these views necessarily conflict. It is possible to educate about medical conditions and omit information about alternate therapies, for example. As Congress considers arguments for and against DTC advertising of prescription drugs, context becomes important. All pharmaceuticals carry some risks. Human drugs, by their definition, are substances intended to affect the structure or function of the body. Consumers can take too much\u2014or too little. They can take drugs that interact with each other in ways not yet understood.", "Researchers do not know all risks at the time FDA first approves a drug for marketing. In fact, one effect of the 2005 controversy over Vioxx was that it heightened public awareness of how incomplete the data really are before tens of thousands of consumers use a drug in real-life conditions, which include use beyond the carefully controlled limits of clinical trials. Scientists then attributed approximately 100,000 excess heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths to an unanticipated cardiovascular side effect of that heavily advertised blockbuster drug and others in its class (COX-2 inhibitors developed to treat pain without the associated stomach side effects common to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) before they were withdrawn from the market.", "While critics and supporters of DTC ads sharply disagree on many things, people all along the spectrum often seem united in their belief that DTC ads should meet four criteria. They must be:", "Accessible. We want consumers to have access to information that could\u2014along with the treating physician\u2014help them make the healthcare decisions they face. To do so, the information must be understandable , accurate (true), balanced , and up-to-date . Understandable. Although researchers\u2014whether in academia, government, or industry\u2014disagree about what it is that viewers need to learn from advertisements (drug, brand, disease recognition; risks; benefits; indication), they agree ads should present the information so that average Americans can understand it. Accurate and up-to-date . There is little disagreement about whether DTC ads should be accurate and up-to-date. There is, however, disagreement about exactly what those terms mean. When should ads change to include postmarket findings? When risks or benefits vary by age or disease stage and other treatments, how much of these details should the ads present? Balanced . Most players in the debate acknowledge the need for some discussion of the balance between risks and benefits of a drug. They often disagree over the breadth of comparisons (for example, whether to consider other drugs or other treatments or cost) or methods to use.", "Appearing on TV and radio, and in popular magazines and pop-up windows on the Internet, DTC ads are an anomaly when it comes to federal regulation. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates most advertising in the United States. In 1962, however, Congress assigned the regulation of prescription drug advertising to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In doing so, though, it did not give the agency enforcement authority similar to that granted to the FTC. According to some critics of DTC ads, this has prevented effective oversight, and created a phenomenon more misleading than educational. To other critics, however, FDA's organizational structure, reliance on industry fees, and inadequate appropriations are more important factors in what they see as the agency's less than rigorous enforcement of law and regulation.", "Nevertheless, support for some form of DTC ads from industry and consumers is strong: industry wants to increase sales, and consumers want to actively participate in decisions about their own health. That, combined with advances in information technology and possible relevance to constitutional protections of free speech, makes an outright ban on DTC ads unlikely.", "The concerns about DTC ads already expressed by Members of the 111 th Congress are similar to those that have surfaced in the past. Interest in the 109 th Congress was sparked by some Members who had seen its growth and noted controversies over heavily advertised drugs such as Vioxx. Senate and House committees in the 110 th Congress considered drug safety bills that included restrictions on DTC advertising. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, P.L. 110-85 ) included some of those provisions, such as new industry fees for the advisory review of DTC television ads; expanded authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to require certain disclosures and statements; and civil monetary penalties for false or misleading ads. So far, Members of the 111 th Congress have indicated interest in DTC advertising in the context of drug safety, tax treatment of advertising expenses, risk communication, and general FDA-activity authority and oversight, sometimes in the context of broader discussions of health care costs and reform.", "This report examines these and other issues.

In its regulations, however, FDA has listed examples: \"advertisements in published journals, magazines, other periodicals, and newspapers, and advertisements broadcast through media such as radio, television, and telephone communication systems.\" Academic experts in prescription drug law have noted that \"FDA generally interprets [prescription drug advertising] to encompass information, other than labeling, that promotes a drug product and is sponsored by a manufacturer.\"", "DTC print advertising appears in magazines, newspapers, non-medical journals, pharmacy brochures, and direct-mail letters; companies also run DTC ads on television, radio, videos, billboards, and Internet Web sites. The ads usually fall into one of three categories.", "Help-seeking ads discuss a particular disease or health condition, advise the consumer to \"see your doctor,\" but do not mention the product's name. They are directed towards consumers, make no health claims, and mention no specific drug. Reminder ads call attention to the product's name but make no reference to the health condition it treats. They make no health claims and FDA does not require that they contain full risk information. Although reminder ads may acquaint consumers with brand names of products, they are directed primarily towards doctors and health care professionals who are more likely than consumers to know about the product and its use. Product-claim ads \u2014the type of most concern to FDA\u2014include a product's name and a therapeutic claim for it. The regulations require that therapeutic claims not be false or misleading and that the ad present full risk information.", "FDA's regulatory oversight is minimal for the first two, reflecting its statutory authority. The third commands most of its attention and resources. DTC advertising is only one of the pharmaceutical industry's tools to influence prescription drug sales. Companies also promote drugs to physicians. They use direct advertising, such as ads in medical journals; reminders, such as logo-embossed pads and pens; and less well-defined tools, such as industry-funded seminars, residency training support, drug samples, and visits by \"detailers,\" drug company representatives who visit doctors' offices with drug samples and educational materials. Although not a focus of this report, industry promotion to physicians appears to influence prescribing patterns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spending on DTC Advertising", "paragraphs": ["The pharmaceutical industry increased its DTC spending by 536% from 1996 to 2007. To put this growth in perspective, the Consumer Price Index (all items) (which approximates the change in real dollars of the cost of placing advertising spots increased 24% during the same time period. The increase in DTC advertising spending was more than 22 times higher than the CPI.", "The top row in Table 1 shows pharmaceutical industry spending on DTC advertising for the last 10 years; the other rows show pharmaceutical industry spending for other categories of prescription drug promotion and advertising. Using data from IMS Health, a for-profit source for \"pharmaceutical market intelligence,\" Table 1 also includes spending directed to professional promotion (to physician offices, hospital-based physicians and pharmacists, and medical journals), and the reported retail value of product samples given to office-based physicians. In 2007, according to IMS data, drug companies spent 41.7% of their reported promotional spending on DTC advertising ($4.774 billion out of $11.453 billion).", "Manufacturers actually may spend more than that on promoting prescription drugs to consumers. Some analysts may use data that Table 1 does not include, such as industry expenses for new ways to reach consumers. An online news reporter wrote, in May 2006, that \"Coupons, money-back guarantees, rebates and other supermarket-friendly promotions offering '10 percent off,' 'free-trial offers' or 'buy six prescriptions, get one free' are now standard marketing tools for many top-selling prescription drugs.\"", "As in the past, television and magazines continue to be the major media targets for DTC advertising. In 2007, they accounted for over 90% of spending. Table 2 shows drug industry spending on DTC ads by placement. For the past decade, media analysts have predicted large increases in Internet ad spending. In 2007, however, Internet ads represented about 3% of DTC drug ad spending, indicating the anticipated growth has not yet occurred.", "As drug companies expand their use of social marketing techniques, the traditional definition of DTC advertising may evolve. The published data do not include other areas in which some observers suggest industry may be promoting its products. For example, product placement: \"the insertion of a product or service into a script or scene of a TV show or movie, usually for a price negotiated with the network, producer, or scriptwriter.\" This marketing tool is used to promote cars and computers, but its use for pharmaceutical products has not been confirmed.

Otherwise, until the 1962 Kefauver-Harris amendments to the FFDCA (P.L. 87-781), statutory authority for regulating any advertising \u2014including that for prescription and non-prescription drugs\u2014lay with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).", "In 1962, Congress added Section 502(n) to the FFDCA to give the FDA the authority to regulate not only labeling, but also prescription drug advertising, including DTC advertisements, and other descriptive printed matter.

However, Congress prohibited (\"except in extraordinary circumstances\") FDA from issuing any regulations that would require prior approval of the content of any advertisement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Initial Regulations (1969)", "paragraphs": ["After passage of the 1962 FFDCA amendments, FDA needed to promulgate regulations and to provide guidelines to an industry producing what were now called \"prescription\" drugs.

The promotion within these materials had to be supported by scientific evidence and be consistent with FDA-approved product labeling. The ads could be the approved labeling or other promotional materials, but could not recommend or suggest any use of a drug that was not listed in the approved drug's labeling.", "When FDA wrote the 1969 regulations, industry advertised its drugs to physicians through print ads in medical journals. Complying with the regulations was relatively straightforward. In 1981, when companies wanted to direct ads to consumers, FDA, after a two-year moratorium on DTC ads, announced that the current regulations were sufficient to protect the consumer. If a product-claim print advertisement mentioned the name of the prescription drug and its intended medical indications, it had to include all the information about side effects, contraindications, and precautions from the product's approved labeling.", "It remained unclear, however, how TV and radio ads could comply with the regulations. Conveying all of a product's risk information in print advertising may be cumbersome but it is not difficult. However, the drug industry asserted, including all details in a 30-second broadcast ad is cumbersome, expensive, and unlikely to be possible. FDA had not issued any interpretation of how broadcast advertisements could fulfill that requirement, so, until 1997, the industry assumed that FDA expected broadcast DTC advertising to meet the same requirements as ads in print."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Guidance for Broadcast Ads (1999)", "paragraphs": ["In August 1997, FDA issued draft guidance on how pharmaceutical companies could fulfill the existing regulatory requirements for advertising drugs on radio and television. It published the final guidance, without major change, two years later. The agency explained that the 1969 regulations had always allowed broadcast advertisements to either include all the drug's risks or ensure that consumers would have easy access to the full prescribing information within FDA-approved labeling. The guidance made clear that DTC broadcast advertisements had to include what FDA called the \"major statement\"\u2014the product's most important risks.

In addition, the advertisement had to describe how the consumer could obtain the full package labeling.", "With the 1999 guidance\u2014which is still in effect now\u2014FDA attempted to ensure that consumers with different information-seeking needs and abilities have adequate access to the product labeling. As part of that attempt, the guidance presented \"one acceptable approach\" to the required broad dissemination of this information: that ads include an Internet site and a toll-free telephone number where listeners could get that information; a reminder that one's doctor may have more information and a list of other print sources with large circulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Draft Guidance for Print Ads (2004)", "paragraphs": ["By 2004, after an enormous increase in DTC ads, FDA moved to change its policy on those appearing in print. It was concerned that the long and technical risk descriptions in ads were hard for consumers to understand. FDA requires that any prescription drug advertisement contain \"information in brief summary relating to the side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness\" of the drug. The information on the risks of the product (known as the brief summary) must disclose all the risk-related information in the drug's package labeling. Consequently, ads in print often include the entire section of the approved professional labeling with its side-effects and warnings.", "Therefore, in January 2004, FDA issued three draft guidances: Brief Summary: Disclosing Risk Information in Consumer-Directed Print Advertisements (referred to as Brief Summary Guidance below), \" Help-Seeking \" and Other Disease Awareness Communications by or on Behalf of Drug and Device Firms (referred to as Disease Awareness Guidance below), and a third on medical device advertising (which will not be discussed here).", "FDA had long required that drug firms disseminate truthful, non-misleading, and scientifically accurate information.

The draft guidance then offered manufacturers three options (other than printing the entire professional labeling) for presenting that information to satisfy the brief summary requirement for DTC print ads.", "The first option would be to reprint the FDA-approved patient labeling in full. For the second option, the manufacturer could print a portion of the patient labeling, including the risk information but omitting, for example, directions for use. The third option would allow printing the \"highlights\" section of the professional labeling, a format FDA had proposed earlier. But because this highlights section would be written for medical professionals, FDA recommended that it be rewritten so consumers could understand it. The agency also asked drug firms to consider the costs and benefits of each of these options and decide for themselves which option is best.", "Supporters of the draft guidance say that shorter ads would mean that industry will spend less and consumers will understand more. Critics argue that this approach may be appropriate for only a small subset of products. They also argue that FDA should develop guidelines requiring risk disclosures that patients can use in discussions with health professionals.", "Because the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates most advertising in the United States, FDA asked it to review the three January 2004 draft guidance documents.

Are the ads accurate enough? Are they complete enough? Do they balance the discussion of risks and benefits in a way that reflects the research? Can consumers understand them?", "To look closely at those questions is to see several important issues. First, most people do not read the entire ad. After seeing a DTC print ad, only 10% of respondents to the FDA survey said they read the entire \"brief summary\"\u2014the detailed material dealing with risks and benefits.", "Second, not all consumers understand the DTC ads they do read or hear. Half of all American adults read at or below an eighth grade reading level. What does this mean when it comes to health literacy and behavior? The most often-quoted survey on this issue is still a 1995 Emory University study of patients seeking care at two urban, public hospitals. One telling finding: 42% could not understand the sentence, \"Do not take on an empty stomach.\"", "That many consumers cannot understand the technical language in DTC ads does not necessarily implicate the pharmaceutical industry. Researchers on \"health literacy\" now see the effects of reading levels on how Americans seek care, follow treatment and medication instructions, and use Internet health material. Compounding these difficulties is an artifact of the historical development of DTC drug advertising. In the 1960s, when Congress added the advertising section to the FFDCA and FDA promulgated the related regulations, almost all drug ads were print ads aimed at doctors. The requirement that those print ads contain the FDA-approved labeling language ensured that physician-readers would have all the information about a drug's risks and benefits. The requirement continues today. Thus, even now the labeling language that appears in many ads is more complicated than what a consumer at an average reading level could understand.", "In addition to what consumers do or understand, there is a third issue contributing to whether they are adequately informed. Information may be understandable but not be wholly accurate or balanced. One 2000 study found that less than a third of DTC ads acknowledge competing treatments, and only 9% contain estimates of how often drugs are effective.", "In 2000, questions about the information conveyed in advertising led the American Medical Association (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs to review studies of ad content accuracy, arguments for and against DTC advertisements, and physician attitudes. The Council found, for example, that 44% of promotional material to physicians \"would lead to improper prescribing,\" and recommended that physicians \"assess and enhance the patient's understanding of what the treatment entails ... resist commercially induced pressure to prescribe such drugs when not indicated ... deny requests for inappropriate prescriptions ... educate patients ... [and] remain vigilant to ensure that DTC advertising does not promote expectations.\"", "Language and persuasion experts agree that one way of persuading audiences is to use the well-respected expert. But what if pharmaceutical ads present an actor who plays an expert in a show, or celebrities Americans admire\u2014and therefore trust\u2014with no expertise at all? Recently such ads have starred well-known performers speaking of their own conditions (Dorothy Hamill, Robert Dole), popular actors (Mandy Patinkin), or real physicians who are not experts in the condition they endorse (Robert Jarvik). Other celebrities (Terry Bradshaw) appear on talk shows, speaking about their own medical difficulties and treatment without acknowledging that a drug company pays them for that exposure.", "Concerned that these activities could mislead the public, the American Medical Association issued guidelines in 2006 urging advertisers to, first, not cast actors as physicians in DTC drug ads, and, second, if they do, to include a prominent disclaimer.

With very few exceptions, once a drug is approved, a physician can prescribe that drug for any purpose. Many of these people will have personal and disease characteristics different from those in the initial clinical trials. A drug approved for use in adults may be prescribed to children.
