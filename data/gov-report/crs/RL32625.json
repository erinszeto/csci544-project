The number of riders and access points makes it impractical to subject all rail passengers to the type of screening airline passengers undergo. Nevertheless, steps can be taken to reduce the risks of terrorist attacks.", "The 9/11 Commission called for a systematic analysis of transportation assets, the risks to those assets, and the costs and benefits of different approaches to defending those assets. The commission also called for homeland security assistance to be distributed based on these assessments of risks and vulnerabilities, rather than according to population. A comprehensive assessment of risk across all passenger rail operations has not been submitted to Congress. Most federal assistance for passenger rail security has been allocated to systems judged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to be at highest risk.", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) did not directly address passenger rail security, but did direct DHS to create a national strategy for transportation security. This plan would identify national transportation assets, set risk-based priorities for their protection, assign responsibilities for their protection, and recommend appropriate levels and sources of funding for these efforts. DHS delivered a classified report on a \"National Strategy for Transportation Security\" to Congress in September 2005; this report was updated in April 2006. A security plan for the surface transportation sector was due to Congress by the end of 2006; DHS announced the plan's release in May 2007. The Government Accountability Office has noted that this plan is only a first step, as it is only required to describe how the most critical transportation assets will be identified and how their risk will be assessed, but is not required to address how risks to transportation assets are actually being assessed or how those assets will be protected.", "The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 ( H.R. 1 / P.L. 110-53 ) signed into law on August 3, 2007, included comprehensive surface transportation security legislation. This act authorized a total of $3.5 billion for transit security and $2.0 billion for rail security, including grant programs for which commuter rail operators, Amtrak, and state and local governments will be eligible recipients. Some funds are specifically authorized for Amtrak's security and tunnel safety projects. The act also authorizes DHS to regulate the employee security training programs of transit and rail entities. The FY2008 DHS appropriations act (Division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008/ P.L. 110-161 ) provides $47 million for surface transportation security activities, including $22 million for rail security inspectors and dogs, and $400 million for public transportation and railroad security assistance grants.

Multiple bombings of passenger trains in India in 2006 and 2007, preceded by the bombings of London subway trains on July 7, 2005, the alleged attempt to bomb London subway trains again on July 21, 2005, and the bombing of Spanish commuter trains in 2004, provide a backdrop to Congress's efforts to reduce the risk of attacks against passenger rail operations in the United States. The 9/11 Commission characterized the federal emphasis on aviation security spending as \"fight[ing] the last war,\" noting that \"opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater, in maritime or surface transportation.\" This report summarizes the challenges of securing passenger rail systems, options for making decisions about security funding, industry requests for funding, and passenger-rail related legislative action.

But the risk to passengers on these systems from terrorist attack is quite small, relative to the number of trips these systems provide daily, and travel on passenger rail systems is safer overall than the primary alternative, the automobile.", "Passenger rail service takes four forms: heavy rail (e.g., subway systems like Washington D.C.'s Metro), commuter rail (e.g., Maryland's Maryland Rail Commuter, or MARC, and Virginia's Virginia Railway Express, or VRE, trains), light rail (e.g., Dallas's DART), and intercity passenger rail (Amtrak). The first three are forms of public transit, which, along with Amtrak, share certain characteristics that make them vulnerable to attack: (1) they make scheduled stops along fixed routes; (2) their operations depend on people having quick and easy access to stations and trains; (3) the number of access points, volume of ridership, and pace of operations make it impractical to subject all rail passengers to the type of screening that airline passengers undergo; and (4) the number of operators and scale of operations of all forms of passenger rails systems in the United States make it difficult to provide uniform levels of security to each and every rail system.", "Congress remains concerned about rail security in part because in recent years there have been a number of attacks on passenger rail systems in other countries. The 9/11 Commission noted in its final report, \"Surface transportation systems such as railroads and mass transit remain hard to protect because they are so accessible and extensive.\" With one possible exception, CRS has been unable to find a case of a terrorist attack on a passenger rail system in the United States in recent history. This does not mean, however, that these systems are not vulnerable to attack.", "The recent attacks on passenger rail systems in other countries have resulted in hundreds of deaths. Yet in the context of millions of people riding passenger rail every day, the risk to a rail passenger of dying in any country as the result of a terrorist attack continues to be extremely small. Conversely, during the years 2003-2005, more than 80 passengers died in accidents on rail systems in the United States. Given that Americans take more than 3.5 billion trips on passenger rail systems each year, the risk of dying in a rail accident is also extremely small, but it is not zero.", "The goal of a terrorist attack is not simply to kill people, but, as the name implies, to sow terror, to disrupt the social order by spreading fear and uncertainty about the future. People have died as a result of accidents on passenger rail systems, which are more common than acts of terror against such systems, but a terrorist attack would have greater shock value. One possible consequence of such an attack could be for people to switch from using rail to other modes of transportation. Switching to one likely alternative, driving, would actually raise the risk of death, due to the higher risk of accident and injury faced by drivers compared to rail passengers.", "In short, while rail systems and their passengers may be vulnerable to attack, the risk of attack is smaller than other risks those passengers face, including the relatively remote risk of death by accident. Perhaps more vulnerable to attack is the nation's sense of the social order. In the aftermath of an attack, people experience fear, especially as they consider the possibility of further attacks. While government can do things to reduce the risk of an attack on passenger rail systems, such attacks cannot absolutely be prevented. If an attack on a passenger rail system were to occur, the psychological impact could be reduced by restoring a sense of normalcy as quickly as possible. This could be accomplished by, among other things, resuming passenger rail operations and apprehending the persons responsible for the attack. As Tim O'Toole, Managing Director of London's subway system, testified, \"we believe our greatest defence comes from our rapid response and restoration of service, denying terrorists the chaos and fear they are seeking and thereby discouraging their return.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Passenger Rail Security Since September 11", "paragraphs": ["Immediately after the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) conducted vulnerability assessments of the 37 largest transit agencies, and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) conducted security inspections of commuter railroads. Subsequently, additional assessments of the same agencies and others were performed with assistance from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Office of Grants and Training of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Transit agencies have used these assessments to help identify and prioritize security actions. William Millar, president of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), testified in January 2007 that the transit industry has spent $2.5 billion since September 11, 2001, on security and emergency preparedness measures.", "In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ), Congress directed DHS to prepare a national strategy for transportation security and security plans for each transportation mode. The national strategy was completed in 2005; the mode-specific security plans were released in May 2007. Congress has provided a total of $1.09 billion for grants to passenger rail systems since September 11, 2001, mostly through DHS annual appropriations acts. These funds can be used for security-related planning, acquisition of equipment, training, exercises, and administrative expenses.", "On May 20, 2004, after the bombings of commuter trains in Madrid, TSA issued security directives for U.S. passenger rail systems. Although these directives were not made public, they reportedly reflected actions already taken by many U.S. rail systems. These included removing or hardening trash containers on boarding platforms that could be used to hide bombs, increasing the presence of security officers, using video surveillance in and around stations, conducting random inspections of passengers and baggage (sometimes with the help of bomb-sniffing dogs), and encouraging riders to look for suspicious activity.", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted that \"the issuance of these directives was an effort to take swift action in response to a current threat.\" However, the GAO goes on to write that because the rail industry and federal stakeholders were afforded only limited input and review, the directives \"may not provide the industry with baseline security standards based on industry best practices.\" Furthermore, GAO \"recommended that TSA collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the passenger rail industry to develop rail security standards that reflect industry best practices and that can be measured, monitored, and enforced.\" The FRA and the passenger rail industry have raised concerns about some of these directives, including at least one that seems to conflict with other federal safety regulations. According to GAO, \"in January 2007, TSA stated that it recognizes the need to closely partner with the passenger rail industry to develop security standards and directives.\"", "Since September 2005, TSA has hired 100 surface transportation inspectors to monitor and enforce compliance with TSA rail security directives. In September 2006, FRA's and TSA's roles and responsibilities for compliance inspections were outlined in an annex to the existing memorandum of understanding between DHS and DOT. Additionally, according to TSA, their \"inspectors have developed relationships with security officials in passenger rail and transit systems, coordinated access to operations centers, participated in emergency exercises, and provided assistance in enhancing security.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Security Options", "paragraphs": ["In studying the security measures taken by U.S. and some foreign transit agencies, GAO found that the domestic and foreign agencies were doing many of the same things.

These are (1) covert testing of employee response to incidents by placing suspicious items throughout the system or setting off alarms, (2) random screening of passengers and baggage, and (3) a national government clearinghouse of security technologies and best practices. GAO noted that attempts to implement these three practices in the U.S. could face political, legal, fiscal, and cultural challenges. GAO also identified government centralization of the process for researching and developing passenger rail security technologies as a potentially useful practice.

'Vulnerability' encompasses the ways a system may be open to attack; 'threat' considers the likelihood of an attack on a system; and 'criticality' refers to the potential consequences of an attack. The assessment of the level of risk results from the interplay of these components.", "One implication of risk analysis is that there is more than one way to manage risk to a passenger rail system. Specific strategies can be tailored to specific rail systems by combining one or more of the following approaches. One approach is to make changes in passenger rail systems to lower their vulnerability to attack (e.g., hiring more police officers, introducing random screening of passengers and bags, installing security cameras). Another is to reduce the potential consequences of an attack (e.g., through coordinated emergency response training exercises with local first responders). Yet another is to make changes elsewhere that reduce the level of threat to those systems (e.g., putting more money into intelligence and law enforcement to combat terrorism)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Federal Strategy for Passenger Rail Security", "paragraphs": ["In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ), Congress directed DHS, working jointly with DOT, to prepare a strategy for transportation security, with plans for each mode of transportation.

TSA has testified that the mode-specific plans identify underwater and underground tunnels in as one of the highest security priorities.", "In 2006, DHS also issued a National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) to serve as a guide to using risk management principles for prioritizing protection efforts within infrastructure sectors (e.g., transportation) and across sectors. The NIPP required that sector-specific agencies submit plans to DHS by December 2006 identifying critical assets, evaluating the risk to them, and developing measures to protect them. The NIPP called for the sector plans to be developed by councils of federal, state, and regional and local government agencies involved in that sector, along with sector councils made up of private sector stakeholders. The government council for the transportation sector was formed in January 2006, but, alone among the seventeen infrastructure sectors, the transportation sector did not have a private sector council as of March 2007, though reportedly each transportation mode has a sector council. DHS indicates that \"once the modes are organized,\" an overall transportation sector council will be formed. DHS announced that the transportation sector-specific plan (along with the other sector plans) and transportation mode-specific annexes were completed on May 21, 2007.

For example, as noted above, passenger rail operators have reported that TSA did not adequately consult with the industry in developing the directives for passenger rail security, and concerns have been raised about some of the directives conflicting with other passenger rail industry regulations. GAO noted that TSA has recently said it recognizes the need to work more closely with the passenger rail industry in developing security standards and directives.

They assert that their primary security issue is finding a way to pay for additional security improvements. As noted earlier, William Millar, president of APTA, has testified that the transit industry (which includes bus-only systems as well as rail systems, but does not include Amtrak) has spent over $2.5 billion on security activities since 9/11. In a 2004 survey, APTA members (transit-system operators) were asked, \"How much additional funding do you need in the long-term to complete your capital program to maintain, modernize, and expand your security function?\" Based on survey responses, APTA estimates that there are over $6 billion in unmet long-term security needs: $5.2 billion in security-related capital investment (for protection of infrastructure and vehicles, enhancing evacuation capabilities, and improving emergency response) and $800 million annually in ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures. APTA has repeatedly requested significant increases in federal grants to help pay for those security improvements.", "Funding security improvements for passenger rail has been primarily a state and local responsibility. Advocates of greater federal responsibility for security funding argue that, since the current concern is chiefly about attacks from terrorists, the federal government should bear more responsibility for providing security funding, reflecting its role of providing for the national defense.", "Advocates for a more limited federal role in funding passenger rail security improvements argue that the federal government is exercising its national defense responsibility through funding national defense efforts and that taxpayers all over the country should not be required to pay for security improvements for a relatively small number of transit agencies located in large metropolitan areas.

In addition to the grants provided specifically for passenger rail security, the federal government has provided billions of dollars to state and local governments through the broader Urbanized Areas Security Initiative for security-related activities, funds which the state and local governments have the discretion to apply to those activities they judge as having the greatest security value to their communities.", "The National Transit Systems Security Act of 2007 (Title XIV of P.L. 110-53 ), enacted on August 3, 2007, authorized a total of $2.6 billion for grants for security-related capital expenses and $840 million for grants for security-related operating expenses over a four-year period (FY2008-FY2011). These are authorizations for funding; the actual amounts to be provided are still to be determined by Congress each year through appropriations for DHS.
