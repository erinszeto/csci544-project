Most farm bill programs with mandatory funding, with the exception of SNAP, generally cease new operations when they expire (e.g., the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Market Assistance Program, and Specialty Crop Block Grants). However, existing contracts under prior-year authority can continue to be paid. The mandatory farm commodity programs of the 2008 farm bill not only ended with the 2013 crop, but without congressional action an outdated and expensive \"permanent law\" from the 1938 and 1949 farm bills stood ready to be implemented to cover the 2014 crop, beginning with dairy, on January 1, 2014.

This group included certain agricultural disaster assistance programs, certain conservation programs, specialty crop research and grants, organic research and certification, beginning and socially disadvantaged farmer programs, rural development, bioenergy, and farmers market promotion programs. The extension did not provide these programs any mandatory funding, although many would have been funded in the new farm bill.

", "Other budget enforcement rules and appropriations dynamics affected particular farm bill conservation programs. The Congressional Budget Office used the last year of authorization to determine the 10-year funding baseline for the farm bill reauthorization. Because the FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-55 ) reduced spending for select mandatory conservation programs and could have reduced the multi-year budget baseline, it extended the funding authority expiration date for five of these programs, including Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA), the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Farmland Protection Program (FPP), and the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP). This allowed appropriators to score savings in FY2012, but not affect the overall farm bill baseline since program authority for many of the reduced programs was extended to 2014. Thus, even without a reauthorization of the 2008 farm bill, the five programs continued to operate.", "Several conservation programs also have permanent program authority, but are authorized to receive discretionary funds appropriated annually.

The second and third vetoes were in 2008 by President George W. Bush. The 2008 farm bill was vetoed and overridden twice. After the initial veto of the bill ( H.R. 2419 ), Congress overrode the veto and enacted P.L. 110-234 , but accidentally enrolled the law without Title III (the trade title). Congress immediately reintroduced the same bill with the trade title as H.R. 6124 .

An \"expiration of the suspension\" would allow the essentially mothballed policies of permanent law to resume.

", "Suspension", "Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, farm bills generally used and amended the 1938 and/or 1949 acts. Amendments sometimes were made permanent and sometimes only applied to specific years. As farm commodity policy continued to evolve away from parity-based price supports and quotas, farm bills in the 1970s gradually began to move away from using the permanent law provisions. Yet, the 1970 and 1973 farm bills, for example, generally were written into the 1938 and/or 1949 farm bills, as amended, with provisions that were applicable only for the new period of the farm bill. Thus, while those farm bills might not have directly suspended permanent law in the same way that more modern farm bills have, they nonetheless supplanted some portion of the permanent law parity-based support system for the life of the farm bill, albeit from within the body of the permanent law itself.", "Beginning with the 1977 farm bill, direct suspension or nonapplicability language began to be used regarding the permanent laws. This approach has continued through the 2014 farm bill.", "Repeal", "Proposals to repeal permanent law have been relatively rare, though some have passed the floor in each chamber.", "For example, proposals to repeal permanent law advanced perhaps the farthest during the development of the 1996 farm bill. Repeal provisions may have had saliency then because of a perceived intent of the \"Freedom to Farm\" reform plans. If Agricultural Market Transition Act (AMTA) payments were to end in 2002 at the end of the farm bill, then the existence of permanent law could have been an obstacle. Whether or not repeal was a condition of the plan during its development, repeal was dropped in favor of continued suspension during conference negotiations in 1996.", "More specifically regarding the 1995-1996 developments, the initial bill considered by the House Agriculture Committee in 1995 would have continued to suspend permanent law ( H.R. 2195 , Title IV).

However, the Senate-passed version of the 1995 reconciliation package included a provision to repeal permanent law ( S. 1357 , \u00a71101).

A broader government-wide restructuring bill also was introduced that would have repealed permanent law ( H.R. 1923 ).
