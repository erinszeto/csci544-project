Each of these elements is discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Littoral Operations", "paragraphs": ["In late 1992, with the publication of a Navy document entitled ...From the Sea , the Navy formally shifted the focus of its planning away from the Cold War scenario of countering Soviet naval forces in mid-ocean waters and toward the post-Cold War scenario of operating in littoral (near-shore) waters to counter the land- and sea-based forces of potential regional aggressors. This shift in planning focus has led to numerous changes for the Navy in concepts of operation, training, and equipment over the last 12 years. Among other things, it moved the focus of Navy planning from a geographic environment where it could expect to operate primarily by itself to one where it would need to be able to operate effectively in a joint manner, alongside other U.S. forces, and in a combined manner, alongside military forces of other countries. It also led to an increased emphasis on amphibious warfare, mine warfare, and defense against diesel-electric submarines and small surface craft. The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and the DDG-1000 (formerly DD(X)) destroyer are key current Navy efforts intended to improve the Navy's ability to operate in heavily defended littoral waters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Global War On Terrorism (GWOT)", "paragraphs": ["The Navy in mid-2005 began implementing several initiatives intended to increase its ability to participate in what the administration refers to as the global war on terrorism (GWOT). These initiatives include the establishment of the following: a Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (ECC); a riverine force; a reserve civil affairs battalion; a maritime intercept operations (MIO) intelligence exploitation pilot program; an intelligence data-mining capability at the National Maritime Intelligence Center (NMIC); and a Navy Foreign Area Officer (FAO) community consisting of officers with specialized knowledge of foreign countries and regions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Network-Centric Operations", "paragraphs": ["The concept of network-centric operations, also called network-centric warfare (NCW), is a key feature of transformation for all U.S. military services. The concept, which emerged in the late 1990s, involves using computer networking technology to tie together personnel, ships, aircraft, and installations in a series of local and wide-area networks capable of rapidly transmitting critical information. Many in DON believe that NCW will lead to changes in naval concepts of operation and significantly increase U.S. naval capabilities and operational efficiency. Key NCW efforts include the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) network, the Naval Fires Network (NFN), the IT-21 investment strategy, and ForceNet, which is the Navy's overarching concept for combining the various computer networks that U.S. naval forces are now fielding into a master computer network for tying together U.S. naval personnel, ships, aircraft, and installations. A related program is the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unmanned Vehicles", "paragraphs": ["Many analysts believe that unmanned vehicles (UVs) will be another central feature of U.S. military transformation. Perhaps uniquely among the military departments, DON in coming years will likely acquire UVs of every major kind\u2014air, surface, underwater, and ground. Widespread use of UVs could lead to significant changes in the numbers and types of crewed ships and piloted aircraft that the Navy procures in the future, in naval concepts of operation, and in measurements of naval power. The LCS is to deploy various kinds of UVs. Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat air vehicles, or UCAVs (which are armed UAVs), if implemented widely, could change the shape naval aviation. Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and UAVs could significantly expand the capabilities of Navy submarines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sea Basing For Expeditionary Operations", "paragraphs": ["Naval forces are inherently sea-based, but the Navy is currently using the term sea basing in a more specific way, to refer a new operational concept under which forces would be staged at sea and then used to conduct expeditionary operations ashore with little or no reliance on a nearby land base. Under the sea basing concept, functions previously conducted from the nearby land base, including command and control, fire support, and logistics support, would be relocated to the sea base, which is to be formed by a combination of amphibious and sealift-type ships. The sea basing concept responds to a central concern of transformation advocates\u2014that fixed overseas land bases in the future will become increasingly vulnerable to enemy anti-access/area-denial weapons such as cruise missiles and theater-range ballistic missiles. Although the sea basing concept originated with the Navy and Marine Corps, the concept can be applied to joint operations involving the Army and Air Force.", "To implement the sea basing concept, the Navy wants to field a 14-ship squadron, called the Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future), or MPF(F) squadron, that would include three new-construction large-deck amphibious ships, nine new-construction sealift-type ships, and two existing sealift-type ships. Additional \"connector\" ships would be used to move equipment to the MPF(F) ships, and from the MPF(F) ships to the operational area ashore. Some analysts have questioned the potential affordability and cost effectiveness of the sea basing concept."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Kinds of Naval Formations", "paragraphs": ["The Navy in the past relied on carrier battle groups (CVBGs) (now called carrier strike groups, or CSGs) and amphibious ready groups (ARGs) as its standard ship formations. In recent years, the Navy has begun to use new kinds of naval formations\u2014such as expeditionary strike groups, or ESGs (i.e., amphibious ships combined with surface combatants, attack submarines, and land-based P-3 maritime patrol aircraft), surface strike groups (SSGs), and modified Trident SSGN submarines carrying cruise missiles and special operations forces \u2014for forward presence, crisis response, and warfighting operations. A key Navy objective in moving to these new formation is to significantly increase the number of independently deployable, strike-capable naval formations. ESGs, for example, are considered to be formations of this kind, while ARGs generally were not.", "The Navy in 2006 also proposed establishing what it calls global fleet stations, or GFSs . The Navy says that a GFS", "is a persistent sea base of operations from which to coordinate and employ adaptive force packages within a regional area of interest. Focusing primarily on Phase 0 (shaping) operations, Theater Security Cooperation, Global Maritime Awareness, and tasks associated specifically with the War on Terror, GFS offers a means to increase regional maritime security through the cooperative efforts of joint, inter-agency, and multinational partners, as well as Non-Governmental Organizations. Like all sea bases, the composition of a GFS depends on Combatant Commander requirements, the operating environment, and the mission. From its sea base, each GFS would serve as a self-contained headquarters for regional operations with the capacity to repair and service all ships, small craft, and aircraft assigned. Additionally, the GFS might provide classroom space, limited medical facilities, an information fusion center, and some combat service support capability. The GFS concept provides a leveraged, high-yield sea based option that achieves a persistent presence in support of national objectives. Additionally, it complements more traditional CSG/ESG training and deployment cycles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Ship-Deployment Approaches", "paragraphs": ["The Navy is implementing or experimenting with new ship-deployment approaches that are intended to improve the Navy's ability to respond to emergencies and increase the amount of time that ships spend on station in forward deployment areas. Key efforts in this area include the Fleet Response Plan (FRP) for emergency surge deployments and the Sea Swap concept for long-duration forward deployments with crew rotation. The FRP, Navy officials say, permits the Navy to deploy up to 6 of its 11 planned CSGs within 30 days, and an additional CSG within another 60 days after that (which is called \"6+1\"). Navy officials believe Sea Swap can reduce the stationkeeping multiplier\u2014the number of ships of a given kind needed to maintain one ship of that kind on continuously station in an overseas operating area\u2014by 20% or more."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reduced Personnel Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Navy is implementing a variety of steps to substantially reduce the number of uniformed Navy personnel required to carry out functions both at sea and ashore. DON officials state that these actions are aimed at moving the Navy away from an outdated \"conscript mentality,\" under which Navy personnel were treated as a free good, and toward a more up-to-date approach under which the high and rising costs of personnel are fully recognized. Under the DOD's proposed FY2008 budget and FY2008-FY2013 Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), active Navy end strength, which was 365,900 in FY2005, is to decline to less than 325,000 by FY2010. Reductions in personnel requirements ashore are to be accomplished through organizational streamlining and reforms, and the transfer of jobs from uniformed personnel to civilian DON employees. Reductions in personnel requirements at sea are to be accomplished by introducing new-design ships that can be operated with substantially smaller crews\u2014a shift that could lead to significant changes in Navy practices for recruiting, training, and otherwise managing its personnel. Current ship-acquisition programs related to this goal include the LCS, the DDG-1000, and the Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier (also known as the CVN-21 class)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improved Business Practices", "paragraphs": ["DON is pursuing a variety of initiatives to improve its processes and business practices so as to generate savings that can be used to help finance Navy transformation.
