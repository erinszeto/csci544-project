The December 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) describes both China and Russia as seeking to \"challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity.\" An unclassified summary of the January 2018 U.S. National Defense Strategy describes China as a \"strategic competitor\" and charges that it is pursuing a military modernization program that \"seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global preeminence in the future.\" The Department of Defense's (DOD's) June 2019 Indo-Pacific Strategy Report identifies \"the primary concern for U.S. national security\" as \"inter-state strategic competition, defined by geopolitical rivalry between free and repressive world order visions.\" The Trump Administration has leveled its strongest criticism at China's economic practices. In a major October 4, 2018, address on China policy, Vice President Mike Pence charged that China has used \"an arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade\" to build its manufacturing base, \"at the expense of its competitors\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially the United States of America.\"", "In their public statements on the United States, China's top leaders have generally refrained from direct criticism.

The bilateral relationship, Le asserted, is \"now going through the most complex and sensitive period since diplomatic relations were formalized four decades ago.\" Le called for \"a China-US relationship based on coordination, cooperation and stability,\" and pushed back at the idea that China is responsible for U.S. \"challenges.\" The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq \"sapped [U.S.] strategic strength,\" Le asserted, and the global financial crisis \"exposed the deep-seated imbalances in the U.S. economy and society.\" The United States should not make China \"a scapegoat,\" Le argued, for \"[p]roblems such as economic disparity, widening wealth gap and aging infrastructure.\"", "U.S.-China tensions predated the Trump Administration.

Bush Administration document mounting U.S. frustrations with China's failure to implement market-opening commitments it made when it acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001. Previous Administrations concluded, however, that a modus vivendi with China was necessary for a broad array of U.S. policy objectives in the world, and they thus sought to balance competition and cooperation in the U.S.-China relationship.

China's name for the conflict is the \"War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.\" Early in the conflict, the United States sent its Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait \"to prevent the Korean conflict from spreading south,\" effectively preventing Communist forces from realizing their goal of finishing the Chinese Civil War by wresting control of Taiwan from Chiang's forces.", "In 1971, changing Cold War dynamics, including the Sino-Soviet split, led the Nixon Administration to undertake a profound shift in U.S. policy. Then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made a secret visit to China in July 1971. In October of the same year, the United States supported U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758, recognizing the PRC's representatives as \"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations,\" and expelling \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek.\" President Richard Nixon formally ended nearly a quarter of a century of estrangement between the United States and the PRC with his historic visit to China in February 1972.

The same year, Deng launched a bold program of \"reforming and opening\" to the outside world that would transform China from a backward, isolated country into the economic powerhouse, emerging military power, and shaper of global institutions that it is today.", "Through the 1970s and 1980s, the overriding strategic rationale for the U.S.-China relationship was counterbalancing a shared enemy, the Soviet Union. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. and Chinese leaders cast about for a new rationale for their relationship. President Bill Clinton and China's then-leader Jiang Zemin both came to see benefits in expanding bilateral economic ties, including by working together to bring China into the WTO. On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law P.L. 106-286 , granting China permanent normal trade relations and paving the way for China to join the WTO, which it did in December 2001. In 2018, the Trump Administration argued that \"the United States erred in supporting China's entry into the WTO on terms that have proven to be ineffective in securing China's embrace of an open, market-oriented trade regime.\" A former George W. Bush Administration official suggests that \"identifying a preferable alternative, even with the benefit of hindsight, is surpassingly difficult.\"", "After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the George W. Bush Administration settled on counterterrorism cooperation as a new strategic rationale for the U.S.-China relationship, but China complicated that rationale when it persuaded the United States to apply a terrorist label to separatist ethnic Uyghurs from its northwest Xinjiang region. During the Obama Administration, even as U.S.-China friction mounted over economic issues, cyber espionage, human rights, and the South China Sea, the two sides embraced as a strategic rationale for their relationship the need for their cooperation to address some of the world's most pressing challenges, including weak global economic growth, climate change, and nuclear proliferation.

Framework Convention on Climate Change.", "Over the past four decades, the U.S.-China relationship has faced some high-profile tests: ", "In June 1989, a decade after normalization of U.S.-China relations, China's leaders ordered the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to clear Beijing's Tiananmen Square of peaceful protestors, killing hundreds, or more. In response, the United States imposed sanctions on China, some of which remain in place today. In 1995-1996, a U.S. decision to allow Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to make a private visit to the United States and deliver a speech at his alma mater, Cornell University, led to what became known as the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. China expressed its anger at the visit by conducting a series of missile exercises around Taiwan, prompting the Clinton Administration to dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area. In May 1999, two decades after normalization of U.S.-China relations, a U.S. Air Force B-2 bomber involved in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations over Yugoslavia mistakenly dropped five bombs on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese journalists and injuring 20 embassy personnel. The event set off anti-U.S. demonstrations in China, during which protestors attacked U.S. diplomatic facilities. In April 2001, a PLA naval J-8 fighter plane collided with a U.S. Navy EP-3 reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea, killing the Chinese pilot. The U.S. crew made an emergency landing on China's Hainan Island, where Chinese authorities detained them for 11 days. Negotiations for return of the U.S. plane took much longer. In February 2012, a Chongqing Municipality Vice Mayor sought refuge in the U.S. consulate in the western China city of Chengdu, where he is believed to have shared explosive information about wrongdoing by his then-boss, an ambitious Politburo member. Thirty-six hours later, U.S. officials handed the Vice Mayor over to officials from Beijing. The Politburo member, Bo Xilai, soon fell from grace in one of the most spectacular political scandals in PRC history. In April 2012, after Chinese legal advocate Chen Guangcheng, who is blind, escaped house arrest in China's Shandong Province, the U.S. Embassy in China rescued him from the streets of Beijing and brought him into the U.S. Embassy compound, where he stayed for six days.
