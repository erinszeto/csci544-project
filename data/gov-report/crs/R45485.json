Experience has shown that companies first to market with new products can capture the bulk of the revenues, yielding long-term benefits for those companies and significant economic gains for the countries where those companies are located. Hence, technology companies around the world are racing to develop 5G products, and some countries (i.e., central governments) are acting in support of 5G deployment. This competition to develop 5G products and capture the global 5G market is often called the \"race to 5G.\"", "In the race to 5G, the United States is one of the leaders, along with China and South Korea.

China has a national plan to deploy 5G domestically, capture the revenues from its domestic market, improve its industrial systems, and become a leading supplier of telecommunications equipment to the world. In South Korea, the central government is working with telecommunications providers to deploy 5G. South Korea plans to be the first country to deploy 5G nationwide, and to use the technology to improve its industrial systems. In the United States, private industry is leading 5G deployment.

First-generation (1G) technologies brought consumers the first mobile phone. The phone and the service were expensive, and the basic analog networks offered voice-only services, and limited coverage and capacity. Second-generation (2G) technologies used digital networks, which supported voice and texting. Networks were expanded and phones were made more affordable, increasing adoption. Third-generation (3G) technologies supported voice, data, and mobile access to the internet (e.g., email, videos). Smartphones were introduced, and people began using mobile phones as computers for business and entertainment, greatly increasing demand for data. Fourth-generation (4G) technologies offered increased speeds, and true mobile broadband that could support music and video streaming, mobile applications, and online gaming. Providers offered unlimited data plans and mobile devices that could be used as hotspots to connect other devices to the network, further increasing demand for mobile data.

To be called a \"3G network\" implied a specific network architecture and specific technologies were used, certain levels of speeds were offered, and new features were supported. In earlier generations, companies and countries adopted different technical standards to achieve performance requirements. In 3G and 4G, companies and countries began building networks to the same standards. This enabled equipment to be used in many countries, enabled manufacturers to achieve economies of scale, and enabled carriers to speed deployment. For example, for 4G, companies and countries adopted Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standards, which redefined the network architecture to offer greater speeds and capacity.

As an example, analysts note that many network operators are adopting the 5G Non-Stand Alone standard to leverage their legacy 4G networks as a first step to building out 5G. China is supporting the 5G Stand-Alone standard which would require operators to rebuild core networks and buy new base stations and equipment, and move all countries toward more advanced IoT devices (which China is focused on providing). However, in the development of standards for 5G, SDO members supported both Non-Stand-Alone and Stand-Alone specifications, which enabled them to leverage 4G networks, improve 4G services with 5G technologies, and provide better services as companies plan out 5G deployments.

For example, China began deploying 5G infrastructure before 5G specifications were approved, and Verizon launched fixed 5G services using proprietary standards. While these efforts provide some advantages in future deployments, in that companies can prepare for and learn from these deployments, there are also risks. For example, last-minute revisions to the specifications may require China to upgrade those pre-standard 5G sites.", "To offer mobile 5G technologies, companies need 5G phones, which were under development.

However, as more people are using more mobile devices for more purposes, this segment of the spectrum (below 6 GHz) is becoming crowded, which can result in slower speeds, slower connections, and dropped calls.", "In 2015, companies began looking at new spectrum bands that could support mobile communications. Industry researchers identified waves between 30 GHz and 300 GHz (also known as millimeter waves or MMW) that offered greater bandwidth (e.g., higher capacity to handle more traffic) and increased speeds. Telecommunication providers had not considered MMW for mobile communications because the waves are shorter, cannot travel far, cannot travel well through buildings, and tend to be absorbed by trees and rain. Researchers proposed the use of small cells, placed close together, to relay shorter waves across longer distances, and to interconnect them to provide a high-speed network to specific areas, such as a city or a stadium.
