The Office of Government Ethics expressly provides in regulation that such a \"conflict of interest\" will arise in two circumstances: (1) when the activity is expressly prohibited either by statute or by a specific agency regulation concerning such conduct; and (2) when general \"conflict of interest\" principles and rules would require that an employee recuse or disqualify himself or herself from participating in governmental matters to such an extent as to \"materially impair\" the employee's ability to do his or her duty.", "This report examines general statutory restrictions on certain types and categories of outside, compensated employment activities by federal employees, and surveys specific agency and departmental regulations prohibiting particular types and areas of outside, compensated employment activities for employees of that agency or department."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["For most rank-and-file federal employees in the executive branch of government there is no general, overall statutory or regulatory restriction or prohibition on outside, additional compensated employment activity\u2014known colloquially as \"moonlighting.\" Broad restrictions on outside, compensated employment may apply to more senior officials in the executive branch. However, for rank-and-file federal employees the concept of \"conflicts of interest\" generally controls the restriction on or permissibility of outside, compensated activity, and would bar such \"moonlighting\" when (1) a statute or a specific agency regulation expressly prohibits that particular kind of outside employment activity, or (2) an outside activity, because of the particular official duties of the employee, would require that the employee \"recuse\" or disqualify himself or herself from official duties to such an extent as to impair the effectiveness of his or her employment for the government."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conflicting Outside Employment", "paragraphs": ["The conflict of interest limitations on outside, additional private employment of federal employees, which are set out in provisions of federal law, regulation, and executive order, establish the general principle that employees may not receive compensation from certain private parties where a potential \"conflict of interest\" may arise, that is, where the outside private activity may conflict with one's federal, public position and duties. This may limit and restrict outside employment opportunities both as to the source of compensation and, potentially, as to the subject matter and nature of the duties of an outside position. ", "General ethical standards promulgated by executive order specifically require that employees avoid \"outside employment or activities ... that conflict with official Government duties and responsibilities.\" The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) has stated in the government-wide ethics regulations promulgated for the executive branch that outside employment would \"conflict\" with official duties in two specific instances:", "1. Express Statutory or Regulatory Restriction. Initially, the Office of Government Ethics notes that conflicting activities include those that are prohibited by statute or by agency supplemental regulations. Each federal agency, upon approval from the Office of Government Ethics, is authorized to issue ethics and conflict of interest regulations supplemental to OGE's government-wide provisions, which may relate to and bear upon the particular function and mission of that agency. Employees must thus examine their individual agency's own regulations on outside employment and conflicts of interest before engaging in outside compensated activity. In addition to specific restrictions on certain kinds of outside employment, it is common for agency supplemental regulations to require the employee to receive express prior approval to engage in outside employment activities.", "2. Employment Which Creat es a Disqualifying Conflict of Interest. Secondly, the regulations provide that a \"conflicting\" outside employment would result if that activity necessitated the employee's disqualification and recusal from official matters so central to the individual's governmental duties that it would \"materially impair\" the employee's capacity to perform his or her official responsibilities. \"Recusal\" or disqualification from participating in a governmental matter under consideration is one of the principal \"conflict of interest\" avoidance mechanisms in federal law and regulation. Under current conflict of interest law and regulation, an employee in the executive branch is required to disqualify himself or herself from official governmental activities regarding any \"particular matter\" when such matter would have a \"direct and predictable effect\" upon a personal financial interest of the employee, or upon the financial interests of the employee's outside employer or business associates. Outside activities which entangle federal employees in outside employment, business, or economic relationships requiring such regular recusals or disqualifications under federal law or regulation would thus be prohibited, on a case-by-case basis, under this standard.", "Federal employees are cautioned as a general matter that outside employment and other outside activities must comply with the other ethics standards and provisions promulgated by the Office of Government Ethics and by executive order, including \"the principle that an employee shall endeavor to avoid actions creating the appearance of violating any of the ethical standards\" promulgated by OGE, and \"the prohibition against use of official position for an employee's private gain or for the private gain\" of one with whom he or she has a business or economic relationship. Employees are expressly restricted by regulation from using official government resources, supplies, or their official government time, to work on outside, private activities. It should also be noted that general ethical standards for executive branch personnel provide that \"An employee shall not ... solicit or accept any gift or other item of monetary value from any person or entity seeking official action from, doing business with, or conducting activities regulated by the employee's agency, or whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's duties.\" This standard must be observed by federal employees in the conduct of any outside business and financial activities and relationships."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutory and Regulatory Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["There are certain specific statutory restrictions which might apply in some circumstances to restrict or prohibit the receipt of outside compensation by executive branch personnel, or to limit certain types of outside activities for private parties. No employee of the U.S. government may receive anything of value \"for or because of\" any official act performed or to be performed by that employee or officer; no employee may receive or share in compensation for private \"representational services\" rendered to parties in any matter before a federal agency; federal employees may not represent private parties in any matter in which the United States is a party or is interested, before an agency of the government or a court, whether for compensation or not; federal employees must disqualify themselves from working on any government matter in which they have a personal financial interest, or in which a firm or entity for whom they serve as an officer or employee has a financial interest; and no executive branch employee may be compensated by a private source for his or her government work, that is, one may not receive salary supplementation from outside private sources for services performed within the scope of one's federal employment.", "Furthermore, no federal government officer or employee may receive any compensation (\"emoluments\") from a foreign government or other official foreign entity, without the consent of Congress, nor may any federal employee act as an \"agent\" of a \"foreign principal.\" Employees of the federal government who earn over a particular amount are restricted by tax consequences from \"self-dealings\" with private foundations, which may include limitations on the receipt of compensation and expenses from such entities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Honoraria, Lecturing, and Writing", "paragraphs": ["For a short time executive branch employees were prohibited, under the provisions of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, from receiving or earning any \"honoraria\" for outside writing, lecturing, or speaking. That prohibition, however, was overturned by the Supreme Court as an overbroad intrusion into protected First Amendment rights of federal employees and is no longer enforced by the Department of Justice against any officer or employee of the federal government.", "Outside lecturing, writing, and speaking for compensation by federal employees in the executive branch is not now completely unregulated, however. In addition to the general conflict of interest rules and standards discussed above, the Office of Government Ethics has issued regulations on outside lecturing and writing, limiting such compensated activity where particular ethics issues related to an employee's governmental responsibilities may arise.", "Under existing rules, employees may generally engage in privately compensated outside lecturing, writing, or teaching, even in subject areas which involve their inherent professional expertise or background, as long as no specific conflict or ethical problem arises in relation to their official duties. Employees may not use official government resources, time, supplies, or non-public information in the performance or preparation of those outside activities, nor may the outside, compensated activity deal with a matter which is currently (or has been within the last year) assigned to the employee, or which deals with an ongoing or announced policy of one's agency. ", "As to the subject matter of the outside activity, the Office of Government Ethics has explained that a federal employee is allowed to accept outside compensation for lecturing or writing, even if the subject is within the employee's area of expertise because of his or her education, training, and employment, and even though the employee's agency may deal with the subject matter:", "[The regulation] does not preclude an employee, other than a covered noncareer employee, from receiving compensation for teaching, speaking or writing on a subject within the employee's discipline or inherent area of expertise based on his educational background or experience even though the teaching, speaking or writing deals generally with a subject within the agency's area of responsibility.", "The central ethical issue in outside, compensated writing and lecturing is thus not whether the subject of a lecture or writing is merely \"related\" in some general, undefined way to the subject of one's employment or expertise with the government. It has not been perceived to be a significant or particular \"conflict of interest\" or ethical problem, in and of itself, for a government employee to share his or her knowledge or expertise, gained through the employee's education, background, and experience, with members of the public, or to join in the discussion of issues of public policy outside of the work place, even for additional compensation. Rather, the concerns have been with an employee wrongly using the perquisites of federal office, non-public information, government resources or supplies, for his or her own personal financial gain, and to the detriment of the government; the potential undue influence upon an employee in being compensated merely because he or she is a government official, or being compensated by an outside party whose interests may be affected by the employee's official duties for the government; the issue of divided loyalties if a government employee is compensated by a private party for his or her official government work; creating an outside employment or other financial interest which may pose a conflict of interest with official duties; and in restricting outside activities so as not to compromise confidential information or ongoing or recent government matters or decisions, or creating the appearance that the employee in his or her private capacity is somehow representing official government policy.", "As outlined by the Office of Government Ethics regulations, compensation for outside lecturing and writing activities is proscribed when such activities are \"related\" in particular, prohibited ways to one's official position or duties such that these ethical issues might arise. This so-called \"relatedness test\" restricts an outside paid activity if", "(A) the activity is undertaken as part of one's official duties; ", "(B) the invitation to speak or write is extended because of one's official position rather than one's expertise on a matter;", "(C) the compensation is offered by a party who may be affected by the performance of the employee's official duties;", "(D) the activities rely on non-public information; or", "(E) the activities deal in significant part with a matter currently assigned to the employee, or assigned within the last year, or deal with an ongoing or announced policy of one's agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Specific Agency Regulatory Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, each federal agency is authorized to promulgate and publish additional, supplemental ethics regulations when approved by the Office of Government Ethics and published in the Code of Federal Regulations. Most federal agencies that have published additional, supplemental ethics rules expressly require that employees receive advanced approval from the agency for outside employment activities, and set out the criteria for approval of such activities.

Unlike rank-and-file federal employees, a non-career official who is compensated at a rate above a GS-15 is prohibited by Office of Government Ethics regulations from receiving compensation for speaking, lecturing, or writing activity if the subject matter of the speech, article, or appearance \"deals in significant part with ... the general subject matter area, industry, or economic sector primarily affected by the programs and operations of his agency,\" and must receive authorization in advance to engage in outside, compensated teaching activities.", "Although the general restriction on compensated outside employment in the executive order applicable to presidential appointees may supersede many specific statutory limitations on directors or administrators of federal regulatory agencies, there may also be statutory provisions, often enacted as part of the organic act creating the particular agency or federal entity, which\u2014for certain high-level officials such as the director or head of such entity\u2014may limit professional or employment activity in a particular field or endeavor that the agency regulates or oversees, or outside employment generally.
