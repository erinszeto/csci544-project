Forty-six states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have laws requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. Federal statutes, regulations, and a memorandum for federal departments and agencies require certain sectors (healthcare, financial, federal public sector, and the Department of Veterans Affairs) to implement information security programs and provide notification of security breaches of personal information. In response to such notification laws, over 2,676 data breaches and computer intrusions involving 535 million records containing sensitive personal information have been disclosed by data brokers, businesses, retailers, educational institutions, government and military agencies, healthcare providers, financial institutions, nonprofit organizations, utility companies, and Internet businesses. As a result, a significantly large number of individuals have received notices that their personally identifiable information has been improperly disclosed.", "This report provides an overview of state security breach notification laws applicable to entities that collect, maintain, own, possess, or license personal information.

See CRS Report R42474, Selected Federal Data Security Breach Legislation, by [author name scrubbed]. S. 1151 (Leahy), the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2011, would apply to business entities to prevent and mitigate identity theft, ensure privacy, provide notice of security breaches, and enhance criminal penalties. It would provide law enforcement assistance and other protections against security breaches, fraudulent access, and misuse of personally identifiable information. S. 1408 (Feinstein), the Data Breach Notification Act of 2011, would require federal agencies and persons engaged in interstate commerce, in possession of data containing sensitive personally identifiable information, to disclose any breach of such information. S. 1535 (Blumenthal), the Personal Data Protection and Breach Accountability Act of 2011, would protect consumers by mitigating the vulnerability of personally identifiable information to theft through a security breach, provide notice and remedies to consumers, hold companies accountable for preventable breaches, facilitate the sharing of post-breach technical information, and enhance criminal and civil penalties and other protections against the unauthorized collection or use of personally identifiable information. The House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade marked up H.R. 2577 (Bono Mack), the SAFE Data Act, to protect consumers by requiring reasonable security policies and procedures to protect data containing personal information, and to provide for nationwide notice in the event of a security breach. Several subcommittee Democrats objected to the bill's definition of personal information, arguing that the description is limited and does not adequately protect consumers from identity theft. The House Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade Subcommittee approved H.R. 2577 by voice vote and the measure was referred to the full committee for consideration. H.R. 1707 (Rush) and H.R. 1841 (Stearns) were also introduced to protect consumers by requiring reasonable security policies and procedures to protect computerized data containing personal information and providing for nationwide notice in the event of a breach.

In February 2005, the data broker ChoicePoint disclosed a security breach, as required by the California Security Breach Act, involving the personal information of 163,000 persons. In 2006, the personal data of 26.5 million veterans was breached when a VA employee's hard drive was stolen from his home. In 2007, the retailer TJX Companies revealed that 46.2 million credit and debit cards may have been compromised during the breach of its computer network by unauthorized individuals. In 2008, the Hannaford supermarket chain revealed that approximately 4 million debit and credit card numbers were compromised when Hannaford's computer systems were illegally accessed while the cards were being authorized for purchase. In 2009, 130 million records from credit card processor Heartland Payment Systems Inc. of Princeton, N.J., were breached. Also, in 2009, personal information from Health Net on almost half a million Connecticut residents and 1.5 million patients nationally was breached. In 2011, another breach of patient data occurred when data for 20,000 emergency room patients from Stanford Hospital in California was posted on a commercial website for nearly a year.

Data breaches are expensive, time consuming, and can damage a company's reputation. U.S. companies are reportedly reticent about buying cyber liability insurance even though data breaches have cost companies millions of dollars. Data breaches involving sensitive personal information may also result in identity theft and financial crimes (e.g., credit card fraud, phone or utilities fraud, bank fraud, mortgage fraud, employment-related fraud, government documents or benefits fraud, loan fraud, and health-care fraud). Identity theft involves the misuse of any individually identifying information to commit a violation of federal or state law. With continued media reports of data security breaches, concerns about identity theft are widespread.", "Cloud computing also poses particular data security challenges as illustrated by the 2011 Epsilon, Sony, and Amazon data breaches. E-mail marketing company Epsilon announced in April 2011 that its databases had been hacked, compromising customer names and e-mail addresses for companies that outsource their marketing communications to Epsilon. E-mails concerning the breach from companies including Citibank, Chase, Capital One, Walgreens, Target, Best Buy, TiVo, TD Ameritrade, Verizon, and Ritz Carlton were sent after Epsilon announced the data breach. About 2% of Epsilon's estimated 2,500 clients were affected by the attack, which amounted to millions of exposed records.", "Sony announced that in April 2011 certain PlayStation Network and Qriocity service user account information was compromised in connection with an illegal and unauthorized intrusion into its network.", "The Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), suffered a partial failure when one of Amazon's giant server farms (the northern Virginia data center\u2014\"US-East\"), whose storage and processing facilities it rents to other companies, suffered a lengthy outage. Customers whose information technology was hosted by Amazon EC2 were down. These included applications like Foursquare, Formspring, HootSuite, and Reddit, among others. In addition, the failure propagated across multiple \"availability zones.\" It was also reported that Amazon permanently lost some customer data.", "Litigation and enforcement actions arising from security breaches of personal information are becoming common. Lawsuits seeking class action status are proceeding against retailers, credit card issuers, payment processors, and banks. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has brought enforcement actions, along with states' attorneys general, for violations of consumer protection laws amounting to unfair practices.

California was the first jurisdiction to enact a data breach notification law in 2002, requiring notification when unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. There followed the emergence of numerous federal and state bills modeled after the California law imposing notification requirements on entities that own, license, or process personal information. Many states, however, included an element of harm as a trigger for notification rather than simply unauthorized acquisition. For example, under Alaska law \"disclosure is not required if, after an appropriate investigation and after written notification to the attorney general of this state, the covered person determines that there is not a reasonable likelihood that harm to the consumers whose personal information has been acquired has resulted or will result from the breach.\"", "The majority of states have enacted laws requiring notice of security breaches of personal data. As of January 2012, 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted laws requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, in 2011 at least 14 states introduced legislation expanding the scope of laws, setting additional requirements related to notification, or changing penalties for those responsible for breaches.

In September 2012, when the amended Texas breach notification law goes into effect, breach notification obligations will exist in all states because Texas will then require entities doing business within the state to provide notification of data breaches to residents of states that have not enacted their own breach notification law. Thus, breach notification obligations will exist in all states because Texas's consumer notification obligations will apply not only to residents of Texas, but also to residents of states that don't have security breach notice requirements.", "Variations in state security breach notification law have been described as \"so numerous that it is virtually impossible to convert these state laws into the more manageable format of fifty-state surveys.\" Because states have different requirements, businesses engaged in interstate commerce are confronted with compliance challenges and cite the lack of uniformity as justification for a national security breach notification standard. State security breach notification laws have been criticized for creating \"a fragmented, incoherent liability scheme.\"", "The nature of any causal connection between security breaches and concrete harms suffered by consumers such as identity theft remains unclear. Because American consumers are not protected by a general right of information privacy, mere notice that a security breach has occurred is not associated with any right to compensation. Attempts to establish a right to damages following receipt of a security breach notice through class action lawsuits have generally only succeeded in clarifying the degree to which no such right exists, although many businesses suffering breaches have chosen on a voluntary basis to provide their customers with credit monitoring services to reduce the risk of harm from identity theft.", "Proponents of state security breach notification laws believe that state laboratories can provide stronger protection for sensitive personal information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Elements of Security Breach Notification Laws", "paragraphs": ["State security breach notification laws generally follow a similar framework and can be categorized into several standard elements: (1) delineating who must comply with the law; (2) defining the terms \"personal information\" and \"breach of security\"; (3) establishing the elements of harm that must occur, if any, for notice to be triggered; (4) adopting requirements for notice; (5) creating exemptions and safe harbors; (6) clarifying preemption and relationships to other federal laws; and (7) creating penalties, enforcement authorities, and remedies.", "State security breach notification laws vary regarding who is subject to the law\u2014covered entities include businesses, state agencies, for profits, non-profits, information brokers, or persons conducting business within the state that own, license, or maintain the personal information of state residents.

A few states include medical information and/or health insurance information. Many states exclude from the definition of personal information any publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records. The term \"sensitive personally identifiable information\" is a subset of personally identifiable information (PII), the meaning of which also varies, but typically includes any information about an individual (including education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history) along with information that can be used to distinguish or trace the individual's identity (including name, address, or telephone number; date and place of birth; mother's maiden name; Social Security number or other government-issued unique identification number; biometric data; or unique account identifiers).", "The standard definition for \"breach of security\" is unauthorized acquisition of personal information that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information maintained by a covered entity.", "In some states, the standard trigger for notice is the unauthorized access and acquisition of personal information.
