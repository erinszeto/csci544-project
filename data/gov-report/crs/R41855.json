The dislocated worker program is intended to fund employment and training activities for a specific group of unemployed individuals\u2014dislocated workers. Dislocated workers are distinguished from the general category of adult unemployed individuals for purposes of funding allocations and are defined in WIA by specific criteria such as being part of a mass layoff.", "Interest in the dislocated worker program's allocation formula has increased recently because some high unemployment states have lost substantial funds under this program in recent years and there has been significant volatility in year-to-year state funding allocations under this particular funding stream. This report examines the funding formula and explores the pros and cons of alternative allocation procedures. The analysis in this report leads to three conclusions:", "First, the current dislocated worker formula does not align fully with the WIA-defined population of dislocated workers. The factors used for allocating funds in the formula may include but do not focus on the targeted population of dislocated workers. Second, as currently configured, the dislocated worker formula results in volatile changes in state allocations from one year to the next. While some volatility in allocations may be desirable so that funds go to the areas of greatest temporal need, the mechanics of the current formula tend to exaggerate the underlying volatility of the factors and lead to large annual changes in the intensity of funding (i.e., funding dollars per funding factor). Third, there are several alternatives to the current factors in the dislocated worker formula and several alternative formula features that may potentially offer better alignment with the target population and reduced volatility. In addition, there are options available to mitigate the large swings in specific state annual allocations under the dislocated worker formula."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) was enacted in 1998 and replaced the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) as the federal government's primary employment and job training legislation.

Funds authorized under Title I, Subtitle B of WIA (\"Statewide and Local Workforce Investment Systems\") are allocated to states by formula and are used for workforce development activities. The three formula grant programs in Title I\u2014youth, adults, and dislocated workers\u2014authorize funding for employment and training activities available through the national system of One-Stop centers and are provided by service providers in local communities.

For example, in program year (PY) 2010 nearly $3 billion of the total Title I funding of $5.5 billion was allocated by state formula grants. WIA allocation formulas are specified by statute, which defines formula factors, specifies factor weights, and prescribes the distribution of funds to states and localities. The allocation formulas take the form of mathematical equations through which DOL calculates the specific grant amounts to each state.", "The dislocated worker program is the largest of the three Title I grant programs and is intended to provide funding for employment and training activities for a specific group of unemployed individuals\u2014dislocated workers. In recent years, the dislocated worker program has provided approximately $1.2 billion annually in formula grants to states, the majority of which was subsequently suballocated to local areas within states.", "Interest in the dislocated worker program has intensified recently for several reasons. First, while the dislocated worker formula is, partially by design, more volatile (i.e., the size of an individual state's grant varies from year to year) than the two other state allocation formulas used in WIA (Adult and Youth programs), the recent recession and the large and rapid rise in the number of unemployed it produced has magnified the formula's allocation volatility. In the past two to three years, several states have seen funding declines from the prior year in excess of 40%. In addition, some states with high and persistent unemployment were the hardest hit in terms of funding cuts, even while experiencing rising levels of unemployment. This recent pattern of large, unpredictable, and in many cases countercyclical, swings in funding fails to meet one of the underlying aims of the dislocated worker program\u2014allocation of funds to states in a manner that consistently reflects their absolute and relative need and that consistently corresponds with changes in the state level of need.", "Second, the large shifts in state funding from year to year make it difficult to plan, budget for, and operate a program that is designed to be responsive to economic dislocations. When states have rising unemployment, it becomes more difficult to provide employment and training services with level funding. However, when funding declines, in a manner and at levels that cannot be anticipated, in times of rising unemployment, it is unlikely that states can consistently operate cohesive programs and can meet the demand for services.", "Third, in addition to concerns about the dislocated worker program formula leading to significant volatility and concerns about a mismatch between changes in unemployment and changes in funding, a fundamental misalignment between the formula factors and the intended population of the formula has also come under some scrutiny. WIA authorized a formula specifically to allocate resources for dislocated workers\u2014a subpopulation of unemployed workers in general. Yet the formula as currently designed does not incorporate a measure that specifically identifies this subpopulation of workers. Thus, the stated intent in WIA of targeting funds separately for dislocated workers does not match the formula specified in statute to allocate funds for this population.", "As reauthorization of WIA is considered, there is substantial interest in exploring ways to improve the formula design so that it better aligns with the statutorily specified goals of the dislocated worker program.

From these allocations, a portion of the funds are retained by the states for statewide activities and the remainder of the funds are suballocated to local Workforce Investment Boards (WIB). There are both required and allowable statewide and local employment and training activities.", "Statewide required and allowable employment and training activities include dissemination of the state list of eligible providers of training services, evaluations of state workforce investment programs, assistance to local areas in establishing One-Stop delivery systems, operation of a fiscal and management accountability system in order to report on and monitor the use of WIA funds, and various forms of technical assistance.", "Local required and allowable employment and training activities are centered on establishing and operating a local One-Stop delivery system and providing core, intensive, and training services. The programs for adult and dislocated worker participants in WIA are structured around a sequential service strategy that consists of three levels of services: core, intensive, and training. Service at one level is a prerequisite for service at the next level. That is, any individual may receive \"core\" services (e.g., job search assistance). To receive intensive services (e.g., career planning), WIA requires that individuals be unable, after receiving core services, \"to obtain or retain employment that allows for self-sufficiency.\" To receive training (e.g., occupational skills, on-the-job), after receiving intensive services, an individual must have been unable to obtain or retain employment that allows for self sufficiency. Further, to be considered for training, an individual must also have the \"skills and qualifications\" to participate successfully in training (as determined by a One-Stop case manager), choose a training service linked to an occupation in the local area (or be willing to locate to another area where the occupation is in demand), and be unable to obtain other grant assistance (e.g., Pell grants) for the training services.", "The dislocated worker program is the largest of the three WIA state formula grant programs, representing in FY2010 nearly 40% of total state formula grant funding ($1.2 billion of the approximately $3 billion in state formula funding). Unlike the two other formula grant programs in Title I of WIA\u2014Adult and Youth\u2014the dislocated worker program clearly targets a subpopulation within the larger category of unemployed workers. That is, WIA carves out a separate program and separate funding stream for a population that is identified by a particular type of unemployment. In addition, and unlike the WIA programs for youth and adults, the dislocated worker program receives an annual allocation of more than $200 million ($229 million in FY2010) to fund the National Reserve, which funds, among other items, national emergency grants and various types of programs to respond to major economic dislocations.

For instance, eligibility is afforded in cases of anticipated facility closings and for self-employed workers. However, the core eligibility requirement is dislocation due to no-fault termination or facility closing. There is no eligibility requirement under WIA related to the cause of the dislocation. From the perspective of the individual, however, the classification of \"adult\" or \"dislocated\" will not make a difference in terms of services funded by formula grants and provided through One-Stop centers.

In general, allocation formulas use some combination of population-based factors as a way to direct federal resources toward areas with large concentrations of the program's target group. That is, a factor represents a quantifiable measure of some population or characteristic of the population that reflects the program's target. Programs that allocate funding in this manner usually have a cap on total federal spending, thus the allocation factors determine each jurisdiction's share of the total amount available. The discussion below is not intended to be exhaustive but only to provide a sense of the range of components that make up a formula.", "Many formula programs target aid to low-income individuals. While programs for low-income individuals often allocate funds in part on a measure of economic need (e.g., population with income at or below poverty guidelines), not all formula factors are need-based. Some factors are population-based (e.g., rural population), some are characteristic-based (e.g., number of low-income children without health insurance), and some are education-based (e.g., number of individuals ages 16 and over who have not completed high school). Further, some programs base allocations in whole or in part on historic spending patterns, which may reflect a wide variety of factors (e.g., TANF block grants are allocated based on historic spending under predecessor programs). If current population-based formulas were applied to programs using historic spending as a base, the distribution of resources might change significantly. The specific data sources used in formulas are also significant and may be specified in statute. If a formula relies on older data or data subject to large subsequent revisions, funding distributions might not reflect current need.", "Moreover, there are various formula features that are often used to mitigate large changes in a particular jurisdiction's formula-based allotment from one year to the next. For example, formulas might include \"hold-harmless\" provisions to limit annual changes to a certain percentage of the previous year's allocation, \"small-state\" minimums to guarantee less populous states a minimum level of funding, and \"floors\" and \"ceilings\" to create some degree of predictability in annual allocations.", "As will be discussed below, the WIA formulas are principally focused on distributing funds in accordance with varied measures of unemployment and states' relative share of unemployment. The WIA dislocated worker formula considers three measures of unemployment\u2014total unemployment, long-term unemployment, and \"excess\" unemployment. The dislocated worker formula does not employ the use of formula features used in many federal formulas that serve as a hedge against volatility (e.g., ceilings and floors, hold harmless provisions)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dislocated Worker Formula Factors", "paragraphs": ["Funding for the DW program under WIA is distributed to states by a formula grant.

Second, 204,003 was subtracted from the average monthly number of total unemployed in New Jersey in the same period (372,712), resulting in 168,709 excess unemployed individuals.

All three factors in the dislocated worker formula\u2014total unemployed, excess unemployed, and long-term unemployed\u2014are drawn from the same data source: the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is a monthly household survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau. The three factors in the dislocated worker state formula grant are all based on the concept of unemployed individuals as measured in the CPS. To be counted as \"unemployed,\" an individual must have no employment during the reference week, must be available for work during the reference week, and must have actively searched for work within the previous four-week period. In addition, the CPS provides data on the occupation and industry of individuals.", "As will be discussed below, the CPS data on unemployed individuals are not perfectly matched with the WIA definitions of dislocated workers. Data limitations pertaining to each class of worker included in the WIA dislocated worker definition are as follows:", "Terminated, attached to the labor force . The CPS data used in the current dislocated worker formula provide the total number of unemployed but do not provide reason for termination . In addition, the unemployment count used in the formula is in no way dependent upon labor force attachment (e.g., it does not consider eligibility for or receipt of unemployment insurance benefits). The derivation of the excess and long-term unemployment factors likewise do not specify the reason for unemployment or attachment to the labor market. As a result, the data from the CPS over-represent the number of dislocated workers because they include unemployed individuals who have lost their job for any reason (not just no-fault termination), who may or may not have sufficient attachment to the labor force, and who may or may not be likely to return to their previous industry or occupation. Substantial layoff or closure . As with the first class of worker (terminated, attached to the labor force), the CPS data over-represent the number of dislocated workers because there is not information about the nature of the termination (i.e., whether it was part of a larger layoff or closure). Self-employed . The CPS data include self-employed workers in the count of unemployed individuals. The data do not, however, provide a separate count of self-employed workers and do not contain information on the cause of unemployment. Displaced homemakers . The CPS data include this class of worker but not as a separately identified group. In other words, there are most likely unemployed workers in the CPS data who meet the criteria of a displaced homemaker but it is not possible to determine how many of these individuals meet these criteria.", "In sum, while the CPS data provide accurate and timely information on the U.S. labor force, the CPS is not designed to capture the WIA-defined population of \"dislocated\" workers. As currently used in the dislocated worker formula, the CPS data do not measure attachment to the labor market, do not classify workers as \"unlikely to return the their previous occupation or industry,\" do not provide information on how wage and salary workers lost their jobs, do not identify self-employed individuals who are unemployed because of local economic conditions, and do not separately identify displaced homemakers. Thus the measures used for allocating funds in the current dislocated worker formula are likely to include but do not focus on the population of dislocated workers targeted by WIA.

One way to summarize the volatility of allocations is to examine volatility data by \"state-years.\" That is, a state-year represents the allocation in one state for a given year.

For example, from PY2009 to PY2010 Mississippi's dislocated worker funding allocation decreased 27.4%, which represents one state-year. For the entire period that WIA has been in existence, there are 468 state-years (i.e., 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico over nine years) between PY2002 and PY2010. Thus, of the 468 state-years, annual allocations increased or decreased by at least 30% from the previous year in 109, or 23%, of the state-years.

It is also the case that any formula based on the concept of \"relative share\" of factor levels (i.e., percentage of national totals) may result in allocation changes that do not match the changes in factor values (i.e., the number of individuals). The use of a threshold, however, exacerbates this feature of relative share formulas.

Volatility in an individual state's allocation is driven by whether the state crosses the 4.5% threshold from year to year and the degree to which the number of unemployed exceeds the threshold. Unlike the Adult and Youth program funding formulas, the dislocated worker allotment formula does not contain \"hold harmless\" provisions that specify a minimum or maximum allotment that a state must receive each program year. Because the formula is based on a state's relative share of unemployment and because there is no hold harmless provision, allotments may shift substantially between states, creating gains for some and losses for others. ", "The formula does not contain features that affect the calculation, other than the weights themselves, but the statutory definition of \"excess unemployment\" effectively serves as a \"threshold\" feature that is not present in the other two factors. That is, the cutoff of 4.5% means that states with a statewide unemployment rate below 4.5% (the statutorily defined rate) will not receive an allotment based on this factor (i.e., their share from the excess unemployment is 0 x 1/3 = 0). The remaining states\u2014those with unemployment in excess of 4.5%\u2014then split the one-third of the dislocated worker funding that is allocated through the excess unemployment factor. For example, in PY2008 23 states had unemployment in excess of 4.5% and thus split one-third of the dislocated worker funding ($394.6 million, which is one-third of the state formula allotment of $1.18 billion), based on each of the 23 states' relative share of total excess unemployment. In PY2009, 37 states had unemployment in excess of 4.5% and split one-third of the dislocated worker funding ($394.6 million, which is one-third of the state formula allotment of $1.18 billion). Thus, 14 more states shared the same pot of funding in PY2009 than had shared the same amount in PY2008.", "The effect of this threshold feature of the excess unemployment factor on individual states can be illustrated by looking at the experience of two states in PY2008 and PY2009:", "In PY2008, Michigan was one of 23 states with unemployment in excess of 4.5%. Michigan had a total of 128,258 individuals in excess unemployment and its relative share of excess unemployment among the 23 states was 22%. Of Michigan's total dislocated worker funding of $130.8 million in PY2008, $87.4 million was from the excess unemployment factor in the funding formula. In PY2009, Michigan was one of 37 states with unemployment in excess of 4.5%. Michigan had a total of 194,649 individuals in excess unemployment in PY2009 and its relative share of excess unemployment among the 37 states was 8.9%. In PY2009, Michigan's total dislocated worker funding dropped to $75.1 million. Of this $55.8 million decline in funding ($130.8 million - $75.1 million), $52.0 million was a result of Michigan's changing relative share of excess unemployment from PY2008 to PY2009. In sum, despite an increase in excess unemployment of just over 66,000 (52%), Michigan lost $55.8 million (43%) of its dislocated funding. In PY2008, Florida was one of 29 states with no excess unemployment. Thus, of Florida's total dislocated worker funding of $31.4 million in PY2008, $0 was from the excess unemployment factor in the funding formula. In PY2009, Florida was one of 37 states with unemployment in excess of 4.5%. Florida had a total of 141,829 individuals in excess unemployment in PY2009 and its relative share of excess unemployment among the 37 states was 6.5%. In PY2009, Florida's total dislocated worker funding increased to $77.1 million. Of this $45.7 million increase in funding ($77.1 million - $31.4 million), $25.8 million was a result of Florida's changing relative share of excess unemployment from PY2008 to PY2009.", "To illustrate the threshold effect more generally, Figure 1 shows the relationship in all states between changes in the value of excess unemployed and changes in allocations from PY2009 to PY2010. Specifically, Figure 1 shows the amount by which the total number of excess unemployed (right vertical axis) changed from PY2009 to PY2010 and the amount by which the one-third of the total allocation attributable to that factor changed (left vertical axis). Because the overall allocation for the dislocated worker formula grant was the same in PY2009 and PY2010 ($1.184 billion), the analysis shows exactly how much the excess unemployed factor contributed to each state's overall funding change. That is, each factor is weighted one-third and thus contributes one-third of the total $1.184 billion, or approximately $395 million.", "Data in Figure 1 illustrate how the use of a fixed threshold of a 4.5% unemployment rate to define excess unemployment does not always result in allocations that match the change in actual economic conditions in the states. While the excess unemployment factor is based on levels (not change in levels) and thus reflects any given state's share of all excess unemployed in a given allocation year, it often leads to sharply reduced levels of funding in some states when additional states trigger on to the dislocated worker excess unemployment factor in the formula. Specifically:", "The formula often results in divergent allocations among states experiencing similar increases in levels of excess unemployed. For example, from PY2009 to PY2010, Texas, New York, and Michigan saw similar increases in the number of excess unemployed (240,000, 227,000, and 211,000, respectively). Yet the changes in allocations from the dislocated worker formula ranged from $10.1 million more to Texas and $3.6 million more to New York to $10.1 million less to Michigan. Similarly, Kansas and Mississippi each had approximately 25,000 additional excess unemployed from PY2009 to PY2010, but Kansas received an additional $1.4 million in funds while Mississippi received $2.4 million less in funds compared to PY2009 allocations. The formula results in transferring funds away from some states (in some cases, states with persistently high unemployment) in times of generally rising unemployment. In Figure 1 , 12 states were \"new\" in PY2010. That is, these 12 states received a $0 allocation from the excess unemployed factor in PY2009 but triggered on in PY2010 and received an allocation. Of course, because 12 additional states were \"on\" for allocation purposes in PY2010 and because there was no additional funding for the dislocated worker grant formula, by necessity funds for the \"new\" states had to be \"paid for\" by reallocating from states currently receiving an allocation from the excess unemployment factor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relative Share and Changes in Factor Values", "paragraphs": ["The sort of mismatches between changes in economic conditions and changes in allocations shown in Figure 1 are exacerbated by the threshold in the excess unemployment factor but may also exist, albeit to a lesser degree, in the absence of a such a feature. In a program such as the WIA dislocated worker program, which is characterized by nearly flat annual funding and a formula based on each state's relative share of formula factors, normal changes in the values of the formula factors may cause some shifting of funds away from states with increased need. For example, combining the data in Figure 1 with funding and factor data for the state of California illustrates the performance of the three formula factors:", "From PY2009 to PY2010, excess unemployment increased by 649,431 in California but its allocation from this factor decreased by $19.7 million ( Figure 1 shows this portion of the total allocation). From PY2009 to PY2010, total unemployment increased by 653,128 in California and its allocation from this factor increased by $779,376.

In PY2009, California's total allocation from the dislocated worker formula grant was $212.3 million and its total allocation in PY2010 was $192.4 million\u2014a loss of $19.9 million. Because overall funding for the dislocated worker formula grant was the same in both years, the change in allocation was fully attributable to changes in California's relative share of each factor.", "Taken together, California's decrease in dislocated worker funding is almost entirely a function of the excess unemployment factor. That is, despite increases in the absolute level of unemployment for all three formula factors, California's allocation from total unemployment went up slightly and its allocation from long-term unemployment went down slightly; however, these small changes were completely offset by its large allocation drop from excess unemployment. The same phenomenon occurred for allocations from the excess unemployed and the long-term unemployed factors\u2014increases in the number of unemployed but decreases in funding for these factors. The change in funding from the long-term unemployed factor, however, was considerably less than the change from excess unemployed because there is no threshold for long-term unemployed.

From an operational standpoint, large changes in resource intensity from year to year may make it difficult to provide consistency and stability in services.", " Figure 2 provides data on the funding from each factor (excess, total, and long-term unemployed) divided by the target population. For example, in PY2009 the total state formula allocation for dislocated workers ($1.2 billion) was distributed equally by the three formula factors, or approximately $395 million per factor. Divided by the relevant population for each factor, this yielded funding of $182 for each excess unemployed individual, $43 for each unemployed individual, and $123 for each long-term unemployed individual. The per capita figure measures the intensity of funding\u2014resources per intended recipient of services.", "The data in Figure 2 show three aspects of the distributional effects of the dislocated formula:", "The overall intensity of funding declines as the number of targeted individuals increases. The per capita funding for all three formula factors has ranged from $1,703 in PY2002 to $155 in PY2010. This change simply reflects the changes in the targeted populations as unemployment rises and falls. The allocation per capita from the excess unemployed factor has a much larger range in resource intensity than the allocation per capita from the total and long-term unemployed factors. Whereas the funding per excess unemployed person has ranged from $1,351 (PY2002) to $62 (PY2010), the funding for the total and long-term unemployed factors has ranged from $312 to $64 and from $67 to $30, respectively. Even removing PY2002 from the analysis, the ratio of highest per capita funding to lowest per capita funding (e.g., $681 in PY2008 divided by $62 in PY2010) is far higher for excess unemployed (11) than for total unemployed (1.9) or long-term unemployed (3.4). The annual changes in funding intensity are almost entirely generated by one factor\u2014excess unemployed. For example, from PY2008 to PY2009, which was a period of rapidly rising unemployment, the total per capita allocation in the overall dislocated worker formula dropped from $909 to $348, or a total of $562. Of this total, $500 was due to the drop in per capita funding for excess unemployed individuals. This is primarily due to the threshold effect of the excess unemployed factor.

The current formula leads to highly volatile, and in many cases countercyclical, state annual allocations. The volatility alone may make it difficult to plan and operate programs and services. In addition, an increase in a factor value (e.g., an increase in the number of excess unemployed) is often accompanied by a decrease in funding for that factor. The current formula results in significant variation in the intensity of funding, or the allocation per capita (per capita in the target population). Large annual fluctuations in the allocation per capita (see Figure 2 ) means significant inequity across years in the resources available per targeted population. The excess unemployed factor in the formula generates much of the volatility in the formula. The construction of this factor, which uses a threshold over which states are either on or off of the allocation, exacerbates any natural trends that shift funding among states from year to year.", "Given that the dislocated worker formula is likely to receive attention in upcoming WIA reauthorization deliberations, this section of the report considers alternative formula factors and features, which may have the potential of enhancing alignment and reducing volatility.

Based on the review of the dislocated worker formula above, however, the existing factors are a closer measure of the unemployed population than the population of dislocated workers. This mismatch between the formula factors and the underlying population is important because the WIA state formula grant program makes a distinction between unemployed populations by having two separate funding streams for adults\u2014the adult allocation and the dislocated worker allocation. The adult allocation is based on three factors, two of which\u2014unemployment in areas of substantial unemployment and excess unemployment\u2014are variations of the same core measure used in the dislocated worker formula: total unemployed.

Volatility may be expressed by measuring changes from allocation period to allocation period for a single state or changes in the distribution among states for a single period. In discussions of allocation formulas, the term volatility is typically used to describe the annual changes in a state's funding. There will always be some volatility in annual formula grant allocations, as the intent of many allocation formulas, particularly the dislocated worker formula, is to direct funding to states and localities in which there are the greatest needs at a given point in time. As discussed previously, however, the factors in the dislocated worker formula have generated fairly volatile shifts in year-to-year allocations. It has also been suggested that fluctuations in funding shift in a manner that is not necessarily well aligned with shifts in economic conditions. In addition, the use of the \"threshold\" formula feature for the excess unemployment factor drives much of the volatility in the dislocated worker allocations and creates \"unnecessary\" (i.e., above the level of natural fluctuations in the underlying data) volatility.", "Volatility is an issue of concern if the allocations do not match the conditions in the location to which funds are distributed. Additionally, high levels of volatility can make it extremely difficult for state and substate entities to budget, plan, and operate programs. In practical terms, it is very difficult to deal with large swings in annual funding levels from a major funding source, particularly large swings in per capita funding. As discussed previously, it is the threshold feature (i.e., 4.5% unemployment) of the excess unemployed factor that generates most of the sizeable swings in per capita funding (see Figure 2 ). Therefore, this section covers the volatility of alternative formula factors without mechanisms such as a threshold. The addition of any formula features that create a \"cliff\" or \"on-off\" effect would be expected to exacerbate any underlying volatility in the data itself.", "In general, broader measures of labor market activity (e.g., the size of the civilian labor force tends to be relatively stable and predictable because the demographic characteristics of the population tend to change slowly and be predictable) are relatively stable from year to year, while more targeted measures (e.g., mass layoffs) are more episodic in nature and thus vary a great deal from year to year. Factors that use features, such as a threshold, may exacerbate the inherent volatility of a given measure. This section of the report examines whether alternative formula factors may have the potential of reducing volatility.", "One way to measure the contribution of each factor to overall volatility is to compare each state's relative share of each factor over time. A presentation of each state's relative share of each factor for each year would require 4,212 cells of data (9 factors x 52 entities x 9 program years), which would make volatility comparison difficult. Instead, there is a useful summary statistic\u2014the coefficient of variation\u2014to compare the volatility of alternative formula factors for the dislocated worker formula.", "The coefficient of variation, which is the result of dividing the standard deviation (i.e., the typical variation from the average) by the mean, provides a way to compare the dispersion or variation of factor values with widely varying means.", "In this approach, the resulting coefficient for each state is a summary of volatility for all years for each factor. A higher coefficient of variation indicates more average dispersion in that state. More importantly, the range of coefficients of variation across states indicates how much volatility is going to be associated with the particular factor. In the case of the excess unemployment factor, for example, coefficient values range from zero to three. On the other hand, coefficient values for the civilian labor force factor range from 0.005 to 0.05. Because state relative share determines state allocations, factors with a wider range of values (e.g., excess unemployment) will yield much greater funding shifts (i.e., changes in relative share) than factors with a smaller range of values (e.g., civilian labor force).", "There are at least three broad conclusions that may be drawn from the analysis of volatility in this section (The full results of the analysis are in Appendix B ).", "First, the current excess unemployment factor is by far the most volatile of any of the current dislocated worker formula factors. Of all nine factors, three\u2014\"excess unemployment,\" \"mass layoffs,\" and \"extended mass layoffs\"\u2014show the greatest volatility. In terms of individual states, for the average of the PY2002 through PY2010 period, in 44 of the 52 states, the coefficient of variation for the excess unemployment factor is the highest of all factor coefficients. Second, the underlying data for measuring unemployment broadly are not nearly as volatile as the constructed factor of excess unemployment. The threshold feature of the excess unemployment factor generates considerable variation, even on par with the episodic measures, mass and extended mass layoffs. For example, the smallest coefficient of variation for excess unemployment (California) is above the highest coefficient for regular unemployment (Nevada). Another way of stating this is that only the mass layoffs and extended mass layoffs tend to have the highest levels of \"naturally\" occurring volatility, which is intuitive given that they are generated from episodic, irregular events. But even the minimum coefficient of variation values for mass layoffs and extended mass layoffs are well below the minimum value for excess unemployment.

Hold harmless amounts are only guaranteed if funds are sufficient to pay for them. If not, hold harmless amounts are ratably reduced to meet the level of the appropriation. In the current WIA state formula grants, the Adult and Youth formulas contain a 90% hold harmless and a 130% stop gain provision. Provisions to limit decreases and cap increases provide some measure of stability in state funding but may also weaken the linkage between changes in the state factors and the funding received by that state (i.e., creating an artificial floor or ceiling may make the formula less responsive than it would otherwise be to changes in the values of formula factors).", "Such features could be employed in a number of ways in the dislocated worker formula to mitigate against large swings in year-to-year funding.

Finally, the use of hold harmless and stop gain provisions would also allow for different degrees of volatility. For example, a tighter range (e.g., 90% to 110%) would keep allocations relatively stable from year-to-year but would not be as responsive to changes in formula factor values as a formula that allowed greater volatility but guaranteed some minimum allocation from year to year (e.g., 70% to 130%)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small State Minimum", "paragraphs": ["In addition to hold harmless amounts, which are always expressed in terms of a percentage of a previous year grant (or relative share of a grant), some allocation formulas contain a state minimum grant expressed primarily in terms of a percentage of all allocations to states or as a fixed dollar amount per state.

While some volatility is desirable in a formula (to direct allocations to areas with changes in the dislocated worker population), there is often a disconnect between economic conditions and allocations. The scale of the volatility (swings in excess of 30% or more from year to year) threatens the consistency of program operations.", "Third, beyond factor-driven volatility, however, the practice of appropriating level amounts of funding for the dislocated worker program irrespective of changes in unemployment and job dislocations also contributes to large swings in state allocations. In the PY2001 through PY2010 period, appropriations for allocation to states through the WIA dislocated worker program have averaged $1.19 billion per year, with a range from $1.15 billion to $1.27 billion. Thus, given a largely constant level of funding, as economic conditions and the number of dislocated workers increases or decreases, the WIA dislocated worker program allocates the same total amount of funding in different ways. The flat funding creates a zero-sum allocation, such that one state's gain in funding must result in another state's loss of funding, even if economic conditions point in the same direction for most or all states.", "Fourth, there are several alternative factors available to measure the dislocated worker population.
