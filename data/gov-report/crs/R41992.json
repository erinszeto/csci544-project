Reduced timber harvests, increased wildfire risks, degraded forest health, and disagreements among users and other stakeholders have led to congressional disputes over appropriate management. Some interests have suggested third-party certification of sustainable management of the national forests as a possible solution to many of these difficulties. There are two major certification programs in the United States: the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) program.", "The FSC and SFI programs are very similar in many regards. Both programs use a multi-stakeholder approach that balances environmental, social, and economic interests to negotiate broadly acceptable standards of sustainable forest management. Both programs use independent, accredited third parties to verify compliance with the standards. Both programs have stakeholder involvement and public transparency requirements. Within the standards, both programs have similar coverage in terms of requirements for harvest operations, wildlife and habitat management, water and soil protection, and decision-making and management planning.", "Despite these similarities, the SFI and FSC programs do have some distinct differences. The programs each emphasize different sustainability objectives: the SFI program emphasizes sustainable timber harvesting, and places forest management as a tool to achieve that objective; the FSC program emphasizes sustainable forest management, and places timber harvests as one tool to achieve that objective. The SFI standard is generally more flexible, while the FSC standard is generally more prescriptive with more on-the-ground performance requirements.", "How certification would affect the management of the national forests is uncertain. However, certification could evaluate the extent to which the forest management plans align with the standards of each certification program, and then evaluate the extent to which those forest plans are being implemented. A third-party evaluation of the forest plans, and their implementation, could potentially alleviate\u2014or escalate\u2014stakeholder and congressional disputes over the appropriate management of the national forests.", "It is unclear whether the Forest Service has the existing authority to certify the national forests. If Congress chooses to require certification of the national forests, there are other questions to consider, including which certification program(s) to require; what (if any) forest management process requirements (e.g., public involvement standards) might be relaxed; and what would be the impact on timber purchasers of processing certified sustainable wood.

At the federal level, the Forest Service\u2014an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014is the principal forest management agency, charged with managing 193 million acres designated mostly as national forests. The Forest Service manages the forest resources under a multiple use-sustained yield mandate, meaning that the agency must balance uses such as providing recreation opportunities, timber supplies, livestock grazing, watershed protection, and fish and wildlife habitats, in a manner that does not impair the productivity of the land for future resource yields. ", "The national forests have been the focus of controversy for many years. Reduced timber harvests, increased wildfire risks, degraded forest health, and disagreements among users and other stakeholders have led to congressional disputes over appropriate management. Some interests have suggested third-party certification of sustainable management of the national forests as a possible solution to many of these difficulties. ", "Sustainable forest certification programs were created in the 1990s as a nongovernmental approach to promote sustainable forest management practices. Sustainable forest management generally requires that the stewardship and use of the forests balance current and future demand for the resources with maintaining ecological, economic, and social functionality. Forest landowners may voluntarily participate in these programs with the goal of gaining a market advantage through independent third-party assessments and product labels to communicate compliance with standards of sustainable management. The standards are developed by different multi-stakeholder groups with little or no government participation. Although initially directed at private forest owners, certification programs have evolved and developed mechanisms to certify public forests. ", "In 1997, the USDA Forest Service declared it would not pursue certification of any of the national forests. However, the certification of several state, Department of Energy (DOE), and Department of Defense (DOD) forests has raised new questions about this policy. In 2005, the Forest Service sponsored a study evaluating the potential certification of the national forests, but the agency has not issued any changes to its certification policy since the study was released in 2007. ", "If Congress determines that the national forests should be subject to certification, Congress could direct the Forest Service to pursue certification for some or all of the 105 national forest administrative units. Certifying the national forests as sustainably managed may have many potential benefits. Certification might demonstrate and emphasize that the management of the national forests is held to high ecological, economic, and social standards. Certification might reduce existing conflicts over management decisions for the national forests, and has the potential to streamline the management process. For example, certification programs have requirements for planning, management, and public involvement programs as well as for measurable performances on the ground. While these requirements currently exist in policy, regulations, or statutes, Congress may consider that certification would be sufficient and could replace the existing structure. In addition, certification of the national forests may provide benefits to the private sector. The timber and wood products industries as well as the \"green\" products industries may benefit from having access to a greater supply of certified materials. Finally, certifying the sustainability of the national forests may complement other sustainability policy directives, such as federal green purchasing and green building policies. ", "However, certifying the national forests may present some costs, risks, and uncertainties. The certification process would require direct and indirect investments. Direct costs include the initial fee to pay for the audit process, and then whatever annual or semi-annual costs are required to maintain certification. Indirect costs include changes that may be required to earn or maintain certification, such as implementing new monitoring and reporting systems or adjusting harvest levels. These costs may or may not be recovered in improved management, or even in higher stumpage prices for the certified products leaving the national forests. While certification was initially seen as a means to gain market advantages, those expectations have rarely been realized in the domestic U.S. market. In addition, the certification process and maintenance requirements could have the unintended, opposite effect of becoming another layer of administrative complexity for the Forest Service to navigate.

Amid increasing concern among environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders about the deforestation occurring in developing tropical countries, the international community met to discuss a legally binding global forest policy. However, developing countries were opposed to any legally binding agreement, based mostly on trade concerns. Instead, the process led to the Statement of Forest Principles, a nonbinding set of general economic, environmental, and development guidelines that was largely considered a disappointment in terms of setting a global forest policy.", "In 1995 the Montreal Process convened as an international effort to define measures of sustainable forest management. Participating nations\u2014including the United States\u2014developed national policy-level criteria and indicators as measures of the principles of sustainable forest management. The criteria and indicators included the conservation of biological diversity; maintaining forest and ecosystem productivity; conserving soil and water resources; maintaining global carbon cycles; maintaining long-term socioeconomic benefits; and a legal and institutional framework for sustainable forest management. The Montreal Process, along with the Forest Principles, formed a framework of economic, environmental, and social definition and measure of sustainable forest management that was carried forward by the forest certification programs.

In 1993, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification standard was developed by the World Wildlife Fund and other NGOs. As a voluntary certification and labeling system, the FSC standard was intended to leverage the growing consumer demand for sustainable wood products and use market incentives to promote sustainable forest operations. The FSC is registered as a nonprofit organization headquartered in Oaxaca, Mexico. Although the initial impetus for the development of the program was to protect tropical forests, FSC is a global standard that also applies to temperate and boreal forests. As such, the FSC principles of sustainable forest management apply globally, but regional, national, and even subnational standards may be created to adapt to local conditions. In 1995, the U.S. chapter of the FSC was formed in Minneapolis and is responsible for developing and publishing the U.S. standard applicable to the lower 48 states. The FSC-US is further divided into nine regions, with regionally specific guidance built into the standard.

The initial SFI program was developed entirely by wood products industry representatives, with no external stakeholder participation. Participation became mandatory for AF&PA members, but firms could self-select which criteria to measure and could self-report compliance. Market pressures have forced the SFI standard to undergo significant substantive and structural changes to compete with the FSC standard. The SFI standard now requires third-party audits, is independent from the AF&PA, and is a registered nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, DC.", "As of April 2011, the SFI had certified 58 million acres private and public forest land in the United States as sustainably managed ( Figure 2 ).

Smaller programs, such as the American Tree Farm System, also operate in the United States. However, the SFI and FSC programs are the two major certification programs that would apply to the national forests. ", "The PEFC program is a global umbrella organization for different national certification programs, providing a common label to facilitate trade in a global market. The PEFC is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Originating in Europe, the PEFC was first initiated by landowner groups, and now also includes industry interest groups. The PEFC endorses national programs using a third-party verification process based on internationally developed sustainability benchmarks. In 2005, the PEFC endorsed the SFI standard, and the SFI Board of Directors serves as the governing body for the U.S. chapter of the PEFC. As of July 2011, the PEFC had 35 national members, and had certified the sustainable management of 576 million acres ( Figure 1 ) through the endorsement of 30 national certification programs. Since the PEFC program works by endorsing other national certification programs, the PEFC program would not apply directly to the national forests. ", "The other national system operating in North America is the Canadian Standards Association Sustainable Forest Management System (CSA-SFM). Developed in 1996 at the request of the Canadian forest products industry association, the CSA-SFM is Canada's official national standard for sustainable forest management and is endorsed by the PEFC. As of September 2010, the CSA-SFM had certified over 160 million acres in Canada. The CSA-SFM does not apply to forests in the United States.

Founded in 1941, the ATFS is the oldest certification system and is a program of the American Forest Foundation, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C. Landowners with at least 10 acres of managed forest land are eligible to participate in the program. Requiring third-party verification, the ATFS is endorsed by the PEFC and accepted by the SFI chain-of-custody requirements.

Forest operations are evaluated by independent auditors for conformance against negotiated standards of sustainability. The result is an eco-label on forest products leaving the certified forest, which communicates to consumers a responsibly and sustainably produced product. Firms along the entire supply chain must certify their operations to continue to sell the products with the eco-label (this is referred to as chain-of-custody certification). ", "Demand by wood suppliers has driven the market for certified products more than demand by consumers. For example, in the late 1990s, environmental groups concerned with rapid tropical deforestation began boycotting the Home Depot, one of the largest suppliers of wood products. In response, the Home Depot began carrying FSC-certified wood. Other retailers followed suit, creating a demand for certified wood products. Landowners began certifying their forests and providing certified products to respond to the growing demand. A similar situation occurred for pulp and paper products when Time, Inc., committed to using certified paper sources. The result is that the market for certified products has grown exponentially in under two decades of existence, with nearly a quarter of the world's industrial wood production coming from certified sources. ", "Supplier demand in the market also drives competition between the certification programs. After the boycotts, the Home Depot initially accepted only FSC-certified wood products, despite pressure from the SFI program and the AF&PA. Environmental groups\u2014who had very successfully boycotted the Home Depot\u2014preferred the FSC program and questioned the validity and rigor of the self-reporting and voluntary SFI program. The Home Depot commissioned a consultant to conduct an independent comparison with participation from both the SFI and FSC programs. The report highlighted a stronger emphasis on ecological protections in the FSC program, and a stronger emphasis on industry concerns and a more lenient verification procedure in the SFI program. Largely in response, the SFI program went through several revisions to become more competitive and comparable to the FSC program, including requiring third-party audits and separating from the AF&PA organization. Competition has also affected the FSC program: it has revised its standard, strengthened its accreditation processes, and created programs for smaller landowners in response to the SFI and PEFC programs.", "Market forces continue to influence the development and evolution of the certification programs. Since home building is the largest use of wood products, building codes are critical in determining wood use. This is especially true in the specialized green building market. The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) implements the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program and only awards credit for FSC-certified wood products. The SFI has continued to revise its standards to become more comparable to the FSC standard, gain LEED credit, and subsequently gain greater access to the green construction market. In 2010 there was an unsuccessful movement to add other certification programs\u2014including the SFI standard\u2014to the LEED program. Although the initial reasoning for only allowing FSC certification is unclear, the USGBC membership voted against changing the requirement.

", "Potential market advantages from certification include price premiums, greater access to niche markets, product differentiation, and customer loyalty. For U.S. forests, the expectations for market benefits appear to be mostly unrealized. The consumer demand for certified products is limited and price premiums have been minor, and have not always offset the costs of certification. Highly specialized markets, however, have realized some market advantages. Certified wood from tropical countries typically demands higher price points, as do luxury home building products (at least prior to the 2008 real estate crash). Instead of just a market advantage, certification actually may be becoming a market access requirement. ", "Despite disappointing market performances, forest landowners certified in the United States appear generally satisfied with their decision to certify. This may be because of the accountability mechanisms inherent in certification programs. Certification signals responsible management and behavior. In that sense, certification can be a defensive tool used to avoid any negative publicity similar to the Home Depot boycotts in the 1990s.

Certification evaluates the extent to which forest management is meeting the objectives laid forth in a forest management plan, and then evaluates the extent to which the plan is meeting the standards of sustainable forest management. ", "On a broad scale, both the FSC and the SFI operate within similar frameworks with similar governance structures, procedures to develop the standards, and accreditation and auditing requirements. System governance and the development of the sustainability standards are balanced among the competing groups interested in sustainable forest management. This forces the environmental, social, and economic/industry groups to work together and negotiate standards that are broadly acceptable measures of sustainability. The certification audit is done by an accredited, independent third party that evaluates the management plan and the on-the-ground activities, and includes conversations with staff as well as with stakeholders. The audit process may find minor or major non-conformances with the standard, which must be remedied prior to or immediately following certification. Upon certification, there are maintenance and re-certification requirements. Each system includes monitoring, consistency, and enforcement provisions. ", "Once a forest is certified, products leaving the forest may use the system's label. However, a separate, chain-of-custody certification is required in order to use the certification label along the supply chain. The chain-of-custody standard is designed to ensure that certified wood is accounted for as it leaves the forest, and typically includes sourcing, production controls, record-keeping, and documentation requirements. Each producer or vendor along the supply chain must be certified in order to use the label. Both the SFI and FSC programs use a chain-of-custody certification process that is adapted from the landowner certification process described above.", "Despite their broad similarities within this general framework, the FSC and the SFI each have their own unique attributes at a detailed, specific level.

The FSC standard is more prescriptive while the SFI standard allows more flexibility. Each program has different strengths and weaknesses that relate to their different ideas about sustainability. The SFI program emphasizes sustainable timber harvesting, and places forest management as a tool to achieve that objective. The FSC program emphasizes sustainable forest management, and places timber harvests as one tool to achieve that objective.

System targets are focused on developing a process to achieve the desired outcome, such as developing a program to minimize ecological damage. One useful way to understand the difference is that performance-based targets are generally evaluated in the field, while systems-based targets are generally evaluated in an office.

The FSC standard is described in 75 pages, with references to several other policy documents. In comparison, the SFI standard is described in 14 pages. However, this level of detail may be a result of the global focus of the FSC program, as it also applies to countries that may not have comparable environmental and social regulations as the United States.

Sustainable harvest operations also have implications for biodiversity, depending on how the forest is regenerated. Regeneration may be done naturally by allowing the remaining trees to serve as seed sources, or regeneration may be done manually by planting saplings of the desired species. Both require carefully planned and executed pre- and post-harvest activities such as site preparation and rehabilitation. Road-building activities should generally minimize habitat fragmentation and erosion and sedimentation concerns. Active forest management should emphasize restoring natural disturbance regimes, including wind, fire, and pest occurrences.

Both programs emphasize healthy, functioning ecosystems and allow for site-specific fuel management strategies to restore natural disturbance regimes.

Both programs encourage stand biodiversity and the utilization of woody biomass, and discourage excessive harvest waste.", "Despite these similarities, there are some differences between the forest management provisions in the FSC and SFI programs. While they both call for the calculation of a sustainable harvest level, the FSC requires a specific calculation method and requires harvest levels to remain below the projected growth level. The SFI does not define sustainable harvest levels or specify a calculation method. The FSC program has regionally specific guidance regarding the size of clearcut harvests while the SFI program has one size limit that applies nationally. The SFI program calls for specific reforestation time frames depending on the site regeneration method; the FSC does not have any specific reforestation time frames.

The FSC program has more prescriptive requirements for grazing, mineral development, and carbon storage. For grazing and mineral development, the FSC calls for those uses to minimize ecological damage. However, the FSC's focus on land tenure and user rights tends to discourage landowner infringement on use rights associated with mineral development and grazing leases.

While public involvement and transparency are important considerations for the management of the national forests as a public resource, it is also an important consideration for certification programs as market mechanisms.
