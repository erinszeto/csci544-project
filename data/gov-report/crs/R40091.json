Congress continues to consider the Supreme Court's January 21, 2010, ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. The decision has shaped much of the legislative debate on campaign finance issues during the second session of the 111th Congress. Thus far, most congressional attention responding to the ruling has focused on the DISCLOSE Act (H.R. 5175; S. 3295; S. 3628). H.R. 5175 passed the House on June 29, 2010. On a related note, on July 29, 2010, the Committee on Financial Services ordered reported H.R. 4790. The bill would require additional disclosure of political expenditures to corporate shareholders and is designed as a partial response to Citizens United.", "Other than attention to Citizens United, four aspects of campaign finance policy have been subject to major actions thus far during the 111th Congress. First, in April 2009, the House passed legislation (H.R. 749) concerning authority to disburse campaign funds after a candidate's death. Second, on June 10, 2009, the Committee on House Administration favorably reported H.R. 512 (Davis, CA). The bill would amend the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) to restrict certain state election officials from involvement in others' campaigns. Third, on July 28, 2009, the Committee on House Administration held a hearing on H.R. 1826, a bill that would publicly finance House campaigns. The committee ordered reported a successor bill, H.R. 6116, on September 23, 2010. Finally, the Senate considered the nomination of John J. Sullivan to be a member of the Federal Election Commission for much of the 111th Congress. However, the President withdrew the nomination on August 5, 2010.", "Questions about the health of the presidential public financing system were especially prominent during the 2008 election cycle. Two bills to revamp the presidential public financing system were introduced in late July 2010. Neither H.R. 6061 nor S. 3681 have been the subject of additional action. Also in the 111th Congress, Representative Cole has introduced legislation (H.R. 2992) to repeal public financing for presidential nominating conventions. Legislation on public financing of congressional campaigns was introduced in early 2009 (H.R. 158, H.R. 1826, H.R. 2056, S. 751, and S. 752). H.R. 6116, apparently intended to supersede H.R. 1826, was introduced in September 2010 and, as noted above, was ordered reported.", "Recent election cycles also witnessed new or expanded techniques for raising and spending money, such as bundling, joint fundraising committees, and hybrid advertising. Remaining issues from the 110th Congress, such as electronic filing of Senate campaign finance reports (S. 482 and S. 1858 in the 111th Congress), may also receive renewed scrutiny. Other issues, such as 527 organizations, may also be addressed. Congressional oversight of the FEC could also be on the legislative agenda.", "Some of the issues discussed in this report have only recently received substantial attention. Others have long been controversial. All appear likely to remain prominent policy issues. Whether Congress decides to pursue these or other campaign finance issues, common questions about the role of money in politics, transparency, and the need for additional regulation are likely to shape the debate.", "The text of this report was last updated November 3, 2010.

Additional discussion of various policy and legal issues appears in other CRS products.", "In essence, however, the opinion invalidated aspects of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's (BCRA) electioneering communication provision, which had prohibited corporations and unions from using their treasury funds to air broadcast ads referring to clearly identified federal candidates within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary election or caucus. Perhaps more notably, the decision also overturned the Supreme Court's 1990 ruling in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce , which had upheld restrictions on corporate-funded independent expenditures. ( Citizens United appears not to affect the ban on corporate or union contributions to political candidates.) As a consequence of Citizens United , corporations\u2014and presumably unions\u2014now appear to be free to use their treasury funds to air political advertisements explicitly calling for election or defeat of federal (or state) candidates. Previously, such advertising would generally have had to be financed through voluntary contributions raised by political action committees (PACs) affiliated with unions or corporations. ", "Unlimited, albeit independent, expenditures by corporations and unions has spurred legislative action in Congress, although no post- Citizens United measures have become law. Possible policy responses for those favoring additional regulation include enacting public campaign financing legislation, altering contribution limits, pursuing shareholder protection initiatives, easing restrictions on coordinated party expenditures, or amending the Constitution, among others. By contrast, those who believe that Citizens United correctly strengthens corporate speech rights may prefer the status quo, in which case no legislative action may be necessary. ", "Thus far, most congressional attention responding to the ruling has focused on the DISCLOSE Act ( H.R. 5175 ; S. 3295 ; S. 3628 ). The House of Representatives passed H.R. 5175 , with amendments, on June 24, 2010, by a 219-206 vote.

Treasurers\u2014not candidates\u2014are legally responsible for disbursing campaign funds. In fact, FECA does not specify a role for candidates in campaign financial decisions. As a practical matter, however, candidates may exert substantial informal influence over campaign spending. ", "In recent Congresses, some Members have expressed concern about how campaign funds would be spent in the event a candidate died. On March 25, 2009, the House Committee on Administration reported H.R. 749 (Jones, NC) by voice vote and without amendment. The bill would permit candidates to designate to the FEC an individual to direct campaign spending following the candidate's death. That designation would supersede the treasurer's normal spending responsibilities, but would not affect the treasurer's reporting or other responsibilities. A backup could also be identified if the designee died, became incapacitated, or were unable or unwilling to carry out his or her responsibilities. The bill also permits candidates to specify their wishes about how funds would be disbursed. On April 22, 2009, H.R. 749 passed the House by voice vote and under suspension of the rules. The measure was subject to only brief debate and received bipartisan support. H.R. 749 is virtually identical to H.R. 3032 , also sponsored by Representative Jones, and which the House passed on July 15, 2008, under suspension of the rules and by voice vote.

That outcome, however, depends on designees adhering to candidate wishes, and assumes that designees would be more faithful to candidate wishes than would be treasurers. ", "H.R. 749 could create different levels of candidate authority over spending in life than in death. Specifically, although H.R. 749 would provide a mechanism for circumventing the treasurer after a candidate dies, the bill would not provide additional remedies for such action while the candidate is living. This may be a minor distinction due to candidates' de facto influence over their campaigns, despite FECA's general silence on the issue. Nonetheless, if Congress chose to enact H.R. 749 and felt it were important to create parity in candidates' abilities to direct campaign spending, it could amend FECA to create a clearer candidate role over campaign funds regardless of whether the candidate is living or dead. Congress might also provide explicit permission in FECA for candidates to hire and fire campaign treasurers. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Bundling", "paragraphs": ["Bundling is a fundraising practice in which an intermediary either receives contributions and passes them on to a campaign or is credited with soliciting contributions that go directly to a campaign. Lobbyists often serve as bundlers. Bundling has been prominent in recent years both because of the additional disclosure required in HLOGA and because of the role bundling played in the 2008 presidential elections.", "Bundling opponents contend the practice allows individuals to circumvent FECA by delivering larger contributions than they could on their own, even though those contributions are funded by multiple sources. Critics also point to anecdotal evidence suggesting that some contributions routed through bundlers might have been coerced or come from impermissible sources. Nonetheless, bundling is not prohibited by FECA or FEC regulations; it is also a common fundraising practice.", "The FEC unanimously approved rules implementing HLOGA's bundling provisions on December 18, 2008. An \"explanation and justification\" (E&J) statement approved in February 2009 provided additional guidance and clarified the commission's decision-making process. HLOGA's major requirement regarding bundling, and the major requirement in the new bundling rules, is that political committees report contributions \"reasonably known\" to be bundled if at least two of those contributions aggregated at least $15,000 ($16,000 as adjusted for inflation in 2010) during specified reporting periods. Only contributions bundled by registered lobbyists must be included in bundling disclosure reports. Committees are to determine whether bundlers are registered lobbyists by consulting the websites of the Clerk of the House, Secretary of the Senate, or FEC (in the case of PACs maintained or controlled by registered lobbyists). The commission noted in the new rules that other sources of knowledge about lobbyists' bundling activities could also trigger reporting requirements. (As discussed in the next section, however, credit plays a more prominent role in bundling disclosure than does knowledge.) ", "Two aspects of the new bundling rules have generated some controversy. The first concerns whether political committees \"credit\" particular lobbyists with raising bundled contributions. Under the new rules, political committees are required to report contributions as being bundled only if the committee has awarded (through external recognition or internal records) credit to a particular lobbyist or lobbyists for having bundled the contributions. As the commission noted in the E&J, a lobbyist merely claiming to have bundled contributions does not necessarily warrant disclosure, nor does committee knowledge of a lobbyist being a bundler if the committee has not credited that person with bundling for the committee. According to the commission, \"[M]ere knowledge [of bundling], in and of itself, is not enough. Rather, it is necessary for a reporting committee to credit through 'records, designations, or other means of recognizing that a certain amount of money has been raised' before reporting is required.\"", "The second area of contention, related to the first, concerns how credit is awarded for jointly hosted fundraising events. Under the new rules, all hosts of joint fundraising events would have to be listed in bundling disclosure reports only if those hosts were registered lobbyists and were credited by the campaign with raising bundled contributions that met the $16,000 threshold. As the FEC stated in the E&J, for example, an event co-hosted by three lobbyists that generated $20,000 would require bundling disclosure attributing the entire amount to only the one lobbyist the committee credited with having been responsible for raising the funds (assuming the committee did not award credit to the other two). In cases in which more than one lobbyist is credited with raising funds, the committee must report the share raised by and credited to each individual. ", "Some groups have criticized both these components of the rules, suggesting that they could permit political committees to avoid disclosing bundling activities simply because they do not award tangible credit for doing so. The joint-fundraiser provisions, they say, also could allow committees to avoid disclosing the roles of some bundlers through manipulation of crediting arrangements. The FEC, however, contends that awarding credit is the \"focus of HLOGA Section 204\" [the bundling provision] and that the rules are consistent with the law's legislative history."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policy Considerations", "paragraphs": ["If Congress chooses to revisit bundling policy, two perspectives could be relevant. The first emphasizes reporting information about bundling. The second emphasizes further regulating bundling practices .", "From the reporting (disclosure) perspective, a key question is whether campaigns should continue to be permitted to provide information only about bundling by registered lobbyists. If so, existing requirements could be sufficient, provided that Congress is satisfied with the reporting criteria established in HLOGA and FEC regulations. Congress may also wish to monitor continued FEC implementation of the HLOGA requirements and the effectiveness of the new reporting process, which took effect during the spring and summer of 2009. If it chose to do so, Congress could also amend Section 204 of HLOGA to require different disclosure than is articulated in the new bundling rules.", "From a broader perspective, Congress may wish to increase transparency about bundling overall, including by non-lobbyists. A relatively straightforward way to do so could be to extend the existing disclosure requirements to cover bundling by anyone, regardless of profession. During the 110 th Congress, S. 2030 (Obama) essentially proposed such an approach; the bill did not advance beyond committee referral.", "If Congress adopted the view that bundling should be discouraged or reduced, additional regulation could be necessary. For example, limits could be applied to the amount or number of contributions arranged by a single bundler. Bundling could also be banned altogether. Depending on specifics, however, a ban could prohibit even basic fundraising involving multiple contributors.", "For those who believe that bundling circumvents FECA, additional restrictions or disclosure requirements could enhance transparency, limit the prevalence of bundling, or both. On the other hand, those restrictions could increase compliance burdens for the regulated community. Finally, those who view bundling as an efficient and effective fundraising practice may object to further regulation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Campaign Travel Aboard Private Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the bundling restrictions discussed above (and other issues), HLOGA restricts campaign travel on private, non-commercial aircraft (e.g., charter jets). Before HLOGA became law, under 2003 FEC regulations political committees were permitted to reimburse those providing private aircraft at the rate of first-class travel as long as commensurate first-class commercial service were available for the route flown. Reimbursement at non-discounted coach or charter rates was required if commensurate first-class service were unavailable on the route. ", "By contrast, under HLOGA, Senators, candidates, and campaign staff may continue to travel on private aircraft only if they reimburse the entity providing the aircraft for the \"pro rata share of the fair market value\" for rental or charter of a comparable aircraft (e.g., the charter rate). The latter rates would typically be well above the old first-class rate that applied to most flights before HLOGA took effect. Unlike their Senate counterparts, House Members, candidates, and campaign staff are \"substantially banned\" from flying aboard private, non-commercial aircraft, as HLOGA precludes reimbursements for such flights.", "Although the FEC adopted rules to implement HLOGA's air-travel provisions in December 2007, a required explanation and justification statement was not adopted before the commission lost its policymaking quorum in January 2008. Consequently, the air-travel rules were never published in the Federal Register and never took effect. Additional nominees were confirmed to the commission in June 2008, bringing the agency back to full policymaking strength. However, the commission did not finalize the HLOGA travel regulations until November 2009. ", "Under the rules adopted by the FEC on December 14, 2007\u2014but never finalized\u2014Senate, presidential, and vice-presidential campaign travel aboard private aircraft was required to be reimbursed at the \"pro-rata share\" of the charter rate. These requirements also would have applied to travel on behalf of PACs (including leadership PACs ) and party committees. In essence, this meant that presidential, vice-presidential, or Senate campaign travel occurring aboard charter aircraft would have had to be paid for based on charter rates. HLOGA essentially banned reimbursement for House campaign travel aboard private aircraft, as was evident in the 2007 rules. ", "On November 19, 2009, the commission revisited the travel rules at an open meeting. During the meeting, commissioners debated congressional intent in the relevant section (601) of HLOGA and potential interpretations of the statute. A motion to approve an explanation and justification (E&J) statement supporting the December 2007 rules failed by a 3-3 deadlocked vote along partisan lines. Immediately afterward, alternative rules and an accompanying E&J were approved by a 4-2 vote in which Chairman Walther (I) joined Republican Commissioners Hunter, McGahn, and Petersen to constitute a majority. Consequently, the new rules and E&J superseded the never-finalized 2007 rules. ", "A detailed discussion of the lengthy and complex new rules is beyond the scope of this report. Essentially, however, the 2009 rules distinguish between restrictions on campaign travel and travel on behalf of PACs or political parties. The rules also require charter-rate reimbursement in some circumstances but permit reimbursement at coach, first-class, or charter rates (depending on the route flown) in others. Specifically, the new rules require that candidate -oriented travel for presidential, vice-presidential, and Senate travel be reimbursed at the charter rate. By contrast, travel on behalf of party committees or leadership PACs may be reimbursed based on the 2003 regulations (often the first-class rate). House campaign travel\u2014including for House-oriented leadership PACs\u2014aboard private aircraft remains, essentially, prohibited, although travel on behalf of House party committees could be reimbursed at the 2003 rates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policy Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Controversy has emerged over the degree to which the November 2009 rules reflect congressional intent as enacted in HLOGA. Some opponents of the new rules suggest that Congress clearly intended for charter-rate reimbursement to apply to all campaign-related travel, even if parties or PACs pay for the flights. They also argue that the rules could provide cover to avoid the more expensive charter-rate reimbursement simply by classifying travel as on behalf of PACs or parties rather than individual Senate campaigns. Defenders of the new rules, however, suggest that Congress required charter-rate reimbursement only for presidential, vice-presidential, or Senate candidate travel and that it would be improper for the FEC to require PACs or parties to reimburse at the charter rate (unless no commercial service were available). ", "If Congress objects to the new rules, as at least one Senator has, oversight or legislation could be employed. For example, the charter rate could be applied to all campaign travel regardless of whether the travelers are doing so for candidates, parties, or PACs. In addition, Congress could clarify that restrictions on reimbursement by House leadership PACs are also intended to apply to Senate leadership PACs. Congress could also essentially ban Senate campaign travel aboard private aircraft, as is already the case for House campaign travel. As an alternative (or addition) to legislation, Congress could choose to monitor implementation of the new rules to determine whether travel reported as PAC and party travel actually primarily benefits those entities, or whether it appears to subsidize Senate campaigns. Finally, as is often the case with FEC rulemakings, Congress or others could pursue litigation to revisit the rules. By contrast, however, those who believe that the new rules accurately reflect congressional intent or are otherwise acceptable would likely prefer the status quo, in which case little or no congressional action is necessary."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Electronic Filing of Senate Campaign Finance Reports", "paragraphs": ["Unlike all other federal political committees (except those raising or spending less than $50,000 annually), Senate campaign committees, party committees, and PACs are not required to file campaign finance reports electronically. Senate reports are also unique because they are filed with the Secretary of the Senate rather than directly with the FEC. In the 110 th Congress, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration reported S. 223 (Feingold), which would have extended electronic filing to Senate reports. The bill was never considered on the Senate floor, despite attempts to bring it up under unanimous consent. Despite the lack of success in the 110 th Congress, electronic filing remains a widely popular policy proposal. In the 111 th Congress, Senator Feingold has introduced S. 482 . That bill is substantially similar to S. 223 from the 110 th Congress. Senator Feingold has also introduced S. 1858 , which would amend FECA to both require electronic filing and reporting directly to the FEC. The Senate versions of the DISCLOSE Act ( S. 3295 and S. 3628 ) also contain electronic filing provisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policy Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Two major policy questions surround electronic filling. Both are straightforward. First, should Senate campaign finance reports be filed electronically? Second, if so, where should those reports be filed?", "The primary arguments in favor of electronic filing concern efficiency and expense. Currently, a contractor converts the paper reports filed with the Secretary into electronic format. The FEC then makes the reports publicly available on the Internet. The conversion process can take weeks or months at a reported cost of $250,000 annually. As a result, House campaign finance data filed electronically (and directly with the FEC) are routinely available well before Senate data. Various Members of Congress, campaign finance groups, and media organizations have supported electronic filing. Both the FEC and the Secretary of the Senate have stated publicly that their offices are, or can be, prepared to administer electronic filing.", "Electronic filing could eliminate the conversion process and make public disclosure of the data much faster. Electronic filing could, therefore, improve transparency and reduce costs. Requiring electronic filing of Senate reports would also place the same filing responsibilities on Senate committees that currently exist for House candidate committees, party committees, and PACs. As a result, uniform filing standards would apply to all political committees.", "There is little, if any, notable opposition to electronic filing itself. However, some Members have called for addressing other campaign finance disclosure issues alongside electronic filing. For example, attempts in the 110 th Congress to bring up S. 223 were unsuccessful amid a dispute over whether the bill would be amended to require groups filing ethics complaints to disclose their donors. Similarly, at a March 2007 Senate Rules and Administration Committee hearing on S. 223 , Senator Stevens emphasized the need to also consider disclosure requirements for 527 organizations.", "Filing location has been a secondary issue of debate. Senate reports are currently filed with the Secretary of the Senate rather than with the FEC. Bypassing filing with the Secretary of the Senate could make reports more readily accessible to the public and could reduce delay or costs associated with transmitting the reports to the FEC. If campaign finance reports are considered Senate documents, however, some may object to their being filed with the FEC.

Some Members of Congress have also expressed concern about deadlocked votes at the commission (which can, but do not necessarily, affect enforcement issues). In January 2009, the FEC held two days of hearings on various operations issues. At these wide-ranging sessions, a variety of election lawyers and interest-group representatives both praised and criticized the FEC's procedures and transparency.

Additional restrictions, including legislation, could also minimize parties' flexibility to allocate costs according to individual circumstances. That flexibility was a central concern for various party representatives who testified at a July 2007 FEC hearing.

Congressional public financing legislation has only passed both chambers and been reconciled in conference once, during the 102 nd Congress (1991-1992). President George H.W. Bush vetoed the legislation ( S. 3 ), which would have provided additional funds to those facing certain high-spending opponents, in addition to matching funds and broadcast and postal benefits in certain cases.

Second, H.R. 2056 (Tierney) proposes a \"clean money, clean elections\" model, in which participants would receive a combination of grants and matching funds in exchange for limiting campaign spending. Three other bills, H.R. 6116 (Larson), H.R. 1826 (Larson), and S. 752 (Durbin), propose voluntary public financing that provides a base subsidy, matching funds, and, except for H.R. 6116 , broadcast vouches.

Some public financing opponents believe that government-funded campaign subsides amount to \"welfare for politicians.\" The spending limits that also often accompany public financing proposals also raise constitutional concerns for those who criticize public financing proposals. ", "In addition to those perennial issues, one of the most significant questions surrounding public financing proposals is how to design a program that provides enough benefits to allow participants to mount robust campaigns. The level of benefits and spending limits offered in exchange for participation in public financing is particularly important.

These \"small dollar\" contributions would also be eligible for federal matching funds.

An infusion of funds, through an increased checkoff designation, other revenue sources, increased taxpayer participation, or a combination of all three, would likely be necessary. Public financing can also be controversial along ideological lines, which suggests that strong political will and coalition-building will be necessary if changes to the program are to be enacted.", "In the aftermath of the 2008 election cycle, the related issue of small contributions has also been a prominent topic of debate. Although publicly financed general-election candidates must agree to forgo private fundraising for their campaigns, public financing is designed to supplement small, private contributions during the primary campaign.

In addition, the maximum matching contribution would have been lowered to $200 from the current $250.", "Increasing the match rate from the current 100% to 400% or 500% could increase the effect of small contributions. It could also provide substantially greater resources to publicly financed candidates. However, this approach assumes that sufficient funds would be available in the PECF to cover the additional match. In fact, sufficient funds have been unavailable during portions of recent election cycles. Nonetheless, proposals to reform the public financing program typically include revisions to funding mechanisms.", "Congress could also renew the focus on small contributions by permitting publicly financed campaigns to spend larger (or unlimited) amounts of funds raised through small contributions. This approach might or might not include matching funds. The effect could be to encourage candidates to focus their efforts on small contributions, while still providing government assistance for some campaign needs.", "However, focusing on small contributions would not necessarily contain campaign costs (another program goal), particularly for those candidates who were able to raise and spend virtually unlimited amounts. In fact, if spending limits were eliminated, public financing could become an additional, but potentially unnecessary, funding source for those already able to raise substantial private funds.", "Finally, public financing could be repealed. This approach would largely or entirely (depending on specifics) eliminate taxpayer funds in presidential campaigns. In the 110 th Congress, two bills ( H.R. 72 (Bartlett), H.R. 484 (Doolittle)) would have repealed parts of the program or the entire program. Neither bill advanced beyond committee referral.
