Among these principles may be listed the following: (1) House procedure is governed by multiple authorities, not by chamber rules alone; (2) the House has a constitutional power to make its own rules of procedure; (3) House rules are generally not self-enforcing; (4) the House rarely disregards its precedents; and (5) the House adheres to many practices that have developed without being formally adopted. Each of these principles is discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "House Procedures Are Determined by Multiple Authorities", "paragraphs": ["Although the rules of the House may be the most obvious authority governing House parliamentary procedure, they are, as the introductory discussion has already shown, by no means the only one. The authorities by which the proceedings of the House are regulated are not mutually exclusive; rather, any concrete procedural situation is affected by the interaction among them. As a result, the course taken by any proceedings in the chamber will depend on all the different parliamentary authorities that may be pertinent to the specific circumstances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Rule-Making Authority of the House", "paragraphs": ["Article I of the Constitution gives the House the authority to determine its rules of procedure. This constitutional rule-making authority affects House procedure in two different ways. First, except in the case of matters prescribed by the Constitution itself, the House can determine for itself the substance of the rules that will govern its internal procedures. The House exercises this rule-making power at the beginning of each Congress when it adopts the chamber's rules, including any amendments to, or rules additional to, those of the previous Congress.", "The House also uses its rule-making power in this sense when it adopts \"special rules\" and when it enacts \"rule-making statutes.\" A special rule defines a specific procedure for considering an individual measure on the floor. A rule-making statute is a law that includes provisions governing House procedures, typically by prescribing rules for the consideration of a class of measures specified by the act itself. For example, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 contains rule-making provisions that, among other things, specify the content of the congressional budget resolution and set terms for its consideration.", "Special rules and rule-making statutes have the same standing and effect as the rules of the House, because they are both created through an exercise of the House's constitutional rule-making authority. When the House uses a \"rule\" to set terms for considering a measure, it typically adopts the \"rule\" immediately preceding consideration of the measure in question. When Congress enacts a law containing rule-making provisions, it typically includes in the statute a declaration that the provisions are enacted as an exercise of the rule-making authority of each house. At the beginning of each Congress, also, the House provides for the continued effectiveness of existing rule-making statutes as part of the same action by which it adopts its general code of chamber rules.", "A further way in which the House's rule-making authority affects its procedure is that the House can determine when its adopted code of Rules, including rule-making statutes, should not govern its own proceedings. In practical terms, this principle allows the House, by unanimous consent, to take parliamentary actions that violate its adopted Rules, or, by a two-thirds vote, to suspend the rules for consideration of a measure. Moreover, by majority vote, the House can adopt a special rule waiving points of order that Members could normally raise under the rules of the House or under a rule-making statute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "House Rules Are Generally Not Self-Enforcing", "paragraphs": ["Rules of the House, as well as other authorities that have the force of chamber rules (such as rule-making statutes and special rules), are normally enforced by Members raising points of order. A point of order is a claim, stated by a Member from the floor, that the House is violating or about to violate some House Rule, precedent, or other procedural authority. When a point of order is raised, the chair (the Speaker when in the House proper; the chairman when in Committee of the Whole) normally rules on its validity, often providing an explanation of the parliamentary rationale behind the ruling. If the chair sustains the point of order, the House cannot proceed with the action the point of order assails. As the next section describes, the ruling of the chair in such cases normally stands as a precedent of the House.", "The chair may also enforce House Rules and other sources of procedural authority by refusing to entertain a proposed action that these authorities do not permit. In some circumstances, the chair might take the initiative to rule such an action out of order, or to make an announcement to the House regarding proper procedure. For example, the chair often reminds members of rules of decorum during debate. In many circumstances, however, the chair does not take initiative to call to the chamber's attention that a violation of House rules is taking place. Under these conditions, unless some Member raises a point of order, the House can proceed in ways contrary to the requirements of its procedural authorities.", "In addition, points of order and rulings of the chair occur only on procedural questions raised pursuant to rules and precedents of the House. The chair will not rule on a point of order asserting a violation of constitutional requirements, for the chair has authority only over adopted rules and not over the Constitution. It is the practice of the House that the judgment of the chamber on a constitutional matter is to be settled by the vote of the body on the substantive question with respect to which the constitutional question is raised.", "Similarly, parliamentary actions undertaken on the basis of rules of a party caucus or conference, are not enforceable on the House floor, and the same is often true of practices that have developed without being formally adopted. While party caucus and conference rules, and practices that are \"informal\" in this sense, form part of the basis of House procedure, they are not produced through an exercise of the chamber's constitutional rule-making authority, and hence do not have the same standing as the Rules of the House. Caucus or conference rules are created and enforced by one party, and informal practices evolve over the years as custom. Finally, rules of procedure adopted by each House committee generally cannot be enforced on the House floor, though they can be enforced in the committee that adopts them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The House Rarely Disregards Its Precedents", "paragraphs": ["The published precedents of the House set forth how the chamber has interpreted and applied the chamber's rules. Most precedents are formed when the chair rules on a point of order, deciding either to sustain or overrule. In principle, any Member could appeal a ruling of the chair to the House itself, which would then determine the question itself by a majority vote. This proceeding would constitute an exercise of the constitutional authority of the House over its own rules, and the resulting determination of the House would also constitute a precedent. In practice, however, the House almost never entertains appeals of rulings of the chair, and even when it does, it seldom reverses the chair; in fact, the majority usually votes at once to lay any appeal on the table, an action that has the effect of confirming the ruling of the chair.", "Precedents also can be created when the chair responds to a parliamentary inquiry, or when the House makes a procedural decision by a majority vote (e.g . , to adopt a certain type of special rule).", "Precedents influence the manner in which current House rules are applied by relating past decisions to the specific case before the chamber. In specific cases, it may often be necessary to consult the published precedents for guidance on how each rule has been applied. In this way, the published precedents of the House function in practice both to complement and supplement the rules of the House. Precedents, accordingly, are analogous to case law in their effect. Just as attorneys in court will cite previous judicial decisions to support their arguments, Members will cite precedents of the House to support their point of order, or to defend against one. Similarly, the chair will often support a ruling by citing the decisions of predecessors. Historically, the House rarely disregards its precedents.", "Precedents do not carry equal weight. Those based on the chair's disposition of points of order or on a decision of the House by majority vote have more weight than those based on the chair's response to parliamentary inquiries. In addition, more recent precedents generally receive greater weight than earlier ones, and a precedent that is part of an evolved pattern will have more weight than one that is isolated in its effect. Moreover, all precedents must be evaluated in the historical context of the rules and practices at the time they were established. Because of the need to consider these various principles, Members needing to find precedents to support or rebut an argument might wish to seek the official advice of the Parliamentarian of the House (5-7373)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The House Adheres to Many Informal Practices", "paragraphs": ["Some House procedural actions are undertaken on the basis of practices that have evolved over the years and become accepted custom without being formally adopted, which can be called \"informal\" practices. Inasmuch as practices that are \"informal\" in this sense are not mandated by any authoritative statement, they cannot in general be enforced on the House floor through a point of order. In practice, however, these informal practices are rarely challenged on the House floor. Many are described in documents that digest the practice of the House or compile its formal precedents. Contemporary examples of House procedures determined by these informal practices include (1) the Speaker's recognition of Members for one-minute and special order speeches; and (2) giving members of the committee or subcommittee reporting a bill priority recognition for offering floor amendments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The House Manual and Authorities It Contains", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "House Manual", "paragraphs": ["The House Manual compiles in one volume the text of all the principal parliamentary sources that have authoritative force in House proceedings, accompanied by annotations by the Parliamentarian of the House that summarize precedents and practices pertinent to each provision.
