A number of legislative proposals have been introduced related to beneficial ownership disclosure in the 116 th Congress. Some of these legislative proposals, such as H.R. 2513 and S. 1889 , seek in various ways to impose certain duties on those who form corporations, LLCs, partnerships, or other legal entities to disclose their beneficial owners.

To do so, they may form nominal legal entities, or \"shell companies,\" which have no physical presence and generate little to no economic activity, but are used to anonymously store and transfer illicit proceeds. By relying on third-party nominees to serve as the legal owners of record for such shell companies, criminals can control and enjoy the benefits of the assets held by such companies while shielding their identities from investigators.", "Although concealing beneficial ownership has long been a central element of many money laundering schemes, many jurisdictions around the world have not established or implemented policy measures that address beneficial ownership disclosure and transparency.

FATF defines legal persons to include entities such as corporations, limited liability companies (LLCs), various forms of partnerships, foundations, and other entities that can own property and are treated as legal persons. FATF considers trusts, which share some of the same characteristics, to be \"legal arrangements.\" FATF recommends that countries mandate some degree of transparency in identifying beneficial owners, at least for law enforcement and regulatory purposes, for legal persons and legal arrangements. There are a range of legitimate reasons for wanting to create such entities, including diversification of risk with joint owners, tax purposes, limiting liability, and other reasons. However, such legal persons and arrangements can also be used to hide the identities of owners of assets, thereby facilitating money laundering, corruption, and financial crime. For this reason, FATF recommends countries take steps to ensure that accurate and updated information on the identities of beneficial owners be maintained and accessible to authorities.", "In the United States, corporations, LLCs, and partnerships are formed at the state level, not the federal level. Corporation laws vary from state to state, and the \"promoter\" of the corporation can choose in which state to incorporate or in which to form another legal entity, often paying a \"corporate formation agent\" within the state to file the required state-level paperwork. Such corporate formation agents may be attorneys, but are not always required to be attorneys. While state laws vary, most states share some basic requirements for forming a corporation or other entity, including the filing of the entity's articles of incorporation with the secretary of state. These articles often include the corporation's name, the business purpose of the corporation, and the corporation's registered agent and address for the purpose of accepting legal service of process if it is sued. While state requirements vary, most states do not collect, verify, or update identifying information on beneficial owners. Because no federal standards currently exist, a promoter of a corporation can choose to incorporate in a state with fewer disclosure requirements if they wish.", "The FATF evaluation of the United States' AML system found that \"measures to prevent or deter the misuse of legal persons and legal arrangements are generally inadequate\" in the United States. FATF reported there were no mechanisms in place to record or verify beneficial ownership information in the states during corporate formation.

In the United States, however, unlike in many European countries, the federal government has almost no role in the purchase and sale of real estate. Real estate transactions in the United States are largely private contracts, and transfers may or may not be recorded publicly, although many buyers find it advantageous to do so. Most buyers of property finance their purchases with mortgages from banks. Investors or those who do not require such loans may engage in \"all-cash\" purchases, which simply means that no loans are involved and that the purchasers must come up with the necessary funds on their own. According to the National Association of REALTORS\u00c2\u00ae, approximately 23% of residential real estate sales transactions were all-cash in 2017. Data from real estate data firm CoreLogic for 2016, however, put the figure at 46% for New York state, and similarly higher for some additional states.", "In addition to realtors, who may represent buyers or sellers (but are not required to be involved in transactions), escrow agents and title company agents also play a role in real estate transactions in the United States. Escrow agents essentially act as neutral middlemen in real estate sales, temporarily holding funds for either side. In cases where purchases are made in the name of an LLC, for instance, an escrow agent will look at operating agreements of the LLC to identify the person legally authorized to sign documents, but they generally have no specific duties to locate or identify beneficial owners. Usually, escrow agents are not part of title insurance companies or independent title agencies.", "After a buyer and seller agree on a sales price and sign a purchase and sales contract, real estate transactions are transferred to a land title company, most likely the American Land Title Association (ALTA). ALTA represents 6,300 title insurance agents and companies, from small, single-county operators to large national title insurers. Title insurance is a form of insurance that protects the holder from financial loss if there are previously undiscovered defects in a title to a property (such as previously undiscovered fraud or forgery, or various other situations). A typical title insurance company, before providing coverage to the buyer of a property, usually investigates prior sales of the property. This process often starts with examining public records tracing the property's history, its owners, sales, and any partial property rights that may have been given away. This title search investigation also normally includes tax and court records to give title companies an understanding of what they might be able to insure in their policies issued to buyers.", "Title insurers are the only professionals in the real estate community who currently have money laundering requirements, which were imposed through FinCEN's Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs), as detailed below.

To this end, the Commission has identified eight criteria or \"building blocks\" for assessing third countries\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of which is the \"availability of accurate and timely information of the beneficial ownership of legal persons and arrangements to competent authorities.\" In February 2019, the Commission released a proposed list of third countries with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that included four U.S. territories: American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A key criticism of the U.S. territories' AML/CFT regime was the lack of beneficial ownership disclosure requirements.

These included excessive opacity as to credit risks, and to potential losses accrued across various affiliates of large financial conglomerates. For example, when Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, financial regulators and market participants found it difficult to gauge their financial trading counterparties' exposure to Lehman's large number of subsidiaries and legal entities, domestically and overseas. Partly to better track such exposures, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and G-20 helped to design and create the concept of the LEI system, starting in 2009. ", "LEI is a voluntary international program that assigns each separate \"legal entity\" participating in the program a unique 20-digit identifying number. This number can be used across jurisdictions to identify a legally distinct entity engaged in a financial transaction, including a cross-border financial transaction, making it especially useful in today's globally interconnected financial system. The unique identifying number acts as a reference code\u00e2\u0080\u0094much like a bar code, which can be used globally, across different types of markets and for a wide range of financial purposes. These would include, for example, capital markets and derivatives transactions, commercial lending, and customer ownership, due diligence, and financial transparency purposes; as well as risk management purposes for large conglomerates that may have hundreds or thousands of subsidiaries and affiliates to track. A large international bank, for example, may have an LEI identifying the parent entity plus an LEI for each of its legal entities that buy or sell stocks, bonds, swaps, or engage in other financial market transactions. The LEI was designed to enable risk managers and regulators to identify parties to financial transactions instantly and precisely. ", "Although the origins of the LEI stemmed from concerns over credit risk and safety and soundness that surfaced during the 2008 financial crisis, the LEI may also have benefits for financial transparency. A May 2018 study from the Global Legal Entity Foundation found, based on multiple interviews with financial market companies, that the lack of consistent, reliable automated identifiers was creating a great burden on the financial industry; that most in the industry believed the \"Know Your Customer\" process of onboarding new clients would likely become more automated; and that \"there is clearly an opportunity to align on one identifier to generate efficiencies.\" Similar conclusions were reached in a 2017 study by McKinsey & Co. The current LEI system is aimed more at tracking financial transactions of various affiliates, but creating a unified global identifier could be considered a natural first step toward more easily tracking ownership of affiliates as well.", "Worldwide, more than 700,000 LEIs have been issued to entities in over 180 countries as of November 2017; however, use of the LEI remains largely voluntary as opposed to legally mandatory. In the United States and abroad, some aspects of financial reporting require use of the LEI and these, in substantial part, rely on voluntary implementation. ", "Some have called the lack of broader adoption of a common legal identifier a collective action problem. In a collective action problem, all participants in a system benefit if everyone participates; if only a few participate, those few bear high costs, as early adopters, with little benefit. Collective action problems are classic examples of situations where a government-organized solution may improve outcomes. Similarly, some argue that all parties would benefit if such LEIs were uniformly assigned, but there is no incentive to be a sole or early adopter. Academics have urged regulators to mandate the use of the LEI in regulatory reporting as a means of solving this collective action problem. Treasury's Office of Financial Research noted, \"Universal adoption is necessary to bring efficiencies to reporting entities and useful information to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, its member agencies, and other policymakers.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Legislative Proposals in the 116th Congress112", "paragraphs": ["In response to some of the issues discussed above, a number of lawmakers have introduced legislation that would require the collection of beneficial ownership information for both newly formed and existing legal entities.
