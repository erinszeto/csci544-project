", "In a May 8, 2010, speech, Secretary Gates proposed bridging that gap between the cost of sustaining the current force and the budgets he expected in the future by reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually, in order to sustain its current forces with the budgets he expected in the future, given the country's current difficult economic circumstances. Sustaining the current force, Secretary Gates said, would require, \"real growth in the defense budget ranging from two to 3% above inflation.... But, realistically, it is highly unlikely that we will achieve the real growth rates necessary to sustain the current force structure.\"", "The solution Secretary Gates proposed was to shift funds within the budget, providing the necessary real growth in those accounts that directly support combat forces, but offsetting the additional cost by an equivalent reduction in spending for administrative and support activities such as personnel management, acquisition oversight, and DOD's medical program. Phrased in terms of military jargon, Secretary Gates proposed increasing the amount spent on DOD's fighting force\u2014the \"tooth\"-- by decreasing the amount spent on administrative and support functions\u2014the \"tail.\"", "The goal is to cut our overhead costs and to transfer those savings to force structure and modernization within the programmed budget: In other words, to convert sufficient \"tail\" to \"tooth\" to provide the equivalent of roughly two to three percent real growth.... Simply taking a few percent off the top of everything on a one-time basis will not do. These savings must stem from root-and-branch changes that can be sustained and added to over time.", "Citing an estimate by the Defense Business Board that DOD's tail absorbs roughly 40% of the department's annual budget, Gates told reporters that a shift of about $10 billion from those support functions to the part of the budget that directly supports combat units would provide a total real increase of about 3% in the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request.", "On August 9, 2010, Secretary Gates announced several initiatives he said would reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies. Among these were:", "a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors in each of the next three years; a reduction in the number of generals and admirals by 50 and a reduction in the number of senior DOD civilians by 150 over the next two years; and elimination of the Joint Forces Command, the Business Transformation Agency and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration.", "On September 14, 2010, Secretary Gates announced 23 additional initiatives, all of which were intended to increase the efficiency with which DOD contracts for goods and services\u2014activities which, he said, account for about $400 billion of the roughly $700 billion the department spends annually. Among these contracting and acquisition initiatives were:", "a requirement that weapons program managers treat an \"affordability target\" as a key requirement of each new system, on a par with the usual performance requirements such as speed or data transmission rate; various contracting revisions intended to reward contractors for managing their programs more efficiently; and several changes in contracting rules intended to reduce the cost of contracts for services, which account for more than half DOD's annual contracting budget.", "Some Members of Congress contend that the Administration's projected real budget increases, even if realized, would be inadequate, given the steadily rising cost of personnel and operations.

Nevertheless, the FY2011 budget sustains the initiatives launched in the previous budget. Moreover, the budget request reflects the strategy and force planning assumptions that are embodied in DOD's Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), a legislatively mandated assessment of defense strategy and priorities, the most recent of which was released on February 1, 2010, to accompany the FY2011 budget request. ", "The four QDRs produced in 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2010 document an ongoing evolution of DOD strategic thinking that has seen a shift away from emphasizing the readiness of U.S. forces to wage smaller versions of Cold War-era conventional wars, such as the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Increasingly, U.S. planners have focused on the need for U.S. forces to be ready for a diverse array of missions. Two key assumptions running through the 2010 QDR are particularly relevant to the Administration's budgetary priorities.", "The first of these key assumptions is that DOD's top priority is fighting and winning the ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Accordingly, the report says, the department must rebalance its priorities to put more emphasis on support for forces engaged in current operations, and institutionalize capabilities for counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism operations, such as those currently being conducted by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Among the near-term initiatives recommended by the QDR toward this end are increased funding to acquire helicopters, UAVs, improved intelligence and analysis capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. The report also recommends some longer-term initiatives, including the conversion of one heavy Army brigade combat team (BCT) into a Stryker brigade\u2014such brigades use wheeled Stryker armored vehicles for mobility. The report says that \"several more BCTs\" may be converted \"as resources become available and future global demands become clearer.\" ", "A second basic assumption asserted throughout the 2010 QDR is that no adversary in prospect over the next 10-20 years is likely to directly confront U.S. conventional, military capabilities as embodied in armored brigades, aircraft carrier task forces, and squadrons of advanced jet fighters. Instead, the argument goes, any foe\u2014whether a violent, radical non-state terrorist group or a technologically advanced near-peer competitor\u2014will try to challenge U.S. forces \"asymmetrically,\" that is, by using unconventional tactics and technologies to exploit U.S. limitations. The report challenges the widely held notion that there is a spectrum of conflict, ranging from unsophisticated insurgents or terrorists at the low end to sophisticated national armies at the high end. Instead, the QDR says, \"low-end\" terrorist groups may use advanced technologies such as precision-guided missiles and near-peer competitors may use guerrilla-like \"indirect means\" of attack, such as a cyber-war campaign to degrade the computer networks on which U.S. forces rely heavily.", "The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of the military's ability to operate effectively in cyberspace, which it characterizes as one more domain of operations along with air, sea and space. The report also asserts that DOD must strengthen its capabilities to actively defend its cyber-networks. Towards this end, the report calls for several specific steps, including: developing a more comprehensive approach to DOD operations in cyberspace; developing a greater cyber expertise and awareness within DOD; centralizing command of cyber operations; and collaborating more closely with other agencies and levels of government to enhance cyber security.", "The 2010 QDR does not abandon the long-standing policy that U.S. forces should be able to win two major regional wars that occur nearly simultaneously in widely separated theaters of action. However, the report assigns equal importance to ensuring that U.S. forces can respond flexibly and effectively when required to conduct concurrently, at various points around the globe, several missions of different types. For example, one scenario the QDR said U.S. forces should be able to handle combined a major operation to stabilize another country, sustaining deterrence of a potential aggressor in another region, conducting a medium-sized counter-insurgency mission in yet another country, and providing support to U.S. civil authorities in the wake of some major disaster or terrorist attack.", "The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of preparing U.S. forces to deal with one particular type of asymmetric threat that has potentially significant implications for conventional U.S. forces: a so-called \"anti-access, area-denial\" capability that China and other potential adversaries appear to be developing. The argument is that China or Iran could use a variety of both simple and sophisticated technologies to target U.S. forward bases in nearby nations and naval forces operating relatively close to shore, which are the basis of the U.S. ability to project power in regions far from the U.S. homeland. Such power projection capabilities are the bedrock of U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia and the key to U.S. efforts to bolster stability in other important regions as well. Such capabilities are also expensive. The cost of power projection capabilities is one reason why U.S. defense spending dramatically exceeds that of any other nation. ", "Those sinews of U.S. power projections may be increasingly vulnerable to attack. Overseas ground bases may be increasingly vulnerable to ballistic missile, cruise missile, and bomber attacks. Naval forces, particularly aircraft carriers and other service combatants, may be increasingly vulnerable to anti-ship cruise missiles; modern, quiet diesel electric submarines; smart mines that can be activated on command and maneuvered into place; small, fast boats laden with explosives; or, at the high end of the technological spectrum, ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads that can be redirected in flight to strike moving ships. ", "The QDR makes a number of recommendations for countering anti-access strategies, including increased reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines that would be less vulnerable to such methods. For instance, long-range strike forces might include a new manned or unmanned bomber, perhaps armed with long-range cruise missiles for stand-off attacks. Measures to defeat enemy sensors and engagement systems include development of offensive \"electronic attack\" capabilities, which remain highly classified. Missile defense may be a major and expensive part of measures to protect forward deployed forces.

His remarks reflect recommendations contained in the February 8, 2010, Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Report that called for all four armed services \"to strengthen and institutionalize\" their capability to train and advise the security forces of partner nations. ", "Secretary Gates' remarks were reinforced by a March 3, 2010, speech by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, who urged that military power should not be considered the last resort of the state, \"but as potentially the best, first option\" when combined with diplomacy and other instruments of national power. Both Secretary Gates and Adm. Mullen, as well as the QDR report, encouraged lawmakers to substantially bolster civilian capabilities to assist foreign governments in preventing, containing, and recovering from conflict. All three described a new relationship between defense and diplomacy, which \"are no longer discrete choices \u2026 but must in fact, complement one another throughout the messy process of international relations,\" according to Chairman Mullen.", "Consistent with this position, the Administration's FY2011 DOD budget request leaves under DOD's control other controversial security assistance programs, notably the so-called \"Section 1206\" program to train and equip the security forces of other countries threatened by terrorists, for which the budget included $489.5 million. The DOD budget also contains a funding request for the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program ($33.3 million), and two new DOD security assistance programs created in FY2010: the Defense Institution Reform Initiative to promote the institutional development of foreign defense ministries ($5.7 million); and a related program to provide legal instruction to foreign military members and civilian government officials ($1.6 million). The FY2011 request also would launch a new program, the Stability Operations Fellowship Program ($5.0 million), but Congress has turned down this proposal in the past.", "While affirming in his February speech that the State Department should maintain the lead, Secretary Gates described the current national security system as outmoded, with the roles of defense and diplomacy designed for a different set of threats than those the United States faces today. According to some defense experts, some Members have considered introducing legislation based on one Gates' proposal, a pooled fund for security assistance to which DOD, State, and USAID contribute, but instead are awaiting the Administration's own proposal.
