The fact that some low-income undergraduates do not apply for aid is evidenced by the higher percentage of aid applicants receiving a Pell Grant compared to all undergraduates in the same income category. It is possible that some low-income students who did not apply for aid may have believed they were not eligible, or they may have had sufficient resources to meet their costs. At least some of those who believed they were ineligible for aid may have actually been eligible. Among other possible explanations are that very low-income students in particular find the federal financial aid application process too complex to pursue, or that such students may not be aware of the availability of federal student aid.

For example, in AY2013-2014, the maximum Pell Grant covered approximately 68% of the average published in-state tuition and fees at four-year public institutions. At two-year public institutions, where students often commute to classes, the maximum Pell Grant in AY2013-2014 exceeded the average published tuition and fees at these institutions ($5,645 compared to $2,882).

In AY2011-2012, only 32.4% of Pell recipients relied on a Pell Grant as their only source of aid and many participated in other federal student aid programs, sometimes at a high rate.
