These amendments are the most comprehensive and significantchanges made to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) since its enactment in 1975.Several of the most important changes were made regarding the discipline of children withdisabilities. Congress attempted to strike \"a careful balance between the LEA's duty to ensure thatschool environments are safe and conducive to learning for all children, including children withdisabilities, and the LEA's continuing obligation to ensure that children with disabilities receive afree appropriate public education.\" (1)", "Although much of the previous statute, case law, regulations and policy guidance was incorporated in the new statutory language, several provisions were added which give schoolsincreased flexibility for dealing with children with disabilities who misbehave. The IDEAAmendments of 1997 allow a school to place a child with a disability in an interim alternativeeducational setting for not more than forty-five days if the student has been involved with drugs orweapons (not just firearms as under previous law).

In addition, P.L. 105-17 codifies the previous interpretation by the Department ofEducation that educational services may not cease for children with disabilities who have beensuspended or expelled. ", "The Department of Education promulgated final regulations under P.L. 105-17 on March 12, 1999 after receiving comments from about 6,000 individuals, public agencies and organizations. (2) The regulatory provisions on discipline were controversial, especially those aspects relating to shortterm suspensions, and these provisions were changed from what the Department had put forth in itsproposed regulations. (3)", "Although significant changes were made in the 1997 reauthorization of IDEA, amendments have been proposed since then to further amend the discipline provisions. Several of these havepassed the House or Senate but have not become law. The 108th Congress passed H.R. 1350 in both the House and Senate but conferees have not yet been appointed. Prior to a moredetailed discussion of the 1997 statutory and regulatory changes as well as more recent proposedchanges, it is important to briefly examine the history of IDEA's discipline provisions. (4)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of IDEA's Discipline Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The manner in which children with disabilities can be disciplined may seem quite complex butthe logic involved is much more apparent when IDEA's history is examined. IDEA was originallyenacted in 1975 as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, P.L. 94-142 . The primarymotive for its enactment was the fact that children with disabilities often failed to receive aneducation or received an inappropriate education. (5) This lack of education gave rise to numerousjudicial decisions, notably PARC v. State of Pennsylvania, 343 F.Supp. 279 (E.D.Pa. 1972), and Mills v. Board of Education of the District of Columbia, 348 F.Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972). Thesedecisions found constitutional infirmities with the lack of education for children with disabilitieswhen the states were providing education for children without disabilities. As a result, the stateswere under considerable pressure to provide such services, and they lobbied Congress to assist them. ", "In enacting P.L. 94-142 , Congress provided grants to the states to help pay for education for children with disabilities and also delineated specific requirements the states must follow in orderto receive these federal funds. These requirements did not contain a discipline provision per se butrather contained a requirement that if there is a dispute between the school and the parents of a childwith a disability, the child \"stays put\" in his or her current educational placement until the disputeis resolved using the due process procedures set forth in the statute. The concept of \"stay put\" wasplaced in the statute to help eliminate the then common discriminatory practice of expelling childrenwith disabilities from school. A revised \"stay put\" provision remains as law in the current versionof IDEA.", "Issues relating to children with disabilities who exhibited violent or inappropriate behavior have been raised for a number of years. In 1988, the question of whether there was an implied exceptionto the stay put rule was presented to the Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305 (1988). Honig involved emotionally disturbed children one of whom had choked another student withsufficient force to leave abrasions on the child's neck and who had kicked out a window while hewas being escorted to the principal's office. The other child in the Honig case had been involvedin stealing, extorting money and making lewd comments. The school had sought expulsion but theSupreme Court disagreed finding that \"Congress very much meant to strip schools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students, particularly emotionallydisturbed students, from school.\" (6) However, theCourt observed that this holding did \"not leaveeducators hamstrung....Where a student poses an immediate threat to the safety of others, officialsmay temporarily suspend him or her for up to 10 school days....And in those cases in which theparents of a truly dangerous child adamantly refuse to permit any change in placement, the 10-dayrespite gives school officials an opportunity to invoke the aid of the courts under section 1415(e)(2),which empowers courts to grant any appropriate relief.\" (7) This statement about the school's right toseek judicial relief has come to be know as a Honig injunction.", "The Supreme Court's interpretation of IDEA in Honig did not quell all concerns about discipline and children with disabilities. In 1994, Congress amended IDEA's stay put provision togive schools the unilateral authority to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternativeeducational setting if the child was determined to have brought a firearm to school. This provisionwas expanded upon in the IDEA Amendments of 1997 to include weapons, not just firearms, anddrugs.", "The Department of Education had also received numerous questions from schools about discipline and in 1995 issued a memorandum discussing numerous discipline issues including theuse of manifestation determinations. (8) If a schoolsought to suspend or expel a child with a disabilityfor more than ten days, the school must first make a \"manifestation determination,\" a determinationconcerning whether the student's misconduct was related to his or her disability. If the behavior wasnot related to the disability, the school could suspend or expel for more than ten days but mustcontinue to provide education services. If the behavior was related to the disability, the school mustgive notice of any recommended change in placement and, if the parent objected, the parent couldinvoke the stay put provision. The Department found that Honig injunctions, court orders to changethe placement of a child with a disability, were proper when a school believed that maintaining thechild in his or her current placement was \"substantially likely to result in injury to the student orothers.\" The concept of a manifestation determination was placed in statutory language by P.L.105-17 . Similarly, the new statutory language continues the regulatory interpretation thateducational services cannot cease for children with disabilities even if they have been suspended orexpelled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discipline Provisions in the IDEA Amendments of 1997", "paragraphs": ["With the preceding background in mind, the specific changes made by P.L. 105-17 will nowbe examined. First, however, it should be emphasized that much of what Congress intended to dowas to codify existing law that was found in the regulations, case law, and policy guidance. Thechanges that were made were among the most contentious in a long and controversialreauthorization. The House and Senate reports described the changes in general.", "The committee recognizes that school safety is important to educators and parents. There has been considerable debate and concern about both ifand how those few children with disabilities who affect the school safety of peers, teachers, andthemselves may be disciplined when they engage in behavior that jeopardizes such safety. Inaddition, the committee is aware of the perception of a lack of parity when making decisions aboutdisciplining children with and without disabilities who violate the same school rule or code ofconduct. By adding a new section 615(k) to IDEA, the committee has attempted to strike a carefulbalance between the LEA's duty to ensure that school environments are safe and conducive tolearning for all children, including children with disabilities, and the LEA's continuing obligationto ensure that children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education. Thus, drawingon testimony, experience, and common sense, the committee has placed specific and comprehensiveguidelines on the matter of disciplining children with disabilities in this section. (9)", "Generally, a child with a disability is not immune from disciplinary procedures; however, theseprocedures are not identical to those for children without disabilities. If child with a disabilitycommits an action that would be subject to discipline, school personnel have several options. Theseinclude ", "a suspension for up to ten days, ", "placement in an interim alternative education setting for up to forty five days for situations involving weapons or drugs, and", "asking a hearing officer to order a child be placed in an interim alternative educational setting for up to forty five days if it is demonstrated that the child is substantially likelyto injure himself or others in his current placement, ", "conducting a manifestation determination review to determine whether there is a link between the child's disability and the misbehavior. If the child's behavior is not amanifestation of a disability, long term disciplinary action such as expulsion may occur, except thateducational services may not cease.", "School officials may also seek a Honig injunction as discussed previously if they are unable to reach agreement with a student's parents and they feel that the new statutory provisions are not sufficient."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Ten Day Rule", "paragraphs": ["School personnel can order a change in placement for not more than ten days to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting, another setting or suspension to the same extent that theseoptions would be applied to children without disabilities.

", "However, the new statutory language does not state whether the ten days are ten days for theschool year or ten consecutive days and this became a point of controversy in the proposedregulations. The final regulations responded to this criticism with a compromise. School personnelmay order the removal of a child with a disability from the child's current placement for not morethan ten consecutive school days for any violation of school rules to the extent that the same removalwould be applied to children without disabilities. (10) In addition, the school may remove a child witha disability for periods of not more than ten consecutive school days in the same school year for otherincidents of misconduct as long as these removals do not constitute a change in placement asdescribed in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd300.519(b). Section 300.519(b) states that a change in placement occurs if \"the childis subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern because they cumulate to more than 10school days in a school year, and because of factors such as the length of each removal, the totalamount of time the child is removed, and the proximity of the removals to one another.\"", "For suspensions after suspensions for the first ten days of the school year, the final regulations state that schools must provide services to the extent necessary to enable the child to appropriatelyprogress in the general curriculum and meet the child's IEP (individualized educational placement)goals. (11) If the child is removed for not more thanten consecutive days and there is not a change inplacement, the school personnel make the determination of which services are necessary.

Previously, the state of Virginia refused to comply with theOSEP interpretation. This led to several judicial decisions and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appealsfound that the plain language of IDEA did not condition the receipt of IDEA funds on the continuedprovision of educational services to expelled children with disabilities and that in order for Congressto place conditions on the state's receipt of federal funds, Congress must do so clearly andunambiguously.

The Senate billalso would delete the provision in current law regarding current placement and expedited hearings.", "In the House bill, the stay put requirement is applicable to a change in placement as described in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd615(j)(1)(B), H.R. 1350 (House), which would allow school personnel to order achange in placement for a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct. Undercurrent law, this exception to the general \"stay put\" requirement is more limited and applies tosituations involving weapons, drugs or where a hearing officer has determined that maintaining thecurrent placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others. The House andSenate bills would delete the provisions in current law regarding current placement during appealsand expedited hearings. Under current law, if a child with a disability is placed in an interimalternative educational setting and school personnel propose to change the child's placement afterthe expiration of the interim alternative placement, the child is to remain in the child's placementprior to the interim alternative education setting pending the result of the proceeding. The Senatebill, but not the House bill, would add a requirement that the state or local educational agencyarrange for an expedited hearing which shall occur within twenty school days of the date the hearingis requested.", "Current law provides that a child who has not been determined to be eligible for special education and related services and who has engaged in behavior that violated any rule or code ofconduct of the local educational agency, may seek the protections of IDEA if the local educationalagency had knowledge that the child was a child with a disability before the behavior thatprecipitated the disciplinary action occurred. The current law sets forth certain situations where alocal educational agency shall be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability. The House and Senate bills contain similar provisions; however, the House bill requires the teacheror school personnel to express concern in writing about the behavior or performance of the child tothe director of special education or other personnel while the Senate bill requires that the teacher orschool personnel express concern about a pattern of behavior demonstrated by the child to thedirector of special education or other administrative personnel. The Senate bill, but not the Housebill, would add a new situation where the LEA is deemed to have knowledge: where the child hasengaged in a pattern of behavior that should have alerted LEA personnel that the child may be inneed of special education and related services. In addition, the Senate bill, but not the House bill,would add an exception where the LEA is deemed not to have knowledge that the child has adisability if the parent of the child has not agreed to allow an evaluation of the child."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
