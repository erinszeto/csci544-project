In addition, the 1973 amendments specified that states were to receive no less than they received in FY1973 (the hold harmless amount).", "These provisions remained in effect until the 1978 amendments, which changed the minimum amounts for American Samoa to one-sixteenth of 1% of the appropriation, and added a minimum funding amount for the Northern Marianas (also one-sixteenth of 1%). The 1978 amendments also changed the year for the hold harmless amount. The law stipulated that for fiscal years after 1978, states were to receive no less than they received in FY1978, rather than, as in prior law, FY1973. Successive amendments subsequently changed the hold harmless year. Amendments in 1984 required that for fiscal years after FY1984, states be allotted no less than they received for services in FY1984. There were no changes to the formula provisions under the 1987 amendments. The 1992 amendments moved the hold harmless reference year to FY1987. No further changes were made to these funding formulas until the 2000 amendments.", "The OAA Amendments of 2000 and 2006", "The Title III funding formula for supportive services and senior centers, the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs, and disease prevention and health promotion services has been a point of controversy in recent congressional attempts to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. Initially, Congress was concerned that the method AOA used to distribute Title III funds was inconsistent with statutory requirements, thereby negatively affecting states experiencing faster growth in their older population. However, more recently, congressional debate has focused on whether or not the statutory formula itself accurately reflects trends in the aging of the U.S. population. The following provides a brief overview of the debate and legislative changes to the Title III funding formula in the OAA reauthorizations of 2000 and 2006.", "After unsuccessful attempts in the 104 th and 105 th Congresses to reauthorize the OAA, the 106 th Congress approved the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000 ( P.L. 106-501 ). The Title III funding formula was a controversial issue during the six years of congressional debate on the 2000 OAA reauthorization. Prior to the reauthorization, a 1994 U.S. General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office, or GAO) report found that the method AOA used did not distribute funds among states proportionately to their older population to the maximum extent possible. Instead, AOA allotted funds to states, first according to an amount equal to their FY1987 \"hold harmless\" allocation, with the remainder of the appropriations allotted to states based on their relative share of the population aged 60 and over. This methodology negatively affected states with faster-growing older populations, since the majority of funds were being distributed according to population estimates that did not reflect the most recent trends. The GAO report recommended that AOA revise its methodology for distributing funds to states.", "In response to these concerns, the 2000 OAA reauthorization resulted in the following changes to the law: (1) Congress clarified the law to ensure that, first, funds were allotted to states based on the most recent population data; (2) Congress created an FY2000 \"hold harmless\" requirement, thereby ensuring that no state would receive less than it received in FY2000; and (3) Congress created the \"guaranteed growth\" provision, ensuring that all states would receive a share of any appropriations increase over the FY2000 level.", "The Title III funding formula also became a major point of contention during the 2006 OAA reauthorization debate. Congress revisited the FY2000 \"hold harmless\" requirement and \"guaranteed growth\" provision. At the time, the \"hold harmless\" requirement ensured that, provided sufficient funds, every state and U.S. territory received at least its FY2000 amount. The \"guaranteed growth\" provision guaranteed that all states received a certain share of any increase above the FY2000 appropriation. These issues divided Members from states with relatively faster-growing older populations from lawmakers representing states with relatively slower growth in their older populations. High-growth states argued that the \"hold harmless\" provisions in current law provided protections to states whose populations were not increasing as quickly as others', resulting in an inequitable distribution of funds that disadvantaged high-growth states.", "The OAA 2006 Amendments ultimately resulted in changes to the law as follows: (1) Congress changed the formula to ensure that, provided sufficient funds, every state receives at least its FY2006 amount (creating a new fiscal year \"hold harmless\" amount); and (2) Congress phased out the \"guaranteed growth\" provision, reducing the share of any increase in appropriations from 20% to 0 by 5 percentage points annually beginning in FY2008. For FY2007 through FY2010, the guaranteed growth provisions were as follows:", "20% of the percentage increase in appropriations from FY2006 to FY2007; 15% of the percentage increase in appropriations from FY2006 to FY2008; 10% of the percentage increase in appropriations from FY2006 to FY2009; and 5% of the percentage increase in appropriations from FY2006 to FY2010.", "Under current law, for FY2011 and any succeeding fiscal years, the formula does not include the guaranteed growth provision.", "The OAA Reauthorization of 2016", "The Title III funding formula for supportive services and senior centers, the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs, and disease prevention and health promotion services continued to be a major point of contention during the 2016 OAA reauthorization debate, which spanned multiple Congresses. Congress again revisited the issue of how much state population growth should influence state funding allocations versus retaining continuity in funding allocations for slower-growth states. In the 113 th Congress, comprehensive OAA reauthorization legislation was introduced in the Senate ( S. 1028 and S. 1562 ) which would have extended the authorizations of appropriations through FY2018 for most OAA programs and would have made various amendments to existing OAA authorities. The Senate HELP Committee ordered S. 1562 reported favorably with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. In the House of Representatives, two OAA reauthorization bills were introduced ( H.R. 3850 and H.R. 4122 ). These bills were referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, but saw no further legislative action.", "Prior to legislative consideration, the topic of OAA statutory funding formulas was again examined by GAO in an analysis of the OAA Title III and VII statutory funding formulas that focused on formula modifications that would capture state differences with respect to need by including factors that measure the needs of the elderly population, costs of services in addressing those needs, and the capacity of states to finance needed services. GAO found that the current formulas could better meet generally accepted equity standards in targeting OAA services to those with \"greatest economic need\" and \"greatest social need.\" For example, GAO found that the need for OAA services can be estimated using data on older individuals' functional limitations. GAO also noted that while revisions to the OAA statutory formula may pose challenges, options to ease the transition such as phasing in implementation over several years and/or instituting funding floors or ceilings may be further provisions for policymakers to consider in any statutory revisions.", "In the 113 th Congress, S. 1562 did not contain provisions that would amend OAA statutory funding formulas. However, during the Senate HELP Committee consideration of the OAA reauthorization bill, Senator Richard Burr introduced an amendment that would have removed the Title III Part B (supportive services and senior centers), Part C (nutrition services), and Part D (disease prevention and health promotion services) FY2006 hold harmless provision, which was rejected. Senator Tom Harkin, then chairman, stated there would be additional examination of the OAA funding formula by a Senate bipartisan workgroup with a possible solution prior to Senate floor consideration. The bill was subsequently reported out of committee and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar, but did not receive consideration by the Senate. The bill saw no further action in the Senate.", "In the 114th Congress, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2015 ( S. 192 ) was introduced on January 20, 2015. The bill authorized appropriations for most OAA programs for a three-year period from FY2016 to FY2018. It also made various amendments to existing OAA authorities, including changes to the statutory funding formula for the supportive services and senior centers, congregate nutrition, home-delivered nutrition, and disease prevention and health promotion services under Title III of the act, which lessens the effect of the hold harmless provision over time. The Senate HELP Committee ordered S. 192 reported favorably, and it subsequently passed the Senate on July 16, 2015. The House took up S. 192 on March 21, 2016, and passed the bill with an amendment authorizing appropriations for the three-year period from FY2017 to FY2019. S. 192 , as amended by the House, did not substantively change the hold harmless provision under S. 192 , as passed by the Senate. Rather, it amended the effective dates for the hold harmless reduction, from FY2016 through FY2018 to FY2017 through FY2019. It froze this reduction in place for FY2020 and future fiscal years, unless or until such language is amended. The Senate passed S. 192 as amended by the House on April 7, 2016. President Barack Obama signed P.L. 114-144 , the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016, on April 19, 2016.", "Specifically, P.L. 114-144 changed the statutory funding allocations for OAA Title III, Parts B, C, and D. This provision retained the same state and U.S. territory minimum amounts allotted under current law and the same population-based formula factor (aged 60 and over), but reduced state and U.S. territory hold harmless amounts (currently referenced to FY2006 funding levels) by 1% from the previous fiscal year. The law lessens the effect of the FY2006 hold harmless provision by reducing state and U.S. territory hold harmless amounts by 1% for each of three years, and then freezes this reduction in place for FY2020 and future fiscal years, unless or until such language is amended. Effectively, for those states that receive an annual program allotment based on their FY2006 hold harmless amount, the policy change minimizes any reduction in funding to no more than 1% from the previous fiscal year, assuming a program's total funding level in fiscal years 2017 to 2019 is at or above the previous fiscal year's level.", "Appendix B.

There is a two-year time lag between the reference year of the population estimates and the respective appropriation year. For example, FY2019 state allotments are calculated using 2017 estimates of the population aged 60 and older. The column labeled \"% Age 60+\" is the entities' relative share of the 60+ population, which functions as its population-based formula factor used to determine state allotments under OAA Title III, Parts B, C, and D and Title VII.", "The final column of Table B-1 calculates the percentage point change in the population formula factor for each state and U.S. territory from 2000 to 2017. Among all 56 states and U.S. territories (which includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), 29 entities saw a proportionate increase in the population formula factor from 2000 to 2017, while 27 saw a decrease over this time period. The top five states that experienced the greatest proportionate increase were Texas (+0.93%), California (+0.56%), Georgia (+0.47%), North Carolina (+0.37%), and Arizona (+0.37%). The bottom five states that experienced the greatest decline were Pennsylvania (-0.85%), New York (-0.79%), Ohio (-0.44%), Illinois (-0.42%), and New Jersey (-0.35%).", "Appendix C. The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-144 ): Analysis of Formula Change", "The following analysis compares FY2016 allotment amounts for states and other entities with actual allotment amounts under the statutory funding formula change in P.L. 114-144 for FY2017 to FY2019. The following tables provide results by program: ", "Table C-1 : Title III, Part B, supportive services and senior centers; Table C-2 : Title III, Part C, subpart 1, congregate nutrition services; Table C-3 : Title III, Part C, subpart 2, home-delivered nutrition services; and Table C-4 : Title III, Part D, disease prevention and health promotion services programs. ", "Each table compares FY2016 state and U.S. territory allotments prior to the statutory funding formula change under P.L. 114-144 to allotments with the change, for FY2017 through FY2019. The columns in each table provide two types of analyses for each year. The first is the percentage change between the entities' FY2016 allotment and the entities' annual allotment for each year, respectively. The second is the entities' allotment type for each year of the change, where \"M\" refers to an entity that receives a minimum allotment amount; \"HH\" refers to an entity that receives an allotment amount based on 99% of the previous fiscal year's hold harmless funding amount; and \"P\" refers to an entity that receives an allotment amount based on the entities' population formula factor.", "For programs where the current law hold harmless is in effect (i.e., some states and territories receive an allotment based on their hold harmless), the change to the statutory funding formula, often also combined with increases in appropriated funding amounts, reduces the effect of the hold harmless over time. For example, 16 states and territories received an allotment based on their FY2006 hold harmless level for the congregate nutrition services program. Under the statutory funding formula change, the number of states and territories that received an allotment based on the hold harmless (99% of the previous fiscal year) remained at 16 in FY2017 with a 0.2% increase in the total allotment amount from the prior year. That number fell to 4 in FY2018 when combined with a 10% increase in the total allotment amount compared to the prior year and remained at 4 in FY2018. ", "As a state or territory's hold harmless amount is reduced gradually by 1% from the previous year's hold harmless over three fiscal years, additional states and territories received funding based on their hold harmless amount. Effectively, the change to the statutory funding formula, especially when combined with increases in appropriated funding amounts, allows funding freed up from the hold harmless reductions to be redistributed to states and territories based on the population formula factor. Thus, more states and territories received funding based on their population aged 60 and over.", "Under the supportive services and senior centers and disease prevention and health promotion services programs all states and territories received funding in FY2016 based on a proportionate reduction to their FY2006 hold harmless amount. Total FY2016 funding for these programs was below FY2006 funding levels. The statutory funding formula change combined with program funding increases reduced the number of entities receiving an allotment based on their hold harmless from FY2017 to FY2018 (for supportive services, 29 states in FY2017, to 10 in FY2018; and for disease prevention, 28 states in FY2017, to 0 in FY2018). From FY2018 to FY2019, appropriated amounts for these programs did not change and the number of entities receiving an allotment based on their hold harmless increased slightly\u2014to 12 entities for the supportive services program and 9 entities for disease prevention.", "For programs where the previous FY2006 hold harmless was not in effect, such as home-delivered nutrition services, the funding formula change had a smaller effect compared to prior law. Two states and territories receive funding for FY2017 based on their hold harmless amount. For FY2018 and FY2019 all states receiving funding based on either their population age 60 and older or the minimum grant amount. In general, the statutory funding formula change did not affect entities receiving an allotment based on the minimum grant amount as P.L. 114-144 made no change to this provision."], "subsections": []}]}}
