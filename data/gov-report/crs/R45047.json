The act, as amended, makes a number of changes to programs and policies of the VHA that aim to increase access and lower wait times for veterans who seek care at VA facilities. ", "Among other things, the act established a new program (the Veterans Choice Program) to allow the VA to authorize care for veterans outside the VA health care system if they meet certain criteria. The act also provided mandatory funding for the Veterans Choice Program (VCP), by establishing the Veterans Choice Fund (Section 802 (a) of P.L. 113-146 as amended) and appropriating a total of $10 billion over three years. The original sunset date for the VCP was August 7, 2017. In addition, Section 801(a) of the Choice Act ( P.L. 113-146 ; 38 U.S.C. \u00a71701 note) provided an additional mandatory funding of $5 billion to increase veterans' access to health care by hiring more physicians and staff, and to improve VA's capital infrastructure and support information technology (IT) infrastructure. These Section 801(a) funds would remain available until expended.", "Two subsequent laws have affected the duration of the VCP, as well as the availability and amount of the appropriations in the Veterans Choice Fund. First, it was estimated around January 2017 that not all the funds in the Veterans Choice Fund would be exhausted by August 7, 2017. In response, on April 19, 2017, President Trump signed into law P.L. 115-26 (an act to amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to modify the termination date for the Veterans Choice Program, and for other purposes; unofficially known as the as the Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act). The act eliminated the sunset date of the VCP and allowed any unobligated funds in the Veterans Choice Fund to be used until expended. However, in mid-June 2017, the VA notified Congress that due to an increased authorization of appointments, there had been a higher rate of usage of VCP funds such that all funds would likely be obligated by August 15, 2017, and the VCP would not be able to continue past that time. According to the VA, at least $3.5 billion in new mandatory budget authority would be needed to continue the VCP through FY2018. As a result, on August 12, 2017, the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-46 ) was signed into law. This act authorized and appropriated $2.1 billion for the Veterans Choice Fund (\u00a7802 (a), P.L. 113-146 ; 38 U.S.C. \u00a71701 note). These funds were to remain available until expended. ", "On December 20, 2017, the VA published a notice in the Federal Register stating that funds for the Veterans Choice Fund would be exhausted between January 2, 2018, and January 16, 2018. In response, Congress appropriated (\u00a74001 of P.L. 115-96 ) another $2.1 billion to remain available until expended. In February, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs stated that these funds would remain available for obligation until May 2018. Table 1 provides current funding levels for the Veterans Choice Fund.
