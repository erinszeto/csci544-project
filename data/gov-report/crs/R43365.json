This report summarizes and analyzes the issues of conflicts of interest that are addressed in federal law and regulation regarding officers and employees in the executive branch of the federal government.", "Federal conflict of interest laws and regulations deal for the most part with the potential conflict between the official duties and responsibilities of a public officer on the one hand, and the outside, personal economic or financial interests of that individual (including the financial interests of that individual's spouse and minor children) on the other. When a particular governmental matter may have a real and predictable impact on an officer's or employee's personal financial interests or assets, that officer's or employee's work on such a matter for the government would raise conflict of interest issues. The concern in such cases is that the judgment of the officer or employee could be influenced and affected, even subtly or unconsciously, by his or her own personal financial stake in the matter, as opposed to decisions, advice, and official actions of public officers being based solely on the overall, general public interest.", "Although federal officials may have many and varied outside, personal \"interests,\" federal conflict of interest law and regulation focuses specifically on regulating outside, personal financial interests of the officer. The regulatory scheme for conflicts of interest in the executive branch of the federal government may generally be summarized in three broad categories: disqualification, disclosure, and divestiture.", "The principal conflict of interest statute under federal law is a criminal provision which requires federal executive branch officials to disqualify or \"recuse\" themselves from working personally and substantially on any particular matter before the government in which that official (or those close enough to the official that their interests may be imputed to the official) has any \"financial interest.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. There are certain financial interests which are considered either de minimis, or too remote or inconsequential to affect the duties expected of employees, and such interests are exempted from the prohibition by regulations of the Office of Government Ethics. Most high-ranking federal officials must file public annual financial disclosure reports, as well as periodic disclosure reports on certain financial transactions, which detail financial holdings, assets, property, and financial transactions of the official, the official's spouse, and dependent children. Additionally, there may be confidential financial disclosure reports required from certain rank-and-file employees who do not file publicly. All of these disclosure reports are reviewed by agency ethics personnel, and are intended to facilitate conflict of interest regulation by identifying assets, property, and ownerships with a conflict potential, and to resolve any such conflicts of interest. Although there is no overall, general divestiture requirement in federal law, the divestiture of assets may be one method of conflict of interest resolution or avoidance that could be required by agency ethics personnel for assets with conflict of interest potential. Additionally, there are particular statutes and regulations applicable to certain officers and agencies which may prohibit the ownership of a range or category of particular assets. These provisions, in addition to prohibiting the acquisition of such assets, may also require the divestiture of such assets already held by incumbent officers or nominees to certain positions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["This report discusses the federal regulation of potential \"conflicts of interest\" which may arise as a result of the personal financial holdings, assets, securities, property, and financial transactions in assets and securities of an official in the executive branch of the federal government."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conflicts of Interest, Generally", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Principles Underlying Conflict of Interest Regulation", "paragraphs": ["The underlying principle of the financial conflict of interest laws adopted by Congress, and of the regulations promulgated in the executive branch, embodies the axiom \"that a public servant owes undivided loyalty to the Government,\" and that decisions, advice, and recommendations made by or given to the government by its officers be made in the public interest and not be tainted, even unintentionally, with influence from personal financial interests. The House Judiciary Committee, reporting out major conflict of interest revisions made in the 1960s, found:", "The proper operation of a democratic government requires that officials be independent and impartial; that Government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; ... and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. The attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists, or appears to exist an actual or potential conflict between the private interests of a Government employee and his duties as an official.", "As noted in expert studies in the field of conflicts of interest, the concern in such regulation is generally, \"... not only the possibility or appearance of private gain from public office, but the risk that official decisions, whether consciously or otherwise, will be motivated by something other than the publics interest. The ultimate concern is bad government.... \"", "The conflict of interest laws are thus directed not only at conduct which is improper, but rather are often preventative or prophylactic in nature, directed at situations which merely have the potential to tempt or subtly influence an official in the performance of official public duties. As explained by the Supreme Court with regard to a predecessor conflict of interest law requiring disqualification of officials from matters in which they have a personal financial interest:", "This broad proscription embodies a recognition of the fact that an impairment of impartial judgment can occur in even the most well-meaning men when their personal economic interests are affected by the business they transact on behalf of the Government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outside Interests Regulated", "paragraphs": ["The term \"conflict of interest\" may have many diverse meanings in common usage.

", "Officers and employees of the federal government may naturally have many outside, private, and personal \"interests.\" However, limiting the federal regulation of an employee's outside interests to financial interests may avoid, as one federal court has noted, \"invit[ing] challenges to officials based not upon true conflicts of interest but upon their philosophical or ideological leanings.... \" Such limitation of conflict of interest regulation to outside, personal financial interests may also ameliorate First Amendment issues regarding attempts to regulate the outside, private associations, memberships, or organizational activities of public employees. ", "Federal employees in the executive branch have an express obligation to be \"impartial\" in the exercise of their official responsibilities. Although the impartiality language is fairly broad on its face, the \"impartiality\" actually required of a federal employee in a governmental matter by the specific conflict of interest and federal ethical standards\u2014in addition to treating all organizations and individuals fairly\u2014is a disinterestedness in the matter from the point of view of any financial impact that such a matter may have upon the employee personally (or upon certain entities, persons, or organizations which are closely associated with the employee and whose interests may thus be fairly \"imputed\" to the employee). As noted by the Office of Government Ethics, the central office for ethics administration and interpretation in the executive branch of the federal government:", "Questions regarding impartiality necessarily arise when an employee's official duties impact upon the employee's own financial interests or those of certain other persons, such as the employee's spouse or minor child.", "The \"impartiality\" required of a federal employee in a matter thus does not mean that every federal employee must be completely \"neutral\" on an issue or matter before him or her, in the sense that the employee has no personal opinion, view, position, or predilection on a matter based on noneconomic \"interests\" and factors such as the ethical, religious, ideological, or political beliefs in the background or in the current outside affiliations of the employee. In the specific regulations on \"impartiality\" and participation in outside organizations, the Office of Government Ethics notes: \"Nothing in this section shall be construed to suggest that an employee should not participate in a matter because of his political, religious or moral views.\" Executive branch employees\u2014whose duties involve generally administration, enforcement, or regulation\u2014are not held to the strict neutrality standard applicable to federal judges and to those involved in adjudications or quasi-adjudicatory functions. As a federal court has noted, \"We must not impose judicial roles upon administrators when they perform functions very different from those of judges.\" The Supreme Court has recognized that the Due Process Clause which imposes \"rigid\" neutrality requirements \"designed for officials performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions, are not applicable\" to officials performing different, executive and administrative duties.", "There are several methods by which conflicts of interest for public employees may be regulated and avoided.

The regulations of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) state that an employee must recuse himself or herself if the governmental matter \"will have a direct and predictable effect\" on those covered financial interests. OGE explains that a matter will have a direct effect on a financial interest \"if there is a close causal link between any decision or action to be taken in the matter and any expected effect,\" that is, if the \"chain of causation\" is neither \"attenuated\" nor \"contingent upon the occurrence of events that are speculative or that are independent of, and unrelated to, the matter.\"", "The financial interests of businesses and outside private entities with which an employee is associated (as an \"officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee\" of such organization) are among those interests which are imputed to the employee for disqualification purposes. However, the participation by an employee in or association with an outside non-profit organization which has an advocacy interest in public policy matters, even concerning public policy matters associated and connected with one's agency, does not necessarily raise a \"conflict of interest\" disqualification requirement. This is because it is only \"financial\" interests that are regulated and affected by the disqualification statute, and it has been determined that a non-profit, advocacy organization's \"financial interests\" are not generally directly or predictably affected by the attainment or non-attainment of public policy goals.", "The disqualification requirement of \u00a7 208 applies only to current and existing financial and economic factors.

The statutory language is thus stated in the present tense and is directed only to current financial interests and existing arrangements or current understandings for future employment, and the statutory provision does not require disqualification on a matter because of a past affiliation or previous economic interest.

However, regulations adopted by the Office of Government Ethics note that personal participation \"includes the direct and active supervision of the participation of a subordinate in the matter.\" The qualifier \"substantially\" would appear to rule out merely \"ministerial\" or procedural acts or acts on a peripheral matter, and relates to the significance and nature of the involvement, and not merely the time devoted to the matter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Particular Matter", "paragraphs": ["The personal participation by an official in a governmental matter, such as giving advice or making recommendations, will come within the statute when such involvement is in regard to a \"particular matter,\" rather than just merely in relation to a general area of public policy, such as \"in relation to economics.\" The term \"particular matter\" and the enumeration of those particular matters in the statute have been recognized to be \"comprehensive of all matters that come before a federal department or agency.\" Since, for the statutory disqualification requirement, the \"particular matter\" need not involve specific or identified parties, such term has been broadly interpreted to mean any \"discrete and identifiable matter\" such as \"general rulemaking\" or proposed regulations. As stated by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, the restrictions of \u00a7 208 will apply when a federal official reviews proposed rules that will impact an entire industry of which a firm connected to the federal official is part, and need not affect or deal with only that particular firm to come within the restrictions of \u00a7 208(a):", "[W]e have consistently interpreted \u00a7 208(a) to apply to rule-making proceedings or advisory committee deliberations of general applicability where the outcome may have a \"direct and predictable effect\" on a firm in which the Government employee is affiliated, even though all other firms similarly situated will be affected in a like manner.

There is no general requirement for a written or filed disqualification, unless such statement is required from an official to comply with a written \"ethics agreement\" with the Office of Government Ethics, or is required by the agency. It is suggested that an employee \"may elect to create a record\" of his actions concerning a disqualification, and so provide written statements.

The current Office of Government Ethics regulations exempt several such interests, including all interests in \"diversified\" mutual funds; interests in sector funds which include some companies affected by a governmental matter but where those companies are outside of the primary sector in which that fund specializes; and other sector funds specializing in the particular sector but where one's interest in the fund is no more than $50,000; securities, stocks, and bonds in a publicly traded company which is a party to and directly affected by a governmental matter if one's ownership value is no more than $15,000; securities, stocks, and bonds in such a company which is not a specific party to a matter but is in a class affected by the governmental matter, if the employee's ownership interest is no more than $25,000 (if securities in more than one such company are owned, then the aggregate value cannot exceed $50,000 to be exempt from the statute).", "Waivers may also be obtained by an individual employee for insubstantial financial interests under \u00a7 208(b)(1).

The regulation defines a \"covered relationship\" to be one with: those persons or entities with whom the employee seeks a business, contractual or other financial relationship; a member of the employee's household, or a relative with whom the employee has a close personal relationship; a person or entity with whom the employee's spouse, child, or parent is serving or seeks to serve as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, or employee; any person or entity for whom the employee served within the last year as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor or employee; or an organization (other than a political party) in which the employee is an active participant.", "Under the regulation, therefore, although the financial interests of persons or entities that may be imputed to the employee are broadened, the types of governmental \"matters\" from which an employee should recuse himself or herself are narrowed.

A particular matter \"involving specific parties\" is generally or typically a matter involving \"a specific proceeding affecting the legal rights of the parties or an isolatable transaction or related set of transactions between identifiable parties,\" as opposed to rulemaking, legislation, or the formulation of general policy or standards.

", "When divestiture is required for ethics reasons, a current employee should be afforded a \"reasonable amount of time\" to effectuate the disposal of the asset; furthermore, it is possible to ameliorate potential unfair tax burdens that may arise because of such required sale of an asset by receiving a certificate of divestiture and postponing capital gains taxes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Blind Trusts", "paragraphs": ["In some instances, the establishment of a \"qualified blind trust\" may be used to ameliorate or avoid conflicts of interest as an alternative to divestiture of conflicting assets. Although generally, the underlying assets in a trust in which one has a beneficial interest must normally be disclosed in annual public financial disclosure reports \u2014and would under conflict of interest law be considered \"financial interests\" of the employee/beneficiary for disqualification purposes\u2014federal officials may, as a conflict of interest avoidance measure, place certain assets with an independent trustee in what is called a \"qualified blind trust.\" ", "The nature of a \"blind trust,\" generally, is such that the official will have no control over, will receive no communications about, and will (eventually as existing assets are sold and new ones obtained by the trustee) have no knowledge of the identity of the specific assets held in the trust. As such, an official will not need to identify and disclose the particular assets in the corpus of a \"blind trust\" in future financial disclosure reports, and such assets will not be \"financial interests\" of the employee for disqualification purposes. The conflict of interest theory under which the blind trust provisions operate is that since the official will not know the identity of the specific assets in the trust, those assets and financial interests could not influence the official decisions and governmental duties of the reporting official, thus avoiding potential conflict of interest problems or appearances. Assets originally placed into the trust by the official will, of course, be known to that official, and therefore will continue to be \"financial interests\" of the public official for conflict of interest purposes until the trustee notifies the official \"that such asset has been disposed of, or has a value of less than $1,000.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}}
