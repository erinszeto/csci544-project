The VA also works with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide permanent supportive housing to homeless veterans through the HUD-VA Supported Housing Program (HUD-VASH). In the HUD-VASH program, HUD funds rental assistance through Section 8 vouchers while the VA provides supportive services. In addition, the VA and HUD have collaborated on a homelessness prevention demonstration program.", "Several issues regarding veterans and homelessness have become prominent, in part because of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. One issue is ending homelessness among veterans. In November 2009, the VA announced a plan to end homelessness within five years. Both the VA and HUD have taken steps to increase housing and services for homeless veterans. Funding for VA programs has increased in recent years (see Table 4), Congress has appropriated funds to increase available units of permanent supportive housing through the HUD-VASH program (see Table 5), and the number of veterans served in many programs has increased (see Table 6). Congress has appropriated a total of $575 million to support initial funding of HUD-VASH vouchers in each year from FY2008 through FY2015, enough to fund approximately 79,000 vouchers. Since the VA announced its plan, the HUD and VA point-in-time estimates of the number of veterans experiencing homelessness has fallen from 73,367 in 2009 to 47,725 in 2015 (see Table 1).", "Another issue is the concern that veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who are at risk of homelessness may not receive the services they need. In addition, concerns have arisen about the needs of female veterans, whose numbers are increasing. Women veterans face challenges that could contribute to their risks of homelessness. They are more likely to have experienced sexual trauma than women in the general population and are more likely than male veterans to be single parents. Historically, few homeless programs for veterans have had the facilities to provide separate accommodations for women and women with children.

These include the demolition of single room occupancy dwellings in so-called \"skid rows\" where transient single men lived, the decreased availability of affordable housing generally, the reduced need for seasonal unskilled labor, the reduced likelihood that relatives will accommodate homeless family members, the decreased value of public benefits, and changed admissions standards at mental hospitals. The increased visibility of homeless persons was due, in part, to the decriminalization of actions such as public drunkenness, loitering, and vagrancy.", "Homelessness occurs among families with children and single individuals, in rural communities as well as large urban cities, and for varying periods of time. Depending on circumstances, periods of homelessness may vary from days to years. Researchers have created three categories of homelessness based on the amount of time that individuals are homeless. First, transitionally homeless people are those who have one short stay in a homeless shelter before returning to permanent housing. In the second category, those who are episodically homeless frequently move in and out of homelessness but do not remain homeless for long periods of time. Third, chronically homeless individuals are those who are homeless continuously for a period of one year or have at least four episodes of homelessness in three years. Chronically homeless individuals often suffer from mental illness and/or substance use disorders.

In 2014, the VA office of General Counsel advised that VA GPD providers not serve homeless veterans unless they met eligibility criteria for VA health care (including length-of-service and character-of-discharge criteria). Similar guidance had been given to SSVF grantees. Previously, these criteria had not been required in determining eligibility for the GPD program, with the GPD program handbook basing eligibility on the definition of veteran and not further specifying length-of-service or character-of-discharge criteria.

The VA outlined six areas of focus for the new plan in its FY2011 budget justifications: (1) outreach and education, (2) treatment, (3) prevention, (4) housing and supportive services, (5) employment and benefits, and (6) community partnerships. In the FY2011 through FY2013 budget documents, the VA laid out plans to expand existing programs and to implement two new programs, the VA-HUD pilot to prevent veteran homelessness and the SSVF program. Since FY2009, VA obligations for targeted homeless veterans programs have increased from approximately $376 million to $1.5 billion in FY2014. During the same period, healthcare obligations for homeless veterans have increased from $2.5 billion to about $4.8 billion.", "In October 2015, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, HUD, and the VA released guidance on what it means for a community to end veteran homelessness. There are five criteria:", "the community has identified all veterans experiencing homelessness; the community provides shelter immediately to any veteran experiencing unsheltered homelessness who wants it; the community only provides service-intensive transitional housing in limited circumstances; the community has capacity to assist veterans to move swiftly into permanent housing; and the community has resources, plans, and system capacity in place should any veteran become homeless or be at risk of homelessness in the future.", "During the last several years, estimates of homeless veterans have fallen. The most recent point-in-time count of homeless veterans, from 2015, reported not-quite 48,000 homeless veterans, a reduction of more than 25,000 since 2009. (For more information, see the section of this report entitled \" Estimates of the Number of Homeless Veterans .\") ", "During this same time period, the need for permanent housing, as reported by homeless veterans and those who provide services, has also declined. The VA's annual \"Community Homelessness Assessment, Local Education and Networking Groups\" (CHALENG) report surveys homeless veterans, as well as government and community service providers, about the most pressing unmet needs among homeless veterans. Through FY2006, the highest priority unmet need according to all respondents in the CHALENG reports was long-term permanent housing. However, in the FY2007 report, permanent housing was the second-highest unmet need, behind child care. In FY2008 and FY2009, it fell to the fourth-highest unmet need, in FY2010, long-term housing was the ninth in the list of unmet needs for veterans, and in FY2011, it was 16 th on the list.", "One of the reasons that estimates of homeless veterans are declining and that the highest unmet need is no longer housing is an increasing emphasis on permanent supportive housing for veterans. The permanent supportive housing model promotes stability by ensuring that residents receive services tailored to their particular needs, including health care, counseling, employment assistance, help with financial matters, and assistance with other daily activities that might present challenges to a formerly homeless individual.", "Historically, homeless programs targeted to veterans did not provide permanent supportive housing (although veterans were eligible for housing through HUD's homeless programs). Instead, programs such as Grant and Per Diem offered transitional housing to help veterans become stable, find employment, and eventually transition to permanent housing. However, after leaving transitional housing, veterans competed with other needy groups\u2014including elderly residents, persons with disabilities, and families with young children\u2014for government assisted housing. With the advent of HUD-VASH (discussed earlier in this report), tens of thousands of units of permanent supportive housing funded through the federal government have been targeted to homeless veterans for the last seven fiscal years. Congress has appropriated $575 million for the program, an amount sufficient to fund 79,000 vouchers for one year. The additional Section 8 vouchers, as well as increased funding through VA program interventions (see Table 4 ), could be making a difference in the number of veterans experiencing homelessness. ", "In addition to funding increases, the numbers of veterans served in VA homeless programs have increased in the years since the plan was announced, as shown in Table 6 . In the year prior to the plan's announcement, about 118,000 veterans were served in DCHV, HCHV, CWT/TR, GPD, and HUD-VASH. By FY2013, the number had increased to nearly 223,000.

Approximately 1.76 million OEF/OIF/OND troops have been separated from active duty and become eligible for VA health benefits since 2003. If the experiences of the Vietnam War are any indication, the risk of becoming homeless continues for many years after service. One study found that after the Vietnam War, 76% of Vietnam era combat troops and 50% of non-combat troops who eventually became homeless reported that at least 10 years passed between the time they left military service and when they became homeless.", "A number of studies have examined the mental health status of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. According to one study of troops returning from Iraq published in the New England Journal of Medicine, between 15% and 17% screened positive for depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. Another study, conducted by the RAND Corporation, found that, of veterans surveyed, 14% reported screening positive for PTSD and 14% for major depression. Veterans returning from Iraq also appear to be seeking out mental health services at higher rates than veterans returning from other conflicts. Research has also found that the length and number of deployments of troops in Iraq result in greater risk of mental health problems. Access to VA health services could be a critical component of reintegration into the community for some veterans, and there is concern that returning veterans might not be aware of available VA health programs and services.", "The VA has multiple means of reaching out to injured veterans and veterans currently receiving treatment through the Department of Defense (DOD) to ensure that they know about VA health services and to help them make the transition from DOD to VA services.

The number of women veterans can be expected to grow commensurately.

A study of women veterans in the Los Angeles area compared homeless women veterans to women veterans who were housed and found that the characteristics most associated with homelessness were unemployment, having a disability, and being unmarried. Additional factors associated with homelessness were screening positive for PTSD, experiencing military sexual trauma, suffering from an anxiety disorder, and having fair or poor health. ", "Experts have found that female veterans report incidents of sexual assault that exceed rates reported in the general population. One study of all returning OEF/OIF veterans who used VA mental and/or primary health care found that 15.1% of female veterans reported experiencing sexual assault or harassment while in the military (referred to by the VA as military sexual trauma, MST). Another study of MST among homeless veterans who were using VHA care in FY2010 found that 39.1% of homeless women veterans experienced MST.", "In the two studies, women veterans who had experienced military sexual trauma were more likely than other veterans to have been diagnosed with a mental health conditions. In the study of returning OEF/OIF veterans, women veterans were more likely to have been diagnosed with depressive disorders, PTSD, anxiety disorders, alcohol and substance use disorders, and adjustment disorders. In particular, the relationship between military sexual trauma and PTSD among women was stronger than it was for men. In the study of homeless veterans, women veterans who had experienced MST were more likely than women veterans without a history of MST to have depressive disorders, PTSD, substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, personality disorders, and behaviors associated with suicide. These factors can increase the difficulty with which women veterans readjust to civilian life, and could be risk factors for homelessness (see earlier discussion in this report).", "Women veterans are estimated to make up a relatively small, but growing, proportion of the homeless veteran population. According to the 2012 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, homeless women veterans represented 8% of veterans living in shelter. As a result, programs serving homeless veterans may not have adequate facilities for female veterans at risk of homelessness, particularly transitional housing for women and women with children. In FY2010, 4.5% of individuals placed in Grant and Per Diem programs were women while 4.9% of veterans served in the Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans program in FY2010 were women. The program that serves the highest percentage of female veterans is HUD-VASH; approximately 11% of veterans who have received vouchers are women. ", "The need for assistance among younger women veterans, in particular, appears to be increasing. A report released by the VA about the risk and prevalence of homelessness among veterans noted the increased risk of homelessness among young, female veterans, and that intervention upon return from service and during the transition to civilian life could benefit this group. It is also noteworthy that child care was the highest unmet need reported by homeless veterans and service providers in four of the last five VA CHALENG reports (in the most recent CHALENG report, for FY2011, child care is the third-highest unmet need).", "In the 110 th Congress, the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-387 ) added a provision to the statute governing the Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans program requiring the Secretary to \"take appropriate actions to ensure that the domiciliary care programs of the Department are adequate, with respect to capacity and with respect to safety, to meet the needs of veterans who are women.\" In the 111 th Congress, the Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-275 ), signed into law on October 13, 2010, created an HVRP grant program specifically targeted to serve women veterans and veterans with children.
