The Department of Defense would likely be called upon to support both the international and domestic efforts. An analysis of the tasks assigned by the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan indicates that DOD's role during a flu pandemic would center on the following objectives: assisting in disease surveillance; assisting partner nations, particularly through military-to-military assistance; protecting and treating US forces and dependents; and providing support to civil authorities in the United States", "With respect to providing support to civil authorities in the United States, the types of defense support which would likely be in greatest demand during a flu pandemic include: providing disease surveillance and laboratory diagnostics; transporting response teams, vaccines, medical equipment, supplies, diagnostic devices, pharmaceuticals and blood products; treating patients; evacuating the ill and injured; processing and tracking patients; providing base and installation support to federal, state, local, and tribal agencies; controlling movement into and out of areas, or across borders, with affected populations; supporting law enforcement; supporting quarantine enforcement; restoring damaged public utilities; and providing mortuary services. Note, however, that DOD's ability to support these requests would be limited by its national defense and force protection responsibilities. The two principal ways in which defense support could be provided to civil authorities are by way of an \"immediate response,\" or in response to a formal \"request for assistance\" (RFA). Additionally, in extreme circumstances the federal government may expedite or suspend the RFA process and initiate a \"proactive federal response.\"", "National Guard personnel would almost certainly be involved in domestic response efforts as members of their state militia under the control of their governor. Current DOD plans do not anticipate federal mobilization of the National Guard or Reserves to respond to a flu pandemic. However, these plans could be modified if circumstances warranted it (for example, if the severity of the pandemic significantly exceeded DOD's planning assumptions). In the event such a federal mobilization is contemplated, an important consideration would be the impact it would have on any response efforts that were already occurring at the state and local levels.

While these statutes authorize the federal government to provide assistance, the manner in which the array of federal agencies provide that assistance in coordination with other levels of government, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector is guided by an executive branch planning document known as the National Response Framework (NRF). ", "The NRF \"is a guide to how the Nation conducts all-hazards response.\" Among other things, it establishes broad lines of authority for federal government agencies to prepare for and respond to any terrorist attack, major disaster, or other emergency (i.e., \"all-hazards\"). Under the NRF, the Secretary of State is responsible for \"managing international preparedness, response and recovery activities relating to domestic incidents and the protection of U.S. citizens and U.S. interests overseas.\" The Secretary of Homeland Security is \"the principal Federal official for domestic incident management...[and is] responsible for coordination of Federal resources utilized in the prevention of, preparation for, response to, and recovery from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies.\" However, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) \"leads all Federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies and incidents covered by the NRF.\" Given the centrality of public health and medical response during a flu pandemic, HHS would be the primary response agency for the domestic response, even while DHS coordinates the overall domestic response effort. ", "The role of the Department of Defense (DoD) in supporting domestic response efforts under the NRF is potentially significant, while recognizing certain limits due to the Department's principal mission of national defense:", "The primary mission of the Department of Defense (DOD) and its components is national defense. Because of this critical role, resources are committed after approval by the Secretary of Defense or at the direction of the President. Many DOD components and agencies are authorized to respond to save lives, protect property and the environment, and mitigate human suffering under imminently serious conditions, as well as to provide support under their separate established authorities, as appropriate. The provision of defense support is evaluated by its legality, lethality, risk, cost, appropriateness, and impact on readiness. When Federal military and civilian personnel and resources are authorized to support civil authorities, command of those forces will remain with the Secretary of Defense. DOD elements in the incident area of operations and National Guard forces under the command of a Governor will coordinate closely with response organizations at all levels.", "A more thorough discussion of the types of support DoD might be called upon to provide to civil authorities, and the process whereby such support can be requested, occurs later in this report.

It is based on three \"pillars\": preparedness and communications; surveillance and detection; and response and containment. A related document, the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan ( hereafter Implementation Plan) , details the specific actions and policy decisions which will be needed to execute this strategy and bring all the resources of the federal government to bear in a coordinated manner. Like the NRF, it affirms that the Secretary of State would be responsible for the coordination of the international response, the Secretary of Homeland Security would have overall responsibility for the federal government's response to a pandemic, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be responsible for the \"overall coordination of the public health and medical emergency response during a pandemic....\" It describes the role to the Secretary of Defense as follows: ", "The Secretary of Defense will be responsible for protecting American interests at home and abroad.

DoD conducts continuous worldwide influenza surveillance at domestic laboratories as well as at military installations around the world. More than a dozen different DOD entities cooperate with each other, foreign militaries, and some nonmilitary organizations in a complex arrangement that allows global surveillance of emerging infections. International cooperation is important due to the rapid transmission of disease made possible by high levels of global travel. DOD policy is designed to provide for detection capabilities at the lowest possible organizational level. The Institute of Medicine reviewed DOD's global influenza surveillance network in 2007 and issued a mainly favorable assessment, although the Implementation P lan required the Department of Defense to improve its capacity to detect and monitor new influenza strains, and to enhance its ability to share information with international organizations and agencies.

Examples of this type of assistance include assessing the preparedness and response plans of foreign militaries, validating these response plans with military-to-military exercises, conducting training programs to improve military infection control and case management, and assessing the capacity of foreign military labs and response teams. The Implementation Plan also directed DoD to support the Department of State in providing U.S. response capabilities to international response efforts.

For example, an influenza pandemic could conceivably render naval ships unable to perform missions, shut down training and support activities on major bases, seriously degrade security at critical sites, and break the supply chain that sustains forward deployed forces. The Implementation Plan states:", "The primary responsibility of DOD is to preserve national security by protecting American forces, maintaining operational readiness, and sustaining critical military missions.

DOD also reports that it has an 80-day supply of personal protective equipment (gowns, masks, and gloves) for medical providers. Although at this time there is no vaccine available for H1N1, DOD has policies and organizations, such the Army's Military Vaccine Agency (MILVAX), in place to issue vaccination policies and guidance and to coordinate with the Department of Health and Human Services in acquiring vaccines when they are available.

However, commanders using this authority are obligated to seek approval or authorization through their chain of command as soon as possible. It is therefore likely that this authority would only be used if the onset of a flu pandemic were abrupt and unanticipated.

The federal government has a number of broad statutory authorities it can use to assist state, local, and tribal governments in responding to such requests. This assistance typically takes the form of funding, personnel, equipment, supplies, services, facilities, information and technical assistance.

It carries out the DSCA missions approved by the Secretary of Defense with forces assigned as required from all the armed services, typically through the creation of a joint task force.
