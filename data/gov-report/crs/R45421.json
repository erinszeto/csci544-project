{"id": "R45421", "title": "Congressional Oversight of Intelligence: Background and Selected Options for Further Reform", "released_date": "2018-12-04T00:00:00", "summary": ["Prior to the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in 1976 and 1977, respectively, Congress did not take much interest in conducting oversight of the Intelligence Community (IC). The Subcommittees on the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the congressional Armed Services Committees had nominal oversight responsibility, though Congress generally trusted that IC could more or less regulate itself, conduct activities that complied with the law, were ethical, and shared a common understanding of national security priorities. Media reports in the 1970s of the CIA's domestic surveillance of Americans opposed to the war in Vietnam, in addition to the agency's activities relating to national elections in Chile, prompted Congress to change its approach. In 1975, Congress established two select committees to investigate intelligence activities, chaired by Senator Frank Church in the Senate (the \"Church Committee\"), and Representative Otis Pike in the House (the \"Pike Committee\").", "Following their creation, the Church and Pike committees' hearings revealed the possible extent of the abuse of authority by the IC and the potential need for permanent committee oversight focused solely on the IC and intelligence activities. SSCI and HPSCI oversight contributed substantially to Congress's work to legislate improvements to intelligence organization, programs, and processes and it enabled a more structured, routine relationship with intelligence agencies. On occasion this has resulted in Congress advocating on behalf of intelligence reform legislation that many agree has generally improved IC organization and performance. At other times, congressional oversight has been perceived as less helpful, delving into the details of programs and activities.", "Other congressional committees have cooperated with the HPSCI and SSCI in their oversight role since their establishment. Intelligence programs are often closely tied to foreign and defense policy, military operations, homeland security, cybersecurity, and law enforcement. Committees in both chambers for Foreign Affairs/Relations, Armed Services, Appropriations, Judiciary, and Homeland Security, therefore, share jurisdiction over intelligence. Some have suggested the current overlapping jurisdictions for oversight of the IC in Congress contribute to the perception of weak congressional intelligence committees that have relatively little authority and insufficient expertise. Others cite the overlapping responsibilities as a strength. Oversight of the IC spread over more committees can contribute to greater awareness and transparency in Congress of classified intelligence activities that are largely hidden from public view. They also claim that since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Senate, and House rules have changed to enable the congressional intelligence committees to have more authority and be more effective in carrying out their oversight responsibilities. Further reform, they argue, may be unrealistic from a political standpoint.", "An oft-cited observation of the Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (i.e., the 9-11 Commission) that congressional oversight of intelligence is \"dysfunctional\" continues to overshadow discussion of whether Congress has done enough. Does congressional oversight enable the IC to be more effective, better funded and organized, or does it burden agencies by the sheer volume of detailed inquiries into intelligence programs and related activities?", "A central question for Congress is: Could additional changes to the rules governing congressional oversight of intelligence enable Congress to more effectively fund programs, influence policy, and legislate improvements in intelligence standards, organization and process that would make the country safer?"], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["This report provides a review of congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community (IC) since establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), particularly since the 9-11 Commission published its recommendations in its 2004 report. It also explores selected options for further reform, and offers questions that Congress may consider to assess the effectiveness of its oversight. ", "In legislating, confirming appointees, authorizing programs and appropriating funds, Congress enables the IC, a community of seventeen discrete intelligence elements, to conduct the business of intelligence in support of United States national security. In addition, Congress has perspective that few others outside of the IC have. Oversight of the IC enables Congress to determine whether classified intelligence programs that are restricted from public disclosure are legal, ethical, and respectful of civil liberties. When there have been perceived abuses, Congress has often intervened to conduct hearings and legislate changes in intelligence process or organization. ", "Several competing, sometimes overlapping, perspectives exist on the purpose for conducting congressional oversight of the IC: ", "Some have argued that the primary responsibility of the intelligence committees is to provide the authority and strategic direction to enable continual improvement in the performance of intelligence programs in support of the most pressing national security challenges. Others have pointed to the role of the congressional intelligence committees in counterbalancing the power of the executive branch. This could result either through monitoring the IC as it implements programs and activities that support the executive's national security policies, or through ensuring that the IC is able to function independently of occasional instances of officials in the executive branch (including the president) choosing to politicize intelligence, or influence intelligence deliverables to support assumptions underlying policy decisions. This perspective holds that the IC must be able to exercise independence to be able to speak truth to power without abusing the power that that independence implies. Another perspective of the role of congressional oversight of the IC is that it serves as an external check on the power of the IC apart from the executive branch. This perspective draws from a perception of deep-seated biases inside the IC that proponents believe may be unethical, illegal, or resistant to executive policy. Each perspective may animate the thinking of various Members of the congressional intelligence committees at any given time. To the extent that Members share a perspective on oversight of the IC, they may be more likely to share views on the ways to conduct the oversight. Significant differences of opinion among Members on the purpose for conducting intelligence oversight, however, may signal a discordant tone in Congress's relations with the IC and hamper oversight efforts. Some believe that the intelligence committees' perceived tradition of bipartisanship and objectivity is of particular importance for effective oversight and a constructive relationship with the IC. Others, both within and outside of Congress, focus on what they perceive as weaknesses in the structure and authority of the congressional intelligence committees. While the IC has experienced significant reform over the past forty years since the establishment of the HPSCI and the SSCI, some have contended that Congress could do more to change the rules governing the committee structure and authority for conducting intelligence oversight. They note, for example, the number of committees that claim jurisdiction over intelligence matters dilutes the authority of the HPSCI and SSCI. Critics also note that despite to the diffusion of responsibility for oversight of intelligence in Congress, the growth of the IC\u2014in the size and number of its subordinate elements, as well as its budget\u2014has outstripped Congress's ability to provide adequate checks on the power of the executive or to develop the expertise and dedicate the time to strategically influence intelligence programs and policy.

Previously, the Subcommittees on the CIA of the Senate and House Committees on Armed Services exercised nominal oversight of the IC. However, they were viewed by many to be too close to the agencies they oversaw to be objective. Many in Congress came to believe that the legal and ethical abuses by IC agencies resulted in part from an attitude characterized by some as \"benign neglect\" among the committees that had jurisdiction over intelligence matters. Senator Frank Church described the situation in the 1970s saying, \"the Intelligence Community's immunity from congressional oversight had been a basic reason for the failures, inefficiencies and misdeeds of the past.\" The work of the Church and Pike committees, therefore, provided the first formal effort to understand the scope of the IC's illegal, and unethical intelligence activities.

This resolution to change committee rules was intended to increase the power of the SSCI as a select committee over its previous authority in relation to standing committees. S.Res. 445 , for example, gave the SSCI jurisdiction over reviewing, holding hearings, and reporting to the Senate floor presidential nominations of civilians for IC positions requiring Senate confirmation.

The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE) was established by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (P.L. 585, 60 Stat. 772-773). It had equal representation from the House and Senate. It was seen as largely bipartisan, fostered expertise among its members, influenced policy of the executive branch, and enabled more efficient oversight of matters under its jurisdiction. Unlike any other joint committee of Congress the JCAE also had the authority to report legislation to the floor of the House and Senate. Until its termination in 1977, it had been considered by many to be one of the most powerful committees in Congress. It was terminated, however, in part due to its having developed what was perceived as a conflict of interest as both a committee that could influence policy on atomic energy uses and the oversight body for the Atomic Energy Commission. ", "The idea of a joint committee for oversight of intelligence was first proposed by the U.S. Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government (the Second Hoover Commission ) in 1955. ", "During the same time frame Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana proposed a joint committee in 1955 and 1956 to provide oversight of the CIA. \"Until we create some sort of 'watchdog' committee,\" Mansfield said at the time, \"we will have nothing but continued anxiety about the Central Intelligence Agency and its widespread activities.\" Mansfield's joint committee would have had six members from each chamber, three from each of the subcommittees with responsibility for intelligence under the Appropriations and Armed Services committees. In 1963, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota proposed a \"Joint Committee on Foreign Information and Intelligence.\" ", "Those who support the idea of a joint committee suggest it would promote more bipartisan, streamlined, and efficient congressional oversight of the IC and, therefore, better relations with intelligence agencies. The 9/11 Commission suggested such a committee be modeled on the JCAE, and that the committee have authority to report legislation to the floor, subpoena power, no term limits, and a subcommittee dedicated to oversight. A single committee could also enable Congress to have a more focused, integrated perspective of intelligence programs and strengthen Congress's accountability of IC performance, advocates say. A more efficient oversight structure appeals to those who believe the IC is already burdened by the multiple layers of oversight outside of Congress (the ODNI, and agency IGs also exercise oversight of intelligence programs, for example). Advocates have also argued that a joint committee would allow for greater depth and understanding in Congress on intelligence matters and therefore provide greater transparency of the IC without compromising security. ", "Opponents have argued that a joint committee would not be as effective in conducting oversight as the existing structure of committees in each chamber. Concentrating oversight of intelligence among a smaller number in Congress could limit Congress's perspective of intelligence programs that support multiple departments across the government. They assess the JCAE was not as effective as proponents have claimed. A joint committee also might not have the same degree of influence in either chamber as the HPSCI and SSCI do separately. Critics believe that a weak joint committee would encourage other committees to reassert jurisdiction over intelligence programs and consequently pose a greater risk of leaks of classified information. They also believe that the current structure of overlapping committee assignments for SSCI and HPSCI members with Foreign Relations/Foreign Affairs, Appropriations, Armed Services and Judiciary enable members to develop expertise and assess intelligence programs in context of their relation to the national security priorities and defense programs they support.

They also believe it would improve integration of disparate IC agencies and enhance accountability of intelligence programs and managers to Congress.

Only the HPSCI has authorizations authority over the Military Intelligence Program (MIP), however. Senate rules allow the SSCI to provide informal recommendations on the MIP authorizations to the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) which has authorization authority over the entire Department of Defense budget including the MIP. In addition, House and Senate Appropriations, rather than the congressional intelligence committees, have jurisdiction over intelligence appropriations. Transfer of intelligence appropriations authority from the HAC-D and SAC-D to the HPSCI and SSCI, some maintain, would strengthen their understanding of intelligence programs and influence over intelligence policy. It could also enable a dedicated focus on intelligence programs that is impractical currently due to the time and emphasis spent on defense appropriations. Supporters of shifting appropriation authority to the intelligence committees, from the Defense Subcommittees of the Appropriations Committees, claim the latter are unable to give significant attention to the intelligence budget that represents approximately 11% of the annual national defense budget.

In addition, several of recommendations that the 9/11 Commission believed would be more easily accomplished through a consolidation of authorizations and appropriations were later achieved without changing the rules.

She further noted that \"History does suggest that there are game-changing junctures\u2026And in those game- changing junctures, what makes the difference is leadership of individuals, either members of Congress or the President, and engaging with a public to force change on a change-resistant system.\"", "Another observer noted a historical, oscillating pattern that ", "\u2026is rather desultory police patrolling by members of Congress for most of the time\u2026Not as energetic as one would like, until there is what I call 'a shock to the system,' and by that I mean a scandal of some kind\u2026or a terrible intelligence failure such as what preceded the 9/11 events. And when you have this 'shock,' then suddenly lawmakers become very energetic\u2026They go and conduct the investigation; and this has happened five times: It happened with the Church Committee; it happened with the Iran/Contra scandal; it happened with the Aldrich Ames counterintelligence case; it happened with the 9/11 mistakes that occurred; it happened with the wrong hypothesis about the WMDs in Iraq\u2026What concerns me is what happens in between these fires, and how we can avoid these fires in the first place.", "Critics characterize this change as \"tinkering , \" an approach against which the 9/11 Commission warned. Others view the cumulative change as enabling\u2014eventually\u2014functional, and politically pragmatic oversight of intelligence. Aside from what more might be done, a potential overarching question for Congress to frame the discussion is: Could additional changes to the rules governing congressional oversight of intelligence enable Congress to more effectively fund programs, influence policy, and legislate improvements in intelligence standards, organization, and process that would make the country safer?
