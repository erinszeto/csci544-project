DOD is responsible for water consumption on its own installations and in thesurrounding area. The Committee's markup would limit this responsibility to its own installations. Some may argue that the provision was unnecessary because a recent court case in Arizona alreadystruck down a far-reaching Fish and Wildlife Service opinion that would have made DODresponsible for use of water in the surrounding area. Some may also be concerned because theamendment could be seen as setting a precedent for exempting DOD from other environmentalprovisions as proposed by the Administration in a separate legislative package thisyear.

Section 2002 of Title 2 in the Senate version of H.R. 4775 provided that funds in the bill would not be availableto the President unless he designated all funds as \"emergency spending\" that were designated thatway in the bill. This \"all or none\"provision, which applied to all emergency funding except for thatprovided to the Department of Defense, was opposed by the Administration, and was not includedin the House bill. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended,provides that both the President and Congress must designate funding as emergency in order forthose monies to be exempt from budgetary ceilings. This provision would limit the President'sdiscretion to make those designations. A similar provision was proposed in the House andwithdrawn after protests from the Administration. (39) (See Table 4 and discussion above regardingthe outcome of this issue.)", "Senate Confirmation of Director of Homeland Security. S. 2551 included a provision (Chapter 11, Section 1102) thatrequired that within 30 days after enactment, the Administration must establish a position for aDirector for Homeland Security who would be confirmed by the Senate.", "Over the last several months, Senator Byrd has asked that Director of Homeland Security Tom Ridge testify before congressional committees. The Administration has rejected that request on thebasis that Tom Ridge is an advisor to the President within the White House, and hence is notrequired to testify before Congress. (40) The Housebill did not include this provision. This provisionbecame less controversial in light of the Administration's announcement of plans to create a newcabinet level Homeland Security agency. ", "Overall Spending Level. The Administration stated its concern about the overall level of the Senate bill that was above the Administration's request -by about $2.5 billion - and that the funding priorities differ substantially with that of the request. Although the Senate bill provided the same funding as requested by the Administration for defense,S. 2551 provided considerably more funding than requested for homeland defense (e.g. funding forfirst responders), as well as other areas (see Table A-2 and discussion below). TheAdministrationopposed the funding level in the Senate bill. ", "Funding Issues. In addition to these general provisions, and differences in the overall funding level, there were substantial differences in fundingfor particular agencies and programs (see Appendix A-1 and A-2 andindividual sections below) asdescribed below.", "Transportation Security Administration : S. 2551 provided $4.4 billion, as requested by the Administration, compared to $3.9 billion in the House bill.", "First Responders : S. 2551 included about $1 billion or twice as much as the Administration requested for various grants and programs located in both FEMA and the JusticeDepartment. ", "Port Security and Coast Guard : S. 2551 provided almost $1 billion for various port security efforts, well above that in the House bill or the Administrationrequest.", "Bioterrorism and Water Safety : the Senate bill provided additional funding for testing of drinking water systems ($100 million), and infectious disease programs (almost $400million) not in the Administration request or the House bill.", "Nuclear Safety : S. 2551 provided an additional $100 million for nuclear non proliferation efforts, and $200 million for improved security at nuclear labs in theU.S.", "Areas of Agreement. Both the House and Senate provided $450 million for election reform, though with differing provisions about implementation. And both houses added funds for assistance to Israel. Both houses also raised funding for highwaysand provided funding for Pell grants. The Administration requested an additional $1 billion forpayments to eligible veterans on May 21, reflecting an unanticipated draw down in the backlog ofclaims. Although only the Senate included the funding in their bill, this increase did not becomecontroversial because the funding was mandatory, i.e. required by existing law. ", "Senate Floor Action. On June 3 and June 4, the Senate debated S. 2551, substituting its version of the bill in H.R. 4775 as passed by the House. OnJune 4, the Senate adopted an amendment proposed by Senator Byrd that deleted a provision in thebill that would temporarily cap emergency loans provided in the wake of the terrorist attack to giverelief to airlines.

The Senate rejected anamendment proposed by Senators Gregg and Feingold that would set total spending limits for thenext 5 years, as well as re-institute various budget enforcement mechanisms to check spending thatlapse in 2002. Since both houses have not adopted a concurrent resolution on the budget forFY2003, there are no overall targets for spending for this or later years. In addition, Congress is nolonger subject to enforcement tools, such as pay go - which requires that changes to entitlementprograms that increase spending are offset - and sequestration - which require across-the-board cutsif budget ceilings are exceeded.

In addition, the Senate, like the House, added the American Servicemembers' Protection Act, an act originally proposed inthe 106th Congress intended to shield U.S. service members from being subject to the jurisdictionof the International Criminal Court. The proposed legislation prohibits the participation of U.S.service members in U.N. peacekeeping missions unless there are protections that would ensure thatthey would not be subject to the court.

(46) Although the Administrationstated that the additional funding in the Housebill for DOD - for paying the cost of activating reservists, and additional funding for spares anddepot maintenance - was not necessary, the House provided the funds on a \"contingent emergency\"basis, meaning that the President could decide whether to spend the monies. The other significantdifference in funding between the House and the Senate was the additional $3 billion for homelandsecurity activities in the Senate bill, including more spending for bioterrorism, preparednessactivities, and security enhancements (see section on policy priorities above). ", "Determining the overall difference in funding between the two bills was complicated by differences in scoring between OMB and CBO. Although the House reported the total for its billas $28.8 billion, if the bill was scored using CBO's numbers, the total would be $30.1 billion, a totalthat was closer to the Senate level, and above the Administration's request. Although Congressgenerally uses CBO's estimates, the House chose to use higher OMB estimates of savings for severaloffsets.", "Although the conferees reached agreement on a total spending level of $30.4 billion after returning from the July 4th recess, the Administration objected to that total and proposed a series ofdecreases in spending and offsets to reduce the total to $28.8 billion. That proposal was rejected byCongressional appropriators, in part because of concern that OMB's estimates overstated savings. (47) Although OMB's proposals for cuts in spending reduced the overall total, several members objected,and suggested that the Administration look elsewhere for savings, including some from last year'sEmergency Terrorism Response supplemental. (48)", "\"All or None\" Provision. The White House objected not only to the funding level in the Senate bill but also threatened to veto the bill if Section 2002 inthe Senate, the \"all or none\" provision, was included. That provision required that the Presidentdesignate as emergency spending all non-defense funding that is classified as \"contingentemergency\" spending in the bill in order to spend any of those funds. In other words, the Presidentwould not have the prerogative of spending only some of the \"contingent emergency\" spending aswould be the case in the House bill.", "According to the 1985 Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act as amended, both the President and Congress must agree that spending is emergency for those funds to be exempt frombudgetary controls over total spending. (49) (Thefinal year that those budgetary controls apply isFY2002.) If Section 2002 was adopted, however, the President would no longer have the prerogativeto select the spending that would be classed as emergency spending and, hence, not subject to budgetcontrols. All non-emergency spending must be offset by cuts in other programs or offsets. According to Senator Byrd, a similar provision was included in the 2001 Supplemental.

Some members suggested that the FY2002 supplemental should be the vehicle for Congress to adoptbudgetary controls on overall spending levels for FY2003 through FY2007 and for an increase in thedebt ceiling that is desired by the Administration. Ordinarily, those controls would be included ina concurrent budget resolution, but there appeared to be little prospect for passage. The House hadpassed a \"deeming\" resolution in the rule for H.R. 4775 that set levels that matched those in theirbudget resolution, but the Senate did not include any overall spending levels. (51)", "In comparing the concurrent budget resolution passed by the House and the resolution reported by the Senate Budget Committee, the two houses are $19 billion apart in the total allocated fordiscretionary spending in FY2003. Negotiations between the two houses and with the Administrationto resolve this issue are currently underway, however, so a compromise may be reached. (52) The twohouses could choose to adopt the higher level for non-defense spending on the Senate side byallocating $10 billion that the Administration requested be set aside for a contingency fund to coverthe cost of the war on terrorism in FY2003. (53) Ifthat solution is adopted, an FY2003 supplementalrequest for costs of the war would be needed. Reaching common overall totals for discretionaryspending in FY2003 would make it considerably easier for the two houses to resolve FY2003appropriations bills.

Before leaving for the July 4th recess, the House followed Senate actionand passed a freestanding $450 billion increase in the debt ceiling, eliminating this issue.", "Funding for Transportation. The House and the Senate were $2.3 billion apart in their recommended spending levels for the TransportationDepartment, with the Senate providing $7.4 billion and the House, $5.1 billion. Part of that total,however, reflected the inclusion by the House of a cap on emergency airline loans that was projectedto save $1.3 billion. The Senate eliminated that cap during floor action by a vote of 91 to 4. (54) Theremaining $1 billion difference between the houses reflected the Senate's proposal to add morefunding for the Coast Guard ($373 million) and to provide the full amount requested by theAdministration for aviation security rather than reducing the request ($550 million). Although bothhouses were dissatisfied with the Administration's presentation of its plans for aviation security, theSenate chose not to cut the request.", "Funding to Secure Nuclear Facilities and Materials. The Senate bill provided $328 million, some $80 million more than the House, to secure Departmentof Energy nuclear facilities and to safeguard nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union. Althoughthe goals were similar, each bill emphasized different security measures or locations (see TableA-2 ). ", "Policy Issues for Conference. Several significant policy issues needed to be resolved in conference.", "U.N. Family Planning Assistance. The Senate, but not the House, included language that would require the U.S. to release $34 million to the U.N.Population Fund (UNFPA) for family planning activities as long as the President found that Chinais not engaging in coercive family planning practices. Although the House bill initially includedsimilar language (but giving the President discretion about the funding level), that language wasdeleted on the floor.

The House and the Senate bill included different language governing a proposed new role for DOD in theadministration of up to $520 million in military assistance. Neither house adopted the broadlanguage proposed by the Administration. Although both houses would permit DOD to transfer upto $420 million to Pakistan, Jordan, or other cooperating nations for military and logistical supportto U.S. forces, the Senate bill placed control of those funds with the State Department, whereas theHouse bill made that DOD's prerogative. Moreover, only the House provided $100 million thatcould be used to reimburse foreign government for goods, services, or the use of facilities thatsupport U.S. operations in the fight against terrorism, language that was narrower than requested bythe Administration. The Senate bill did not include this provision (see Foreign Operations sectionbelow).", "Restrictions on DOD's Ability to Cancel the Crusader Program. Since early May when DOD announced that the Army's Crusaderartillery system would be cancelled, this issue has generated substantial controversy in Congress,with the White House threatening a veto of any bill that placed any statutory restrictions oncancellation. (55) In a June 20 letter to Senator Byrd,Chair of the Appropriations Committee, OMBDirector Mitch Daniels reiterates this position, stating that the President's senior advisors wouldrecommend a veto of the FY2002 supplemental if House report language that restricts his ability tocancel the Crusader artillery program is made statutory. (56) The House report directed that theSecretary of Defense \"shall take no action that would precipitously stop work on the Crusaderprogram until Congress had made a definitive judgment in legislation on the future of theprogram.\" (57) The Senate bill included no languageon this issue.

The House and the Senate differed not only in the amount of funding provided for grants to firstresponders (e.g. firefighters, rescue teams, emergency operations centers) but also in which agencyadministers those grants. The Administration requested that FEMA administer $327 million inequipment and training grants, as part of its traditional roles in disaster planning. The House andSenate provided funding for first responders not only to FEMA but also to the Department of Justice,which in recent years has administered grants for first responders in a law enforcement context. Some consider that reliance on the Justice Department is more appropriate for funding designed tocombat terrorism. This issue was considered in the context of the President's new proposal to foldFEMA into a new agency to combat terrorism. ", "Placement of Funding for Election Reform. The House and the Senate both provided $450 million for election reform, but the House temporarilylodged the funds in the Executive Office of the President and the Senate placed the funds in theJustice Department.

DOD contends that funding flexibility is needed because of the uncertainties ofevents in the next several months.

DOD's request did not explicitly provide an estimate of total cost to continue the war in Afghanistan inFY2002. DOD did, however, estimate that the cost of military deployments will be $10.4 billion,of which $3.7 billion was provided in the first emergency supplemental. DOD's request for anadditional $6.7 billion reflected its belief that costs in the remainder of the year were likely to becomparable to those experienced in the first third. (61) This approach assumed that despite the defeatof the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, military operations by U.S. forces would continue to requireabout the same resources. (62) Based on thisconservative approach, DOD estimated that wartimemilitary operations in 2002 would cost about $865 million per month. (63)", "That cost for military deployments included the resources to deploy and support units and their equipment, to operate equipment at a higher operating tempo to carry out wartime operations, torotate deployed forces between stateside and overseas, to pay active duty forces at higher levels, andto repair and replace equipment damaged or destroyed in combat. DOD's deployment cost did notinclude the expense of activating reservists supporting Afghan operations or the cost of replacingmunitions expended during the war.", "According to a recent estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office that uses these categories and relies on actual cost data from operations as well as DOD's experience in otheroperations, the cost of the war in Afghanistan in the second half of FY2002 will be about $750million per month, about 75% of CBO's estimated cost for the first half of the year. CBO's lowercost estimate for the second half of the year reflects the recent withdrawal of naval forces, lowermunitions usage, and the absence of certain one-time costs incurred at the beginning of the conflict. (64) If the number of forces remained the same but the pace of operations slowed, CBO estimates thatthe monthly cost of the war would drop to about $600 million per month.

If DOD's figures are adjusted to be comparable to those used byCBO, DOD's estimate of the total cost of the war for the year would be about $12.4 billion ratherthan the $10.2 billion assumed by CBO, a $2.2 billion difference. (66)", "Mobilizing Reservists. The second largest piece of DOD's FY2002 supplemental request was $4.1 billion to pay for the cost of activated reservistsfor the last eight months of the year. (DOD's request assumed that $1 billion was provided in thefirst emergency supplemental. (67) ) That proposalgenerated concern in Congress among someMembers who believe that this amount may not be adequate to fund the reservists currently on activeduty. (68)", "According to DOD, the $4.1 billion in its request assumed a level of 80,000 reservists for the remainder of the year, a number that is close to the 81,235 reservists currently on active duty. (69) DODassumed that the number of reservists would fall in the latter part of the year as the frequency ofcombat air patrols on the east and west coast - carried out primarily by Air Force reservists - isreduced and as the services trim the number of activated reservists who are currently carrying outguard duty at stateside military installations.", "Although DOD did not provide definitive information about the tasks that reservists are performing, it appears that many of the reservists activated by the services are being used as guardsat U.S. military installations, reflecting the heightened concerns of the military in the wake of theterrorist attacks. Some have suggested that the number of guards could be reduced as DODcompletes security enhancements for bases - such as more fences and barriers - for which $1.6billion was allocated in the first emergency supplemental. DOD could also reduce the cost by usingcivilian rather than military to perform these duties. In fact, DOD has requested lifting the currentstatutory provision on contracting out security duty functions in the 2002 supplemental in order topermit DOD to use private guards who would be considerably less costly than the $66,000 per personcost of relying on activated reservists. (70)", "In its regular FY2003 budget, DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to improve physical security at military installations but has not specified whether reservists would continue to be usedas guards at military installations (see Table 3 above). If that request is approved, DOD wouldreceive a total of $3.9 billion over two years for additional physical security at bases.", "Increasing Munitions Stockpiles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Another major DOD initiative begun in the first emergency supplementalwas to expand current industrial capacity to produce precision-guided or \"smart munitions,\"particularly, the weapon of choice in Afghanistan - the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). DOD requested $4 billion for weapons and munitions in the ETR, the FY2002 supplemental and theFY2003 request, including the funding for JDAMs (see Table 5 ). This category funds not onlysmart munitions but also replacement and an increase in the number of Global Hawk (unmanned airvehicles - UAVs) and Predators (armed UAVs) that are being used for surveillance andreconnaissance in Afghanistan.", "Concerned that JDAMs were being consumed faster than they could be replaced, DOD requested and received funding to increase the current productive capacity of about 1,500 per month.According to DOD, the additional funding requested in the FY2002 supplemental \"will allow theJDAM production rate to increase in a more orderly manner,\" will achieve the new, higher deliveryrate of 2,800 missiles per month in August 2003 rather than July 2004, and will purchase anadditional 17,900 missiles. (71)", "Although some have questioned whether the plan to double productive capacity this quickly is realistic, apparently the military leadership were convinced by the manufacturers that a doubling ofcapacity in about a year is possible. Any expansion will be dependent on both the level and timingof funding. The high expenditure rates for JDAMs that were experienced in the early part of the war,which generated such concern among the military, may also have fallen in more recent months asthe nature of the war has shifted towards surveillance rather than combat.", "DOD's FY2002 request for weapons and munitions also included replacing one Global Hawk UAV and two sensor packages, and accelerating the production of Predator UAVs to two vehiclesper month. (72) DOD also plans to purchaseadditional UAVs with funds provided in the firstemergency supplemental, and with funds requested in the FY2003 budget. (73)", "Command, Control, Communications, and Classified Programs. If the levels requested in the FY2002 supplemental and the FY2003budget request are approved, DOD would receive an additional $11.2 billion in command, control,communications, and classified programs to combat terrorism. (These funds would be in additionto the $33.6 billion in the 2000 budget before the buildup to combat terrorism. (74) ) There is littlevisibility on most of this request because many of the programs are classified. For example, of the$1.5 billion requested in the FY2002 supplemental, $1.4 billion is for classified programs. Similarly,there is no unclassified information on the FY2003 request of $3.1 billion, which includes $2.6billion for classified programs, and $540 million for continuity of operations, that is, for plans toprotect key government personnel and facilities in case of attack.", "Coalition Support. DOD's FY2002 request also included up to $550 million that DOD could distribute to countries who aid the U.S. in the \"war onterrorism,\" including $420 million for those countries who provide military and logistical support,indigenous forces who support the U.S., and other foreign governments who fight terrorism.

Much of the $1.5 billion emergency aid already distributed focused on two areas:1) economic support to Afghanistan and neighboring countries in anticipation of food shortages,displacement and other social disruptions that would occur during the military campaign; and 2)efforts to stabilize the security and economic situation in Pakistan and demonstrate support forPresident Musharraf. By contrast, the proposed $1.28 billion supplemental would distributeadditional economic and military assistance among 23 countries in all regions of the world.", "When the Administration announced its FY2003 budget request in early February, officials said that amounts for Afghan reconstruction needs beyond 2002 would be added to the request later,though a decision about whether to seek supplemental foreign aid this year had not been reached.

Moreoften, Congress prefers to waive specific legislative constraints rather than approvingacross-the-board waivers.

Congressional concern paralleled the languageincluded in the ETR, which called for not less than $20 billion to be \"allocated for disaster recoveryactivities and assistance related to the terrorist acts in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia onSeptember 11, 2001.\" (87)", "Combining the request for $5.5 billion for aid to New York in the FY2002 emergency supplemental with $5 billion in business tax credits for Lower Manhattan passed by the House inearly March, and funding already provided in the ETR, the Administration contends that New YorkCity would receive a total of $21.5 billion. (88) TheFY2002 emergency supplemental included $5.5billion in funding for aid to New York provided by FEMA disaster assistance, CommunityDevelopment block grants and transportation grants to rebuild mass transit, and roads. (89)", "FEMA Request. (90) Of the Administration's $3.1billion request for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), $2.75 billion, or 88%, wasfor the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) administered by FEMA. (91) That fund is used to help communitiesrecover from and rebuild after major disasters as designated by the President under the StaffordAct. (92) Combined with $6.6 billion allocated toFEMA in the first emergency supplemental, the totalfor disaster assistance would be $9 billion, a historic high for eligible costs. According to FEMA,most of the funds allocated to New York City in the first emergency supplemental were releasedwithin two months of the attack. (93)", "Some, however, contended that considerably more recovery assistance was needed. For example, a report issued by a partnership of economic development organizations in New York Cityreported that \"the city's economy will sustain a gross loss of approximately $83 billion due to theattack, including $30 billion in capital losses, $14 billion in cleanup and related costs and $39 billionin loss of economic output to the economy.\" (94) Only some of those types of costs, however, wouldbe eligible for FEMA funding. ", "The Stafford Act limits FEMA assistance to individuals and families, state and local governments, and non-profit organizations that provide essential services. Although some haveargued that the Stafford Act should be amended to authorize federal assistance to for-profitenterprises such as utilities and medical centers, others want to retain the current criteria, and relyon other federal programs to aid private corporations. ", "HUD Community Development Block Grants. (95) In order to meet the needs of utilities and other businesses - reportedly in need of millions of dollarsin assistance after the September attacks - the Administration's request included $750 million forthe Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program administered by the Department ofHousing and Urban Development (HUD). According to press reports, these funds were intendedprimarily to help Con Edison and Verizon rebuild their facilities. (96)", "One of the chief advantages of these grants is that state and other eligible local governments are given broad discretion and flexibility in the use of funds. Although the Community DevelopmentBlock grants program is designed to foster economic development and benefit primarily low- andmoderate-income persons, Congress has routinely waived specific programmatic requirements, andused the funds to support disaster recovery efforts, including assistance to Oklahoma City followingthe bombing of the Alfred Murrah Building, and to aid utilities affected by disasters, notably the icestorm that paralyzed much of New England in 1998. (97)", "Under the 2001 Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental, New York City received $2.7 billion in CDBG funding for disaster recovery activities that is to be administered by the LowerManhattan Development Corporation (LMDC). A non-profit corporation created to direct theredevelopment of the World Trade Center area, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation isto use those funds to assist individuals, non profits, and small businesses recover from economiclosses resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ", "The President's proposed FY2002 supplemental appropriations request would appropriate $750 million in additional CDBG assistance to be administered by the LMDC. These funds would be usedto rebuild utility infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the September 11, 2001 attacks, and toreimburse New York State and New York City's regular CDBG allocation for costs incurred inresponse to the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center. ", "Transportation Grant Funds. The Administration's FY2002 emergency supplemental included $1.8 billion to pay the costs ofrebuilding Manhattan's public mass transit that would not be covered by FEMA funds for disasterrecovery as well as $167 million to repair roads like the West side highway that are eligible forfederal funds. ", "FEMA funds can only be used to remove debris, and repair and replace subways and train stations, but not to redesign or modernize current systems as desired by New York officials. In ameeting with Members of Congress in mid-April, New York officials outlined a proposal tomodernize and rebuild the Lower Manhattan transportation system that would cost $7.3 billion. (98) Those plans could require using a mix of FEMA funds from those already available or the newrequest as well as tapping other sources in the FY2002 emergency supplemental. Congress facedsome pressure to add to or re-allocate funds included in the Administration's request to help NewYork City to carry out these plans.", "House Action on the Administration's New York City Request. Action taken by the House Appropriations Committee during its markup provided the full $5.5 billion in aid to New York City, as requested. The panel, however, allocated$175 million for first responder support to the Department of Justice rather than FEMA, as proposed. Initially, the Committee recommended that the money be managed by the Office of HomelandSecurity, but switched to the Justice Department after White House objections. No changes weremade on the House floor.", "Senate Action on Administration's New York City Request.
