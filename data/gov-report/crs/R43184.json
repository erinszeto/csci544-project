Over the next decade, in response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps. Some of these increases were quite substantial, particularly after FY2006, but Congress began reversing these increases in light of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011 and a drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan which began in 2012. In FY2013, the authorized end strength for the Army was 552,100, while the authorized end strength for the Marine Corps was 197,300. The Army has proposed reducing its personnel strength to 490,000 by FY2015 while the Marine Corps has proposed reducing its personnel strength to 175,000 by FY2017. End-strength for the Air Force and Navy has decreased since 2001. The authorized end strength for FY2013 was 329,460 for the Air Force and 322,700 for the Navy.", "Discussion: With the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and the ongoing drawdown in Afghanistan, the final bill included major reductions in Army (-32,100) and Marine Corps (-7,100) end strengths in comparison to their FY2013 authorized end strengths. It also slightly reduced the end strength for the Air Force (-1,860) while slightly increasing it for the Navy (+900). The figures in H.R. 1960, the Senate committee-reported bill ( S. 1197 ), and H.R. 3304 are identical to the Administration's proposal. Taken together, the final bill stipulates a total active duty end strength which is 40,160 lower than the FY2013 level, almost entirely due to reductions in the size of the Army and Marine Corps. However, both the Army and the Marine Corps finished FY2013 well below their authorized end strength levels. The Army's strength at the end of FY2013 was 532,043 (instead of the authorized 552,100) and the Marine Corps' was 195,848 (instead of the authorized 197,300).

Much of this can be attributed to the reduction in Navy Reserve strength during this period. There were also modest shifts in strength for some other components of the Selected Reserve. For comparative purposes, the authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves for FY2001 were as follows: Army National Guard (350,526), Army Reserve (205,300), Navy Reserve (88,900), Marine Corps Reserve (39,558), Air National Guard (108,022), Air Force Reserve (74,358), and Coast Guard Reserve (8,000). Between FY2001 and FY2013, the largest shifts in authorized end strength occurred in the Army National Guard (+7,674 or +2.2%), Coast Guard Reserve (+1,000 or +12.5%), Air Force Reserve (-3,478 or -4.7%), and Navy Reserve (-26,400 or -29.7%).

Section 1009 of Title 37 provides a permanent formula for an automatic annual increase in basic pay that is indexed to the annual increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The increase in basic pay for 2014 under this statutory formula would be 1.8%; however, Congress can pass a law to provide otherwise and the President asserts that he has authority under 37 USC 1009(e) to specify an alternative pay adjustment. The FY2014 President's Budget requested a 1.0% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula. According to the Department of Defense, this smaller increase would save \"$540 million in FY 2014 and nearly $3.5 billion through FY 2018.\" On August 30, 2013, the President sent a letter to Congress stating \"I have determined it is appropriate to exercise my authority under Section 1009(e) of title 37, United States Code, to set the 2014 monthly basic pay increase at 1.0 percent...The adjustments described above shall take effect on the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2014.\" ", "Discussion: The House-passed bill contained no provision to specify the rate of increase in basic pay, while the Senate committee-reported bill ( S. 1197 ) specified an increase of 1%. The final bill contained no provision regarding the rate of increase in basic pay. Normally, this would leave in place the statutory pay raise formula specified in 37 U.S.C. 1009, which equates to an increase of 1.8% on January 1, 2014. However, the President stated that he would direct a 1% pay raise under the authority of 37 USC 1009(e). Thus, basic pay for military personnel increased by 1% on January 1, 2014.

As specified in 10 U.S.C. 526, the number of general and flag officers (GO/FO) on active duty may not exceed the following as of October 1, 2013: 231 for the Army, 162 for the Navy, 198 for the Air Force, and 61 for the Marine Corps. In addition to these service-specific positions, the Secretary of Defense may designate up to 310 GO/FO for joint duty positions. Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary of Defense, at least 85 of these officers for these joint duty positions shall be Army officers, 61 from the Navy, 73 from the Air Force, and 21 from the Marine Corps.

", "Discussion: The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan resulted in a substantial expansion in the size of the Army and Marine Corps and in GO/FO authorizations. In 2001, there were 889 general and flag officers on active duty; 10 years later there were 971 (though DOD projects this figure to drop over the next few years). With the end of the war in Iraq, the ongoing drawdown in Afghanistan, and the substantial reductions in Army and Marine Corps strength that is underway, there has been growing interest in Congress to reduce the number of generals and admirals in the Armed Forces. Section 501 of the House bill would reduce current authorizations for GO/FO on active duty from 962 (effective October 1, 2013) to 937 (effective October 1, 2014). The Senate committee-reported bill ( S. 1197 ) contained no similar provision. The final bill included a provision requiring DOD to notify the House and Senate Armed Services of any proposed action to increase in Service or joint duty GO/FO above specified baselines, and wait 60 days after such notification before the proposed action can go into effect. It also establishes an annual reporting requirement on the number of GO/FO.", "Reference(s): For historical background on general and flag officer authorizations, see Library of Congress, Federal Research Division, \"General and Flag Officer Authorizations for the Active and Reserve Components: a Comparative and Historical Analysis,\" 2007.", "CRS Point of Contact: [author name scrubbed], x[phone number scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minimum Notification Requirements for Reserve Component Deployment or Cancellation of Deployment", "paragraphs": ["Background: Section 515 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 110-181 ) required the Secretaries of the military departments to provide advance notice to reservists who were going to be ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation for more than 30 days. The provision also specified that \"[i]n so far as is practicable, the notice shall be provided not less than 30 days before the mobilization date, but with a goal of 90 days before the mobilization date of a pending activation.\" The Secretary of Defense was granted fairly broad authority to waive or reduce this requirement, but has to submit a report to Congress detailing the reasons for the waiver or the reduction in certain circumstances. DOD policy, as contained in DOD Instruction 1235.12, provides that mobilization orders are normally to be approved 180 days before mobilization, but allows the Secretaries of the military departments to approve \"individual mobilization orders for emergent requirements and special capabilities provided that no less than 30 days' notification has been given....\" The policy also acknowledges that \"[i]n crisis situations, some RC forces may be required immediately\" and allows the Secretary of Defense to approve mobilizations with less than 30 days between mobilization order approval and the mobilization date. DOD policy also specifies that in the event of changes to operational requirements that alter the need for already notified reservists \"DOD Components will seek other missions for all RC units and members identified for mobilization\" and \"[t]he Military Services will identify and make efforts to mitigate individual hardships for RC units and members who have mobilized or are within 90 days of mobilization.\" Under DOD policy, reservists who wish to volunteer for duty in support of a contingency operation are able to waive the 30-day notification requirement of P.L. 110-181 . ", "Discussion: Although DOD policy provides for reserve notification prior to mobilization, there have been complaints when the shorter notification limits have been invoked. More recently, there was dissatisfaction when the Army elected to use active duty units to replace four Army National Guard units that had already been notified of mobilization in support of Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans Sahara and the Multinational Force Observer Task Force Sinai. The House provision sought to provide greater advance notice to reservists of deployments and changes to deployment orders, though the Service Secretaries would still have had the option of providing less than 120 days of notice coupled with a report to Congress justifying the decision. The Senate committee-reported bill ( S. 1197 ) contained a provision (Section 508) which would prohibit cancelling the deployment of certain reserve units unless the Secretary of Defense approved the cancelation in writing. The prohibition would affect reserve units within 180 days of their scheduled deployment, if the cancellation were due to the deployment of an active component unit in lieu of the reserve unit. Section 513 would have required the Secretary of Defense to notify the congressional defense committees and the governor concerned of any approved cancellations.

However, the Establishment Clause is meant to stop the government from endorsing a national religion, or favoring one religion over another. Actions taken must be carefully balanced to avoid being in violation of one of these Clauses. There are already sections in Title 10 under the Army, Navy, and Air Force that address chaplains' duties.

This instruction indicates that DOD places a high value on the rights of military personnel to practice their respective religions. There have been instances where military personnel have become upset because the chaplain closed the prayer at a mandatory ceremony, such as a deployment ceremony, with a specific religious remark, such as \"praise be Jesus.\" In February, an atheist soldier at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, TX, threatened the U.S. Army with a lawsuit because a chaplain allegedly prayed to the Heavenly Father during a secular event. However, no personnel are required to recognize the prayer, or participate in it (for example, they do not have to respond). Religious proselytizing is considered by some to be a prominent issue in the Armed Forces. Some believe it could destroy the bonds that keep soldiers together, which could be viewed as a national security threat. The ability for a chaplain to be able to close a prayer outside of a religious service may heighten the tension between soldiers and may worsen the problem.

The VOW Act made participation in TAP mandatory for nearly all separating military personnel and required that each TAP participant receive \"an individualized assessment of the various positions of civilian employment in the private sector for which such member may be qualified\" as a result of their military training. The core Transition GPS was implemented in November 2012 and optional tracks are expected to take place by the end of 2013.", "Discussion: Section 524 of the House bill would amend Section 1144 of Title 10, United States Code, by adding a provision requiring the TAP to provide information regarding disability-related employment and education protections for servicemembers. Section 524 would also add a new program requirement to instruct participants on the use of veterans' educational benefits, \"courses of post-secondary education appropriate for the member, courses of post-secondary education compatible with the member's educational goals, and instruction on how to finance the member's post-secondary education,\" and instruction on other veterans' benefits not later than April 1, 2015.

Prime Service Areas (PSAs) are geographic areas where TRICARE Prime is offered. PSAs were created to ensure medical readiness of the active duty force by augmenting the capability and capacity of military treatment facilities (MTFs). The affected areas are not close to existing MTFs and have never augmented care around MTF or Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) locations. This change is estimated to affect approximately 171,000 military retirees. Elimination of the TRICARE Prime option for these individuals means that they need to either use TRICARE Standard/Extra, obtain a waiver to use TRICARE Prime if within the limits of another PSA, or use some other form of health coverage (such as employer sponsored insurance).", "DOD had planned to make PSA reductions since 2007, when proposals were requested for the next generation of TRICARE contracts. DOD determined that existing PSAs be kept in place in all regions until October 1, 2013, to coincide with the deadline for annual TRICARE Prime enrollments and fee adjustments.", "Both TRICARE's general Prime enrollment policy (see TRICARE Operations Manual (TOM), Chapter 6, Section 1, para 9.0), as well as the guidance provided to the managed care support contractors and TRICARE beneficiaries as part of DOD's PSA reduction (see TOM, Chapter 27, Section 1), permitted beneficiaries who live outside of a T-3 PSA but within 100 miles of an available Primary Care Manager (whether civilian network or MTF) in a remaining PSA to execute a drive time waiver and apply for Prime enrollment. We are not aware any T-PSA beneficiary being denied re-enrollment in a remaining T-3 PSA from Jan-Oct 2013, but there could be some who were within 100 miles of a PCM, but that PCM's enrollment panel was at capacity. ", "Discussion : Section 701of the enacted bill requires DOD to ensure certain affected beneficiaries (specifically those that were disenrolled from TRICARE Prime on October 1, 2013 due to the PSA changes but that reside within 100 miles of a MTF) are provided the right to make a one-time election to continue their enrollment in Prime. Section 701 provides a guarantee that those within 100 miles of an MTF can continue their enrollment in Prime. DOD has stated that it will ensure these affected beneficiaries are informed of this statutory right and that a PCM in a remaining PSA is made available to any beneficiary who makes the one-time election per Section 701. DOD has stated that the existing enrollment policy that allowed a beneficiary to waive the drive-time standard and apply for Prime enrollment at a remaining PSA within 100 miles of a Primary Care Manager is not being changed and the beneficiaries who re-enrolled under that policy will not be dis-enrolled. Under this general enrollment policy, contractors are not required to establish sufficient network capacity and capability to grant enrollment to beneficiaries who reside outside of the PSA - enrollment for those individuals is based on availability/capacity and is not a matter of right.", "DOD's plans to eliminate TRICARE Prime coverage for certain PSAs would have been completely overridden by Section 711 of the House-passed bill. The initial House provision would have allowed individuals who were enrolled in TRICARE Prime in affected services areas to elect to remain in TRICARE Prime for as long as they reside in the affected service area. DOD would still, however, been able to prevent any new enrollments in TRICARE Prime in the affected areas. The Senate committee-reported bill ( S. 1197 ) contained no similar provision. The enacted provision limits the election opportunity to individuals who live within 100 miles of a military treatment facility (MTF). Such individuals, however, were already allowed to waive access standards and enroll in the Prime Service Area associated with the military treatment facility.", "Previously, Section 732 of the FY2013 NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit within 90 days to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report setting forth the policy of the Department of Defense on the future availability of TRICARE Prime for eligible beneficiaries in all TRICARE regions throughout the United States.
