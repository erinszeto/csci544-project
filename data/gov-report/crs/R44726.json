Member offices vary in their priorities, activities, and scope of constituent service, but most offices try to assist with certain requests when possible. Member offices have engaged in constituent service activities since the earliest Congresses. Depending on what the constituent is seeking, requests may be addressed by a Member's Washington, DC, office, or by a Member's district or state office.", "Many constituents contact congressional offices to initiate their own requests, but Members of Congress may also engage in outreach to let constituents know of the ways in which a Member office might be able to assist them. Members of Congress often post constituent service links on their official websites and may mention constituent services in newsletters, in other communications, or at events. These activities can help facilitate a lasting connection between Member offices and constituents, and they may also provide feedback for Members of Congress about how government programs or legislation are affecting a district or state.", "A congressional office is sometimes one of several places a constituent can turn to. Other programs, opportunities, or services may require a Member office to serve as an intermediary. Constituent service activities can be simple, like relaying contact information for a local federal office, or more complex, like providing internships or casework assistance. Limited office resources, along with House and Senate rules, may affect what level of assistance a congressional office is able to provide.", "This report provides an overview of common constituent services provided by Member offices, along with references to additional CRS products or other relevant resources.

Requests for assistance with Revolutionary War pensions and other matters led the House, in 1794, and the Senate, in 1816, to establish select committees for private claims. Today, many similar matters would be considered constituent service. ", "Often, constituents contact congressional offices and initiate requests. A constituent may contact a Member office requesting basic information about a government entity or process. Sometimes, a congressional office is one of several places a constituent can turn to. Other programs, opportunities, or services may require a Member office to serve as an intermediary.

Member offices will often post constituent service links on their official websites, or may mention available services in their newsletters or other constituent communications. Requests from constituents may also provide feedback for Members of Congress about how government programs are working and what issues could be addressed through formal oversight or legislation.

It tells you whether or not the legislation is doing what it is supposed to do.\" ", "The following sections provide a brief overview of many common constituent services provided by congressional offices.
