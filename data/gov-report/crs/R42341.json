Additionally, it has centered around guidance for conducting public-private competitions to determine whether federal employees, or contractor employees, should be selected to perform certain agency functions. The Administration of President George W. Bush, in particular, emphasized subjecting eligible agency functions to public-private competitions. Branding this policy, and related guidance, as competitive sourcing, the Bush Administration included it as one component of the President's Management Agenda.", "During the Administration of President Barack Obama, another strain, or facet, of sourcing policy surfaced. Labeled multi-sector workforce management by the Administration, it posits that federal agencies might be susceptible to overreliance on contractors, which could affect the ability of agencies to maintain control over their missions and operations. OMB's July 2009 memorandum provides guidance to agencies on how to manage their multi-sector workforces. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy's Policy Letter 11-01\u2014by providing a single, consistent definition of inherently governmental and guidance for identifying and managing inherently governmental functions, functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions, and critical functions\u2014complements the Administration's multi-sector workforce management policy. This letter was issued in September 2011.", "Congressional interest in sourcing policy, generally, has been evident for some time. For example, in 1998, the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act (P.L. 105-270) was signed into law. It requires certain federal agencies to compile, and submit annually to OMB, inventories of their commercial activities, which are activities that may be performed by federal employees or a government contractor. Recent signs of interest in sourcing policy include two substantively similar but identically titled bills that were introduced during the 112th Congress. H.R. 1474 and S. 785, the Freedom From Government Competition Act, contain provisions that would expand upon existing policies designed to encourage federal government reliance on the private sector for the provision of both goods and services.", "This report provides an overview of the evolution of federal sourcing policy to date and identifies the major policy issues before Congress.

Both federal employees and contractor employees have valid roles to play in performing the work of the federal government. This combined workforce is known as a blended workforce. Determining which sector will perform which functions, including determining when federal employee performance is, or should be, required can be challenging, however. Efforts to address this issue, and related questions, have been the subject of the federal government's sourcing policy since at least the 1950s.", "Sourcing policy is not so much a product of coordinated planning and implementation as it is an amalgamation of statutory provisions, policy letters, administrative directives, and guidance issued by various presidential administrations. Sourcing policy has been at the root of contentious debates, which may complicate the somewhat murky picture. This brief overview of the report is provided to assist in navigating the subject of sourcing policy.", "Sourcing policy encompasses two major strains. Delving into the history of sourcing policy is necessary for understanding the strain that emerged in the 1950s, and for providing context for the strain that emerged during President Barack Obama's Administration. The latter strain has not necessarily displaced, or replaced, the former strain, though it might not always be clear to outside observers what actions agencies are taking, or are expected to take. The complexity might be due, at least in part, to the ad hoc fashion in which sourcing policy has evolved and the mix of government documents involved.", "The strain that emerged first, with the issuance of three Bureau of the Budget (BOB) bulletins in the 1950s, emphasizes governmental reliance on the private sector for the provision of goods and services. An unwritten corollary of this strain of sourcing policy has been that certain functions performed by federal employees may be subjected to public-private competition. A competition determines whether the incumbent workforce would continue to perform the work, or the agency would award a contract to a private company to perform the work.", "Circular A-76, which was issued initially in 1966, continued this policy of governmental reliance on the private sector and provides guidance and procedures for carrying out public-private competitions. The Office of Management and Budget has published five revisions to the circular. The current circular (or revision) was released in May 2003. Generally, the term introduced by the Administration of President George W. Bush\u2014competitive sourcing\u2014is associated with this strain of sourcing policy.", "Throughout the history of sourcing policy, only certain functions have been eligible for public-private competitions. Beginning with the Bureau of the Budget bulletins published during the Eisenhower Administration, only agency functions identified as commercial may be subjected to public-private competitions. Any agency function designated as governmental (or, later, inherently governmental ) must be performed by federal employees. ", "With the continued emphasis on governmental reliance on the private sector finding expression in a \"[g]overnment policy [that] has favored contracting for goods and services rather than providing them in-house,\" the commercial/inherently governmental dichotomy and the focus on public-private competitions sufficed for a number of years. As the needs of the government expanded over the years, however, contracting for services grew, both in terms of the amount spent on contracts and the types of services provided by contractors. Notably, the federal government's short-term and long-term responses to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, involved a significant growth in service contracting. The federal government invaded Afghanistan and then Iraq; added a new department tasked with safeguarding the homeland; and embarked upon a raft of new initiatives and programs involving, for example, intelligence, transportation security, and cybersecurity. Determining who should do the work of the federal government became more challenging as, for example, certain practices were called into question (e.g., using companies to conduct passenger screening at airports); controversy swirled around some events that involved private security contractors (e.g., private security guards reportedly shot Iraqi civilians in 2007 ); and concerns surfaced that, in the rush to expand its capabilities, the federal government was at risk of having contractor employees perform inherently governmental work. ", "Thus, the second strain of sourcing policy that has emerged focuses on ensuring that the federal government has the best, or most appropriate, mix of federal employees and contractor employees. The Obama Administration, through guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget, refers to this strain as multi-sector workforce management. Unlike competitive sourcing, the multisector workforce management strain relies chiefly (though not entirely) on an expanded typology of functions and associated guidance to determine who\u2014federal employees or contractor employees\u2014should perform which agency functions. Additions to the existing typology (commercial functions and inherently governmental functions) are critical functions and functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions . According to the Obama Administration's guidance, multi-sector workforce management was devised to ensure that agencies' reliance on contractors is not excessive. Restated, this strain focuses on ensuring that agencies, not contractors, perform inherently governmental functions, and that agencies retain control over their mission and operations.", "This report begins with a history of sourcing policy that focuses on the terms commercial and inherently governmental , and the policy of government reliance on the private sector. The following section examines the two strains of sourcing policy: competitive sourcing and multi-sector workforce management.

Nor does this action signal a retreat from the Administration's commitment to a market-based government that is unafraid of competition, innovation, and choice. The deletion is simply meant to avoid a presumption that the government should not compete for work to meet its own needs. Such a suggestion conflicts with the Circular's main function of providing policies and procedures to determine the best service provider\u2014irrespective of the sector the provider represents.", "The justification for competitive sourcing found in the 2003 revision is based partly on market ideology and partly on financial considerations. It states, \"To ensure that the American people receive maximum value for their tax dollars, [agencies'] commercial activities should be subject to the forces of competition.\"", "Despite this difference from statements in previous versions of Circular A-76, the presumption in favor of private sector performance of commercial activities and a belief in the importance of the private sector as a rationale for competitive sourcing remain, at least for some.

For example, when considering insourcing a function, agencies are advised to place a lower priority on reviewing certain work performed by small businesses. Additionally, agencies are to apply the \"rule of two\" for work that remains in the private sector when \"part of [the] contracted function to be insourced is currently being performed by small and the large businesses.\" Small business goals might reinforce these considerations if agencies are reluctant to take steps that could compromise their ability to achieve those goals. OFPP also advises agencies on how to respond when they are unable to reestablish control of inherently governmental functions through other means and thus \"need to insource work on an accelerated basis.\" While termination of the contract is a possibility, OFPP also indicates it is possible to synchronize the insourcing with the non-exercise of an option period in the contract.", "Regarding contractor performance of critical functions that, the agency has determined, puts its internal control of mission and operations at risk, the policy letter does not mention accelerated insourcing as an option.
