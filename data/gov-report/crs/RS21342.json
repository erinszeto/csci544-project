The law weighs allocation of immigrant visas heavilytowards alienswith close family in the United States and, to a lesser extent, aliens who meet particular employment needs. Thediversity immigrantcategory was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by the Immigration Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-649 )to stimulate \"newseed\" immigration (i.e., to foster new, more varied, migration from other parts of the world). (1) The current diversity lottery began inFY1995 following three transitional years with temporary lotteries. (2)", "The diversity lottery makes 55,000 visas available annually to natives of countries from which immigrantadmissions were lower thana total of 50,000 over the preceding five years. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Bureau(USCIS) generatesthe formula for allocating visas according to the statutory specifications: visas are divided among six geographicregions according tothe relative populations of the regions, with their allocation weighted in favor of countries in regions that wereunder-representedamong immigrant admissions to the United States. The Act limits each country to 7%, or 3,850, of the visa limit,and provides thatNorthern Ireland be treated as a separate foreign state. Recipients of the visas become legal permanent residents(LPRs) of the UnitedStates.", "While the diversity lottery has not been directly amended since its enactment in 1990, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and CentralAmerican Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA) temporarily reduces the 55,000 annual ceiling by up to 5,000 visasannually. Beginning inFY1999, the diversity ceiling became 50,000 to offset immigrant visa numbers made available to certainunsuccessful asylum seekersfrom El Salvador, Guatemala, and formerly communist countries in Europe who are being granted LPR status underspecial rulesestablished by NACARA. While the offset is temporary, it is not clear how many years it will be in effect to handlethese adjustmentsof status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trends in Admission", "paragraphs": ["In FY2002, there were 42,829 persons actually admitted or adjusted as LPRs with diversity visas, according to the FY2002 USCISadmissions data. This number represents 4% of all LPRs in FY2002 and is comparable to FY2001, when 42,105diversity immigrantscomprised 3.9% of all LPRs. The top five countries in FY2002 (the latest year for which detailed data are available)were Albania,Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and the Ukraine.", "As Table 1 details, these five countries have consistently ranked among the top diversity visa sending countries, along withBangladesh, Bulgaria, Morocco, Romania, and Russia. Citizens of Ireland, Poland, and the former Soviet Unionwon the most visasin the mid-1990s, but their participation in the lottery has fallen in recent years. Albania ranks as the top sendingcountry for thisentire period, followed by Nigeria. The numbers for Russia and Ukraine may be understated because nationals whoqualified fromsome of the post-Soviet nations reported that they were born in the Soviet Union.", "Table 1.

African immigrants received38.1% of thediversity visas in contrast to 3.6% of the family-based and employment-based visas.

Any derivativebeneficiary must belisted on the petition when it is initially filed, and the derivative beneficiary visas are counted against the 50,000visa cap.
