The Defense ThreatReduction Agency's Weapons of Mass Destruction Terms of Reference Handbook defines a ballisticmissile as \"a missile that is guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight when thetrajectory that it follows is subject only to the external influences of gravity and atmospheric drag\"and a cruise missile as \"a long-range, low-flying guided missile that can be launched from air, sea,and land.\" Ballistic and cruise missile development and proliferation continue to pose a threat toU.S. national security interests both at home and abroad. Approximately 35 countries currentlypossess operational ballistic missiles of various ranges and approximately 25 countries haveoperational cruise missiles with a range greater than 150 km (90 miles). Some analysts considercruise missile proliferation to be of more concern than that of ballistic missile proliferation, primarilydue to their low threshold of use, availability, affordability, and accuracy. This report will beupdated annually.", "With the fall of Iraq and the voluntary termination of Libya's ballistic missile program, manyview North Korean and Iranian missile and WMD programs as the primary \"rogue nation\"long-range ballistic missile threat to U.S. national security. Russia and China continue to be the onlytwo countries that could conceivably attack the United States with intercontinental ballistic missilesarmed with nuclear weapons, but improved relationships with both countries have done a great dealto diminish this threat over past decades. India's and Pakistan's ongoing missile developmentprograms are viewed by many as highly aggressive and even provocative, but are generally viewedin a regional context as opposed to a direct threat to the United States. The renewal of dialoguebetween these two countries in an attempt to settle their disputes by diplomatic means may also helpin slowing proliferation as well as preventing their potential use in this region.", "The implications of ballistic and cruise missile proliferation to the United States hasnecessitated both nonproliferation and counterproliferation approaches in trying to stem thedevelopment, deployment, and export of missiles. Past Administrations have been characterized asnonproliferation-oriented by some analysts while the current Bush Administration is viewed by someas having abandoned traditional nonproliferation for a more action-oriented approach towardsmissile proliferation. Other experts have suggested that the United States must somehow find theright balance between missile nonproliferation and counterproliferation policies if meaningful,long-term progress is to be made. While some believe that missile proliferation can be \"rolled back\"by some combination of these approaches, others note that both ballistic and cruise missiles havebecome such an integral part of many countries' national security frameworks, that it is highlyunlikely that countries will abandon their programs in deference to U.S. pressure."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Foreign ballistic and cruise missiles pose a potential threat to the national security interestsof the United States.

Countries with a WMD missile capability have thepotential to influence the actions of other countries in their regions or even countries on anothercontinent and, in some cases, destroy population centers and national infrastructure. At the presenttime, the United States is within range of the ballistic missiles of Russia, China, and perhaps NorthKorea, as well as France and the United Kingdom. Several other countries have missiles withinrange of U.S. overseas facilities and interests. A number of countries are attempting to eitherprocure or develop longer-range ballistic missiles to accurately deliver WMDs over great distancesand many fear that one day such an attack may be launched against the United States by a regionalpower or rogue state where stringent political and military controls over these weapons are notexercised. ", "Estimates of the missile threat to the United States continue to be controversial for a numberof reasons. One is that many missile programs have moved underground and can also be hidden ina country's civilian space or aerospace industry, making it much harder for intelligence organizationsto track development. There is also some controversy still surrounding the 1995 NationalIntelligence Estimate and 1998's Report of the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threatto the United States ( P.L. 104-201 ) also known as the Rumsfeld Commission Report. Despitenumerous recent developments in missile programs world-wide, the Rumsfeld Commission Reportcontinues in 2005 to be the open source benchmark for missile proliferation. While there is stilldisagreement about the extent of the missile threat, the Bush Administration's unwaveringcommitment to ballistic missile defense has resulted in the deployment of ballistic missileinterceptors at Ft. Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. (1) ", "Estimates released by the U.S. Intelligence Community vary little from those issued in thelate 1990s by the Rumsfeld Committee. Iran is still assessed as being capable of developing anintercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) (2) capable of reaching the United States by 2015 (3) although in the1995 NationalIntelligence Estimate (NIE) most intelligence agencies believed that this could happen before 2015. The NIE also cites North Korea as posing an ICBM threat to the United States before 2015. Likewise, North Korea's ballistic missile development time lines may need to be re-evaluated as newmissile programs are apparently underway. While not posing a direct threat to the United States, theproliferation of shorter range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles has resulted in heightened regionaltensions in the Middle East, between India and Pakistan, and between China and Taiwan.

When a country has amissile production facility, its ability to produce large quantities of missiles is limited only by itsability to obtain certain critical materials and components. When a country acquires a large numberof missiles and launchers, it may be able to launch sustained attacks and to overwhelm missiledefense systems. Production and research facilities also enable these regional powers to enhance therange, accuracy, destructiveness, and missile defense penetration aids of their missiles. Anotherimportant factor is that countries with an indigenous missile production capability also avoid exportcontrol restrictions when trying to import missiles and missile technology from outside sources. Finally, once a country produces missiles it can consider exporting them as well as the productiontechnology to still more countries for financial, political, or ideological rewards.

(80) In termsof reliability, he suggests that the combined probability that a North Korean missile would both takeoff and then stage as intended was around 49 percent and that any hostile North Korean launchguaranteed an almost 100 percent retaliatory strike by the United States. (81) Hayes also maintains that\"the North Koreans are terrible at systems engineering,\" and that each new missile type becomes \"anew type of unknown operating characteristic\" suggesting that a North Korean missile attack mightlook like an \"uncontrolled fireworks display.\" (82) Although there are a variety of assessments as to the state andviability of North Korea's long-range missile program, some suggest that these missiles serve anotherpurpose. The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) offers the possibilitythat North Korea's longer range missiles are:", "designed more for bargaining leverage and trading forpolitical and economic benefits than for military use. In a sense, both are probably true - bydeveloping greater missile capabilities, North Korea can drive up the price for agreeing to restrainor abandon parts of its missile programme and at the same time be in a stronger position to test anddeploy such systems if negotiations fail. (83)", "Missile Proliferation. North Korea has beencalled \"the world's most prolific exporter of ballistic missiles and related equipment, materials andtechnology.\" (84) Overthe past 20 years, North Korea is credited with having sold several hundred Scuds and NoDongmissiles, components, related technologies, and production facilities, primarily to Middle Easterncountries such as Egypt, Iran, Syria, Libya, Pakistan, Yemen, and the United Arab Emirates. Thesemissile sales - possibly amounting to several hundred million dollars - constituted a significantportion of North Korea's hard currency earnings over the years and likely were also exchanged withIran for oil and with Pakistan for nuclear technology. There is speculation, however, that revenuesfrom missile sales have been declining in recent years as some of North Korea's traditionalcustomers, Iran for example, have developed an indigenous missile production capability and otherssuch as Yemen, Egypt, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates have been pressured by Washingtonto end their missile-related dealings with North Korea. ", "A Resumption of Ballistic Missile Test Flights? On March 3, 2005, NorthKorea announced a end to their 1999 self-imposed moratorium on test firing long-rangemissiles. (85) On May1, 2005, North Korea launched a short-ranged ballistic missile - believed to be an upgraded versionof a Soviet-era SS-21 - with a range of about 75 miles into the Sea of Japan, short of the Japanesecoast. (86) A similar testin April 2004 of an SS-21 reportedly failed and South Korean defense experts speculate the thisupgraded SS-21 has the capability to reach south of Seoul where U.S. military bases are to berelocated. (87) Whilesome do not expect that North Korea will test longer-range ballistic missiles such as 1998's TaepoDong missile test over the island of Japan due to the political fallout, the possibility exists that NorthKorea could conduct such a test if they feel that its nuclear or missile program is threatened byWestern pressure.

(89) ", "Iran's Space Program? On January 5, 2004, Iran'sDefense Minister reportedly announced that Iran would launch a satellite within the next 18months. (90) ", "Although this deadline has passed without a launch, some U.S. intelligence analysts remainconcerned that such a launch - likely involving a modified Shahab-3 missile - would not only elevateIran's stature but also serve as a \"Trojan Horse\" \"to help Iran develop both range and warheadimprovements to the already upgraded Shahab-3 under the cover of a civilian space program. (91) This upgraded Shabab-3,which was flight tested three to four times between July and October 2004, reportedly has a numberof modifications that suggest that this missile is being modified to accommodate a nuclearwarhead. (92) Theupgraded Shahab-3, with a more bulbous nose and up to 15% more propellant capacity, suggests a reentry vehicle similar to the Russian SS-9 ICBM. (93) Experts also maintain that this new configuration could facilitateadditional modification for the addition of a small solid propellant upper stage and satellitepayload. (94) This Shahabversion could therefore become a \"dual-use\" missile, thereby making it more difficult for intelligenceanalysts to separate ballistic missile development activities from space launch ones. ", "Nuclear Warhead Development. Iran isreportedly also developing a missile reentry vehicle containing a small nuclear warhead for use inits Shahab missiles. (95) U.S. officials, commenting after former Secretary of State Colin Powell's November 17, 2004,disclosure that Iran was developing nuclear warheads for its missiles, stated that the warhead is basedon an indigenous Iranian design and includes the \"physics package\" - the nuclear weaponscomponents designed to fit inside of the reentry vehicle. (96) The anonymous U.S. officials stated the information on Iranianwarhead development \"came from reliable intelligence sources\" and not from Iranian oppositiongroups that have provided unreliable information in the past. (97) Another report suggeststhat Iran is smuggling ceramic matrix composite (CMC) - a composite graphite material that, inaddition to a variety of commercial uses, is considered ideal for use as heat shields on missile reentryvehicles. (98) InternationalCMC trading for use in reentry vehicles and missile warheads is controlled under the MissileTechnology Control Regime -- a voluntary arrangement on the export of missiles and associatedtechnologies.

On May 31, 2005, Iranreportedly announced that it had successfully tested a new solid-fuel motor which could beincorporated into the upgraded Shahab-3, which is currently based on liquid-fuel technology. (100) If these claims are true,this could represent a significant breakthrough for Iran's ballistic missile program. Solidpropellant-based missiles, unlike liquid propellant ones, can be kept in storage for years, require lessmaintenance, and are generally more reliable and accurate. In addition, a solid propellant capabilityis generally considered a pre-requisite for developing longer range missiles. The maximum rangefor a single stage missile is approximately 2,000 kms and in order to achieve greater ranges, a twoor three stage missile is required. The in-flight separation and ignition of these additional stages are considered a very complex scientific and engineering processes and \"in order to maintain theaccuracy of the missile, it needs to be using solid fuel.\" (101) ", "Shahab 4/5? There has been a great deal ofspeculation surrounding upgraded versions of the Shahab 3 - the so-called Shahab-4/5. On October3, 2002, Iranian Brigadier General Ahmad Vahid, the chairman of the Iranian Aerospace IndustriesOrganization, told journalists that Iran \"had no plans to develop long-range missiles in order to strikethe United States, since the U.S. is not one of Iran's strategic defense targets and instead had orientedits ballistic missile development against its principal regional adversary - Israel.\" (102) Some believe that thisstatement suggests that Iran will not pursue specific Shahab-4/5 programs as the upgrdaed Shahab-3is capable of striking Israel and regional targets. One expert postulates that Iran's previouslydiscussed \"improved Shahab-3\" might in fact be Iran's way of developing more capable, longer rangeShahab missiles without hanging politically contentious Shahab-4 or 5 labels on such programs.
