Similarly, energy security has become a policy priority for the European Union (EU) and its 27 member states. The EU imports about 50% of its energy needs. Barring significant changes, the European Commission expects this figure to rise to 65% by 2030. About half of the EU's natural gas imports and 30% of its imported oil come from Russia. Europe's growing dependence on Russian energy, and long-term energy agreements between Russian firms and some European governments have fueled speculation that Moscow is using the \"energy weapon\" to try to influence European foreign and economic policy.", "The EU has traditionally exerted little if any influence over individual member state energy policy. However, in March 2007, in the face of increasing concern about Europe's reliance on Russian energy, and growing public pressure to address global climate change, EU member states agreed to forge an \"Energy Policy for Europe.\" They have agreed on a set of EU-wide targets\u2014some legally binding\u2014to increase the use of renewable energy, and reduce carbon emissions. However, member states continue to pursue divergent external energy policies, particularly toward Russia, and some European countries remain reluctant to cede national control over energy markets.", "The United States and Europe have steadily broadened the transatlantic energy dialogue to include joint promotion of collective energy security, energy efficiency and alternative energy sources. At the April 2007 U.S.-EU summit, leaders on both sides of the Atlantic agreed to advance cooperation to develop alternative and renewable energy technologies. However, U.S. officials have expressed concern at some European member states' unwillingness to exert more pressure on Russia to comply with EU market principles. On the other hand, European leaders appear increasingly frustrated with U.S. reluctance to pursue binding multilateral regulatory frameworks to reduce carbon emissions and promote energy efficiency.", "Members of Congress have expressed an interest in efforts to increase European energy security, particularly vis-a-vis Russia. In the first session of the 110th Congress, committees held hearings that touched on the issue of European energy dependence on Russia, and on European efforts to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy use. The second session of the 110th Congress may also hold hearings and pursue legislation on various aspects of EU energy policy.", "This report examines some of Europe's critical energy security challenges and EU efforts to coordinate a common European energy strategy. It also includes an overview of broader transatlantic energy security cooperation and will be updated as needed.

Although member state governments remain reluctant to cede national sovereignty over energy-security aspects of their foreign policies, they have set binding EU-wide targets for the use of renewable energies and biofuels, and have agreed to ambitious but non-binding energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction targets for the year 2020. In addition, member states are considering potentially significant reforms to further liberalize energy markets. Nonetheless, most observers expect member states to continue to retain significant national control over national energy markets and external relations with energy-producing countries. EU heads of State are set to discuss specific policy proposals in these areas at their spring 2008 summit.", "Europe's renewed interest in energy security has been influenced by both internal and external factors. Internally, steadily rising energy prices, declining European energy production and a fragmented internal energy market have contributed to anxieties over Europe's ability to meet future energy demand. The strain on global demand exerted by the emerging economies of countries such as China and India, persistent instability in energy producing regions, the threat of terrorist strikes against energy infrastructure, and Russia's apparent willingness to use its energy power for political ends, are all raising concerns in Europe over how to address external influences that could affect future energy requirements. Recent calls for EU-wide energy coordination have been driven by rising European concern about the effects of energy production and consumption on global climate change. To this end, EU member states' recent energy policy decisions center largely on promoting energy efficiency, developing renewable energy and clean fuel sources, and reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions.", "As uncertainties surrounding global energy supply and demand persist, issues pertaining to U.S., European, and global energy security are may gain importance in the second session of the 110 th Congress. Members of both parties have introduced legislation aimed at increasing energy independence and energy security and reducing carbon emissions. Several of these proposals envision carbon trading schemes similar to those in use in Europe. In several hearings during the first session of the 110 th Congress, Members of Congress voiced concern about Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources, and the potential for Russian manipulation of European energy markets. To this end, Senator Richard Lugar has raised the possibility of a more proactive role for NATO in guaranteeing energy security for Alliance members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Context of Europe's Energy Security Debate", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Collectively, EU member states import half of their energy needs.

Today, oil, natural gas, and coal account for 80% of the energy consumed in the EU.", "Europe's energy imports come primarily from Russia and the Middle East, where approximately 70% of global oil and gas supplies originate. Yet, the Middle East region is fraught with war, terrorism and politically unstable regimes. Iraq's oil production has not reached pre-war levels, and there is fear that terrorist groups could target pipelines and production facilities throughout the region. Iran has threatened to cut back oil production if forced to abandon its nuclear power program. With regard to Russia, recent political and economic behavior exhibited by Moscow has raised the dual specter of reliability and \"energy politics.\"", "High demand has also raised questions regarding the future availability of global oil and gas reserves. Although significant shortages are not projected for the next several decades, uncertainties over future exploration and production in areas such as Russia and the Middle East have also raised concerns about long-term supply availability. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that close to $16 trillion in new investments may be needed over the next 30 years to meet future global energy demand.", "European concern regarding the security of its energy supply was first prompted by the Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s. Specifically, the embargo highlighted three main issues. First, it exposed a need for increased energy policy collaboration among European countries and between Europe and the energy producing world. Second, it became clear that institutional mechanisms for increased coordination in the event of future supply disruptions were essential. Third, consensus emerged that Europe should prepare strategies to prevent it from becoming the victim of future attempts by exporting nations to use energy as a political or economic weapon. The 1974 creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which has become Europe's primary instrument for monitoring and analyzing world energy markets, was one response to the embargo. In addition, European countries sought to develop strategies to diversify energy supply.", "After the embargo, European countries began to identify Russia and other Eurasian countries as potential energy suppliers. At the time, Soviet Russia was beginning to realize its energy producing potential but required major investments in its energy sector. The prospect of future cooperation in the energy field began to play a key role in European perspectives on developing relations with the Soviet Union.", "In 1991, the European Union launched the Energy Charter Declaration, an initiative intended to promote energy cooperation and diversify Europe's energy supply. The Declaration gave way to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty that entered into legal force in 1998 and established a framework of rules and agreements to promote international energy cooperation. To date, 51 countries and the EU have signed or acceded to the Treaty. The Treaty seeks to create a level playing field of rules regarding the promotion of foreign energy investments; free trade in energy materials, products and equipment; freedom of energy transit through pipelines and grids; promoting energy efficiency; and providing mechanisms for addressing disputes.", "Since the signing of the Energy Charter Treaty, the European Commission has used its existing competency in competition and environment and consumer protection policy to attempt to shape a European energy policy in a variety of ways. These include promoting an internal gas and electricity market, encouraging the development of alternative energy supplies, and, in cooperation with the office of the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, pursuing a more cooperative approach to external relations with current and future energy suppliers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Turning Point", "paragraphs": ["A 2005 German-Russian gas pipeline agreement and more recent Russian manipulation of gas and oil flows to the European market have sparked a newfound sense of urgency among European leaders regarding the need for a more coordinated strategy. These events correspond with growing concern among the European public and political classes regarding the link between energy production and consumption and global climate change.", "In 2005, Germany and Russia agreed to build a gas pipeline connecting the countries under the Baltic Sea, the so-called North European Gas Pipeline (NEGP). While Germany maintains that the pipeline will significantly enhance German and therefore European energy supply and security, a number of EU member states, including Poland and Lithuania, have protested the decision. They counter that by running the pipeline under sea so it bypasses both countries, and that by failing to coordinate with EU neighbors when negotiating with Russia, Germany's actions pose a threat to their and broader European energy security. Furthermore, prominent Swedish officials have voiced concerns that the pipeline will provide Russia with a platform to increase both military surveillance and its military presence in the strategically important Baltic Sea. The German-Russian agreement and subsequent responses from Poland, Lithuania, and more recently, Sweden, have reignited calls for a more coordinated European energy strategy.", "As internal strife over the German pipeline decision continues, disputes between Russia and Ukraine and Russia and Belarus have exposed some undesirable consequences of European dependence on Russian energy resources. In late December 2005, Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, temporarily suspended gas flows to Ukraine as part of a dispute over gas price increases. Within hours of the shut off, several European countries, including Austria, Italy, Poland, and Germany, reported drops in their own pipeline pressure by as much as 30%. The gas crisis lasted only a few days, and after Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement on gas prices, gas was flowing again.", "An almost identical dispute between Russia and Belarus with similar consequences for European countries, particularly Germany, occurred in early January 2007. This time, Russian oil pipeline operator Transneft shut down the Druzhba oil pipeline through which Germany receives 20% of its oil imports. Germany and the EU sharply rebuked Russia's decision, and Russia resumed oil delivery after three days of price negotiations with Belarus.", "Many European observers have characterized the Russia-Ukraine and Russia-Belarus gas and oil crises as \"wake up\" calls exposing Europe's energy security vulnerability even to unintended supply disruptions. More importantly, however, the crises raised the dual questions of Russia's reliability as an energy partner and Moscow's willingness to use its energy power as a political weapon. In response, European leaders have advocated coordinating decisions on energy supply so as to present a unified front to producer nations like Russia, and have promoted energy efficiency and more efficient energy use. Despite these calls, some European countries and energy companies have continued to pursue long-term energy deals bilaterally. In the past year, companies from Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, and Serbia have signed contracts with Russian energy companies which some observers contend could pose a threat to collective European energy security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "European Energy Consumption: By the Numbers", "paragraphs": ["The EU's 27 member states account for approximately 17% of the world's total energy consumption. In 2005, about 80% of the energy consumed within the EU was from fossil fuels. Figure 1 provides an overview of the EU's energy consumption by fuel source.", "Europe imports about 50% of its total energy supply\u2014slightly over 80% of its oil and close to 57% of its natural gas. Its dependence on imported energy sources, particularly natural gas, is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades. Commission estimates suggest that if current trends continue, Europe will import 65% of its total energy requirements by 2030. Russia, Norway, the Middle East, and North Africa are the largest suppliers of EU energy. In 2005, Russia accounted for 45% of the EU's natural gas imports and about 29% of its oil imports.", "Forecasters predict that natural gas consumption in the EU will double over the next 25 years, and gas has rapidly become Europe's fuel of choice for power generation. European natural gas consumption currently represents 18% of world consumption. European gas imports are expected to reach slightly over 80% of total consumption by 2030. In 2004, EU member states and Norway accounted for just over half of the EU's natural gas supply. The other half was imported primarily from Russia (29%) and Algeria (13%). Several EU member states are totally dependent on Russian natural gas for their domestic energy consumption. Table 1 illustrates the levels of dependency on Russian natural gas in selected nations of the EU."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "An Energy Policy for Europe?", "paragraphs": ["Concern over Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources has corresponded with growing public calls for EU-wide action on climate change. European leaders have responded by renewing efforts to establish a more cohesive European energy policy. During their March 2007 summit, EU heads of state adopted a series of European Commission proposals that they expect will form the foundation of an \"Energy Policy for Europe.\" The adopted measures are among a larger group of recommendations the Commission laid out in a March 2006 \"Green Paper\" and more detailed action plans unveiled in January 2007 and 2008. The Commission proposals focus on three broad interconnected goals: increasing European-wide energy security; enhancing sustainability; and fostering competition in Europe's internal energy market. Commission officials place particular emphasis on the links between energy security, energy efficiency, and an EU-wide reduction in carbon emissions.", "In what some consider a reflection both of increasing public pressure to address global climate change and continued member state reluctance to cede national economic and foreign policy making authority, the EU's proposed energy policy focuses largely on enhancing sustainability. Member states have committed in principle to take some steps toward further liberalizing the EU-wide energy market and have broadly endorsed increased foreign policy coordination on securing energy supplies. However, the EU's most far-reaching commitments focus on increasing energy efficiency, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting the use of renewable energy and alternative fuels and associated technologies.", "Specifically, EU member states have committed to reducing total EU-wide carbon emissions by 20% compared with 1990 levels by 2020. They have also pledged to seek international agreement on a 30% reduction target by 2020 in a post-Kyoto Protocol international carbon emissions reduction treaty. In addition, the EU seeks a 20% increase in Europe-wide energy efficiency by 2020 and has mandated that 20% of all EU energy consumption come from renewable sources and 10% of transport fuel from biofuels by 2020. The Commission hopes that EU heads of state will agree on proposed country-specific targets to achieve their goals during the spring of 2008.", "European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso estimates that achieving these targets could cost or up to $87.7 billion, or 0.5% of EU member states' combined annual GDP. However, he has argued that this approximately $4.50 (3 euros) per week per European citizen represents far less than the cost of inaction. According to a March 2007 study by the global consulting firm McKinsey and Company, EU member states will need to invest approximately $1.5 trillion (1.1 trillion Euros) in new technologies over the next 14 years in order to achieve their targets. In preparation for the new push toward alternative and renewable energy sources, the European Investment Bank has announced plans to earmark slightly over $1 billion (800 million Euros) for loans for renewable energy projects from 2007-2010. In addition, the Commission envisions a 50% increase in EU-spending on carbon technology over the next seven years. Although the EU approach appears to be focused largely on developing new and alternative technologies, the McKinsey study suggests it may be more cost efficient for the EU to focus more of its efforts on reducing energy use than on developing and promoting alternative and renewable energy sources.", "The Russia-Ukraine and Russia-Belarus oil and gas crises have also ignited calls from the European Commission and several EU member states to increase foreign policy coordination to secure and diversify energy supply. To this end, EU member states have agreed to begin cooperating to form an external policy centered on expanding political partnerships with, and increasing pipeline and energy infrastructure investment in, producer and transit countries. European states have specifically singled out Central Asia and the Caspian and Black Sea areas as focal points for such activities. In addition, the EU has called for the formation of a European energy dialogue with African countries of strategic importance. The EU's flagship project in the Central Asia and the Caspian region is the Nabucco gas pipeline. The proposed pipeline, which is backed by a promise of $7 billion (5 billion euros) in European Commission funding, would bring Central Asian and Caspian gas to Europe, without passing through Russia. However, as discussed below, the potential construction start-date has been pushed back several years, and some observers question the project's viability.", "With regard to Russia, some member states hope to institutionalize a common commitment to market principles as outlined in the Energy Charter Treaty through an EU-Russia Energy Dialogue and in a new EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. However, bilateral energy agreements between some member states, notably Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria, and Russian firms, illuminate continued disagreement within the EU on how best to deal with Moscow. In the face of such discord, the European Commission is seeking to strengthen multilateral mechanisms, including the Energy Charter, to better coordinate global energy policy among consumer, transit, and producer nations.", "Many observers consider the European Commission's call to increase competition within and among traditionally protected European energy markets to be its most controversial. The Commission has advanced proposals to reduce the power of state-owned energy companies by forcing them to split up ownership of generation and distribution businesses. In the face of opposition from countries such as Germany, France, and Spain, the Commission could seek backing for a compromise proposal that would allow national energy industries to continue to operate both generation and distribution facilities, but would subject them to oversight from an independent European regulatory body. European leaders are expected to agree on a solution during the first half of 2008.", "Although European leaders increasingly pay lip-service to the need for enhanced energy cooperation, the success of an EU energy strategy will likely depend on the ability of member states to overcome differences in addressing three fundamental challenges. First, how to develop strong partnerships with energy producing and transit regions; second, how to use and further develop indigenous and alternative energy sources while seeking to curb overall consumption; and third, how to establish an internal system to provide dependable and secure energy supplies to all of Europe."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Challenge 1: An External Policy for Energy Security", "paragraphs": ["Growing energy demand within the EU's 27 member states is mirrored in regions throughout the world. Growth in China and India has added considerably to global demand, as has rising population growth and economic modernization in Latin America, Africa, and even the energy-rich Middle East. In the face of this strain on limited supplies, Europeans must compete for existing and new energy sources. Projections for European energy consumption indicate that one of the most important energy security challenges facing the EU over the next 20 years will be Europe's ability to diversify the sources and modes of transit of its energy imports.", "The bulk of the world's energy resources, located in Russia, the Caspian Sea region, the Middle East and North Africa, are all well within geographic reach of the European Union. In fact, Europe already receives energy supplies from each of these regions. However, Europe's growing dependence on Russia and Russia's apparent willingness to use its energy resources for political purposes have spurred calls from some member states and the United States for a more cohesive EU-wide strategy to further diversify supply. The key for Europe may be to determine the equilibrium point for supply from each region and how to best manage relations with the governments in those regions. By strengthening political relations with these governments, the EU opens additional options for its external energy strategy. According to some, the EU strategy in this regard differs from the stated aim of many U.S. politicians and Administration officials in that Europeans acknowledge they can never gain complete energy independence and therefore seek to better manage their energy dependence rather than achieve outright energy independence.", "EU member states have collectively endorsed the Commission's calls to develop a collective international energy policy. Nonetheless, while acknowledging that the EU may at times be in a better position to determine what leverage could be used to advance the collective interests of the Union as a whole, member states have been careful not to sacrifice their individual rights to independently pursue external relations to secure energy supplies. Europe's energy relations with Russia best elucidate the tension between calls for a collective external energy policy and support for individual member state policies. Some of the EU's newer member states in Central and Eastern Europe appear skeptical of Russia's reliability as an energy partner, and therefore call on EU member states work collectively to prevent Russia from exploiting long-term dependencies for political purposes. At the same time, other member states continue to pursue long-term bilateral supply contracts with Russia's state-run energy companies, increasing both their energy and, according to some, their political dependence on Russia."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Russia23", "paragraphs": ["Russia is a major player in world energy markets. In 2004, its 1,700 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas reserves were the largest of any country, making it both the world's largest gas producer and exporter. Russia is also the world's second largest oil exporter. According to the European Commission, EU member states imported 29% of their natural gas and 26% of their oil from Russia in 2004. With gas consumption expected to rise more dramatically than oil consumption in the future, some experts predict that Europe could rely on Russia for more than 40% of its natural gas by 2020. While Russia's resources and proximity to Europe make Euro-Russian collaboration a necessity, Russia's apparent willingness to use its energy wealth to achieve controversial foreign policy objectives has fueled debate within Europe on how best to manage energy relations with Russia.", "Most observers contend that Russian president Vladimir Putin views his country's vast energy resources as a tool to regain Russia's stature as a major force in global affairs. Thus, Putin sees energy as an important political force as much as it is the force driving Russia's economic development. Some experts believe that Russia seeks to control as much of Europe's energy infrastructure as possible in return for its delivery of reliable energy supplies. From this perspective, Moscow knows that if the EU is successful in creating a Europe-wide single market for electricity and gas, \"[Russia] will be presented with opportunities to become part of the world's largest and most integrated energy market right on its border.\" According to analyst Daniel Yergin, \"Putin believes that energy security is about [Russia's] retaking control of the 'commanding heights' of the energy industry and extending that control downstream....\"", "Energy's political importance is evident in the fact that the two major Russian energy giants, Gazprom and Rosneft, have close ties to the Kremlin and, in particular, to President Putin himself. Rosneft is led by a close associate and former KGB colleague of Putin. Gazprom is run by Alexey Miller, a close Putin ally, and Dimitry Medvedev, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister and Putin's choice to be his successor as president. Gazprom dominates the Russian gas sector and controls 100% of Russian gas flowing to the EU. Medvedev is expected to win March 2008 presidential elections.", "On the investment side, analysts also see Russia playing the political card. The International Energy Agency estimates that the Russian gas sector will require upwards of $10 billion in annual investment to meet future global demands. The EU has urged Russia to provide European energy companies the opportunity to invest in the total range of the energy sector from oil and gas fields to the pipeline system. Thus far, Russia has refused to meet EU demands and in turn, has warned the EU not to attempt to block Gazprom's plans to buy or invest in Europe's energy sector. Brushing aside the EU's policies regarding competition and monopoly practices, as well as the Energy Charter, Gazprom CEO Miller told EU Ambassadors in a not so veiled attempt to exert Russia's energy-driven influence that \"attempts to limit Gazprom's activities in the European market ... will not produce good results ... it is no coincidence that competition for energy resources is growing ... and it should not be forgotten that we [Gazprom] are actively seeking new markets such as China....\"", "Rather than rely on significant outside investment in its energy infrastructure, observers believe Russia intends to satisfy its long-term gas contracts with European nations through its near monopoly on gas from Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). Russia currently controls the overwhelming majority of oil and gas transportation routes from Central Asia and, according to analysts, intends to exploit this control and its political leverage over central Asian governments and European countries to impede European and U.S. efforts to develop alternative pipelines that bypass Russia. For example, critics of Gazprom activities, such as analyst Vladimir Socor, believe that Gazprom's strategy is to \"establish permanent control of the [Hungary/Balkans] markets before Caspian gas can reach them through the proposed Nabucco pipeline....\" Specifically, Socor and others point to Gazprom's proposed South Stream gas pipeline, intended to transport Caspian and Central Asian gas to Europe via an almost identical route as the EU's planned Nabucco pipeline. Deals struck between Gazprom and Italian, Bulgarian, and Serbian energy companies in 2007 and January 2008 appear to confirm the view that Gazprom may seek to convince nations that agreed to fund the Nabucco pipeline to withdraw their commitments and rely on the South Stream pipeline instead. These critics also warn that Russia's state-owned energy companies aim to increase their influence in the face of further European diversification by seeking to acquire controlling stakes in natural gas concerns in North Africa."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The European Response", "paragraphs": ["EU member states have established two primary institutional mechanisms with which to collectively address energy relations with Russia: the Energy Charter Treaty and the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue. As outlined above, the Energy Charter Treaty, which Russia has signed but not ratified, would oblige Russia to adopt a legal framework governing investment, transit, and trade in energy resources. Some analysts contend that European leaders should make Russian implementation of the Treaty a requirement of any future EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Such calls have contributed to delays in current negotiations of such an agreement and have hindered progress on the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue.", "Even as EU leadership in Brussels moves forward with its ideas on a common external energy strategy, many question how far individual member states will agree to push Russia (and Gazprom) to adopt the EU's principles of competition, open its energy sector to outside investment, and ratify the Energy Charter. Some believe that without such Russian concessions, Europe will ultimately find its energy security largely under Russian control. Indeed, several member states have pursued bilateral energy deals with Russia that will increase their dependence on Russia for years to come. Both Germany and Italy, the largest importers of Russian gas, have negotiated long-term deals with Russia to lock in future gas supplies. For Germany and a few others, \"Russia's role as a key supplier of oil and gas makes Putin a vital strategic partner who cannot be ignored or antagonized.\" Such deals are not limited to the major energy consumers. Slovenia and Belgium have entered into negotiations with Gazprom to build a pipeline across the former and to enter the gas distribution market in the latter. Hungary's oil and gas company, Mol, has joined with Gazprom to extend Gazprom's Blue Stream pipeline across the Black Sea through the Balkans into Hungary. In January 2008, Bulgaria signed a deal with Gazprom to join the proposed South Stream project.", "These examples of individual member states dealing with Russia bilaterally have drawn harsh criticism from other member states, such as Poland and the Baltic states. They have warned their European colleagues not to make energy deals that will give Russia an undue and possibly dangerous amount of political influence over European decision-making. Many of these nations understand that Europe's dependence on Russian energy is likely to last no matter what alternatives are included in an EU energy policy. But they also feel Europe does not gain real security by becoming more dependent on Russia. In fact, the growing presence of Gazprom throughout the European energy market has led many to worry about the EU's ability to develop an energy policy insulated from Gazprom's influence. In a July 2006 speech, Romania's President Basescu went so far as to warn that \"Europe's dependence on Russian gas monopoly Gazprom ... could be the biggest threat to the region since the former Soviet Union's army.\"", "Initial efforts to institutionalize an EU-Russia energy dialogue came to fruition in 2000 with the creation of the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue. However, results of the Dialogue have reportedly been mixed at best. Despite continued Russian reluctance to allow European investment in its energy sector and adopt energy market and transportation principles laid out in the Energy Charter, several European nations continue to enable increased Russian influence in their energy sectors. On the other hand, 2006 negotiations on a renewed Russia-EU partnership agreement were derailed due to Polish and other member state concerns regarding Russian intransigence in several areas, including energy cooperation. In the face of internal discord, the EU appears to have agreed to focus on achieving its energy goals with regard to enhancing sustainability, while Russia has shown few signs of deviating from its recent policies.", "The energy situation with Russia is not yet dire. Russia will continue to be Europe's primary energy supplier for the long-term, and healthy Russian-European relations remain a priority on both sides. If a common external EU energy security policy is to emerge, two options may be considered. First, Europe may move to curb its dependence on Russian energy by increasing its diversification to other regions without threatening Russia's own market security in Europe. In doing so, Europe might ask if there is a point at which Russia could decide that the EU's commitment to diversification no longer makes it financially attractive for Russia to continue to invest in new supplies destined for the European market. Second, the EU may attempt to regulate the behavior and practices of Gazprom as it becomes more of a dominant energy player in Europe. Thus far, few European countries have demonstrated restraint in seeking bilateral deals with the Russian monopoly that would do just that. If this continues, Europe could risk having Gazprom interfere more and more in its internal political decision-making. To avoid this, the European Union will likely continue to apply pressure on Gazprom to play by Europe's rules on competition and work to change Gazprom's corporate mentality by allowing European firms to invest in Russia's gas industry.", "According to some analysts, however, internal discord on how to approach Russia is preventing the EU from applying this kind of pressure. These critics argue that the EU could collectively pressure Russia by enforcing existing EU competition laws and even using Russia's prospective World Trade Organization (WTO) membership as leverage to open Russia's domestic energy sector to outside investment. On the other hand, countries such as Germany appear reluctant to take any concerted action that may antagonize Russia, citing the need for a healthy strategic partnership, given Euro-Russian mutual dependencies and the importance of Russian cooperation in addressing other issues of global concern, such as the Iranian nuclear program and the future status of Kosovo."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Central Asia and the Caspian / Black Sea Regions38", "paragraphs": ["One of the focal points of European energy diversification strategies is Central Asia and the Caspian and Black Sea regions.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the international community took an active interest in the region because of the potential oil and gas reserves thought to be located in at least six identified hydrocarbon fields beneath the Caspian Sea.", "Presently, the Caspian Sea region is a significant, but not major supplier of crude oil to world markets The untapped reserves held by four of these nations might offer Europe an opportunity to move away from increased dependence on Russian energy. Estimates of the Caspian Sea region's proven oil reserves range between 40 and 50 billion barrels. Production levels in 2005 were estimated to be around 2 million barrels per day. The Caspian Sea region's natural gas reserves are estimated at 232 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). Natural gas production in 2004 was approximately 5 Tcf.", "Europe's formal interest in the energy resources of the region dates back to 1995 with the creation of the Interstate Oil and Gas Transport to Europe program (Inogate), This EU initiative (currently with 21 member countries) was designed to promote the construction of regional pipeline systems in order to facilitate the transport of oil and gas to Europe. This was followed by another EU proposal, the \"Baku Initiative,\" which was launched in November 2004 with the participation of the European Commission and the Black Sea and Caspian littoral states. The Baku Initiative was designed to facilitate the progressive integration of the energy markets of the region into the EU market as well as the transportation of the extensive Caspian oil and gas resources toward Europe.", "At the time Inogate was formed, Russia dominated both oil and gas production and distribution in the region. Since most of the countries involved are landlocked, their oil and gas had to be transported via pipelines. Reflecting Soviet era dictates and infrastructure, nearly all Caspian crude oil traveled north or west via pipeline to or through Russia to European markets. Some oil also went by tanker through the Bosporus straits to Western European markets via the Mediterranean. Natural gas transportation was tied to pipelines traveling mainly north or west through Russia and its monopoly pipeline system\u2014Gazprom. This has provided Russia with the market power to dictate, in part, the price it is willing to pay for the oil or gas, to set transit fees on Caspian energy shipped through its transportation network, and to determine in some cases how much, if any, it is willing to transport. This latter point was evident in 2005 when Russia's oil pipeline company, Transneft, refused to allow oil from Kazakhstan to be shipped through its pipeline system to Lithuania for refining. The Caspian region nations thus have incentives to develop alternatives to routes through Russia to reach European and other markets and provide leverage in negotiating transit fees on shipments that do go through the Russian pipeline system.", "Changing the region's energy flow from the existing North-South axis to an East-West axis toward Europe could be integral to Europe's energy strategy. Currently, three big pipeline projects serve to reduce the region's dependence on Russia:", "The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) project connects Kazakhstan's Caspian Sea area oil deposits with Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. Oil loaded at Novorossiysk is then taken by tanker to world markets via the congested Bosporus Straits. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline (BTC), which opened in July 2006, exports oil from Azerbaijan and up to 600,000 bl/d from Kazakhstan along a 1,040-mile route from Baku, Azerbaijan via Georgia to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. This will allow oil to bypass the Bosporus Straits. The South Caucasus Gas Pipeline (SCGP), a new gas pipeline venture completed in December 2006, runs parallel to the BTC oil pipeline for most of its route before connecting to the Turkish energy infrastructure and on to Europe via a transit pipeline through Greece.", "In addition to these pipelines already in service, several additional projects in Europe could be involved. One option for additional oil transport would be to upgrade the existing oil pipeline which runs from Baku in Azerbaijan to Supsa in Georgia. That line could be extended under the Black Sea or the oil could be loaded onto tankers and shipped to Odessa, Ukraine. The oil could then be pumped through the Odessa-Brody pipeline into Poland. Some, including the Poles, have suggested that the Brody line be extended to northern Poland and possibly into the Baltic states for use at the Mazeikai refinery in Lithuania.", "On the gas front, two additional projects offer important options for Europe. As mentioned above, the EU's flagship project is the Nabucco gas pipeline. The other, the Trans-Caspian pipeline, is intended to bring additional gas from the Caspian to Georgia and across the Black Sea to Romania and the Balkans. EU officials had hoped that construction of the Nabucco pipeline\u2014intended to transport up to 31 billion Cubic meters of Central Asian gas through Turkey into Bulgaria and on to Austria\u2014would begin in 2007. However, the project has been repeatedly delayed, and recent advances by Gazprom on signing contracts for its South Stream pipeline have caused some to doubt Nabucco's viability. EU officials remain optimistic, aiming for construction of the pipeline to begin in 2009. In what some ciritics see as an additional attempt by Gazprom to undermine the Nabucco project, Gazprom is reported to have acquired a 50% stake in the planned terminus of the Nabucco pipeline, the Baumgarten transmission center in Austria, in January 2008.", "There can be no doubt that the energy resources of the Caspian Sea region can offer Europe a viable alternative source of energy supply. However, the full realization of the energy potential of the region could be impeded by several additional factors.", "One issue that continues to raise questions regarding regional stability is the unresolved legal status of the Caspian Sea. Despite a number of efforts, so far only Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia among the littoral states have reached agreement on delineating ownership of the Sea's resources or their rights of development. The EU could offer its legal assistance to help resolve outstanding issues.", "A second issue is the ability of the EU to work to ensure the long-term political stability of the region. The conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabaugh leaves the BTC and the future SCP pipelines vulnerable to sabotage. Internal political strife involving Georgia and its two breakaway regions also threatens future pipelines through that country. Continued political uncertainty in Ukraine and growing Iranian influence in the southern Caucasus could deter future long-term investment by the private sector. However, the January 2007 entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the European Union and the EU's special relationship with Turkey should help keep the Black Sea region settled.", "A third issue involves the willingness of the EU to compete with Russia for political and economic influence in the region and to prevent Gazprom from closing off the Caspian market, or at least the Central Asian part of the region, to Europe and its private sector. Russia's higher priced gas exports to Europe depend on Gazprom's ability to control gas from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. This dependency is expected to increase over the next 7-10 years until Russia's huge gas fields in the Barents Sea come on line. According to some, although Gazprom was unable to prevent the BTC pipeline from being completed, Gazprom intends to continue to press the countries around the Black and Caspian Sea regions to agree to gas supply and transit arrangements that satisfy the company's goals of channeling lower-cost Central Asian gas to Russian customers and protecting its lucrative European market. Gazprom has already locked up much of Turkmenistan's gas in a 25-year contract and has pursued a similar strategy toward Kazakhstan.", "The final issue revolves around whether Europe is the optimal market for Caspian oil and natural gas. Oil demand over the next 10 to 15 years in Europe is expected to grow by little more than 1 million bl/d. Oil exports eastward, on the other hand, could serve Asian markets, where demand for oil is expected to grow by roughly 10 million bl/d over the next 15 years. In fact, China, which opened an oil pipeline to Kazakhstan in 2005, sees Kazakhstan as a major source of oil for the long term.", "The Caspian region will continue to be an important source of energy production for the foreseeable future, especially if the estimates of its reserves, particularly its gas reserves, are accurate. Thus, the region can contribute to the diversification of oil and gas supplies to Europe, which will add to Europe's energy security. Taking full advantage of this potential will require a strong commitment on the part of the EU to encourage the private sector to take the financial risks associated with securing a share of the Caspian energy market for Europe, and to set forth an external strategy that is fully prepared to address the dynamics of the entire region.

Parenthetically, Europe's growing interest in energy resources in North Africa has not gone unnoticed by Russia and Gazprom. Just as in the Caspian region, Russia appears to be bolstering its efforts to influence Europe's energy plans.
