The Convention contains procedures for processing international child support cases that are intended to be uniform, simple, efficient, accessible, and cost-free to U.S. citizens seeking child support in other countries. The United States was the first country to sign the Convention. For many international cases, U.S. courts and state Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agencies already recognize and enforce child support obligations, whether or not the United States has a reciprocal agreement with the other country. However, many foreign countries will not enforce U.S. child support orders in the absence of a treaty obligation.", "On August 30, 2016, President Obama signed the instrument of ratification for the Convention. On September 7, 2016, the United States deposited its instrument of ratification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is the depository for the Convention. Thirty-three other countries, including the European Union, have also ratified the Convention.", "Although it is not the Senate's role to ratify treaties, it provides its advice and consent to a treaty's provisions. On September 29, 2010, the U.S. Senate approved the Resolution of Advice and Consent regarding the Convention.", "Implementing legislation for the Convention was included in the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (H.R. 4980), which was enacted into law on September 29, 2014, as P.L. 113-183. H.R. 4980 was passed by the House on July 23, 2014 (by voice vote under suspension of the rules), and by the Senate on September 18, 2014 (by unanimous consent). P.L. 113-183 included provisions that would implement the Convention. Specifically, it contains several provisions related to the international enforcement of child support orders. It contains provisions designed to improve child support collections in cases where the custodial parent and child live in one country and the noncustodial parent lives in another country. It ensures that the United States is compliant with the Convention and any other multilateral child support enforcement treaty and requires states to update their Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) law to incorporate any amendments adopted as of September 2008 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Additionally, P.L. 113-183 facilitates greater access to the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) by foreign countries and tribal governments as part of improving child support collections. P.L. 113-183 also allows the federal income tax refund offset program to be available for use by a state to handle CSE requests from foreign reciprocating countries and foreign treaty countries.", "Once the Convention is in force (January 1, 2017) it would apply to cases being worked between countries that are party to it (currently 34 countries, including the United States and the European Union)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["It is often difficult, if not impossible, to enforce child support obligations in cases where the custodial parent and child live in one country and the noncustodial parent lives in another. International cases are often challenging and time consuming for CSE workers because there are no agreed-upon standards of proof, uniform procedures, or methods of communication. While a multilateral CSE treaty has existed since November 23, 2007, the United States just recently ratified the treaty. ", "This report provides an overview of the current Child Support Enforcement (CSE) system, including a discussion of how international CSE cases are handled. It provides a summary of the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance (the Convention) and contains current status information. It also provides a description of the provisions included in P.L. 113-183 that pertain to enforcement of child support in international cases. These provisions would implement the Hague Convention on International Recovery of Child Support and any other multilateral agreement to which the United States is a party.", "Supporters of ratification of the Hague Convention provisions related to child support and family maintenance note that many Americans who live abroad may owe child support, and also that there are thousands of foreigners with children who live in the United States for whom child support should be provided. They contend that a noncustodial parent's residence in a foreign country should not prevent his or her children from receiving the child support to which they are entitled. According to some commentators, the United States had not previously ratified any treaty relating to child support primarily because of fundamental differences in how jurisdiction is obtained over the involved parties. In most foreign countries, jurisdiction in child support cases is based on the habitual residence of the custodial parent. In contrast, although the child support order is established in the home state of the custodial parent in the United States, child support enforcement relies on the ability of the court to obtain personal jurisdiction over the noncustodial parent.", "On August 30, 2016, President Obama signed the instrument of ratification for the Convention. On September 7, 2016, the United States deposited its instrument of ratification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is the depository for the Convention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of the Current Child Support Enforcement (CSE) Program3", "paragraphs": ["The CSE program was enacted in 1975 ( P.L. 93-647 ) as a federal-state program (Title IV-D of the Social Security Act). Its purpose is to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on a consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families remain self-sufficient and off public assistance. The CSE program has evolved over time from a \"welfare cost-recovery\" program into a \"family-first\" program that seeks to enhance the well-being of families by making child support a more reliable source of income. Child support orders require noncustodial parents to fulfill their financial responsibility to their children by contributing to the payment of childrearing costs. The CSE program provides seven major services on behalf of children: (1) parent location, (2) paternity establishment, (3) establishment of child support orders, (4) review and modification of child support orders, (5) collection of child support payments, (6) distribution of child support payments, and (7) establishment and enforcement of medical support. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds. The federal government reimburses each state and the jurisdictions listed above 66% of the cost of operating its CSE program. In addition, the federal government pays the states and jurisdictions an incentive payment to encourage them to operate effective programs. ", "State CSE programs are usually operated at the county level of government in the human services department, department of revenue, or the state attorney general's office. States must comply with a comprehensive set of requirements as a condition for receiving federal funds for operating state CSE programs. The CSE program is administered at the federal level by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Domestic Enforcement of Child Support", "paragraphs": ["State CSE programs have authority to use a vast array of methods/tools to collect and enforce the payment of child support. Collection methods used by CSE agencies include income withholding, intercept of federal and state income tax refunds, intercept of unemployment compensation, liens against property, and reporting of child support obligations to credit bureaus. All states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands also have civil or criminal contempt-of-court procedures and criminal nonsupport laws. Moreover, the 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ), officially known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), required states to implement expedited procedures to allow them to secure assets to satisfy an arrearage by intercepting or seizing unemployment and workers' compensation; lottery winnings; awards, judgments, or settlements; and assets of the debtor parent held in public or private retirement funds and financial institutions. It required states to implement procedures to withhold, suspend, or restrict use of driver's licenses, professional and occupational licenses, and recreational and sporting licenses of persons who owe past-due support or who fail to comply with subpoenas or warrants relating to paternity or child support proceedings. In addition, the 1996 law authorized the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports of debtor parents.", "Many CSE administrators contend that some of the more difficult child support orders to enforce are interstate cases. Family law traditionally has been under the jurisdiction of state and local governments, and citizens fall under the jurisdiction of the courts where they live. Thus, although federal CSE law requires states to cooperate in interstate child support enforcement, problems often arise because of the autonomy of local courts.", "P.L. 104-193 required states to enact and implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA). UIFSA was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) and approved by the commissioners in August 1992. The NCCUSL revised the act in 1996, 2001, and 2008. ", "UIFSA limits the jurisdiction that can properly establish and modify child support orders and addresses the enforcement of child support obligations within the United States. When multiple states are involved in establishing, enforcing, or modifying a child or spousal support order, UIFSA is used to resolve jurisdictional issues of the courts in the different states. UIFSA also establishes which state's law will be applied in proceedings under UIFSA, an important factor as support laws vary greatly among the states. UIFSA is designed to deal with desertion and nonsupport by instituting uniform laws in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The core of UIFSA is limiting control of a child support case to a single state, thereby ensuring that only one child support order from one court or child support agency is in effect at any given time. It follows that the controlling state will be able to effectively pursue interstate cases, primarily through the use of long arm statutes, because its jurisdiction is undisputed.", "UIFSA provides procedural and jurisdictional rules for three types of interstate child support proceedings: (1) establishing a child support order, (2) enforcing a child support order, and (3) modifying a child support order. UIFSA implements the \"one-order system.\" This means that only one state's order governs, at any given time, an obligor's support obligation to any child. Further, only one state has continuing jurisdiction to modify a child support order. This requires all other states to recognize the order and to refrain from modifying it unless the first state has lost jurisdiction.", "One of the most important aspects of UIFSA is its provisions related to continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. Consistent with UIFSA's policy of \"one order, one time, one place,\" only one court is authorized to establish or modify a child support order at a time. UIFSA provides that the court or administrative agency that issues a valid child support order retains \"continuing, exclusive jurisdiction\" to modify an existing order, as long as the custodial parent, the noncustodial parent, or the child remains in the issuing state. This provision limits the number of duplicate and conflicting orders, and reduces \"forum shopping\" by parents seeking to increase or decrease the amount of child support payments.", "P.L. 104-193 required that the 1996 version of UIFSA be adopted. It has been adopted in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As mentioned above, the NCCUSL approved additional amendments to UIFSA in August 2001. However, there is no federal mandate for states to enact the 2001 amendments. To date (more than a decade later), only 21 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the 2001 amendments. In July 2008, the NCCUSL approved amendments to the 2001 UIFSA (referred to as UIFSA 2008), to integrate the appropriate provisions of the Convention, which were adopted at the Hague Conference on Private International Law on November 23, 2007. P.L. 113-183 (enacted September 29, 2014) required that for a state to receive federal CSE funding, each state's UIFSA must include verbatim any amendments officially adopted as of September 30, 2008, by the NCCUSL. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have adopted UIFSA 2008. Thus, all of the 54 jurisdictions stand ready to immediately implement the Convention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Enforcement of Child Support", "paragraphs": ["Before 1996, there was no mandate, direct or indirect, for the states or the federal government to become involved in international arrangements for child support. Prior to P.L. 104-193 , states used the system that they had developed for interstate child support cases to collect child support on behalf of children whose noncustodial parent lived abroad. According to various CSE documents, the arrangements developed between the individual states and various foreign countries to enforce child support obligations were based on the principles of comity\u2014the voluntary recognition and respect given to the acts of another nation's government\u2014as well as formal statements of reciprocity. ", "P.L. 104-193 established procedures for international enforcement of child support.

Currently, the CSE program has reciprocal agreements regarding child support enforcement with 14 countries and 12 Canadian provinces/territories. The 14 countries are Australia, Czech Republic, El Salvador, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.", "Moreover, in the absence of a federal-level international agreement for child support enforcement, there may be a state-level arrangement with a country. These state-level arrangements were formerly authorized by the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), and are now authorized pursuant to UIFSA. However, such state-level arrangements may not be as comprehensive as the federal-level agreements. Further, not all states have similar arrangements with all countries; most states have arrangements with only a few countries.

P.L. 103-383 restricted a state court's ability to modify a child support order issued by another state unless the child and the custodial parent have moved to the state where the modification is sought or have agreed to the modification. ", "Court Jurisdiction: P.L. 113-183 amends 28 U.S.C. \u00a71738B by stipulating that a state court that has established a child support order has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order if the order is the controlling order and (1) the state is the child's state of residence or that of any individual contestant or (2) the parties consent in a record or in open court that the court may continue to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order. It clarifies 28 U.S.C. \u00a71738B by stipulating that a state court may modify a child support order issued by a court of another state if the court of the other state no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a child support order because that state is no longer the residence of the child or an individual contestant and the parties have not consented in a record or in open court that the court of the other state may continue to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order. It also makes minor changes to the definitions section of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71738B.", "In addition, P.L. 104-193 clarified the definition of a child's home state and made several revisions to ensure that the full faith and credit laws could be applied consistently with UIFSA. P.L. 113-183 provides further clarification (as noted above) of under what conditions a state could modify a child support order.", "P.L. 113-183 makes the amendments to 28 U.S.C. \u00a71738B effective on the date on which the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance of November 23, 2007, enters into force for the United States.
