Under the act, hospitals will be required to regularly conduct \"community health needs assessments\" and adopt implementation strategies to meet those needs. They are also required to have written financial assistance and emergency medical care policies that are consistent with standards imposed by the act. Furthermore, hospitals are not able to charge eligible uninsured individuals more than the lowest amounts charged to insured individuals for emergency and other medically necessary care, and they must make reasonable efforts to determine an individual's eligibility for financial assistance before beginning extraordinary collection actions.", "The act's requirements appear to reflect concerns that have arisen in recent years about whether non-profit hospitals are providing adequate public benefits to justify their tax-exempt status. Non-profit hospitals are eligible for federal tax-exempt status as charitable organizations described in \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).

A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community, and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Community Benefit Standard", "paragraphs": ["In 1969, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 69-545, which eliminated from Revenue Ruling 56-185 the requirement that a hospital provide free or reduced-cost care.

The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the \"generally accepted legal sense\" of the term \"charitable,\" as required by Treasury regulation. Expanding on this point, the ruling stated that", "The promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community.", "The IRS concluded that the hospital was \"promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community\" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education, and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital privileges were available to all qualified physicians.", "It appears the community benefit standard was adopted partly in response to the enactment in 1965 of Medicare and Medicaid, which some thought would reduce the need for hospitals to provide charity care. Its adoption by the IRS may also have been a response to concerns about the charity care standard. These concerns were evidenced in a legislative proposal, introduced in the same year Revenue Ruling 69-545 was issued, that would have created an explicit category in IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) for hospitals. The House Report accompanying the bill expressed concern with how the charity care standard was applied in practice:", "In a number of cases internal revenue agents have challenged the exempt status of hospitals on the sole ground that the hospitals are accepting insufficient numbers of patients at no charge or at rates substantially below cost. This has resulted in significant uncertainty as to the extent to which a hospital must accept patients who are unable to pay, in order to retain its exempt status.", "Shortly after the House Report was released, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 69-545. The Senate Finance Committee then removed the hospital provision from the bill, noting the existence of the new ruling and stating it would look at the issue when it addressed pending Medicare and Medicaid legislation.

The Supreme Court ordered the district court to dismiss the case because the plaintiffs lacked the constitutionally required standing to bring suit. To have standing, \"[a] plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" The plaintiffs' alleged injury was that the adoption of the community benefit standard had encouraged hospitals to not provide necessary medical care to the indigents. The Court, in holding the plaintiffs lacked standing, reasoned that it was \"purely speculative\" as to whether the hospitals had denied treatment because of the new ruling and not for other reasons and whether the plaintiffs' success would result in care being provided since hospitals could choose to give up their tax-exempt status if the cost was too high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Further Development of the Community Benefit Standard", "paragraphs": ["The IRS continues to use and develop the community benefit standard.

While an important factor in Revenue Ruling 69-545 was that the hospital operated an emergency room open to everyone, Revenue Ruling 83-157 states that a hospital without an emergency room may still qualify for exempt status if other conditions are met. The ruling recognized there are circumstances in which hospitals may not need to operate emergency rooms, such as when a state agency has determined that its operation would be duplicative or when a hospital is in a specialized field that is unlikely to require emergency care. In these situations, a hospital may still qualify as a charitable organization if it shows other evidence that it provides benefits to the community by promoting the health of a broad class of persons. The ruling listed examples of factors that may be used as evidence: a board of directors chosen from members of the community; an open medical staff policy; treatment of patients using public programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid); and using surplus funds for improving patient care, facilities, equipment, and medical training, education, and research."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Controversy", "paragraphs": ["In the past several years, questions have arisen as to whether non-profit hospitals deserve the benefits they receive as \u00a7 501(c)(3) charitable organizations.

Other issues that must be addressed include the basis for calculating amounts charged to patients, the actions that might be taken for nonpayment (e.g., collection actions and reporting to credit agencies), and the hospital's measures to widely publicize the policy within the community. The emergency medical care policy must require the hospital to provide, \"without discrimination,\" care for emergency medical conditions to individuals regardless of their eligibility for financial assistance.", "Third, with respect to emergency and other medically necessary care, hospitals may not charge individuals eligible under the financial assistance policy more than the lowest amounts charged to those with insurance coverage. Hospitals are also prohibited from using gross charges.

Drawn heavily from, but not identical to, the community benefit reporting model used by the Catholic Health Association of the United States (CHA), Schedule H was drafted to \"combat the lack of transparency surrounding the activities of tax-exempt organizations that provide hospital or medical care.\"", "Comments on the draft expressed immediate concerns about the technical and procedural implications of the addition. For example, comments reflected uncertainty over what constituted a hospital and whether multiple iterations of the Schedule were required for entities operating more than one hospital facility. In response, the IRS indicated that it intended to defer to state law for the definition of hospitals and that only one Schedule H would be required for an entity with a single employer identification number, regardless of the number of hospitals run by it.", "Schedule H contains six parts, each of which will be discussed in detail below.

The metric the IRS has chosen to quantify community benefit is dollars spent. Qualifying expenses include free care, unreimbursed Medicaid, unreimbursed costs from other means tested government programs, community health improvement services, health professions education, subsidized health services, research, and contributions to other community groups.", "Aside from concerns about the technical aspects of the new Schedule H, several substantive criticisms also emerged from the public comments. For the most part, these criticisms stemmed from the perception that the categories of charity care and community benefit envisioned by the IRS were underinclusive. The agency had explicitly stated in its comments accompanying the initial draft of Schedule H that the Schedule was an attempt to \"quantify, in an objective manner, the community benefit standard applicable to tax-exempt hospitals.\" While the IRS did not suggest a minimum level of expenditures that would be required in order to justify tax-exemption, it is probable that some hospitals were concerned that the exclusion of certain expenditures would make themselves appear, on paper, undeserving of tax-exempt status. By and large, these criticisms focused on three specific omissions: community building expenditures, Medicare shortfalls, and bad debt.", "Part II: Community Building", "Schedule H includes an area, Part II, in which to report community building expenditures. Although the definition of \"community building\" may not be obvious at first glance, it is generally understood to refer to programs that are intended to have a beneficial impact upon the health of a community but that do not provide medical care. Examples of community building are housing improvements, economic development, community support, environmental improvements, leadership development, coalition building, community health improvement advocacy, and workforce development.", "The initial draft of Schedule H did not include community building activities in its calculation of community benefit. In comments on the draft, the CHA strongly opposed their exclusion. The CHA argued that \"there is clear consensus in the public health community that social and environmental factors are strong determinants of health for vulnerable populations,\" citing publications from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other scholarly articles. Additionally, the CHA noted that \"every community building activity would qualify for exemption on a stand-alone basis.\"", "Despite the subsequent inclusion of community building metrics on the Schedule H, these numbers are still separate from the reporting of charity care and community benefit expenditures in Part I. The IRS commentary on the Schedule's final draft reflected the view that the link between community building and health was still tenuous and that the reporting tools in Schedule H are intended to operate, in part, as data collection methods for the IRS to discern what links exist.", "Part III: Medicare Shortfalls", "Hospitals incur costs when treating all patients, including patients who are covered by Medicare. Medicare, however, may not reimburse a provider for the total cost of services received by a patient. The difference between the Medicare reimbursement rates and the costs incurred by a hospital are called shortfalls.", "Some commentators on the draft Schedule H expressed a belief that a hospital should be allowed to include the aggregate amount of these shortfalls in any calculation of the total community benefit provided by that hospital. For example, comments from the Health Law and Taxation Sections of the American Bar Association (ABA) reasoned that \"the entire amount of any 'Medicare shortfall' should count as 'charity care,' because the elderly constitute a clearly recognized charitable class.\" Additionally, the American Hospital Association (AHA) commented that \"many Medicare beneficiaries, like their Medicaid counterparts, are poor,\" and would have qualified for a hospital's charity care program or Medicaid in addition to Medicare. If these patients had been treated as charity care, the entire cost of medical care would have been considered community benefit under Part I. Additionally, any shortfall in Medicaid reimbursement would similarly have been included in community benefit.", "Others, however, argued that Medicare shortfalls are not a useful metric for determining community benefit. The Catholic Health Association, opposing inclusion, noted that \"many for-profit hospitals compete aggressively for these [Medicare] patients.\" In its view, measuring Medicare shortfalls would not usefully distinguish for-profit hospitals from those seeking tax exemption, and creating distinctions between these two groups is necessary to ensure that tax exemption retains its credibility with policy makers. Notwithstanding these arguments, the CHA noted that \"if, at some point, access problems emerge for Medicare patients, the rationale for including Medicare services as community benefit increases.\"", "Schedule H includes a dedicated area in which to report Medicare shortfalls. Despite the addition of Part III, the IRS does not treat Medicare shortfalls as a direct measure of community benefit, in and of themselves. Instead, hospitals are asked to \"[d]escribe ... the extent to which any shortfall reported in [this part] should be considered as community benefit.\"", "Part III (continued): Bad Debt", "Hospitals regularly engage in billing and collection practices in order to recoup co-pays, deductibles, and other expenses from patients. During the collection process, there may occur a point at which it becomes apparent that a debt owed to the hospital has little or no potential of repayment. In accordance with sound accounting practices, it is customary to \"write off\" these debts as \"bad debt.\"", "Because bad debts, by definition, represent services hospitals have provided without compensation, some believe that the aggregate amount of bad debt should be included in any calculation of community benefit. Community benefit in the context of the provision of health care services normally refers to means-tested eligibility programs, but the ABA noted that \"hospitals continue to have difficulty separating traditional uncompensated care from true bad debt\" due to \"issues associated with identifying individuals who qualify for uncompensated care.\" Some portion of bad debt, therefore, appears to include the provision of care to individuals who would have been eligible for charity care. Proponents argue that it is unfair to penalize a hospital with a reduced community benefit calculation simply because the charity care program did not accurately classify these individuals.", "Support for inclusion of bad debt was not universal among the comments submitted. The Catholic Health Association noted that bad debt is a \"'cost of doing business' that affects taxable and tax-exempt organizations.\" In CHA's opinion, reporting bad debt does not create meaningful distinctions between for-profit and non-profit entities that would justify tax exemption. CHA did not necessarily dispute the theory that bad debt includes some patient charges that should be considered charity care. Rather, CHA argued that hospitals should improve their charity care programs to identify these patients at the onset of treatment, rather than using bad debt to approximate the impact of these patients after the fact. In support of this argument, CHA also noted that \"many Catholic hospitals have changed their policies and improved their ability to identify patients eligible for financial assistance.\" Some patient advocates have also noted the perceived inequity in allowing hospitals to benefit from bad debt after instituting potentially aggressive and damaging collection practices against patients.", "Schedule H allows hospitals to report bad debt in Part III alongside Medicare shortfalls, but bad debt expense may not be reported on the charity care and community benefit table. As with Medicare shortfalls, filing hospitals will have to explain what portion of bad debt should be considered community benefit. The IRS comments accompanying the Schedule's final draft indicated that it does not intend to automatically consider any portion of bad debt a community benefit, citing a lack of consensus regarding bad debt policies among hospitals.", "Part IV: Management Companies and Joint Ventures", "Part IV of Schedule H asks tax-exempt entities that operate hospitals to list the joint ventures they participate in. Joint ventures can be problematic in the non-profit healthcare context for a variety of reasons. If physicians with staff privileges at the hospital also have a proprietary interest in the joint venture, referrals to that joint venture may violate federal prohibitions against self-referrals or kickbacks. If directors or trustees of the hospital have a proprietary interest in that joint venture, the non-profit status of the hospital could be jeopardized by any benefit that they receive as a result of their interest in the venture. Similarly, in St. David's Health Care System v. United States , the Fifth Circuit held that a joint venture's profit motive could undermine a non-profit partner's status as a charitable organization.", "For the most part, these issues are common to all tax-exempt organizations. The majority of comments addressing this issue noted that the IRS already receives information on joint ventures in the redesigned Form 990, and that only organizations that operate hospitals are burdened with this extra reporting requirement in Schedule H. In response, the IRS noted that the \"unique relationship between hospitals and physicians resulting from their special status of having medical staff privileges without regard to employment appears to have no clear analogy in other exempt organization contexts.\" The IRS did limit this reporting requirement to those joint ventures where directors, trustees, and physicians with staff privileges together owned at least 10% of the joint venture.", "Part V: Facility Information", "Organizations are asked, in Part V of Schedule H, to identify all hospital or medical care facilities and to indicate the types of medical services provided by each. The definition of hospital or medical care does not include assisted living services, vocational training for the disabled, or medical education and research.", "Part VI: Supplemental Information", "Part VI of Schedule H provides an area in which to provide narrative information regarding the amount of community benefit provided. The IRS stated that this area could be used to explain why some portion of Medicare shortfall or bad debt reported in other areas of the Schedule should be considered community benefit. In addition, hospitals may provide details about other community benefits they provide that are not easily quantifiable."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
