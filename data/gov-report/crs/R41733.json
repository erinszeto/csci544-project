It is likewise a federal crime to use or disclose any information acquired by illegal wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping. Violations can result in imprisonment for not more than five years; fines up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations); civil liability for damages, attorneys' fees and possibly punitive damages; disciplinary action against any attorneys involved; and suppression of any derivative evidence. Congress has created separate, but comparable, protective schemes for electronic communications (e.g., email) and against the surreptitious use of telephone call monitoring practices such as pen registers and trap and trace devices.", "Each of these protective schemes comes with a procedural mechanism to afford limited law enforcement access to private communications and communications records under conditions consistent with the dictates of the Fourth Amendment. The government has been given narrowly confined authority to engage in electronic surveillance, conduct physical searches, and install and use pen registers and trap and trace devices for law enforcement purposes under ECPA and for purposes of foreign intelligence gathering under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.", "This report appears as a part of a larger piece, which includes a discussion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and is entitled CRS Report 98-326, Privacy: An Overview of Federal Statutes Governing Wiretapping and Electronic Eavesdropping, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].

The second, the Stored Communications Act, focuses on the privacy of, and government access to, stored electronic communications. The third creates a procedure for governmental installation and use of pen registers as well as trap and trace devices. It also outlaws such installation or use except for law enforcement and foreign intelligence investigations. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["At common law, \"eavesdroppers, or such as listen under walls or windows, or the eaves of a house, to hearken after discourse, and thereupon to frame slanderous and mischievous tales, are a common nuisance and presentable at the court-leet; or are indictable at the sessions, and punishable by fine and finding of sureties for [their] good behavior.\" Although early American law proscribed common law eavesdropping, the crime was little prosecuted and by the late nineteenth century had \"nearly faded from the legal horizon.\" With the invention of the telegraph and telephone, however, state laws outlawing wiretapping or indiscretion by telephone and telegraph operators preserved the spirit of the common law prohibition in this country. ", "Congress enacted the first federal wiretap statute as a temporary measure to prevent disclosure of government secrets during World War I. Later, it proscribed intercepting and divulging private radio messages in the Radio Act of 1927, but did not immediately reestablish a federal wiretap prohibition. By the time of the landmark Supreme Court decision in Olmstead , however, at least forty-one of the forty-eight states had banned wiretapping or forbidden telephone and telegraph employees and officers from disclosing the content of telephone or telegraph messages or both.", "Olmstead was a Seattle bootlegger whose Prohibition Act conviction was the product of a federal wiretap. He challenged his conviction on three grounds, arguing unsuccessfully that the wiretap evidence should have been suppressed as a violation of either his Fourth Amendment rights, his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, or the rights implicit in the Washington state statute that outlawed wiretapping.", "For a majority of the Court, writing through Chief Justice Taft, Olmstead's Fourth Amendment challenge was doomed by the absence of \"an official search and seizure of his person, or such a seizure of his papers or his tangible material effects, or an actual physical invasion of his house or curtilage for the purposes of making a seizure.\"", "Chief Justice Taft pointed out that Congress was free to provide protection which the Constitution did not. Congress did so in the 1934 Communications Act by expanding the Radio Act's proscription against intercepting and divulging radio communications so as to include intercepting and divulging radio or wire communications.", "The Federal Communications Act outlawed wiretapping, but it said nothing about the use of machines to surreptitiously record and transmit face to face conversations. In the absence of a statutory ban the number of surreptitious recording cases decided on Fourth Amendment grounds surged and the results began to erode Olmstead 's underpinnings. ", "Erosion, however, came slowly. Initially the Court applied Olmstead 's principles to the electronic eavesdropping cases. Thus, the use of a dictaphone to secretly overhear a private conversation in an adjacent office offended no Fourth Amendment precepts because no physical trespass into the office in which the conversation took place had occurred. Similarly, the absence of a physical trespass precluded Fourth Amendment coverage of the situation where a federal agent secretly recorded his conversation with a defendant held in a commercial laundry in an area open to the public. On the other hand, the Fourth Amendment did reach the government's physical intrusion upon private property during an investigation, as for example when they drove a \"spike mike\" into the common wall of a row house until it made contact with a heating duct for the home in which the conversation occurred. ", "The spike mike case presented something of a technical problem, because there was some question whether the spike mike had actually crossed the property line of the defendant's town house when it made contact with the heating duct. The Court declined to rest its decision on the technicalities of local property law, and instead found that the government's conduct had intruded upon privacy of home and hearth in a manner condemned by the Fourth Amendment. ", "Each of these cases focused upon whether a warrantless trespass onto private property had occurred, that is, whether the means of conducting a search and seizure had been so unreasonable as to offend the Fourth Amendment. Yet in each case, the object of the search and seizure had been not those tangible papers or effects for which the Fourth Amendment's protection had been traditionally claimed, but an intangible, a conversation. This enlarged view of the Fourth Amendment could hardly be ignored, for \"[i]t follows from ... Silverman ... that the Fourth Amendment may protect against the overhearing of verbal statements as well as against the more traditional seizure of papers and effects.\" ", "Soon thereafter the Court repudiated the notion that the Fourth Amendment's protection was contingent upon some trespass to real property in Katz v. United States . Katz was a bookie convicted on the basis of evidence gathered by an electronic listening and recording device set up outside the public telephone booth that Katz used to take and place bets. The Court held that the gateway for Fourth Amendment purposes stood at that point where an individual should to able to expect that his or her privacy would not be subjected to unwarranted governmental intrusion.", "One obvious consequence of Fourth Amendment coverage of wiretapping and other forms of electronic eavesdropping is the usual attachment of the Amendment's warrant requirement. To avoid constitutional problems and at the same time preserve wiretapping and other forms of electronic eavesdropping as a law enforcement tool, some of the states established a statutory system under which law enforcement officials could obtain a warrant, or equivalent court order, authorizing wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping.", "The Court rejected the constitutional adequacy of one of the more detailed of these state statutory schemes in Berger v. New York . The statute was found deficient because of its failure to require:", "a particularized description of the place to be searched; a particularized description of the crime to which the search and seizure related; a particularized description of the conversation to be seized; limitations to prevent general searches; termination of the interception when the conversation sought had been seized; prompt execution of the order; return to the issuing court detailing the items seized; and any showing of exigent circumstances to overcome the want of prior notice. ", "Berger helped persuade Congress to enact Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, a comprehensive wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping statute that not only outlawed both activities in general terms but that also permitted federal and state law enforcement officers to use them under strict limitations designed to meet the objections in Berger .", "A decade later another Supreme Court case persuaded Congress to supplement Title III with a judicially supervised procedure for the use of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping in foreign intelligence gathering situations. When Congress passed Title III there was some question over the extent of the President's inherent powers to authorize wiretaps\u2014without judicial approval\u2014in national security cases. As a consequence, the issue was simply removed from the Title III scheme. ", "After the Court held that the President's inherent powers were insufficient to excuse warrantless electronic eavesdropping on purely domestic threats to national security, Congress considered it prudent to augment the foreign intelligence gathering authority of the United States with the Foreign Intelligence Security Act of 1978 (FISA). The FISA provides a procedure for judicial review and authorization of electronic surveillance and other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence purposes.", "Two other Supreme Court cases influenced the development of federal law in the area. In United States v. Miller , the Court held that a customer had no Fourth Amendment protected expectation of privacy in the records his bank created concerning his transactions with them. These third party records were therefore available to the government under a subpoena duces tecum rather than a more narrowly circumscribed warrant. In Smith v. Maryland , it held that no warrant was required for the state's use of a pen register or trap and trace device, if the device merely identified the telephone numbers for calls made and received from a particular telephone. No Fourth Amendment search or seizure occurred, the Court held, since the customer had no justifiable expectation of privacy in information which he knew or should have known the telephone company might ordinarily capture for billing or service purposes. ", "In 1986, Congress enacted the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). ECPA consists of three parts: a revised Title III; the Stored Communications Act (SCA); and provisions governing the installation and use of pen registers as well as trap and trace devices. Congress has adjusted the components of ECPA and FISA, over the years. It has done so sometimes in the interests of greater privacy; sometimes in the interest of more effective law enforcement or foreign intelligence gathering; often with an eye to some combination of those interests. Prominent among its enactments are: ", "the USA PATRIOT Act; the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002; the 21 st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act; the Department of Homeland Security Act; the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act; and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008 (2008 FISA Amendments Act)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title III: Prohibitions", "paragraphs": ["In Title III, ECPA begins the proposition that unless provided otherwise, it is a federal crime to engage in wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping; to possess wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping equipment; to use or disclose information obtained through illegal wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping; or to disclose information secured through court-ordered wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping, in order to obstruct justice.

Congress adopted the approach because of concern that its constitutional authority might not be sufficient to ban instances of electronic surveillance that bore no discernable connection to interstate commerce or any other of Congress's enumerated constitutional powers. So it enacted a general prohibition, and as a safety precaution, a second provision more tightly tethered to specific jurisdictional factors. The Justice Department has honored that caution by employing subparagraph (b) to prosecute the interception of oral communications, while using subparagraph (a) to prosecute other forms of electronic eavesdropping."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interception", "paragraphs": ["Interception \"means the aural or other acquisition of the contents\" of various kinds of communications by means of \"electronic, mechanical or other devices.\" Although logic might suggest that interception occurs only in the place where the communication is captured, the cases indicate that interception occurs as well where the communication begins, is transmitted, or is received. Yet, it does not include instances when an individual simply reads or listens to a previously intercepted communication, regardless of whether additional conduct may implicate the prohibitions on use or disclosure.", "Once limited to aural acquisitions, ECPA enlarged the definition of \"interception\" by adding the words \"or other acquisition\" so that it is no longer limited to interceptions of communications that can be heard. The change complicates the question of whether the wiretap, stored communications, or trap and trace portions of the ECPA govern the legality of various means of capturing information relating to a communication. The analysis might seem to favor wiretap coverage when it begins with an examination of whether an \"interception\" has occurred. Yet, there is little consensus over when an interception occurs; that is, whether \"interception\" as used in section 2511 contemplates surreptitious acquisition, either contemporaneous with transmission, or whether such acquisition may occur anytime before the initial cognitive receipt of the contents by the intended recipient, or under some other conditions.", "The USA PATRIOT Act resolved some of the statutory uncertainty concerning voice mail when it removed voice mail from the wiretap coverage of Title III (striking the phrase \"and such term includes any electronic storage of such communication\" from the definition of \"wire communications\" in Title III (18 U.S.C. 2510(1)) and added stored wire communications to the stored communications coverage of 18 U.S.C. 2703."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Content", "paragraphs": ["The interceptions proscribed in Title III are confined to those that capture a communication's \"content,\" that is, \"information concerning [its] substance, purport, or meaning.\" Trap and trace devices and pen registers once captured only information relating to the source and addressee of a communication, not its content. That is no longer the case. The \"post-cut-through dialed digit features\" of contemporary telephone communications now transmit communications in such a manner that the use of ordinary pen register or trap and trace devices will capture both non-content and content. As a consequence, a few courts have held, either as a matter of statutory construction or constitutional necessity, that the authorities must rely on a Title III wiretap order rather than a pen register/trap and trace order if such information will be captured."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "By Electronic, Mechanical, or Other Device", "paragraphs": ["The statute does not cover common law \"eavesdropping,\" but only interceptions \"by electronic, mechanical or other device.\" The term includes computers, but it is defined so as not to include hearing aids or extension telephones in normal use (use in the \"ordinary course of business\"). Whether an extension phone has been installed and is being used in the ordinary course of business or in the ordinary course of law enforcement duties, so that it no longer constitutes an interception device for purposes of Title III and comparable state laws has proven a somewhat vexing question.", "Although often intertwined with the consent exception discussed below, the question generally turns on the facts in a given case. When the exemption is claimed as a practice in the ordinary course of business, the interception must be for a legitimate business reason, it must be routinely conducted, and at least in some circuits employees must be notified that their conversations are being monitored. Similarly, \"Congress most likely carved out an exception for law enforcement officials to make clear that the routine and almost universal recording of phone lines by police departments and prisons, as well as other law enforcement institutions, is exempt from the statute.\" The exception contemplates administrative rather than investigative monitoring, which must nevertheless be justified by a lawful, valid law enforcement concern."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications", "paragraphs": ["An interception is only a violation of Title III if the conversation or other form of captured communication is among those kinds which the statute protects, in oversimplified terms\u2014if it is a telephone (wire), face to face (oral), or computer (electronic) communication.

", "Title III does not cover all wire, oral or electronic communications. \"Oral communications,\" by definition, includes only those face to face conversations for which the speakers have a justifiable expectation of privacy. \"Wire communications\" are limited to those that are at some point involve voice communications (i.e., only aural transfers).

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exemptions: Consent Interceptions", "paragraphs": ["Consent interceptions are common, controversial and have a history all their own. The early bans on divulging telegraph or telephone messages had a consent exception. The Supreme Court upheld consent interceptions against Fourth Amendment challenge both before and after the enactment of Title III. The argument in favor of consent interceptions has always been essentially that a speaker risks the indiscretion of his listeners and holds no superior legal position simply because a listener elects to record or transmit his statements rather than subsequently memorializing or repeating them. Wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping by either the police or anyone else with the consent of at least one party to the conversation is not unlawful under the federal statute. These provisions do no more than shield consent interceptions from the sanctions of federal law; they afford no protection from the sanctions of state law. Many of the states recognize comparable exceptions, but some only permit interception with the consent of all parties to a communication. ", "Under federal law, consent may be either explicitly or implicitly given. For instance, someone, who uses a telephone other than his or her own and has been told by the subscriber that conversations over the instrument are recorded, has been held to have implicitly consented to interception when using the instrument. This is not to say that subscriber consent alone is sufficient, for it is the parties to the conversation whose privacy is protected. Although consent may be given in the hopes of leniency from law enforcement officials or as an election between unpalatable alternatives, it must be freely given and not secured coercively.", "Private consent interceptions may not be conducted for a criminal or tortious purpose. Some state wiretap laws do not recognize a one party consent exception. There, interception with the consent of but one party to the conversation is a violation of state law. But the federal exception is available as long as the purpose of the interception was neither criminal nor tortious\u2014though the means may have been. At one time, the limitation encompassed interceptions for criminal, tortious, or otherwise injurious purposes, but ECPA dropped the reference to injurious purposes for fear that First Amendment values might be threatened should the clause be read to outlaw consent interceptions conducted to embarrass."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exemptions: Publicly Accessible Radio Communications", "paragraphs": ["Radio communications which can be inadvertently heard or are intended to be heard by the public are likewise exempt.

It may also apply to state wiretaps. It covers information generated from a court-ordered wiretap authorized under \u00a72516. Section 2516 authorizes both federal and state court-ordered wiretaps. On the other hand, strictly speaking, \u00a72516 permits state wiretapping when \"authorized\" by state law. The courts might conclude that Congress would have spoken more clearly, if it intended to make it a federal crime to obstruct state criminal prosecutions by the disclosing of information derived from a state wiretap.", "A third disclosure proscription applies only to electronic communications service providers \"who intentionally divulge the contents of the communication while in transmission\" to anyone other than sender and intended recipient.
