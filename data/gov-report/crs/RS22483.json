The program is administered by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Community Care, located in Denver, CO.", "Eligibility", "To be eligible for CHAMPVA benefits, the beneficiary must be the spouse or child of a veteran who has a total and permanent service-connected disability, or the widowed spouse or child of a veteran who (1) died as a result of a service-connected disability; or (2) had a total, permanent disability resulting from a service-connected condition at the time of death; or (3) died while on active duty status and in the line of duty; and does not qualify for health care under the Department of Defense (DOD) TRICARE program. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-163) expanded CHAMPVA benefits for primary caregivers of certain seriously injured veterans if they do not have any other form of health insurance. Under current law, a child (other than a helpless child) loses eligibility when (1) the child turns 18, unless enrolled in an accredited school as a full-time student; or (2) the child, who has been a full-time student, turns 23 or loses full-time student status; or (3) the child marries. Nevertheless, a child between the ages of 18 and 23 may remain eligible for CHAMPVA benefits if the child incurs a disabling illness or injury\u2014while enrolled as full-time student\u2014and is unable to continue studying at his or her educational institution. The child's eligibility will end either (1) six months from the removal date of the disability, (2) two years from the onset of the disability, or (3) on the child's 23rd birthday.", "Benefits", "The CHAMPVA program covers most health care services and supplies that are determined to be medically necessary, including inpatient and outpatient care, prescription drugs, mental health services, and skilled nursing care. Certain types of care require advance approval, commonly known as preauthorization. Currently, preauthorization is required for durable medical equipment, hospice services, mental health/substance abuse services, organ and bone marrow transplants, and dental procedures that are directly related to covered medical conditions.", "Payments", "CHAMPVA beneficiaries usually pay 25% of the cost of medical care up to an annual catastrophic cap of $3,000 plus an annual outpatient deductible of $50 per individual or $100 per family. CHAMPVA pays the remaining 75% of the cost of the beneficiaries' medical care. CHAMPVA is generally a secondary payer to other health insurance coverage and Medicare.

The VHA is primarily a direct service provider of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to veterans though an integrated health care system. In 1973, Congress enacted the Veteran Health Care Expansion Act of 1973 ( P.L. 93-82 ), which, among other things, established effective September 1, 1973, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) as a means of providing health care services to dependents and survivors of certain veterans. As stated in the House report accompanying P.L. 93-82 :", "The nation has long recognized that the widow and children of a veteran who dies of service-connected disease or injury or of a veteran who has a service-connected total disability are in a special category and deserving of substantial compensation and assistance in return for the sacrifice the family has made. This recognition has been shown in title 38 programs which provide for death compensation benefits, home loans, and educational assistance benefits for wives, widows, and war orphans. Failure to provide for the medical care of such individuals is an oversight which should be corrected.", "CHAMPVA is fundamentally a health insurance program where certain eligible dependents and survivors of veterans (veterans rated permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected condition) obtain medical care from private health care providers. Beneficiaries usually pay 25% of the cost of medical care up to an annual catastrophic cap of $3,000 plus an annual outpatient deductible of $50 per individual or $100 per family. CHAMPVA pays the remaining 75% of the cost of the beneficiaries' medical care. CHAMPVA was designed to share costs of health services and to provide medical care in a manner similar to the care provided to certain eligible beneficiaries under the Department of Defense (DOD) TRICARE program (described later in this report). The program is administered by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Community Care, located in Denver, CO.", "The number of beneficiaries enrolled in CHAMPVA has grown over the years. From FY2001 through FY2017, enrollments grew by 396%\u2014from 96,500 to 478,600 beneficiaries (see Figure 1 ). The 2001 expansion of CHAMPVA eligibility to certain individuals aged 65 years and older has contributed somewhat to the increase in enrollment. Moreover, there has been an increase in enrollment of dependents and spouses of certain Vietnam-era veterans with service-connected disabilities. This increase in Vietnam-era CHAMPVA sponsorship has occurred as aging Vietnam-era veterans with service-connected disabilities experience a worsening of symptoms and a change in disability status. Once a veteran becomes VA-rated permanently and totally disabled for a service-connected disability, the veteran's spouse and dependents are then eligible to enroll in CHAMPVA. The enactment of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-163 ), expanded CHAMPVA eligibility to include additional categories of non-veterans, such as primary family caregivers of certain seriously injured veterans qualifying under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC). Table A-1 provides a summary of major legislative changes that have affected the CHAMPVA program since 1973 (see Appendix A ).", "The number of unique CHAMPVA users has also grown by 485%, from 61,900 in FY2001 to 361,900 in FY2017 (see Figure 1 ). Unique users are enrollees who utilize health care at least once in a fiscal year. Appendix B provides a state-by-state breakdown of the number of CHAMPVA enrollees and unique users for FY2017.", "Funding for CHAMPVA is provided through the VHA's Medical Services account. As shown in Figure 2 , spending for CHAMPVA (excluding administrative costs) has increased by 945% between FY2001 and FY2017. The average cost per patient has also increased from approximately $2,349 per patient in FY2001 to an estimated $4,200 per patient in FY2017. A demographic shift in CHAMPVA enrollees from less expensive younger beneficiaries to more expensive aging beneficiaries, the \"extension of CHAMPVA benefits to beneficiaries over the age of 65,\" and the general inflation of medical costs are potential reasons for this increase in CHAMPVA expenditures.", "The next section provides answers to frequently asked questions about the program.
