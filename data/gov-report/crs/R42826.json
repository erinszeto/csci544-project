In particular, Members, committees, and staff may find themselves (1) considering or drafting legislation that would amend the FAR to save money, promote transparency, or further other public policies; (2) conducting oversight of executive agencies' performance in procuring goods and services; and (3) responding to questions from constituents regarding executive branch procurement activities. In addition, certain commentators have recently suggested that some or all FAR provisions should be withdrawn.", "The FAR is a regulation, codified in Parts 1 through 53 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which generally governs acquisitions of goods and services by executive branch agencies. It addresses various aspects of the acquisition process, from acquisition planning to contract formation, to contract management. Depending upon the topic, the FAR may provide contracting officers with (1) the government's basic policy (e.g., small businesses are to be given the \"maximum practicable opportunity\" to participate in acquisitions); (2) any requirements agencies must meet (e.g., obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures); (3) any exceptions to the requirements (e.g., when and how agencies may waive a contractor's exclusion); and (4) any required or optional clauses to be included, or incorporated by reference, in the solicitation or contract (e.g., termination for convenience). The FAR also articulates the guiding principles for the federal acquisition system, which include satisfying the customer in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered goods and services; minimizing operating costs; conducting business with integrity, fairness, and openness; and fulfilling public policy objectives. In addition, the FAR identifies members and roles of the \"acquisition team.\"", "The FAR is the result of a 1979 statute directing the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to \"issue polic[ies] \u2026 for the purpose of promoting the development and implementation of [a] uniform procurement system.\" Partly in response to this directive, the FAR was issued in 1983, and took effect in 1984. It has been revised frequently since then, in response to legislation, executive orders, litigation, and policy considerations. These revisions are generally made by the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator of National Aeronautics and Space, acting on behalf of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council. However, the Administrator of OFPP also has the authority to amend the FAR in certain circumstances. FAR amendments generally apply only to contracts awarded after the effective date of the amendment.", "While the FAR contains the principal rules of the federal acquisition system, it is not the only authority governing acquisitions of goods and services by executive branch agencies. Statutes, agency FAR supplements, other agency regulations, and guidance documents may also apply. In some cases, these sources cover topics not covered in the FAR, and sometimes the FAR addresses topics not expressly addressed in statute or elsewhere. In addition, it is the contract (not the FAR) that binds the contractor, although judicial and other tribunals may read terms required by the FAR into contracts which lack them.", "Agencies subject to the FAR may deviate from it in certain circumstances, and agencies or transactions not subject to the FAR may be subject to similar requirements under other authority."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The federal government is the largest buyer of goods and services in the world, and executive branch agencies\u2014particularly the Department of Defense\u2014make most of these purchases.

In some cases, the FAR requires agencies to include terms in their prime contracts obligating their contractors to \"flow down\" certain requirements to subcontractors, so that subcontractors may be subject to certain requirements like those in the FAR as terms of their contracts. However, not all requirements flow down, and certain FAR provisions that pertain primarily to the conduct of procurements by executive branch agencies are inapplicable to subcontractors.

Subpart 6.3, in turn, identifies the circumstances in which other than full and open competition is permitted (e.g., only one responsible source, urgent and compelling circumstances).

", "In other cases, the FAR articulates general standards that agencies are to consider in making certain determinations, or the grounds upon which agencies may take certain actions. Thus, Part 9 of the FAR\u2014which addresses \"contractor qualifications\"\u2014specifies the \"general standards\" that contracting officers must consider when determining whether prospective contractors are responsible. It similarly describes the grounds upon which agency suspension and debarment officials may exclude persons from federal contracting for a temporary or fixed period. Other provisions of Part 9 describe how contracting officers may (or, in some cases, must) obtain information for use in making determinations regarding contractor qualifications (e.g., preaward surveys, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System [FAPIIS], and the System for Award Management [SAM]). ", "Yet other provisions articulate the responsibilities of various agency personnel in administering the contract. Contract administration may include a variety of tasks and responsibilities depending on, for example, the type of contract and the goods or services acquired. Part 42 of the FAR provides guidance for contracting officers and other members of the acquisition team regarding audits, postaward orientations for contractors, production surveillance and reporting, and collection of contractor performance information, among other things.

Notably, Congress enacted the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1979 ( P.L. 96-83 ), which amended the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act ( P.L. 93-400 ) to authorize the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to \"issue policy directives \u2026 for the purpose of promoting the development and implementation of the uniform procurement system.\" Subsequently, OFPP released Policy Letter 80-5. This document effectively established the \"Federal Acquisition Regulation System\" and stated that the system would include, among other things, \"[a] single Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), to be issued jointly by the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, pursuant to their respective authorities\" under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, the Armed Services Procurement Act, and the National Aeronautics and Space Act.

The APA established four basic requirements agencies must follow when issuing rules using notice-and-comment, or informal, rulemaking. These four steps are", "1. the publication of a proposed rule in the Federal Register ; 2. the opportunity for interested persons to submit comments on the proposed rule; 3. publication of a final rule that includes a \"concise general statement\" of the \"basis and purpose\" of the rule; and 4. a 30-day waiting period after the final rule is published in the Federal Register before the rule can take effect.", "If necessary, agencies can invoke a \"good cause\" exception to some of these requirements. One particular application of the \"good cause\" exception is the use of interim final rulemaking. If an agency finds that notice and comment would be \"impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest,\" the agency may issue a rule without prior notice and comment and instead take post-promulgation comments. The agency may choose to revise the rule in light of the post-promulgation comments it receives.

Moreover, while agencies could potentially be compelled to take action in certain circumstances if they have \"unreasonably delayed,\" they have seldom, if ever, been compelled to issue procurement regulations. This is, in part, because congressional indications of how quickly an agency should proceed are only one factor in determining whether a delay in rulemaking is unreasonable and agency action should be compelled. Other factors include (1) whether a danger to human health is implicated by the delay; (2) the agency's competing priorities; (3) the interests prejudiced by the delay; and (4) whether the agency has treated the present party disparately from others.

Further, the regulations may not conflict or be inconsistent with the FAR, except as required by law or if the agency has used an authorized deviation (see \" May Agencies Deviate from the FAR? \"). ", "The FAR contains requirements that agencies must follow when promulgating agency-specific regulations. They include providing notice and comment in the Federal Register when required (e.g., if the regulations have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors).

These long-term contracts\u2014which provide for the contractor to incur the costs of implementing energy savings measures in exchange for a share of any energy savings directly resulting from the measures\u2014are also discussed in certain agency FAR supplements.

However, Congress may prompt the executive branch to amend the FAR by doing one of two things. In some cases, Congress effectively prompts amendment of the FAR by enacting or amending a law implemented, in part, through the FAR. This law need not mention the FAR, or amendment of the FAR, for an amendment to ensue. In other cases, Congress explicitly directs that the FAR be amended. Sometimes, Congress also specifies that the FAR Council should make this amendment, or the time frame within which the amendment should be made (although not all FAR amendments required by Congress are made within the prescribed time frame, as discussed above, \" How Long Does It Take to Amend the FAR? \"). The first approach appears to be more common in situations where procurement or other statutes directly address the topic of the legislation, while the second approach tends to be used in situations where the FAR addresses topics not directly addressed in statute (see \" What Is the Relationship Between the FAR and Procurement or Other Statutes? \"). ", "However, as discussed previously (see \" Who Typically Promulgates Regulations Amending the FAR? \"), the FAR Council and OFPP may also amend the FAR without the enactment of procurement-related legislation or a congressional directive to do so. Some FAR amendments are initiated by the FAR Council, in particular, in response to policy concerns or litigation. In other cases, the FAR Council amends the FAR in response to an executive order directing the amendment of the FAR, or otherwise addressing procurement matters.

Members of Congress may make such concerns known to the executive branch informally (e.g., via letters), or through the exercise of oversight, in the hope of prompting the abandonment or modification of the provisions in question. In some cases, however, Congress may also enact legislation that effectively or expressly forecloses certain amendments to the FAR. For example, Congress could enact legislation whose requirements would be inconsistent with certain potential amendments to the FAR, as happened in 2008, when Congress required that contracts for commercial items or performed overseas be subject to any \"mandatory disclosure rule\" promulgated by the FAR Council. Congress could also enact legislation that bars agencies from imposing certain requirements on contractors, or from using appropriated funds to implement specific rules, regulations, or executive orders pertaining to contract-related matters. ", "In addition, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7801-808) provides Congress with the opportunity to overturn a final rule, including a rule that would amend the FAR, through the enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval. If passed by Congress and signed into law by the President, a joint resolution of disapproval results in the rule having no \"force or effect.\" Enacted in March 1996 as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) ( P.L. 104-121 ), the CRA contains expedited procedures for congressional consideration of such joint resolutions of disapproval."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Much Deference Do Courts and Other Tribunals Give to FAR Provisions?", "paragraphs": ["Like other regulations, FAR provisions represent agencies' constructions of the statutes which they implement. As such, judicial and other tribunals generally review the provisions of the FAR in light of Chevron, USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council in determining whether these interpretations are entitled to deference (commonly known as \"Chevron deference\"). In Chevron , the Supreme Court articulated a two-part test for review of an agency's construction of a statute which it administers: (1) Has Congress directly spoken to the precise question at issue, and (2) If not, is the agency's reasonable interpretation of the statute consistent with the purposes of the statute? \"[I]f the statute speaks clearly 'to the precise question at issue,'\" the tribunal \"must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress,\" regardless of what the agency regulation provides.

The extent of such deference is generally \"understood to vary with circumstances,\" such as \"the degree of the agency's care, its consistency, formality, and relative expertness, and \u2026 the persuasiveness of the agency's position,\" as well as the \"writer's thoroughness, logic, and expertise, its fit with prior interpretations, and any other source of weight.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The FAR and Federal Contracts", "paragraphs": ["This section includes questions and answers addressing the relationship between the FAR and a federal contract; whether FAR amendments apply to pre-existing contracts; and what happens if a contract clause which is required by the FAR is not included in a particular contract.

", "While the FAR contains many standard terms and clauses, the details and specifics are left to the individual contract. For this reason, the drafting that occurs for each contract can be highly important. The interaction between the FAR and the contract is exemplified by the treatment of economic price adjustments. An economic price adjustment provides for the upward or downward revision of prices in a contract if certain conditions occur. The FAR provides that there are three general types of economic price adjustments: those based on established prices; those based on actual costs of labor or material; and those based on cost indexes of labor or material. When one of these price adjustments is to be used, the contract will then be drafted to address the specifics, such as identifying the events that will trigger the price adjustment, identifying the applicable indexes or established prices, and establishing the base levels.", "Importantly, while courts and other tribunals will generally interpret a statute or regulation, such as the FAR, by looking to its plain meaning, and not the drafters' intent, the intent of the parties to a contract could be found to prevail over its plain text in certain cases (e.g., other provisions of the contract evidence that the contract's language on a particular issue does not reflect their intentions).

Moreover, when the FAR change is prompted by a statute, this convention also reflects the fundamental canon of statutory interpretation that laws will not be given retroactive effect unless there is clear congressional intent to the contrary.

", "In certain circumstances, the courts and boards of contract appeals will \"read\" required clauses into contracts which lack them, treating the clause as a term of the contract despite its absence. The currently prevailing grounds for \"reading in\" clauses is that articulated by the former Court of Claims (here acting as a predecessor to the current U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) in G.L. Christian & Associates v. United States , wherein the court found that certain required contract terms allowing the government to terminate contracts for its convenience were to be read into contracts which lacked them because (1) the terms represented a \"deeply ingrained strand of public procurement policy,\" and (2) federal regulations can \"fairly be read\" as permitting the clause to be read into the contract since they require agencies to incorporate the clause. Other required FAR clauses that have been read into government contracts under the \" Christian doctrine\" have included those allowing the government to terminate contracts for default; addressing protests after award; and governing contractors' use of government property. However, courts have declined to read in other clauses, often when the contractor (as opposed to the government) seeks to rely upon the missing, but required, clause.

The FAR recognizes two types of deviations: individual and class. Individual deviations affect only individual contract actions. They may generally be authorized by the agency head, with the contracting officer required to document the justification and agency approval in the contract file. Class deviations affect multiple contract actions. For civilian agencies (other than NASA), deviations may generally be authorized by agency heads or their designees after consultation with the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC). Additionally, a copy of each class deviation must be provided to the FAR Secretariat. For DOD, the FAR provides that class deviations will be done in accordance with DFARS, which generally grants the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy the authority to issue them. If any agency requires a permanent class deviation, then it should propose a FAR revision when appropriate. ", "An example of a recent notable class deviation was the one that DOD issued regarding the System for Award Management (SAM) shortly after this database came into use. In anticipation of SAM's completion, the FAR and DFARS were amended to require contractors to use the database to meet initial registration and annual certification requirements. However, once SAM began to be used, people reported \"performance issues ... [that] affected the timely processing of awards.\" These issues prompted DOD to issue a class deviation permitting contractors to use alternative measures to meet their registration and certification requirements until the problems with SAM were resolved.

For example, in a 2012 decision, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small businesses must be accorded a price evaluation preference when the General Services Administration (GSA) acquires certain leasehold interests in real property even though such acquisitions are not subject to the FAR (see \" What Purchases Are Subject to the FAR? \"). GAO reached this conclusion because the Small Business Act, which governs price evaluation and other preferences for HUBZone small businesses, \"does not limit the type of contract to which it applies\" (unlike the FAR, which applies only to procurement contracts). Because the Small Business Act \"broadly applies to all federal contracts that involve full and open competition,\" and a lease of real property is a contract, GAO rejected GSA's assertion that price evaluation preferences for HUBZone small businesses are required only in procurements of goods and services (i.e., procurements subject to the FAR).", "In other cases, statutes impose requirements like those implemented, in part, by the FAR on entities or transactions that are not subject to the FAR.
