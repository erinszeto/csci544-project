The act created the Federal Power Commission (FPC) to regulate the construction and operation of nonfederal hydropower projects. In subsequent years, many companies began to enter the electric power industry. Large companies began to form and consolidate the industry, as economies of scale began to dominate the production of electric power. Many of these individual companies fell under the organizational control of even larger \"holding companies.\" This was likely an effort to evade state regulation because states did not have jurisdiction over interstate transmission or rates charged for electricity, and federal regulations did not exist for such interstate activities. ", "In 1935, Congress passed the Public Utility Act (PUA) which sought to end the abuses of market power at that time. Title I of the PUA, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA; P.L. 74-333), was created to address the lack of oversight over holding companies. Among other actions, PUHCA gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authority over many holding company transactions, and it limited power industry mergers and acquisitions to contiguous areas. ", "Title II of the PUA amended the FWPA to create the Federal Power Act (FPA), and granted authority to the FPC to regulate the interstate transmission and sales of electricity and natural gas. The FWPA became Part I of the FPA, with the FPC assuming authority over nonfederal hydropower projects on navigable waterways and federal lands. ", "Part II of the FPA authorized the FPC to regulate the interstate transportation and wholesale sale (i.e., sale for resale) of electric energy, while leaving jurisdiction over intrastate transportation and retail sales (i.e., sale to the ultimate consumer) in the hands of the states.

However, in RTO regions as shown in Figure 2 , power generators generally compete to sell electricity from their power plants to retail suppliers (i.e., a distribution utility or other Load Serving Entity) via a wholesale electricity market. RTOs are the facilitator in this supply and demand process, coordinating the purchase, sale, and delivery of wholesale electricity from seller to buyer. The participation of renewable generation and demand response resources in RTO markets has been an area which FERC wants to ensure fair value and access to wholesale markets.
