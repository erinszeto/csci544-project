Under WTO dispute settlement rules, a WTO Member will generally be given a reasonable period of time to comply. While the Member is expected to remove the offending measure by the end of this period, compensation and temporary retaliation are available if the Member has not acted or not taken adequate remedial action by this time. Either disputing party may request a compliance panel if there is disagreement over whether a Member has complied in a case.", "Nine unresolved cases involve trade remedies, including a long-standing dispute with Japan over a provision of U.S. antidumping (AD) law and another with various WTO Members over the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000. The Offset Act was repealed as of October 2005, but remains the target of sanctions by the European Union (EU) and Japan due to continued payments to U.S. firms authorized under the repealer (P.L. 109-171). Six of these cases involve \"zeroing,\" a practice under which the Department of Commerce (DOC), in calculating dumping margins in AD proceedings, disregards non-dumped sales. The practice was challenged by the EU (DS294/DS350), Japan (DS322), and Mexico (DS344), resulting in broad prohibitions on its use. The United States administratively resolved one aspect of DS294 by abandoning zeroing in original AD investigations, but has yet to comply fully either in this case or in DS350, 322, or 344, leading the EU (in DS294) and Japan to request the WTO to authorize sanctions. Under memoranda signed by the United States with each complainant on February 6, 2012, however, U.S.-requested arbitration of the two sanctions proposals has been suspended while the United States makes new dumping determinations in challenged AD proceedings using a methodology finalized in March 2012 that eliminates zeroing in later stages of AD cases. The sanctions arbitrations will be terminated once implementation of the new determinations is complete. A compliance panel report in Mexico's zeroing dispute has not yet been publicly circulated. The United States was expected to comply by March 17, 2012, in Brazil's zeroing challenge (DS382), but it is unclear if recent U.S. action will resolve the dispute. A July 2, 2012, deadline is in place in the dispute with Vietnam (DS404). The United States is expected to comply by April 25, 2012, in China's challenge to U.S. countervailing duties imposed on Chinese goods (DS379).", "Panel and Appellate Body reports were adopted in the EU's successful challenge of U.S. aircraft subsidies on March 23, 2012 (DS353) (\"Boeing\" case), and the United States is expected to comply by September 23, 2012. In Brazil's dispute over U.S. cotton subsidies (DS267), Congress repealed a WTO-inconsistent cotton program in 2006 (P.L. 109-171), but other programs were also successfully challenged and the United States was found not to have fully complied. The United States later made statutory and administrative changes to the export credit guarantee program faulted in the case. While the WTO has authorized Brazil to retaliate, the United States and Brazil signed an agreement in June 2010 aimed at permanently resolving the dispute. It includes Brazil's pledge not to impose sanctions during the life of the agreement and foresees possible legislative resolution of the dispute in the 2012 farm bill. The United States and Antigua have been consulting on outstanding issues in Antigua's challenge of U.S. online gambling restrictions (DS285); compensation agreements between the United States and various WTO Members in exchange for U.S. withdrawal of its WTO gambling commitments, an action taken to resolve the case, will not enter into effect until issues with Antigua are settled. Also unsettled are long-pending disputes with the European Union (EU) over a music copyright law (DS160) and a statutory trademark provision affecting property confiscated by Cuba (DS176)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["This report provides a summary of the status of U.S. compliance efforts in pending World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes that have resulted in adverse rulings against the United States. The report focuses on cases in which panel and Appellate Body reports have been adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, an action sending the disputes into the compliance phase of the WTO dispute process. Although the United States has complied with adverse rulings in many past WTO disputes, there are 14 pending cases in which the United States is facing compliance deadlines in 2012; deadlines have expired but the United States has not yet fully implemented the WTO decisions involved; or the United States has taken action, including the enactment of legislation, but the prevailing parties in the dispute continue to question whether the United States has fully complied and, as in one case, continue to impose WTO-authorized trade sanctions. Compliance in these cases may implicate either legislative or administrative action by the United States, or both.", "The report begins with an overview of WTO dispute settlement procedures, focusing on the compliance phase of the process, followed by a discussion of U.S. laws relating to WTO dispute resolution proceedings. The report then lists pending WTO disputes in the compliance phase categorized by subject matter: trade remedies, subsidies, trade in services, and trade-related intellectual property rights. Disputes are listed in chronological order based on the date on which the panel and any Appellate Body in the case were adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. Each entry contains a discussion of major issues and U.S. compliance history. Long-standing cases also include a section titled \"Recent Developments\" discussing the latest activity in the dispute."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "WTO Dispute Settlement Procedures", "paragraphs": ["WTO disputes are conducted under the terms of the WTO Understanding on the Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (Dispute Settlement Understanding or DSU). The DSU, which entered into force with the establishment of the World Trade Organization on January 1, 1995, carries forward and expands upon dispute settlement practices developed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The DSU is administered by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), which is composed of all WTO Members. Where individual WTO agreements contain special or additional dispute settlement rules that differ from those in the DSU (e.g., expedited timelines for subsidy disputes in the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures), the former will prevail. A list of these agreements and rules is contained in Appendix 2 of the DSU. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) represents the United States in the WTO and in WTO disputes.", "WTO dispute settlement may be characterized as a three-stage process: (1) consultations; (2) panel and, if requested, Appellate Body (AB) proceedings; and (3) implementation. Within this framework, the DSB establishes panels; adopts panel and appellate reports; authorizes countermeasures when requested; and monitors the implementation of dispute settlement results. The establishment of panels, adoption of panel and AB reports, and authorization of countermeasures are decisions that are subject to a \"reverse consensus\" rule under which the DSB agrees to these actions unless all DSB Members object. In effect, these decisions are virtually automatic. Article 23 of the DSU requires a complaining Member to act in accordance with the DSU when it initiates a dispute, including making any internal determination that another Member has violated a WTO obligation consistent with the WTO decision in the case and following DSU procedures to set a deadline by which the defending Member must comply, determining the level of sanctions for non-compliance, and obtaining authorization from the DSB to impose any such sanctions.", "After the DSB adopts an adverse panel and any Appellate Body report, the defending Member must inform the DSB of its compliance plans. If it is impracticable for the Member to comply immediately, the Member will be allowed a \"reasonable period of time\" to do so. If the Member proposes a compliance period and it is not approved by the DSB, the disputing parties may negotiate a deadline themselves. If this fails, the length of the period will be arbitrated. A WTO Member found to have violated WTO obligations is expected to comply by withdrawing the offending measure by the end of the established compliance period, with compensation and temporary retaliation available to the prevailing party as alternative remedies. Full compliance is the preferred outcome, however, so as to ensure that negotiated rights and obligations are preserved and maintained.", "Article 22 of the DSU provides that if the prevailing Member in a dispute believes that the defending Member has not implemented the WTO rulings and recommendations by the end of the established compliance period, it may request the other Member to negotiate a compensation agreement or it may ask the DSB for authorization to suspend WTO concessions, usually to impose higher tariffs on selected imports from the defending country. The Member may choose the latter option without first requesting compensation. In some cases, the prevailing party may agree to extend the original compliance deadline instead of immediately seeking a remedy.", "If a prevailing Member does choose to suspend concessions, it is expected to do so in the same sector in which the WTO violation was found, but if the Member finds that this is not \"practicable or effective,\" it may seek to suspend concessions in other sectors in the same agreement. If, however, the Member finds that this alternative would also be impracticable or ineffective and that \"the circumstances are serious enough,\" it may seek to suspend obligations under another WTO agreement, referred to as \"cross-retaliation.\" A prevailing Member may seek to cross-retaliate if, for example, in a dispute involving trade in goods, the Member does not import a sufficient amount of goods from the defending Member to remedy the trade injury involved or the Member believes that placing tariff surcharges on goods imported from the defending Member would be unreasonably costly for the prevailing Member's economy.", "Under the DSU, the DSB is to authorize the retaliation request under the reverse consensus rule within 30 days after the compliance period expires. If the defending Member objects to the request, however, the proposed retaliation will be arbitrated and the 30-day deadline for approving the retaliation request effectively extended. The objection may relate to the level of nullification or impairment of benefits involved or whether DSU cross-retaliation rules have been followed. The arbitration, which may be carried out by the original panel if members are available, or by an arbitrator appointed by the WTO Director General, is ordinarily to be completed within 60 days after the compliance period expires. The DSB then meets to authorize the retaliation request, subject to any modification by the arbitrator.", "In addition, Article 21.5 of the DSU provides for further dispute settlement proceedings in the event the disputing parties disagree as to whether the defending Member has implemented the WTO rulings and recommendations in a particular case. Once a compliance panel is convened, it is expected to issue its report within 90 days; the report may then be appealed. In practice, compliance panels may require a considerably longer period of time to complete their work where a complicated case is involved. For example, in the European Union's challenge to the U.S. use of \"zeroing\" in antidumping proceedings (DS294), the EU made its compliance panel request in September 2007, panelists were appointed in November 2007, and the panel report was not publicly circulated until December 2008. ", "Because the DSU fails to incorporate Article 21.5 proceedings into the 30-day period for approving countermeasures and the time frame for any subsequent arbitration, a procedural problem, referred to as \"sequencing,\" has resulted. Disputing Members have often filled the gap by entering into ad hoc bilateral procedural agreements setting out timelines for any requested compliance-related proceedings and reserving Members' rights in the unfolding of these proceedings. Such agreements have been entered into in many of the cases discussed below. ", "The DSU provides that any suspension of concessions or other obligations is temporary and may only be applied by the prevailing Member until the WTO-inconsistent measure is removed, the defending Member provides a solution to any trade injury at issue, or a mutually satisfactory resolution of the dispute is reached. Moreover, if a prevailing Member is ultimately authorized to impose countermeasures, the Member is not required to implement them.

Under the retrospective U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty system, DOC ordinarily makes a final assessment of the duties owed on dumped or subsidized goods in an administrative review conducted after the goods are imported. The review covers goods that enter the United States during a specified prior 12-month period. Until this final duty assessment is made for particular goods, importers must deposit estimated duties with CBP on entry. Canada argued that, where a DOC or ITC determination in an antidumping or countervailing duty proceeding is found to violate a WTO obligation, Section 129(c)(1) effectively prohibits the United States from fully complying with the WTO decision by preventing it from refunding estimated duties deposited with CBP before the date that the Section 129 Determination is implemented. In other words, because the duty deposits supported by the challenged determination would no longer have a WTO-consistent basis, Canada argued that they must be returned.", "In response to Canada's claim, the United States maintained that Section 129(c)(1) addresses only the treatment of imports entered after the implementation date and does not govern the treatment of prior entries for which final duties have not yet been calculated. The United States further argued that the statute does not mandate any particular treatment of these prior unliquidated entries and that the United States has other legal options for dealing with them, including establishing a new dumping or subsidy margin by using a WTO-consistent methodology in an administrative review of the entries or, in the event the duty order or orders were revoked as a result of the WTO proceeding, revising the duty rate in response to a domestic court decision involving the earlier entries.", "In a report issued in July 2002, the WTO panel concluded that Canada failed to establish that the statute either required WTO-inconsistent action on the part of the United States or precluded the United States from taking action in accordance with its WTO obligations.

Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). First, the court, using tools of statutory construction, determines whether Congress has clearly spoken to the issue at hand. Second, if the underlying statute is silent or ambiguous, the court decides whether the agency's construction of the statute is permissible and will defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute provided it is reasonable. It has also been argued that, in considering whether an agency construction is reasonable for purposes of the second prong of the Chevron test, the court should apply the canon of construction articulated by the Supreme Court in 1804 in Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804). This canon holds that where a statute does not require a specific interpretation, that is, it permits more than one interpretation, it should be interpreted consistently with U.S. international obligations. In the current context, the international obligation would be that contained in a WTO agreement, either by itself or as interpreted in one or more WTO decisions. Plaintiffs thus argue, on the basis of the Charming Betsy canon, that an agency interpretation that violates a WTO obligation is unreasonable under Chevron step two.", "Because the underlying cause of action in domestic legal challenges to the agency actions described above is based in the Tariff Act and not on a provision of a WTO agreement, courts have not viewed Section 102(c) of the URAA as preventing them from hearing a WTO-based argument in these challenges. When faced with such arguments, courts may deem WTO decisions to be \"persuasive\" or a source of useful reasoning, \"if sound\" to inform a court's decision, but state that WTO decisions are not binding on the United States, U.S. agencies, or the judiciary. Most recently, courts have made clear that, given the statutory scheme established in the URAA for regulatory implementation of adverse WTO decisions, questions as to whether the United States should comply with an adverse WTO decision, and what the extent of U.S. compliance should be, are matters falling within the province of the executive branch. As a result, in ruling on whether an agency's interpretation of a statute is reasonable, courts have rejected Charming Betsy arguments and declined to base their decision making on a WTO decision adverse to the United States where the executive branch has not taken the necessary domestic action to comply."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Pending WTO Disputes: An Overview", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Thumbnail Sketch of Pending Cases", "paragraphs": ["There are currently 14 pending WTO cases in which the United States is the defending (or in the language of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding, \"responding\") party.

Of the 14 cases, nine involve U.S. trade remedies, with the remainder involving subsidies, trade in services, or trade-related intellectual property rights.", "Six of the nine pending trade remedy cases focus on the U.S. practice of \"zeroing\" in antidumping proceedings, discussed in greater detail below. The remaining three are a long-standing dispute with Japan over a portion of U.S. antidumping law governing the calculation of dumping rates for producers and exporters who are not individually investigated by the Commerce Department in an antidumping proceeding; a dispute involving the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, a statute that required the distribution of collected antidumping and countervailing duties to petitioners and interested parties in the underlying trade remedy proceedings; and the application of U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty law to products of China.", "The United States took administrative action to resolve its antidumping dispute with Japan, but has yet to amend a statutory provision at issue in the case. While Congress repealed the CDSOA as of October 1, 2005, and Congress placed additional restrictions on available funds in 2010, the 2005 repeal legislation mandates the distribution to U.S. firms of duties collected on goods entered through September 30, 2007. The European Union and Japan, two complainants who have objected to the post-repeal disbursements, are continuing to retaliate with tariff surcharges on U.S. goods, albeit in decreasing amounts. The United States and China have agreed to a deadline of April 25, 2012, in their countervailing duty dispute.", "As the result of a compliance panel proceeding, the United States was found not to have fully complied in Brazil's challenge to U.S. cotton subsidies and continues to face the possibility of retaliation by Brazil against U.S. goods and possibly U.S. services or intellectual property interests. While Congress repealed or made statutory changes to U.S. export credit guarantee programs that were found by the WTO to be prohibited subsidies and the executive branch made administrative changes to one of these programs under revised statutory authority, Congress also reauthorized payments under two domestic support programs that Brazil successfully challenged as actionable subsidies. Payments under these programs were found to cause serious prejudice to Brazil in the form of significant price suppression in the world upland cotton market. Brazil is currently authorized to impose sanctions to remedy both prohibited and actionable subsidy measures at issue in the case. The United States and Brazil have temporarily resolved their dispute, however, forestalling any application of sanctions by Brazil.

Outstanding issues still remain subject to discussion by the two parties.", "Two long-standing disputes involve intellectual property rights, each of these brought by the European Union (EU).

Under this practice, DOC, in calculating dumping margins for an imported product, disregards non-dumped sales and thus, complainants argue, inflates the dumping margin or establishes a dumping margin where one might not otherwise exist. Of the 21 cases, six are currently in the compliance phase. Two of these cases were brought by the European Union (DS294 and DS350), with one each brought by Japan (DS322), Mexico (DS344), Brazil (DS382), and Vietnam (DS404). The decisions in these cases have resulted in a broad WTO prohibition on the use of zeroing in U.S. antidumping proceedings, a multi-phased process consisting of original investigations, annual administrative reviews, five-year \"sunset\" reviews, and, in some cases, \"changed circumstances\" and \"new shipper\" reviews.", "In response to the first EU challenge (DS294), the Commerce Department in early 2007 discontinued the use of zeroing in the price comparison employed most frequently in original antidumping investigations and recalculated dumping margins in the investigations cited by the EU, issuing new determinations under Section 129 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA). The United States has yet to fully comply with the WTO decisions in this case, the cases initiated by Japan (DS322) and Mexico (DS344), and the second EU challenge (DS350), to the extent that the WTO decisions involve the use of zeroing in other phases of U.S. antidumping proceedings.", "Both the EU (in DS294) and Japan requested authorization from the WTO to impose trade sanctions against the United States for non-compliance with the WTO decisions involved; the United States objected to the proposals and, thus, under WTO dispute settlement rules, the requests were automatically sent to arbitration. In 2010, the EU and Japan agreed to suspend the arbitrations on the understanding that the United States would address outstanding issues by early September 2011. In response, the Department of Commerce issued a Federal Register notice in December 2010 in which it proposed as a general rule to calculate dumping margins and duty assessment rates with an offset for non-dumped sales, that is, without zeroing, in administrative, expedited administrative, and new shipper reviews and, by implication, to eliminate zeroing in sunset reviews as well.", "The dates for resuming the sanctions arbitrations were extended several times, ultimately to February 6, 2012, for both the EC and Japan. Under separate memoranda signed by the United States with the EU and Japan on that date, the suspensions will continue while the United States finalizes the December 2010 zeroing proposal and issues Section 129 determinations using the new methodology in eight AD proceedings challenged by the EU, one proceeding challenged by Japan, and possibly a second proceeding challenged by Japan if U.S. courts do not uphold the revocation of the antidumping order at issue. The sanctions arbitrations are to be terminated once the Section 129 proceedings are completed, that is, on the date the USTR directs DOC to implement the new determinations. DOC is expected to issue the Section 129 determinations within four months of February 6, 2012, and the USTR is expected to direct DOC to implement these determinations within seven days after they are issued. Implementation will be on a prospective basis; that is, the new cash deposit rates resulting from the recalculated dumping margins will apply to unliquidated entries (i.e., entries for which final duties have not been assessed) that enter on or after the date that the determinations are implemented. ", "In September 2010, Mexico requested a compliance panel in DS344, alleging the failure of the United States to comply with the WTO decision as it involves antidumping administrative reviews in general and reviews of the original antidumping order challenged in the case. The panel has not yet publicly circulated its report. The United States was expected to comply by March 17, 2012, in Brazil's zeroing challenge (DS382), but it is unclear if recent actions taken by the United States will resolve the dispute. A deadline of July 2, 2012, is set in the dispute with Vietnam (DS404).", "New complaints involving zeroing were filed in 2011 by Korea (DS420), China (DS422), and the EU (DS424), and by Vietnam in February 2012 (DS429). A panel was established in Korea's challenge on February 22, 2012, following the entry into a bilateral procedural agreement by Korea and the United States; among other things, the agreement aims at expediting the panel proceeding and excludes from the panel's consideration U.S. compliance efforts in other WTO zeroing cases that may address issues also raised in Korea's panel request. A panel was established in China's challenge in October 2011 after the United States and China entered into a bilateral procedural agreement under which the parties agreed to expedite the panel process, China pledged to provide the necessary evidence and arguments to support its allegations, and the United States agreed not to contest China's claim that the measures identified in the agreed-upon panel request are inconsistent with the relevant section of the WTO Antidumping Agreement, an approach the United States has taken in recent cases in which the use of zeroing in initial investigations was challenged. The panel was appointed on December 21, 2011. The complaint by the EU remains in consultations, as does the complaint by Vietnam, which involves a variety of antidumping issues.", "Finally, 11 other WTO complaints have cited the U.S. use of zeroing; some of these disputes were resolved through the panel process, while others remain in consultations or have been otherwise settled. To date, more than 25 WTO panel and Appellate Body reports have been rendered on this issue.", "The conduct of antidumping investigations and the imposition of antidumping duties are subject to obligations in the WTO Agreement on Antidumping and Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), which permits the imposition of an antidumping duty on an imported product \"not greater in amount than the margin of dumping in respect of such product.\" While neither of these agreements expressly address the use of zeroing in antidumping investigations or in the various reviews and duty assessments carried out in antidumping proceedings, WTO panels and the Appellate Body have found that the use of zeroing in original investigations, as applied in two types of price comparisons, is inconsistent with obligations in Article 2.4.2 of the WTO Antidumping Agreement, a provision requiring WTO Members to determine dumping margins by comparing normal and export values of \"all comparable export transactions.\" In addition, WTO panels and the Appellate Body have concluded that the use of zeroing in administrative and new shipper reviews violates GATT and Antidumping Agreement prohibitions on imposing antidumping duties that exceed the dumping margin for the goods under investigation. Further, reliance on zeroing-based dumping margins in mandatory five-year sunset reviews of antidumping duty orders has been found to violate Article 11.3 of the WTO Antidumping Agreement on the ground that such reliance taints the fundamental determination made in sunset reviews, namely, whether revocation of the antidumping order is likely to lead to the recurrence or continuation of dumping and injury. ", "As a result of these cases, the use of zeroing has been found to be broadly prohibited in the calculation of dumping margins in U.S. antidumping proceedings, both as a general practice and as applied in particular proceedings. Moreover, findings in related compliance panel proceedings that a WTO decision faulting the use of zeroing in an original antidumping investigation continues to apply with respect to subsequent annual administrative reviews are particularly important for the U.S. \"retrospective\" antidumping duty system of which administrative reviews are a key component. It has also been found in these cases that, where goods have entered the United States before the end of the compliance period established in a WTO dispute but final duties have not been collected, zeroing-based duties may not be applied to such goods once the compliance period has ended. In addition, the Appellate Body has found that an additional claim may be made in an initial WTO complaint against zeroing, namely, the \"continued use\" of the practice in subsequent domestic proceedings relating to a particular antidumping duty order. ", "As mentioned earlier, the United States has responded to these decisions by prospectively eliminating the use of zeroing in original investigations under a regulatory modification issued by the Commerce Department under Section 123(g) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act and finalizing its December 2010 regulatory modification on the use of zeroing in subsequent phases of antidumping proceedings. Where the use of zeroing in an individual original antidumping investigation has been challenged, the United States has resolved the case by the issuance of a Section 129 Determination in which the dumping margin in question has been recalculated without the use of zeroing. The United States has not contested recent complaints of this type before the panel.", "It is not clear that prospective modification of U.S. zeroing practice\u2014that is, its application to new proceedings only\u2014and the issuance of case-by-case recalculations under Section 129 will be sufficient to satisfy the concerns of all WTO complainants. The EU, however, appears to have dropped any demands that it had for the refund of zeroing-based duties paid after the expiration of the compliance periods in its zeroing cases, given that the memorandum that the EU signed with the United States in February 2012 aimed at resolving its zeroing disputes with the United States provides that the new WTO-compliant dumping margins to be calculated by the United States will be applied only to future entries of merchandise. ", "The United States has been critical of the Appellate Body's broad prohibition on the use of zeroing at meetings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body and in related documents circulated to Members. In addition, the United States submitted proposals in June 2007 to the WTO Negotiating Group of Rules, which has been negotiating revisions to antidumping and subsidy rules in the Doha Round, asking that negotiators evaluate the reasoning of the WTO panels that have examined the issue of zeroing and stating that \"the proper resolution of this issue requires clear text providing that margins of dumping may be determined without offsets for non-dumped transactions, consistent with the long-held concept of dumping.\" The United States also proposed revised language for the Antidumping Agreement to this effect. While the draft negotiating text issued by the Chairman of the Doha Negotiating Group in November 2007 contained proposed language reflecting U.S. concerns, the draft text issued in December 2008 does not contain such language and instead notes that, with regard to zeroing, \"[d]elegations remain profoundly divided on this issue,\" with positions ranging from \"insistence on a total prohibition of zeroing irrespective of the comparison methodology used and in respect of all proceedings to a demand that zeroing be specifically authorized in all contexts.\" Notwithstanding these uncertainties, including the continued inability of WTO Members to complete the Doha Round, the United States stated at a February 2012 meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body that \"it will continue to press in ongoing WTO negotiations for affirmation that 'zeroing' is consistent with WTO rules.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Domestic Legal Basis for Zeroing", "paragraphs": ["Although the Tariff Act of 1930, at Section 735(A), 19 U.S.C. Section 1677(35), defines the terms \"dumping margin\" and \"weighted average dumping margin,\" it does not expressly address the practice of zeroing. Using the Chevron standard of judicial review, U.S. courts have held that the statute does not unambiguously require zeroing, but that the Commerce Department's interpretation of the statute as allowing the practice is a permissible one. Courts have also refused to implement adverse WTO decisions on zeroing, leaving determinations as to \"whether, when, and how\" to comply with such rulings to the executive branch. ", "Further, the U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) ruled in July 2009 that the Commerce Department's determination under Section 123 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act to eliminate the use of zeroing in average-to-average comparisons in original antidumping investigations and to offset sales made at less than fair value with fair value sales, an action taken in response to the WTO decision in DS294, was based on a reasonable interpretation of U.S. antidumping law for purposes of Chevron and was thus in accordance with law. As discussed earlier, Section 123 sets out statutory requirements for U.S. regulatory modifications taken to implement WTO decisions. Thus, in its Chevron analysis, the court also considered that the department was undertaking this interpretation in the context of statutory authorities and requirements with an international dimension, stating that the \"deference accorded to Commerce's interpretation [under Chevron ] is at its highest when that agency acts under the authority of a Congressional mandate to harmonize U.S. practices with international obligations, particularly when it allows the Executive Branch to speak on behalf of the U.S. to the international community on matters of trade and commerce.\" The court further held that, because the Section 123 action was in accordance with law, the department's use of this new approach in a Section 129 Determination taken to comply with the WTO decision was \"not unlawful.\" In October 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), in a decision focused on the Section 129 claim, found that the department's Section 129 Determination \"reflects Commerce's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute\" and affirmed the USCIT decision. ", "In March 2011, however, the CAFC ruled in Dongbu Steel Co. v. United States that DOC's use of zeroing in administrative reviews while abandoning it in initial investigations was an arbitrary interpretation of the statute for purposes of Chevron step two, vacating and remanding the contrary USCIT judgment and remanding to DOC for further proceedings to enable DOC to explain its reasoning. The court found, in part, that the government's decision to implement an adverse WTO decision \"standing alone does not provide sufficient justification for the inconsistent statutory interpretations.\" The court stated in summary:", "our prior case law does not address the situation at hand where Commerce has decided to interpret 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677(35) differently based on the nature of the antidumping proceeding at issue. Applying Chevron step two to this ambiguous statute, we conclude that the agency has not provided a reasonable explanation for why the statute supports such inconsistent interpretations.... We accordingly vacate the decision of the Court of International Trade and remand for further proceedings to give Commerce the opportunity to explain its reasoning. It may be that Commerce cannot justify using opposite interpretations of 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677(35) in investigations and in administrative reviews. Under such circumstances, Commerce is of course free to choose a single consistent interpretation of the statutory language.", "In a subsequent case, JTEKT Corp. v. United States , DOC explained to the CAFC that the reason for continuing to use zeroing in administrative reviews was that investigations and administrative reviews are \"different proceedings with different purposes,\" with the dumping margin calculation in the former used to determine if an antidumping order will be imposed and the dumping margin calculation in the latter used to determine the amount of the duty assessment on entries subject to the order. In response, the court ruled in June 2011 that DOC had \"failed to address the relevant question\u2014why is it a reasonable interpretation of the statute to zero in administrative reviews, but not in investigations?\"\u2014and again vacated and remanded.", "The U.S. Court of International Trade remanded the case to the Commerce Department on December 15, 2011, ordering the department to issue a redetermination in which it reconsiders its decision in the administrative review at issue; to modify its decision or explain how the language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677(35) may be construed differently as to the use of zeroing whether an original investigation or an administrative review is involved; and, if the department modifies its decision and decides not to apply zeroing or to make some other change, to redetermine the dumping margin for the exporter involved. The court stated that to be adequate under the CAFC standard articulated in Dongbu and JTEKT , discussed above, \"any such explanation must identify a ' basis in the statute for reading 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677(35) differently in administrative reviews than in investigations' \u2026 and must explain why the differences between antidumping investigations and antidumping administrative reviews, 'make it reasonable to continue zeroing in one phase, but not the other.'\"", "In Union Steel v. United States , a February 2012 decision of the USCIT, the court accepted the department's more expansive explanation and upheld the continued use of zeroing in administrative reviews. The department provided three reasons for its different approaches: (1) zeroing has been was the department's \"preferred method\" and has been consistently upheld by the courts; (2) the difference in procedures was the result of the department's decision to comply with WTO decisions; and (3) there exist inherent differences in the nature and purpose of investigations and reviews. Regarding the third rationale, the department contrasted the fact that investigations focus on \"overall pricing behavior of an exporter in order to establish an antidumping duty order\" while reviews are used to set final rates to be used to assess antidumping duties. The court stated that, in reviews, \"it is reasonable for the agency to look for more accuracy, which it achieves in some measure through monthly averaging, and also for the agency to look for the full measure of duties resulting therefrom, which it better achieves through zeroing.\" The court thus concluded that's \"when it comes to reviews, which are intended to more accurately reflect commercial reality, Commerce is permitted to unmask dumping behavior in a way that is not necessary at the investigation stage.\" Considering these reasons in the context of a statute that is silent on the matter of zeroing, the court held that Commerce did not abuse its discretion in changing only its investigation methodology and acted reasonably in applying the antidumping statute to conform to the different purposes of the two.

Under Section 703 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. Section 1673, antidumping duties will be imposed if DOC determines that dumping exists, that is, that a product is sold, or likely to be sold, in the United States at less than its fair value, and ITC determines that the dumped imports cause, or threaten to cause, material injury to a domestic industry. At issue in the WTO case were the manner in which DOC calculated the dumping margins in these cases, that is, the amount by which the fair market or \"normal\" value of the product under investigation exceeded the export price, and elements of the affirmative material injury determination made by the ITC.", "DOC calculates dumping margins for individual exporters, as well as an \"all others\" rate for firms that are not investigated individually. Under Section 735(c)(5)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. Section 1673d(c)(5)(A), the \"all others\" rate is to be based on rates determined for individually investigated producers, excluding any zero and de minimis margins (i.e., margins of less than 2%) and any margins determined \"entirely\" under \"facts available.\" The department uses \"facts available\" whenever necessary information is not on the public record or any person involved in the investigation withholds requested information, fails to provide information in a timely manner, significantly impedes an investigation, or provides information that cannot be properly verified. When the department decides to use \"facts available,\" it needs to determine what is the most appropriate information on which to base the dumping margin and whether a party has failed to cooperate in such a manner that an adverse inference against it is warranted.", "Also at issue was the test used by the United States to determine if sales were \"in the ordinary course of trade\" and therefore included in the calculation of normal value. The Antidumping Agreement requires that sales not made \"in the ordinary course of trade\" are to be excluded from this calculation, but the agreement neither defines this concept nor establishes a general test for determining whether sales fall within this category. In the case at hand, the \"arm's length\" pricing test used by the United States to determine whether sales made by exporters and producers to affiliated customers were \"in the ordinary course of trade\" was argued to unfairly exclude certain low-priced sales and therefore to increase normal value and consequently inflate the dumping margin for the goods under investigation.", "In 2001, the WTO panel, as upheld by the Appellate Body, found that the United States was in violation of the WTO Antidumping Agreement because (1) U.S. law requires, in effect, that any dumping margins based in part on \"facts available\" be used in calculating the \"all others\" rate; (2) the Commerce Department improperly applied \"facts available\" in calculating dumping margins for producers who were individually investigated; and (3) the department improperly determined the normal value of the goods under investigation due to the manner in which it determined whether sales were \"in the ordinary course of trade.\" While the panel had focused on the \"arm's length\" test, the Appellate Body looked at the combined operation of two tests used by the department in determining whether goods were \"in the ordinary course of trade\"\u2014the \"arm's length\" test and the related and even more limited \"aberrationally high\" test\u2014finding a \"lack of even-handedness\" that disadvantaged exporters. As stated by the Appellate Body, the \"combined application of these two tests operated systematically to raise normal value, through the automatic exclusion of marginally low-priced sales, coupled with the automatic inclusion of all high-priced sales, except those proved, upon request, to be aberrationally high priced.\" The Appellate Body reversed the panel on a related point, finding that the United States was not in violation of its WTO obligations regarding the calculation of normal value when it replaced home market sales to affiliates that were excluded under the \"arm's length\" test with downstream home market sales by the affiliates to independent purchasers.", "The Appellate Body also ruled against the United States with respect to the ITC's injury determination, reversing two panel findings favorable to the United States. First, in contrast to the panel, the AB found that ITC had not applied a provision of the antidumping statute addressing \"captive production\" consistently with the Antidumping Agreement. \"Captive production\" refers to the situation in which a domestic producer does not sell the domestic counterpart of the product under investigation to unrelated parties (the \"merchant market\") but instead processes it into a higher-value good downstream. Second, the AB determined that the ITC had not found a causal link between the dumped imports and material injury to the domestic industry involved. The AB also found, however, that there was an insufficient factual record to allow completion of the required causation analysis.", "The original compliance period in the case, which had been determined by arbitration, expired November 23, 2002.

As described by the WTO Appellate Body, the WTO dispute settlement system is one under which \"compliance has to be accomplished at the latest from the end of the reasonable period of time [i.e. the compliance period] with prospective effect.\" At the same time, due to the U.S. retrospective system, there were goods that had entered the United States before the date on which the compliance period ended but for which final duty assessments would not be made until after this date, or for which final assessments were made before this date, but the duties were not collected until after the period expired.

Under the statute, if DOC finds that available information does not permit it to determine normal value under the rules that are ordinarily applicable in U.S. antidumping investigations, DOC must make this determination \"on the basis of the value of the factors of production\" used in producing the product, adding certain other costs and expenses and base its valuation of these factors on the best available information regarding the valuation of such factors in a market economy country or countries that DOC considers to be appropriate.", "If DOC finds that available information is inadequate for these purposes, it is to determine normal value on the basis of the price at which merchandise that is (1) comparable to that under investigation, and (2) that is produced in one or more market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the NME country involved, is sold in other countries, including the United States. Assuming that a Chinese product is subsidized and that this subsidization results in a lower domestic sale price, the NME methodology generally produces a higher fair market value than would result if the actual sale price in China were used.

The Commerce Department changed its policy in 2006 in accepting the CVD petition in Coated Free Sheet Paper from the People's Republic of China and in issuing affirmative preliminary and final subsidy determinations in the resulting CVD investigation. Although the U.S. International Trade Commission issued a negative final material injury determination in the Coated Free Sheet Paper investigation, thus ending the proceeding, the Department of Commerce issued CVD orders in subsequent CVD investigations involving Chinese products, with more than 20 CVD orders on Chinese goods in effect as of October 2011.

As discussed above, the use of NME surrogate country methodology in an antidumping investigation generally produces an unsubsidized (and likely higher) price for normal value, the subsidy later being captured in the margin of dumping. In such situations, subsidization is thus offset not only by the CVD but also by the dumping margin, potentially resulting in a double remedy. In calculating a dumping margin, the Commerce Department is required under Section 772(c)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677a(c)(1)(C), to make an upward adjustment of the export price to account for any countervailing duty imposed on the same merchandise to offset an export subsidy, thus reducing the margin. There is, however, no such requirement or authority where a CVD is imposed to offset a domestic subsidy, that is, a subsidy that is not contingent on export but that may nonetheless benefit exported goods, thus creating a double remedy or \"double counting\" where domestic subsidization is involved.

Regarding DOC's determinations of specificity , the panel rejected China's claims that DOC had improperly determined that lending by SOCBs to the off-the-road (OTR) tire industry was de jure specific, but also found that the United States had not acted consistently with the SCM Agreement in determining that the government provision of land-use rights in one investigation was regionally specific. Regarding U.S. benefit determinations, which, at China's later request, were reviewed only in light of Article 14 of the SCM Agreement and not the price comparison provisions in China's Accession Protocol, the panel found that China had not established that DOC violated the SCM Agreement by failing to conduct a \"pass through\" analysis in the OTR investigation to determine whether any subsidy benefits received by trading companies selling rubber inputs were passed on to OTR tire producers who purchased those inputs; by failing to \"offset\" positive with \"negative\" benefit amounts in the same investigation; and by rejecting Chinese prices and interest rates as benchmarks with respect to various government loans and government-provided inputs and land use rights in the OTR and other investigations. At the same time, the panel determined that DOC had acted inconsistently with the SCM Agreement in the OTR investigation (1) by not ensuring that the methodology used to determine the benefit to tire producers from purchases of SOE-manufactured inputs from trading companies did not result in a benefit that exceeded that conferred by the government's provision of the inputs, and (2) by using average annual interest rates as benchmarks for one company's U.S. dollar-denominated loans from SOCBs. Regarding China's double remedy claims, the panel rejected China's \"as such\" challenge, and reviewing its \"as applied\" claim, found that, while the panel did not doubt that in general the simultaneous imposition of an antidumping order based on NME methodology and a CVD order on the same merchandise likely result in the same subsidization being offset twice, China did not establish that double remedies were inconsistent with the SCM Agreement, Article VI:3 of the GATT, which prohibits the imposition of CVDs in excess of the amount of subsidization, or the GATT MFN article. Regarding alleged procedural violations , the panel found that China had not established that the United States violated the SCM Agreement by not granting China and various Chinese producers extra time to respond to certain questionnaires in the CVD investigations, but that the United States did violate an obligation under the SCM Agreement in using \"facts available,\" that is, facts not provided by China or its companies, in determining the amount of SOE-provided hot-rolled steel that investigated producers purchased from trading companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appellate Body Report", "paragraphs": ["In an appeal by China, the WTO Appellate Body (AB), on March 11, 2011, reversed the panel on two especially significant issues: the interpretation of the term \"public body\" and the permissibility of \"double remedies.\" The AB reversed the panel's finding that the term \"public body\" means an entity controlled by the government and thus its consequent finding that the United States had not violated the SCM Agreement in finding that certain SOEs and SOCBs qualified as such. The AB also completed the analysis on this point and concluded that DOC's determinations in the four CVD investigations that SOE input suppliers were public bodies were inconsistent with the Agreement, on the ground that a public body \"must be an entity that possesses, exercises or is vested with governmental authority\" and not merely an entity that is owned or controlled by the government. The AB also concluded, however, that China had not established that DOC's determination that the SOCBs in the OTR investigation constituted public bodies was improper.", "The AB upheld panel findings on specificity appealed by China. The AB also upheld two of the appealed findings approving DOC's use of foreign benchmarks in determining the subsidy benefit. The AB reversed the panel's rejection of China's claim that the foreign benchmark actually used by DOC to calculate the benefit from RMB-denominated SOCB loans in three investigations was inconsistent with Article 14(b) of the SCM Agreement, a provision governing the calculation of loan benefits, but, at the same time, found that it could not complete the analysis of China's claim under this article.

As result, the AB also found that the United States was also in violation of two other provisions of the SCM Agreement: Article 10, which requires WTO Members, inter alia, to ensure that the imposition of CVDs is consistent with Article VI of the GATT, and Article 32.1, which prohibits WTO Members from imposing a \"specific action\" against the subsidy of another Member except in accordance with the GATT, as interpreted by the SCM Agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of WTO Reports", "paragraphs": ["The Appellate Body report and modified panel report were adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body at its March 25, 2011, meeting.

The test created by the Appellate Body Report appeared to require an additional analysis into what constitutes \"governmental authority\" within the domestic legal system of the exporting Member. There was, in addition, no elaboration in the Report as to how to determine whether the entity in question possessed or exercised such authority. In a CVD case, such an analysis could place a considerable additional burden on the responding companies and governments to provide appropriate data, as well as on administering authorities to collect and analyze all of the appropriate data. It may be difficult in many instances to identify concrete evidence establishing that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were vested with or exercising \"governmental authority\", despite the fact that they were owned by the government. Yet at the same time, governments could and did use SOEs as key instruments through which to manage national economic activity. In such cases, the pricing policies of SOEs in NMEs could be very trade distorting, primarily the provision of inputs and financing at below market rates. Consequently, the Appellate Body Report could make it much more difficult to address trade distorting subsidies provided through SOEs.", "The United States and other Members also expressed concerns over the legal reasoning and implications of the AB's finding on double remedies. As described in the DSB minutes, the United States noted that no provision of the Antidumping Agreement or the SCM Agreement restricted a WTO Member's ability to apply antidumping duties based on NME methodology and countervailing duties concurrently. It further maintained that Article 19.3 of the Agreement, on whose language the AB based its conclusion, was not concerned with the definition and calculation of CVDs and \"still less\" with the concurrent application of antidumping and countervailing duties, but rather with the imposition and collection of CVDs, with the phrase \"appropriate amounts\" referring \"simply to the fact that the CVD on particular imports may vary, even though a CVD should be imposed in a non-discriminatory manner.\"", "The United States further stated that the report gave Members \"no certainty in determining what would constitute an 'appropriate' amount of a CVD in a given situation\" and that it \"appeared to impose the entire burden of proving that there was no 'double remedy' on the importing Member.\" The United States added that the Appellate Body \"appeared to impose significant administrative burdens on Members' trade remedy administrators in the situation of concurrent application of CVDs and NMEs,\" since [\"[i]f required, measuring the effect of a subsidy on the export price of a good and other components of the dumping margin may involve highly complex economic and econometric analysis,\" a measurement that may entail \"significant\" difficulties. In the U.S. view, this situation \"raised serious questions about whether Members would be able to address trade-distorting subsidies by NME Members.\"", "The United States stated at the following DSB meeting that it intended to comply with the WTO decision and that it would need a reasonable period of time in which to do so.

United States , that the application of CVDs on these imports concurrently with antidumping duties calculated under the NME methodology without making adjustments to avoid double counting was unreasonable and inconsistent with U.S. law. In an earlier ruling involving the same CVD order, the USCIT stated that \"[if] there is a substantial potential for double counting, and it is too difficult for Commerce to determine whether, and to what degree double counting is occurring, Commerce should refrain from imposing CVDs on NME goods until it is prepared to address this problem through improved methodologies or new statutory tools.\" The court instructed Commerce that it \"has a choice,\" explaining as follows:", "... The unfair trade statutes ... give Commerce the discretion not to impose CVDs as long as it is using the NME AD methodology. Thus, Commerce reasonably can do all of its remedying though [sic] the NME statute, as it likely accounts for any competitive advantages the exporter received that are measurable. If Commerce now seeks to impose CVD remedies on the products of NME countries as well, Commerce must apply methodologies, including methodologies that will make it unlikely that double counting will occur.

In its August 2010 ruling, the USCIT held the offset to be \"unreasonable\" since it would always result in the unaltered NME AD margin and thus render concurrent AD and CVD investigations unnecessary. The court also found that, \"[p]erhaps even more importantly,\" this practice was inconsistent with Section 772(c)-(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1677a(c)-(d), which lists the specific offsets in dumping margin calculations that are \"permissible\" and held that the offset \"does not comply with the statute.\" The court further stated that it found DOC's tripartite list to be \"exhaustive\" and as such \"a tacit admission that, at this time, it is too difficult for Commerce to determine, using improved methodologies and in the absence of new statutory tools, whether and to what degree double counting is occurring.\" The court remanded again, ordering DOC not to apply CVD law to the goods of the exporter that had challenged the duties on this basis as well as to the goods of a second company even though it had not raised the issue in the litigation.", "The U.S. government and domestic industry defendants appealed the GPX decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).

United States , and that, as a result, the Commerce Department was no longer permitted to interpret the statute as providing authority to impose CVDs on NME products. The ruling thus prohibited DOC from imposing CVDs on the imports in question even if it were able to reasonably resolve the double counting issue or if there were no concurrent antidumping order on the merchandise under investigation. As the court instructed, the department needed to seek legislative authority to apply CVDs to NME countries it if believed that the law should be changed.

In addition, the panel found that the Step 2 program, insofar as it provided for payments to domestic users of upland cotton, qualified as a subsidy contingent on the use of domestic over imported products and was thus prohibited under Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement.", "Third, the panel found that payments under various U.S. domestic support programs, including counter-cyclical payments (CCP), market loss assistance payments (MLA), marketing loan program payments, and Step 2 payments for U.S. cotton producers, were measures that granted sufficient amounts of support to upland cotton to exempt them from the Peace Clause. The panel then found that the payments under the four cited programs\u2014which it characterized as \"mandatory price-contingent subsidies\"\u2014caused serious prejudice to Brazil's interests in the form of significant price suppression in the world upland cotton market for purposes of Articles 5(c) and Article 6.3(c) of the SCM Agreement.", "At the time, CCP payments, market loan program payments, and Step 2 payments were authorized in the 2002 farm bill, while the authority for the MLA payments had expired. Among other findings, however, the panel determined that an agricultural program could be challenged in the WTO even though it had expired so long as the program was in force during the Agriculture Agreement implementation period (i.e., between 1995 and the end of 2003) and continued to have an adverse effect on the complaining Member. This finding allowed Brazil to challenge MLA payments and flexibility contract payments (FCP), the legislative basis of which had lapsed in 2002. Brazil was unable, however, to show serious prejudice from the FCP program.", "The panel recommended that the prohibited subsidies be removed \"without delay\" and specified that this be done at the latest within six months of the date of adoption of the panel report or July 1, 2005, whichever was earlier. The panel cited Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement, which requires that where an export subsidy is found, the panel recommend expeditious removal and specify a time period for such action. The panel also recommended that the adverse effects of the actionable subsidies, or alternatively, the subsidies themselves, be removed, as provided in Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement, that is, upon adoption of the panel report.", "The panel's finding of serious prejudice for the actionable subsidies also implicated a deadline in Article 7.9 of the SCM Agreement affecting requests for authorization to impose retaliatory measures. Provided there is no agreement between the disputing parties on compensation, Article 7.9 accords a prevailing Member the right to make such a request in the event the defending Member \"has not taken appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects of the subsidy or withdraw the subsidy within six months\" after the date the panel or Appellate Body report is adopted.", "The United States and Brazil appealed the panel report, and the Appellate Body, in a March 5, 2005, report largely upheld the panel. The reports were adopted on March 21, 2005. This action effectively established a July 1, 2005, deadline for removal of the prohibited subsidies and an Article 7.9 deadline of September 21, 2005, with respect to the actionable subsidies.", "The United States told the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, on April 20, 2005, that it would implement the WTO rulings, but that it would need a reasonable period to comply and that it had begun to consider its options for doing so. Brazil complained that the U.S. statement was not sufficiently detailed and made reference to the panel's recommended time periods for compliance. The European Union noted that because the subsidies at issue were found to infringe both the SCM Agreement and the Agreement on Agriculture, the United States was entitled to a \"reasonable period of time\" to comply with Agriculture Agreement, that is, a compliance period determined on an ad hoc basis, as ordinarily available under the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responses of the United States and Brazil", "paragraphs": ["In response to the WTO finding that fees charged by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) guarantee programs must be risk-based, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on June 30, 2005, that, as of July 1, 2005, CCC would use a risk-based fee structure for both the GSM-102 and SCGP program.

Brazil proposed sanctions in an amount corresponding to (1) the Step 2 payments made in the most recent concluded marketing year and (2) the total of exporter applications received under the GSM-102, GSM-103, and SGCP programs, for all unscheduled commodities and for rice, for the most recent concluded fiscal year, estimating the annual total for both to be $3 billion.", "On July 5, 2005, USDA announced that, to further comply with the WTO decision, it was sending proposed statutory changes to Congress to eliminate the Step 2 cotton program, remove the 1% cap on origination fees under the GSM-102 program, and terminate the GSM-103 program.

The agreement also recognized both the changes to the CCC programs announced June 30, 2005, and the legislative proposal sent to Congress to repeal the Step 2 program.

The panel thus found that the United States was in violation of its obligation under Article 7.8 of the SCM Agreement to take \"appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects of \u2026 or withdraw the subsidy.\"", "Second, regarding GSM-102 export credit guarantees provided after July 1, 2005 (the deadline set by the original panel), the panel found that Brazil had established that the revised GSM-102 program constituted an export subsidy on the ground that the program continued to be provided against premiums that were inadequate to cover its long-term operating costs and losses and that the program thus qualified as such under item (j) of the Illustrative List. The panel further found that United States was in violation of its obligations in the Agreement on Agriculture in applying export subsidies in a manner that circumvented its export subsidy commitments regarding various unscheduled products (e.g., cotton, oilseeds, protein meals) as well as three scheduled products (rice, poultry meat, and rice). By providing export subsidies both to unscheduled products and to scheduled products in excess of its reduction commitments, the United States was also found to be granting prohibited subsidies in violation of the SCM Agreement.", "The panel based its conclusion that the GSM-102 program constituted an export subsidy on the following factors: ", "(a) The US Government continues to project that new GSM 102 export credit guarantees issued under the new fee schedule will be provided at a net cost to the Government.", "(b) GSM 102 fees are well below the OECD MPR's [minimum premium rates], which we consider to provide an informed appraisal of the level of fees necessary to cover the long-term, operating costs and losses of an export credit guarantee programme;", "(c) Elements of the structure, design and operation of the GSM 102 programme indicate that the programme is not designed to cover the long term operating costs and losses of that programme.", "The compliance panel's conclusion in (c) resulted from the following considerations: \"the CCC's access to funds from the US Treasury, which facilitates the functioning of the programme\"; \"the fact that GSM 102 fees do not vary with foreign obligor risk\"; and \"the fact that the one percent fee cap has not been repealed and in our view prevents the adoption of risk-based fees (notably due to the insufficient 'scaling' of GSM 102 fees [as risk increases]).\" The panel ultimately found that the United States had failed to bring its measures into conformity with the Agreement on Agriculture and to \"withdraw the subsidy without delay\" as recommended by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body pursuant to Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement.", "Both the United States and Brazil appealed. In a report issued June 2, 2008, the Appellate Body largely upheld the compliance panel, though taking issues with an aspect of the panel's methodology regarding the existence of export subsidization. The Appellate Body reversed the panel's intermediate conclusion that the GSM-102 program would be run at a net cost to the government on the ground that the panel had not accorded sufficient weight to data provided by the United States concerning re-estimates of initial subsidy estimates for the three challenged programs for 1992-2006. The United States had argued that the re-estimates demonstrated that the programs \"were in fact not provided at a net loss to the US Government even before the United States took any measures to comply with the DSB recommendations\" in the case. At the same time, the Appellate Body upheld the panel's ultimate conclusion that the revised program fell within the scope of item (j) and thus constituted an export subsidy, determining that the panel's findings on the structure, design, and operation of the revised GSM 102 program provided \"a sufficient evidentiary basis for the conclusion that it is more likely than not that \u2026 [it] operates at a loss.\" ", "The WTO Dispute Settlement Body adopted the reports on June 25, 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2008 Farm Bill Amendments", "paragraphs": ["On June 18, 2008, a week before the compliance panel and appellate reports were adopted, President George W.

Section 3101 of the act made statutory changes affecting U.S. export credit guarantee programs, changes that the bill Managers believed \"satisfy U.S. commitments to comply with the Brazil cotton case with regard to the export credit programs.\" The act repealed the GSM-103 intermediate export credit guarantee program and the Supplier Credit Guarantee Program (SCGP) and eliminated the 1% cap on origination fees under the GSM-102 program, a requirement contained in 7 U.S.C. Section 5622(b). While leaving the GSM-102 program intact, Congress placed new requirements on the Secretary of Agriculture in administering the program, including \"work[ing] with industry to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that risk-based fees associated with the guarantees cover, but do not exceed, the operating costs of and losses over the long term.\" The phrase \"long term\" is defined in the statute as \"a period of 10 or more years.\" In addition, Congress directed the Commodity Credit Corporation to make available for GSM-102 programs each year through FY2012 a maximum $5.5 billion, or \"the amount of guarantees that can be supported by $40 billion in budget authority (plus any budget authority for prior years)\u2014whichever amount is less.\" ", "In addition, Congress reauthorized counter-cyclical payments and marketing assistance loans for cotton and other commodities for the 2008-2012 crop years.

The Arbitrator rejected Brazil's request for a one-time payment based on the Step 2 program; lowered the other amounts proposed by Brazil to a total $297.4 million annually for both prohibited and actionable subsidies (based on the FY2006 figures); and set out conditions under which Brazil could suspend WTO obligations involving U.S. services and intellectual property, or \"cross-retaliate.\" Among other findings, the Arbitrator rejected U.S. arguments that, with the expiration of the statutory authority for the marketing loan and countercyclical payments at issue in the underlying WTO proceedings, Brazil could not pursue countermeasures for serious prejudice resulting from payments under these programs. The Arbitrator's decisions are final and not subject to appeal.", "Retaliation for Prohibited Subsidies", "In examining Brazil's request for countermeasures for the prohibited subsidies, the Arbitrator first concluded that there was no legal basis for Brazil's request for a one-time payment based on past disbursements under the Step 2 program. The Arbitrator found that countermeasures are an exceptional temporary remedy aimed at inducing compliance and that the United States had in fact complied with respect to this program.", "Second, the Arbitrator determined that Brazil could suspend concessions amounting to $147.4 million annually for the continued operation of the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program, based on GSM-102 transactions in FY2006. As summarized by the Arbitrator, Brazil determined the trade-distorting impact of the program and thus the level of \"appropriate\" countermeasures for the prohibited subsidy by determining \"the interest rate discounts secured by creditworthy and uncreditworthy foreign obligors backed by GSM-102 guarantees and estimating the additional export sales obtained by US exporters as a result of these discounts.\" Brazil referred to these two factors as the \"interest rate subsidy\" and \"additionality.\" The Arbitrator modified Brazil's calculations, however, \"in order to more accurately calculate the trade-distorting impact of the GSM-102 programme on Brazil\" and, taking into account other determinations it had made, reduced Brazil's original proposal to the figure stated above. ", "The Arbitrator found that $147.4 million figure was variable, however, and could change annually depending on the total of amount of GSM-102 transactions in the most recently concluded fiscal year. The Arbitrator set out a formula that Brazil would need to use to determine the amount of permissible sanctions for a given year due to these payments, noting that \"the United States does not dispute that it would be permissible for the level of appropriate countermeasures to be determined through a formula, provided that this formula was sufficiently well defined so as to make it applicable in a transparent and predictable manner.\"", "Third, the Arbitrator determined that Brazil could cross-retaliate in order to remedy the prohibited subsidy resulting from the GSM-102 payments, but set conditions on Brazil's use of this remedy. The Arbitrator stated that \"Brazil has at its disposal a sufficient range of imports of goods, including consumer goods, from the United States so as to enable it to suspend concessions in the area of trade in goods alone, without causing itself such economic harm so as to render such suspension 'not practicable or effective,'\" the standard set out in the Dispute Settlement Understanding, taking into account the cumulated $294.7 million in countermeasures the Arbitrator had determined Brazil could impose for both prohibited and actionable subsidies in this case. Based on Brazil's imports of consumer goods for 2007, the Arbitrator identified at least $409.7 million of such goods that could be the subject of countermeasures. For certain consumer goods (food, medical products, and arms), the Arbitrator adopted a benchmark of 20%, finding that a U.S. import share of the good of less than this amount \"constitutes a reasonable threshold by which to estimate the extent to which Brazil may be able to find alternative sources of supply\" for the product. This annual goods \"threshold\" is to be updated, however, under a formula set out by the Arbitrator, to take into account any change in Brazil's total imports of U.S. consumer goods for the same year for which the annual countermeasures are determined.", "Under the decision, if the total level of countermeasures for prohibited and actionable subsidies that Brazil is entitled to for a given year exceeds the updated goods threshold for that year, Brazil may cross-retaliate, that is, suspend WTO obligations involving U.S. services, intellectual property rights, or both, in excess of the goods threshold to the full amount of permissible sanctions for the year. If permissible sanctions do not exceed the goods threshold, however, Brazil may only suspend concessions on trade in goods.", "Retaliation for Actionable Subsidies", "The United States preliminarily argued in the arbitration involving actionable subsidies that, with the expiration of the 2002 farm bill, payments would no longer be made under the marketing loan and countercyclical payments programs at issue in Brazil's WTO challenge and that, because the challenged measures were removed, there was no longer a legal basis for Brazil to impose countermeasures with regard to these payments. Brazil argued that because these programs were reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill in a manner that did not materially change them as they applied to cotton, the problematic payments would continue under the same conditions and criteria as the payments subject to the earlier WTO proceedings. Until the United States achieved what the WTO Appellate Body deemed \"substantial compliance,\" Brazil claimed that it had the right to pursue countermeasures for continuing present serious prejudice. The United States responded that Brazil's conclusions about payments that might be made under the 2008 farm bill and their price effect were speculative.", "In assessing whether the United States had complied, the Arbitrator quoted from the Appellate Body report referred to by Brazil, in which the Appellate Body had stated that for purposes of determining whether a WTO Member has complied in a case, \"substantive compliance is required, rather than formal removal of the inconsistent measure.\" Informed by this principle, the Arbitrator compared the 2002 and 2008 farm bills and concluded that the replacement of the 2002 provisions with new measures that are \"essentially the same\" as those found to be WTO-inconsistent was not a basis for finding that the United States had complied, if the United States had not shown that \"the inconsistencies that were the object of the [prior WTO] proceedings have been remedied.\" Seemingly alluding to possible activity under the reauthorized CCP and marketing loan provisions, the Arbitrator noted that \"any uncertainty about what might happen in the future\" could not dissuade the Arbitrator from \"assessing the adverse effects determined to exist in relation to a measure which did exist and which, on the facts, continues to exist.\" The Arbitrator thus stated that \"although the legal basis for the granting of ML and CCPs has been modified, such payments continue to be offered and may continue to be made under a new legal basis.\" The Arbitrator concluded that, to the extent that it was entitled to review whether compliance has been achieved in a case (a task it earlier admitted was not normally the task of arbitrators), it would not have adequate grounds to conclude that the United States had complied. Further noting that the findings in the underlying WTO proceedings related to the payments under the 2002 farm bill and not to the farm bill as such, the Arbitrator concluded that the United States had failed to establish that Brazil no longer had a legal basis to seek countermeasures for payments under these two programs.", "The Arbitrator ultimately determined that Brazil could impose countermeasures for the actionable subsidies in an amount not to exceed $147.3 million annually. The Arbitrator arrived at this figure by first determining that the world cotton price would have been 9.38 % higher but for the U.S. programs, with adverse effects for the rest of the world of $2.905 billion in marketing year (MY) 2005. The Arbitrator further found that this overall amount needed to be apportioned to Brazil, basing this apportionment on Brazil's 5.1% share of worldwide cotton production for the same marketing year, or $147.3 million.", "The Arbitrator also found that Brazil may cross-retaliate with regard to the actionable subsidies only if the total amount of permissible countermeasures for a given year (i.e., $284.7 million, as adjusted) exceeds the monetary import threshold (i.e., $409.7 million, as adjusted). Since annual countermeasures for the actionable subsidies is fixed at $147.3 million, the use of cross-retaliation will depend on annual increases in countermeasures due to increased U.S. payments under the prohibited subsidy, that is, the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brazil's Preparation of Retaliatory Measure/Bilateral Negotiations to Resolve the Dispute", "paragraphs": ["After the WTO arbitral panel issued its August 2009 reports setting out the permissible scope of Brazil's requested retaliation for both prohibited and actionable U.S. subsidies, Brazil asked the United States to provide it with information on transactions under the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program for FY2008 and FY2009 and the most recent data on U.S. export prices of products for which the United States had made export subsidy reduction commitments (\"scheduled\" products), namely, pig meat, poultry meat, and rice, for 2008 and 2009.

At the same time, Brazil delayed announcing a final list of sanctioned products as the two countries engaged in negotiations on at least a temporary resolution of the dispute. On March 12, 2010, however, Brazil notified the WTO that, beginning on April 7, it intended to impose up to $829.3 million in retaliation against the United States, $591 million of which would consist of tariff increases on various agricultural products, cosmetics, cotton textiles, appliances, motor vehicles, and other items.

On April 16, the USDA issued a proposed rule adding Santa Catarina to a list of regions considered free of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), rinderpest, swine vesicular disease, classical swine fever, and African Swine fever, an action that USDA stated \"would relieve certain restrictions on the importation into the United States of live swine, swine semen, pork meat, pork products, live ruminants, ruminant semen, ruminant meat, and ruminant products\" from that region \"while continuing to protect against the introduction of these diseases into the United States.\" On April 20, the parties signed a memorandum of understanding providing for the above-described fund for Brazilian cotton farmers. According to USTR, the fund \"is scheduled to continue until the next Farm Bill or a mutually agreed solution to the Cotton dispute is reached\" and may be terminated by the United States if Brazil imposes retaliatory measures.

The agreement provides for (1) bilateral discussions on U.S. domestic cotton support; (2) semi-annual reviews of the GSM-102 program to determine whether program usage exceeds $1.3 billion for the relevant six-month period and thus whether USDA must implement an agreed-upon increase in program fees; (3) bilateral consultations at least four times a year on issues relevant to the dispute; (4) Brazil's agreement not to impose countermeasures as long as the agreement is not terminated; and (5) upon the enactment of a successor to the 2008 farm bill, consultations to determine whether the statute provides a mutually agreed resolution to the dispute.

The United States is arguing that the EU has not yet removed the largest launch aid subsidies for the A380, which, while not found to be prohibited subsidies in the original proceeding, were nonetheless found to cause serious prejudice to U.S. interests. The United States has also expressed concerns over new launch aid for the Airbus A350, aid that is not covered by the WTO decision in DS316 but that the U.S. maintains exacerbates the subsidy problems addressed in the case.

Article 3 of the Agreement prohibits subsidies contingent on export performance and subsidies contingent on the use of domestic over imported products. Subsidies that are not prohibited, but that fall within the Agreement's definition of a subsidy are deemed \"actionable\" under Article 5 of the Agreement; that is, they may be challenged by a WTO Member if they are alleged to cause one or more types of \"adverse effects\" to the Member's interests: (1) material injury to a domestic industry; (2) impairment of a tariff concession; or (3) \"serious prejudice.\" To successfully challenge a subsidy, the complaining Member must also show that the subsidy is \"specific\" in law or in fact to an industry or group of industries under principles set out in Article 2 of the SCM Agreement. Prohibited subsidies are considered to be specific per se , however, and thus complainants do not need to make this showing when challenging subsidies of this type.

The EU also alleged violations of agreed levels of industry support contained in the bilateral 1992 U.S.-EU Agreement on Trade in Large Civil Aircraft (LCA Agreement), an agreement from which the United States withdrew the same day that it filed its WTO complaint against EU aircraft subsidies (October 6, 2004).

Regarding the EU's prohibited subsidy claims, the panel concluded that the FSC/ETI measures that were in force at the time that the panel was established (provisions that have since been repealed) constituted prohibited export subsidies under Article III of the SCM Agreement, but that the EU had not shown that challenged Washington State tax measures qualified as such.

Financial contribution/benefit (23 DOD Research, Development, Testing and Ev a luation (RDT&E) programs ) : the AB found that payments and access to facilities provided to Boeing under all 23 DOD (instead of just the two programs cited by the panel) also constituted direct transfers of funds and the provision of goods or services and thus financial contributions under Article 1.1; it also upheld for different reasons the panel's finding that DOD programs conferred a benefit on Boeing; Financial contribution (Washington State B&O tax rate reduction): the AB upheld the panel's finding that the state's reduction of the tax rate applicable to commercial aircraft and component manufacturers constituted the foregoing of revenue otherwise due and thus a financial contribution under Article 1.1; Specificity (allocation of patent rights under NASA/DOD contract s ): the AB found that, with respect to the allocation of patent rights under contracts and agreements between NASA and DOD and Boeing, and on the assumption that each allocation is a subsidy in and of itself, the subsidy is not explicitly limited to certain enterprise, that is, is not specific in law; while the AB also found that the panel erred in not examining whether such allocation was specific \"in fact\" as argued by the EU, and thus could not uphold the panel's finding that these measures were not specific, the AB declined to find de facto specificity; Specificity (Washington State B& O tax rate reduction and Wichita IRBs): the AB upheld the panel's findings that the Washington State tax rate reduction is a subsidy that is specific in law and that the Wichita IRBs are subsidies that are specific in fact; Adverse effects (technology effects of aeronautics R&D subsidies): the AB modified and upheld that panel's overall conclusion that the aeronautics R&D subsidies caused serious prejudice with respect to the 200-300 seat LCA market, inter alia, finding that the panel was correct in finding that these subsidies \"contributed in a genuine and substantial way to Boeing's development of technologies for the 787\" in 2004;

Adverse effects ( collective assessment of the subsidies and their effects): the AB found that the panel erred in not considering whether the price effects of the Washington State B&O tax rate reductions \"complement and supplement\" the technology effects of the R&D subsidies so as to cause significant lost sales and significant prices suppression and a threat of displacement and impedance in the 200-300 seat LCA market;

Commitments are made with respect to four means or \"modes\" by which services may be supplied, including supply from the territory of one Member into the territory of any other Member, which is the mode of supply at issue in this case. Each Member's sectoral commitments are set out in a Schedule of Specific Commitments, which is attached to the GATS and considered an integral part of the agreement.

The panel then found that three federal statutes and provisions of four state laws conflicted with these obligations. The federal statutes were the Wire Act, the Travel Act, and the Illegal Gambling Business Act (IGBA); the state laws were those of Louisiana, Massachusetts, South Dakota, and Utah. The panel found that by preventing one, several, or all means of delivering gambling and betting services, the statutes constituted impermissible market access limitations on the number of service suppliers for purposes of Article XVI:2(a) of the GATS or, alternatively, on the total number of total number or service operations or total quantity of service output for purposes of Article XVI:2(c).", "The panel further found that, with regard to the federal laws, the United States could not successfully invoke exceptions in GATS Article XIV for \"measures necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order\" (Article XIV(a)) or for \"measures necessary to secure compliance with\" GATS-consistent laws and regulations (Article XIV(c)) because the United States had not shown that the measures were \"necessary\" to achieve the stated end or that they were consistent with the Article XIV proviso, which requires that measures justified under the exception not be applied \"in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail.\" Under WTO jurisprudence, such discrimination may occur not only between the different exporting Members but also between an exporting Member and the importing Member and thus in this case between foreign and domestic providers of Internet gambling services.", "In an appeal by both parties to the dispute, the WTO Appellate Body, using a different mode of analysis than the panel, nonetheless determined that the United States had made sectoral commitments regarding gambling and betting services.

The AB ultimately found that statutes were \"necessary to protect public morals or to protect public order\" for purposes of Article XVI(a) and that they thus fell within the scope of this exception.

First, Antigua cited Section 5 of the act, which it characterized as expressly allowing an interstate off-track wager to be accepted by an off-track betting system, where consent is obtained from certain organizations. Second, it cited the statutory definition of \"interstate off-state wager,\" which, in pertinent part, includes pari-mutuel wagers \"placed or transmitted by an individual in one State via telephone or other electronic media and accepted by an off-track betting system in the same or another State,\" provided the wagers are lawful in the States involved. In the words of the AB, Antigua thus argued that \"the IHA, on its face, authorizes domestic service suppliers, but not foreign service suppliers, to offer remote betting services in relation to certain horse races.

In a ruling issued December 21, 2007, the Arbitrator determined that Antigua may request authorization from the DSB to suspend concessions under the TRIPS agreement at a level not to exceed $21 million annually.

Regarding possible future action, a fact sheet accompanying the report states as follows: \"The report concludes that WTO action would be justified. However, this is not an automatic consequence. The report does not include any recommendation for action and also suggests that the issue should be addressed with the US Administration, with a view to finding an amicable solution.\" During their July 2009 meeting in Washington, USTR Kirk and EU Trade Ambassador Ashton discussed the EU report \"and its implications for the WTO rights and obligations of the parties concerned.\"", "In November 2008, the Treasury Department and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued a final rule implementing the provisions of the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), P.L. 109-347 , Title VIII.
