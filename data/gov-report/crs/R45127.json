These incidents have included attacks in which data was stolen, altered, or access to it was disrupted or denied. The frequency of these attacks, and their effects on the U.S. economy, national security, and people's lives have driven cybersecurity issues to the forefront of congressional policy conversations. This report provides an overview of selected cybersecurity concepts and a discussion of cybersecurity issues that are likely to be of interest during the 115th Congress.", "From a policymaking standpoint, cybersecurity includes the security of the devices, infrastructure, data, and users that make up cyberspace. The elements of ensuring cybersecurity involve policies spanning a range of fields, including education, workforce management, investment, entrepreneurship, and research and development. Software development, law enforcement, intelligence, incident response, and national defense are involved in the response when something goes awry in cyberspace.", "To help secure and respond to incidents in cyberspace federal departments and agencies carry out their authorized responsibilities, run programs, and work with the private sector. While every federal agency has a role in protecting its own data and systems, certain agencies have significant responsibilities with regard to national cybersecurity. The Department of Defense supports domestic efforts on cybersecurity with its capabilities and capacity, and deploys military assets to protect American critical infrastructure from a cyberattack when directed to do so. The Department of Homeland Security secures federal networks, coordinates critical infrastructure protection efforts, responds to cyber threats, investigates cybercrimes, funds cybersecurity research and development, and promotes cybersecurity education and awareness. The Department of Justice investigates and prosecutes a variety of cyber threats, which range from computer hacking and intellectual property rights violations to fraud, child exploitation, and identity theft.", "Congress passed five laws related to cybersecurity during the 113th Congress and an additional law during the 114th Congress.

Cyberspace can be considered to be the services that use the infrastructure of the internet to deliver information to users through their devices.", "In practical terms, a person becomes a user of cyberspace when they use devices to access services , such as access to online banking, shopping, email, streaming video, social media, or the news. Those services do not exist independently, but rather rely on a common infrastructure of servers and switches; cable and wireless spectrum; and routers to ensure that a user has access to the service. That same infrastructure is used by other services too, such as utilities and shipping companies to ensure that products arrive as intended\u2014or by businesses to develop new products more efficiently and to manage their operations. ", "Therefore, for policymaking purposes, each of those elements (i.e., the services, infrastructure, devices, and user) are parts of cyberspace. The internet is a publicly accessible network within cyberspace, but cyberspace also contains private networks used by businesses and other users to help obtain greater confidentiality of their communications. ", "The United States government does not have a single definition of cybersecurity. However, the Report on Securing and Growing the Digital Economy by the U.S. Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity offers the following definition of cybersecurity:", "The process of protecting information and information systems by preventing, detecting, and responding to unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.", "The concepts of \"confidentiality,\" \"integrity,\" and \"availability\" are defined in U.S. Code as part of the \"information security\" triad. \"Confidentiality\" refers to the attribute that data are known only to authorized parties and not made available or disclosed to unauthorized parties. \"Integrity\" refers to the attribute that data have not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. \"Availability\" refers to the attribute that data are available for access by an authorized party when they choose. These terms apply to the data stored, processed, and transmitted by information technology (IT) systems, but also to the IT systems themselves. A fourth term for information security is gaining prominence in discussions on cybersecurity: \"authentication,\" or the ability to confirm that parties using a system and accessing data are who they claim to be and have legitimate access to that data and system.", "Elements to ensure cybersecurity involve policies spanning a range of fields, including education, workforce management, investment, entrepreneurship, and research and development. Software development, law enforcement, intelligence, incident response, and national defense may be involved in the response when something goes awry in cyberspace."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Attacks3", "paragraphs": ["Attacks against data and systems are possible because IT systems are large and complex. Through their size and complexity, vulnerabilities exist which can be exploited. Consider a single smartphone. That smartphone may have been designed by a company in the United States, but built abroad by another company using material from yet another country. It runs on software built by one company, but modern operating systems borrow code from other companies. All that complexity exists before the device gets to the user. Once the user has the device it will likely be connected to a variety of networks such as a home wireless network, a corporate network, or a cellular network\u2014each with its own infrastructure, and which share common internet infrastructure. The interconnected nature of all these services necessary to ensure the smartphone works further contributes to the breadth and complexity of the IT system, which is where vulnerabilities may lie.", "There are many ways to attack an IT system. Some of the commonly seen attacks are described below.", "Denial of Service (DOS): A DOS attack compromises the availability of data. In this attack, a network or website with information is overloaded with information, monopolizing the system's bandwidth and preventing legitimate users from getting their requests for service through, resulting in the user experiencing the system as unavailable. A DOS attack itself does not constitute an intrusion into the network or website, but it may be combined with other forms of attack to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the network or its data. A distributed denial of service attack (DDOS) occurs when many disparate devices are used in the attack, as is the case when a botnet is employed for a DOS attack. DOS attacks are illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Ransomware : Ransomware is a specific form of malware (or malicious computer software) that installs itself on a user's computer and encrypts the user's hard drive so that the user cannot access her own files. The attacker then typically provides instructions to the victim to provide payment, payable via a cryptocurrency, usually Bitcoin. Upon receipt of payment, the attacker promises to provide the encryption key to the victim so that the victim may decrypt the attacked hard drive and access her files. However, the payment does not constitute a guarantee that the victim will receive the encryption key. Ransomware is illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Data Breaches : A data breach is a form of an attack against a computer system, but not all attacks are breaches. A data breach has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an information system, and at a minimum violates the confidentiality of that system by exposing it to an unintended third party. In this sense, a breach is \"an incident that results in the disclosure or potential exposure of data.\" Disclosure is different from exposure: disclosure entails a confirmation that an unauthorized third party read the data, while exposure means that a third party merely has the opportunity to do so. Data breaches are illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Attacks against data and system integrity : The previous three types of attack attempt to disrupt the availability and confidentiality of data on a system. Integrity attacks attempt to disrupt trust in the data or the system itself. In an integrity attack on data, a file is accessed without authorization and altered to reflect some information other than what authorized users intend. An example of an integrity attack is someone accessing a system without authorization to change information in a file. Additionally, an entire system may have its integrity compromised by having unauthorized commands executed on that system. An example might be malware that tells a computer to perform an operation without the authorized user's knowledge, while giving the authorized user feedback that the computer is operating as normal. These types of attack are illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. ", "The data and information technology systems of any entity, regardless of size, may be the targets of a cyber incident. Attackers may develop tools and techniques for a specific target and then reuse that tool or technique multiple times to attack other targets. Targets can include countries, multinational corporations, the federal government, large businesses, critical infrastructure entities, state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, academia, small businesses, and individuals. Additionally, attackers may have a particular target in mind, but penetrate their target by going through another entity. As such, partner entities, whether companies or other entities, may face an unforeseen risk of cyberattack based on their relationship to a targeted entity.

While no publicly accessible report has been published regarding a confirmed cyberterrorist attack against the United States, the possibility of one exists. Tighter physical and border security may encourage terrorists and extremists to try to use novel weapons to attack the United States. Persistent internet and computer security vulnerabilities, which have been widely publicized, may gradually encourage terrorists to continue to enhance their computer skills, or develop alliances with criminal organizations and consider attempting a cyberattack against U.S. critical infrastructure, facilities, and activities that support global security interests.", "Cyberterrorists are state-sponsored and nonstate actors who engage in cyberattacks to pursue their objectives. Transnational terrorist organizations have used the internet as a tool for planning attacks, for radicalization and recruitment, as a method of propaganda distribution, as a means of communication, and for disruptive purposes. ", "The vulnerability of critical life-sustaining control systems being accessed and destroyed via the internet has been demonstrated. In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducted an experiment that revealed some of the vulnerabilities to the nation's control systems that manage electric power generators and grids. The experiment, known as the Aurora Project, entailed a computer-based attack on a power generator's control system that caused operations to cease and the equipment to be destroyed. Cyberterrorists may be seeking a destructive capability to exploit these types of vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure but progress toward this goal is uncertain. As noted in March 2017 by then-Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey, \"terrorists have not yet figured out how to use the Internet as an instrument of destruction ... eventually these knuckleheads will.\" ", "There is no consensus definition of what constitutes cyberterrorism. The closest in law is found in the USA PATRIOT Act statute governing \"acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries,\" which includes in its definition of a \"federal crime of terrorism\" some violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). One portion of the CFAA referenced by the USA PATRIOT Act makes it illegal for an entity to do the following:", "knowingly [access] a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access, and by means of such conduct\u00a0\u2026 [obtain] information that has been determined by the United States Government pursuant to an Executive order or statute to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national defense or foreign relations, or any restricted data \u2026 with reason to believe that such information so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation\u2026.", "The other CFAA provision referenced in the USA PATRIOT Act prohibits transmitting \"a program, information, code, or command\" to certain computers (including all government computers and most private ones) and thereby intentionally causing unauthorized damage.", "Some cyberwarfare experts define cyberterrorism as \"the premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives, or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.\" The USA PATRIOT Act's definition of \"federal crime of terrorism,\" with its inclusion of certain CFAA violations as predicate acts, has some similarities to this definition, though the statute is limited to only those attacks with political objectives. However, these provisions are also criminal statutes and generally refer to individuals or organizations rather than state actors. Naval Post Graduate School defense analyst Dorothy Denning's definition of cyberterrorism focuses on the distinction between destructive and disruptive action. Terrorism generates fear comparable to that of physical attack, and is not just a \"costly nuisance.\" Though a DDOS attack itself does not yield this kind of fear or destruction, the broader issue is the potential for second- or third-order effects. For example, if telecommunications and emergency services were completely dismantled in a time of crisis, the effects of that sort of infrastructure attack could potentially be catastrophic. If an attack on the emergency services system were to coincide with a planned real-world event, then cyberterror may be an appropriate metaphor. However, in this case, the emergency service system itself would most likely not be a target, but rather the result of collateral damage to a vulnerable telecommunications network.", "There are a number of reasons that may explain why the term \"cyberterrorism\" has not been statutorily defined, including the difficulty in identifying applicable activities, whether articulating clear red lines would demand a response for lower-level incidents, and retaining strategic maneuverability so as not to bind future U.S. activities in cyberspace."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Federal Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Department of Defense20", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for defending the nation and supporting the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) coordination of efforts for cyber defense, for protecting the defense industrial base (DIB), and for securing the DOD information networks (DODIN).

", "The increasing potential for attacks that might cripple components of CI or otherwise damage the national economy has led to debate about the best ways to protect those sectors. Some, such as the chemical and financial sectors, are subject to federal regulation. The protection of others, such as information technology, relies largely on voluntary efforts. The efficacy of that mix of voluntary and regulatory efforts has long been a source of controversy. ", "In 2013, Executive Order 13636 established an alternative approach, in which the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facilitated a public-private effort to develop a cybersecurity framework for CI sectors. Subsequently, Congress authorized the framework process in the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-274 ). Issued in 2014, the framework consists of three parts: (1) a core set of activities and outcomes applicable to all the sectors, organized into five functions (identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover); (2) a profile describing an entity's current and target cybersecurity postures; and (3) implementation tiers that characterize the entity's current and intended practices.

However, events associated with the rapidly evolving threat environment continue to draw attention to the question of the appropriate federal role in protecting CI. Attacks such as the ones in 2016 using the Mirai botnet have led to renewed calls by some observers for broad security regulations. Attempts attributed to Russia at interfering with the November 2016 federal election have renewed concerns about the security of the U.S. election infrastructure, leading to the controversial designation by DHS of state and local election systems as a subsector under the government facilities CI sector.

", "Legislation focusing specifically on alleviating such obstacles to information sharing in cybersecurity was first considered in the 112 th Congress, but debate about issues such as regulation and privacy continued until enactment in the 114 th . In December 2015, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) was signed into law as part of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 (Division N of P.L. 114-113 ). CISA takes steps to facilitate public- and private-sector sharing of information on cybersecurity threats and defensive measures and to permit private-sector entities to monitor and operate defenses on their information systems. It includes procedures for sharing of classified information; protections for security, privacy, nondisclosure, and correction of errors in shared information; exemptions from liability and antitrust actions for covered activities; and limitations on the uses of shared information by both public and private entities. The Cybersecurity Act of 2015 also makes the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) the lead agency for federal information sharing.", "In overseeing implementation of CISA, Congress might consider a number of factors that might affect its successful application:", "Information that may be usefully shared can be complex in type and purpose, which may complicate determining the best methods and criteria for sharing. The timescale during which shared information will be most useful varies with the kind of information shared and its purpose. A large increase in information sharing could potentially lead to information overload, reducing the effectiveness of the sharing in reducing cybersecurity risks. Protection of confidentiality, privacy, and civil liberties in information sharing remains an area of controversy. The complexity of the current structure for information sharing may complicate implementation and assessment of effectiveness. It includes not only federal agencies and end users such as businesses but also private-sector information sharing and analysis entities (centers called information sharing and analysis centers, or ISACs, established pursuant to Presidential Decision Directive 63 in 1998, and organizations called information sharing and analysis organizations, or ISAOs, established under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Executive Order 13691 of 2015), trade and professional associations, and other mechanisms. Sharing of information among private-sector entities might not be substantially improved by CISA. Even if it is successful, information sharing is only one facet of cybersecurity, and the changes made by CISA might by themselves be of limited effectiveness in improving cybersecurity. Information sharing tends to focus on immediate concerns such as cyberattacks and imminent threats. While those must be addressed, that does not diminish the importance of other issues such as education and training, workforce, acquisition, or cybercrime law, or major long-term challenges such as building security into the design of hardware and software, changing the incentive structure for cybersecurity, developing a broad consensus about cybersecurity needs and requirements, and otherwise adapting to the rapid evolution of cyberspace."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insurance62", "paragraphs": ["Businesses and individuals often use insurance for financial risks that they are unwilling or unable to bear on their own. With the uncertainty and potential size of damages from cyberattacks, entities' interest in insurance against such attacks has been growing in the past few years. Although policies covering cyber risk have been offered for over a decade, the market in general is still largely in its infancy. Much of the coverage is offered outside the regular admitted market made up of insurers fully licensed by the state in which they are operating. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has estimated premiums for cyber insurance at approximately $1.5 billion but recognizes that \"a significant amount of premium\" is missing from this estimate since it is being offered by non-U.S. companies who do not file information with the states. The actuarial data regarding loss probabilities and severities upon which insurers depend to set premiums are still scarce, and policy language is not standardized, with policies generally including low dollar limits and \"a whole slew of exclusions\" to limit insurer risk. ", "The immaturity of the cyber insurance market could be seen as purely a matter of private concern bearing mainly on who may suffer losses from a particular cyberattack. In some circumstances, however, insurance may also be seen to have a public policy purpose. Insurance premiums can cause someone to internalize a risk or a benefit that otherwise might go unrecognized. With security on the internet, for example, being such an interdependent system, such recognition can be particularly important and increase security for everyone. Insurers also often act to transmit valuable information on avoiding and mitigating losses.", "In the 114 th Congress, a Senate subcommittee hearing on cyber insurance was held and legislation was introduced in the House ( H.R. 6032 ) which would have provided a business tax credit for the purchase of \"data breach insurance.\" In addition to the incentive for purchasing cyber insurance inherent in the tax credit, H.R. 6032 would also have required compliance with NIST standards on cybersecurity to be eligible for the credit.", "Congress has enacted laws and programs affecting a range of other insurance markets such as health insurance (Medicare, Affordable Care Act), flood insurance (National Flood Insurance Program), and terrorism insurance (Terrorism Risk Insurance Act).

However, it can make infringement of intellectual property rights (IPR) easier, and identifying those responsible for IPR infringement more challenging. Cyber theft of trade secrets can wipe out the value and competitive advantage of a firm's long-term research, presenting additional, increasingly prominent, barriers to digital trade.

The law imposes several restrictions on internet firms including requiring operators of critical information infrastructure (defined as sectors such as telecommunications, energy, and finance) to store certain data in China, and requiring companies to assist Chinese police and national security agencies. The law's security reviews may force companies to disclose source code, a concern of many U.S. firms who are hesitant to reveal proprietary information about their business intellectual property that could potentially expose them to further cyberattacks. The law states that a key goal is \"secure and controllable\" technology, a term some see as an attempt to promote local ICT providers and lock out foreign firms. U.S. companies and various U.S. officials, such as former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, have raised U.S. concerns about the potential impact of the law.

PPD-41 states that", "response is a shared responsibility among the victims, private sector, and the government; responses must be risk-based to determine which resources to bring to bear; any response must respect the affected entities and must require a unity of effort across federal agencies; and any response should be done in a manner that enables restoration and recovery of operations to the victim, not just retaliation against the hacker. ", "The policy also dictates that a government response is to have concurrent lines of effort. Threat response activities are to be led by the FBI and involve seeking out and delivering a response against the hacker. Asset response activities, as prescribed in PPD-41, are to be led by DHS and involve efforts to help victims mitigate the effects of an attack. The intelligence community is to provide assistance to both lines of effort. ", "Following the release of PPD-41, the government adopted the NCIRP. The NCIRP follows a model developed to support conventional emergency management in the National Preparedness System, especially the National Response Framework.

Instead of prescribing specific actions for agencies to take, the NCIRP outlines how the government is to activate a Cyber Unified Coordination Group to address the specific incidents. This is similar to how the government activates a multiagency group at a Joint Field Office to deliver federal resources in response to a natural disaster.

Such activities endeavor to remove any malware installed on systems, repair damaged systems, and work with incident response teams to restore unadulterated operations. Although DHS is the lead federal agency for such activities, it also relies on capabilities from partner agencies such as the DOD or the intelligence community in providing a response, as well as a critical infrastructure sector-specific agency. The federal government may provide resources to victims, but the victim is not under any obligation to accept federal resources. Victims may opt to respond to incidents with in-house teams, or by retaining cybersecurity firms. If the federal government is invited to assist with incident response, its work may only be made public with the victim's consent, by matter of administrative policy. However, the very action of federal resources being delivered to assist with response to a cyber incident can act as an overt federal reaction, signaling to both other victims and adversaries the options the federal government will pursue for cybersecurity. ", "Frequently concurrent to a response directed at helping victims, response focused on attackers seeks to determine who committed the attack and deliver some form of retaliation. Such activities endeavor to attribute the attack to a group or an individual, and develop options which will both punish the attacker and seek to deter additional adversarial action. Options may include an overt cyber-based response, a covert cyber-based attack against the adversary, announcing sanctions against the group or individual, indicting or arresting those responsible, or using some other form of national power. Although the FBI is the lead federal agency for responding domestically in this line of effort, it will also rely on the capabilities of partner agencies, such as DOD for a cyberattack, the intelligence community for attribution, the Department of the Treasury for sanctions, or the Department of State for diplomatic options.
