Although the COLA situation during 1983 (FY1984) remained unchanged, despite some proposals to modify the 1982 legislation so as to further reduce COLAs, the period from 1984 (the FY1985 budget) to 1986 (the FY1987 budget) was marked by intense debate over reducing COLAs and an actual elimination of the 1986 (FY1987) COLA. Reagan Administration budget proposals in both 1987 (FY1988) and 1988 (FY1989) did not propose any changes in military retirement COLA provisions contained in permanent law, a major change from the previous several years.

However, none of these proposals were eventually enacted into law.

However, the FY1997-FY2005 budgets, enacted in 1996-2004 respectively, contained no changes in the COLA formula. Hence, the FY1997-FY2005 military retirement COLAs were first paid on January 1 of each of those years, respectively, to all classes of military retirees. These nine years are the longest period since military retirement COLAs were first authorized in 1963 in which no legislative changes in the COLA mechanism have been made; the seven years FY1999-FY2005, calendar years 1998-2004, are the longest period in which no COLA cuts have even been proposed, let alone enacted."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background: The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1982 (FY1983)", "paragraphs": ["The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-253 ; September 8, 1982) suspended previously existing permanent law pertaining to cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for federal civilian and military retirees.

However, the legislative process, including the Administration's own proposal, which eventually led to the repeal, included variations in the original Redux COLA formula from the beginning.", "In late December 1998, the Administration announced that it would propose a repeal of Redux that would replace the COLA formula for Redux-eligible retirees with the formula used for federal civil service retirees covered by the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS)\u2014the pension plan for those federal civil servants who were first employed by the government on or after January 1, 1984. The FERS formula is less generous than the formula for pre-August 1, 1986 entrant retirees, but more generous than the original Redux COLA provision. FERS currently operates for civil service retirees by giving them a COLA of the CPI minus one percentage point, if the annual CPI increase is over 3%; a flat 2% COLA if the annual CPI increase is between 2 and 3%; and the full CPI if the actual CPI increase is less than 2%.", "Early Legislative Action: The Senate Bill. On January 27, 1999, the Senate Armed Services Committee reported out S. 4 , the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 ( S.Rept. 106-1 ), which would have offered a military member two choices regarding retirement, of which one would have to be chosen at the 15-year mark: (1) decide to retire under the pre-Redux formula, with full pre-Redux COLA protection, or (2) decide to retire under Redux, including the original Redux COLA formula, but receive an immediate $30,000 cash bonus. The full Senate passed the bill on February 4, 1999.", "Redux Repeal in the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act. There was no House action on S. 4 , noted above; after the Senate passed S. 4 the legislative vehicle for military retirement changes shifted to the FY2000 defense authorization bill. On May 17, 1999, the Senate Armed Services Committee reported out its version of the authorization bill ( S.Rept. 106-50 ), and the bill passed the full Senate on May 27, 1999. The COLA provisions of the Senate bill were identical to those of S. 4 \u2014an option for the individual to select either Redux or pre-Redux COLA formulae. However, the House version of the FY2000 defense authorization was quite different. The House Armed Services Committee's bill, reported May 19, 1999 ( H.Rept. 106-162 ), and the full House bill, passed June 10, 1999, provided the same two options as the Senate\u2014retirement under Redux with a $30,000 bonus or retirement under pre-Redux and no bonus\u2014but the House COLA provisions were less generous than those of the Senate. The House in fact adopted the Administration's proposal for the option involving the $30,000 bonus; members who selected this would have their COLA computed on the same formula as used in the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) as described above. The final version of the bill, however, ( P.L. 106-65 , October 5, 1999, Sec. 641), contained the House plan\u2014the FERS formula was rejected, and those retirees covered by the 1986 Act will have the option of a Redux or pre-Redux COLA formula, depending on whether or not they opt for the $30,000 cash bonus."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY1999-FY2005 (1998-2004) COLA Actions", "paragraphs": ["In each of the seven fiscal years FY1999-FY2005, all military retirement COLAs were first paid on January 1 of those years.

There were no proposals in the Administration budgets and no congressional actions directed at any COLA changes in these years. These seven years are the longest period since military retirement COLAs were first authorized in 1963 in which no legislative changes in the COLA mechanism have been even proposed. Similarly, the eight fiscal years FY1997-FY2005 (calendar years 1996-2004), contained no changes in the COLA formula, the longest such period since 1963 in which no actual changes were made."], "subsections": []}]}}
