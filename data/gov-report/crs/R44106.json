Rather, as discussed below, agencies could have considered at least certain labor law violations pursuant to their authority to (1) make responsibility determinations; (2) establish qualification requirements and evaluation factors; and (3) debar and suspend contractors. Any consideration given to labor law violations was, however, generally within agency officials' discretion prior to the issuance of Executive Order 13673, rather than required, as it is under the order. Also, the types of violations considered prior to the order tended to be more limited than those to be considered under the order.

As previously noted, agency contracting officers are generally required to determine that prospective vendors are \"affirmatively responsible\" for purposes of each individual contract prior to contract award. Vendors who are not seen as affirmatively responsible are \"nonresponsible,\" and are ineligible to be awarded a contract. Responsibility has historically been determined by considering seven \"general standards\" prescribed in statute and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which assess whether the vendor has the requisite facilities, personnel, experience, financial resources, and personal attributes to perform the contract. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case, labor law violations could be relevant to any of these factors. Most commonly, though, labor law violations appear to have been considered in determining whether contractors satisfied the general standard of having a \"satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics.\" This is because, as discussed below, in assessing this standard, agency contracting officers historically considered whether the contractor, or its principals, officers, or employees, had been convicted or indicted for criminal offenses. (See \" What has historically been considered in assessing integrity in the responsibility determination process? \"). Such offenses could have involved labor laws; however, contracting officers were generally seen to have broad discretion as to whether they considered criminal offenses, indictments, or other violations involving labor laws in the responsibility determination process prior to 2008. They were not required to consider this information, as they are under Executive Order 13673. ", "In 2008, Congress established the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and required contracting officers to consult the information contained in it when making responsibility determinations. FAPIIS includes, among other things, information on convictions and certain findings of fault or liability involving federal contractors or grantees holding awards valued in excess of $10 million (total), or their principal officers, within the past five years \"in connection with the award ... or performance ... of a Federal contract or grant.\" While the creation of FAPIIS may have made it more likely that contracting officers would consider certain labor law violations, FAPIIS's information is more limited than the information that would be considered under Executive Order 13673. FAPIIS includes only convictions and certain findings of fault or liability involving \"larger\" contractors and grantees within the past five years \"in connection with\" the award or performance of a federal contract or grant. The labor law violations to be disclosed under Executive Order 13673, in contrast, are not limited to ones \"in connection with\" a federal contract or grant. Executive Order 13673's disclosure requirements also apply to vendors that do not have contracts or grants valued in excess of $10 million, so long as the vendor has one contract whose value exceeds $500,000.

Specifications are descriptions of agencies' technical requirements for supplies or services that include criteria for determining whether those requirements are met , while evaluation factors are factors used by agencies in so-called \"negotiated procurement\" to determine which proposal represents the \"best value\" for the government. Prior to Executive Order 13673, agencies could have drafted specifications that took vendors' compliance with labor laws into account, which, in turn, could have resulted in the bids or offers of vendors who had committed certain violations being found to be nonresponsive and thus ineligible for selection. Agencies could similarly have drafted evaluation factors that gave certain weight in the selection process to vendors' compliance with labor laws, making vendors with poor records of compliance less likely to be selected for award. ", "In practice, however, consideration of labor law violations in these contexts appears to have been limited, in part, because of certain legal requirements regarding specifications and evaluation factors. Specifically, the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, as amended, generally requires agencies to \"develop specifications in the manner necessary to obtain full and open competition with due regard to the nature of the property or services to be acquired.\" The regulations implementing CICA further require that the evaluation factors developed by procuring agencies represent \"key areas of importance and emphasis to be considered in the source selection decision\" and \"support meaningful comparison and discrimination between and among competing proposals.\" In other words, agencies' use of specifications or evaluation factors taking into consideration labor law violations could generally withstand legal challenges only if such consideration was seen as reasonably related to the agency's minimum needs, and not an attempt to \"prefer\" one vendor or group of vendors over others for reasons unrelated to the agency's specific needs.

For example, in one early decision, Domco Chemical Corporation , the Government Accountability Office (GAO) denied a protest of a nonresponsibility determination based on lack of integrity where a contractor employee had been convicted for criminal offenses, income tax evasion, and fraud, and an officer had been indicted. Subsequently, in Traffic Moving Systems, Inc. , GAO similarly denied a protest of a nonresponsibility determination based on the criminal conviction of the corporation's president.", "In other cases, nonresponsibility determinations based on lack of integrity have resulted where an agency finds grounds for suspension, typically involving violations of criminal statutes; or criminal investigation reports suggest wrongdoing.

It is at this point that the contracting officer would assess the responsibility of the vendor(s) in line for the proposed award and, in the case of contractors who had represented that they had been implicated in covered labor violations, the contracting officer would request or review information regarding the law(s) violated. The contracting officer would also invite the vendor to submit any additional information that it deems necessary to establish its responsibility (e.g., mitigating circumstances, remedial measures). The contracting officer would consider all this information in determining whether the vendor is to be seen as responsible for purposes of the contract award. If the vendor were deemed nonresponsible, the contracting officer would turn to the next lowest priced bidder, in the case of procurements conducted via sealed bidding, or the next most highly rated offeror, in the case of negotiated procurements, and assess that vendor's responsibility. (The contracting officer could also refer the vendor to agency suspending and debarring officials for exclusion, as discussed below. See \" Will contractors who disclose violations be debarred or suspended? \"). ", "At no point in this process would the contracting officer weigh Vendor A's record of compliance with labor laws against Vendor B's record in determining which bid is the lowest priced, or which offer represents the \"best value.\" Some commentators have called for vendors' record of compliance with labor and employment laws to be utilized in this way.

Prequalification involves the determination of a vendor's responsibility prior to any solicitation; that is, the \"determination of an offeror's eligibility to compete for a government contract.\" Some states that currently require consideration of contractors' labor law violations in the award of contracts, as Executive Order 13673 does through the responsibility determination process, also rely upon prequalification of vendors. For example, Connecticut bars the award of contracts to persons who have \"been cited for three or more willful or serious violations of any occupational safety or health [(OSH)] act\" or meet certain other criteria. It also generally provides for persons to apply for prequalification for state contracts, a process that includes consideration of whether the applicant is disqualified for OSH violations, among other things. ", "Federal law, however, arguably calls for a different approach, particularly when the executive acts without express statutory authority requiring or permitting the use of prequalification. This is because the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, as amended, generally constrains agencies' use of qualification requirements , or \"requirements for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.\" Among other things, CICA prescribes that agencies take specified steps prior to enforcing any qualification requirement. These steps include (1) preparing a written justification stating the necessity for the requirement and why the requirement must be demonstrated before award; and (2) specifying in writing all requirements that offerors (or products) must satisfy to become qualified, with these \"requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the ... requirement.\" CICA's provisions here have generally been seen to limit (although not prohibit) the use of prequalification by federal agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Will contractors who disclose violations be debarred or suspended?", "paragraphs": ["Contractors who disclose violations of labor laws pursuant to Executive Order 13673 could potentially face debarment or suspension (collectively known as exclusion) as a result of their disclosures, but would not necessarily be excluded as a consequence of disclosing one or more violations.

As previously noted, these grounds encompass \"any ... cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it affects the present responsibility of the contractor or subcontractor,\" as well as other grounds noted in Table 1 below. One or more of these grounds could potentially be found to apply depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case. However, any debarment or suspension proceeding that is conducted would have to comport with the requirements of the FAR, which generally provides for contractors to receive notice and an opportunity for a hearing regarding their exclusion. Such hearings are to take place before any debarment, although they could potentially take place after a suspension. These procedural requirements are intended to protect contractors' due process rights in the exclusion process.", "Where the facts and circumstances of the case are such that multiple determinations of nonresponsibility might be made over time based on the same information, agency officials could potentially be inclined toward exclusion in order to avoid the allegations of impermissible de facto debarment that could follow from repeated determinations of nonresponsibility, as discussed below. (See \"\" What is de facto debarment, and will implementation of the order result in de facto debarment of contractors? \"\"). In other cases, however, agency officials may be more likely to encourage contractors whose disclosed violations could constitute grounds for exclusion to enter into labor compliance agreements than they are to debar or suspend them. Several provisions in the proposed materials implementing Executive Order 13673 could be read to suggest a preference for such agreements, rather than for exclusion.

In particular, Section 8(b)(7) requires that agency contracting officers refer the cases of any \"otherwise qualified\" small businesses that may be seen as nonresponsible to the SBA, which is to investigate the matter and may then certify to the procuring agency as to \"all elements of [the firm's] responsibility, including, but not limited to, capability, competency, capacity, credit, integrity , perseverance, and tenacity.\" If the SBA issues such a certification, known as a Certificate of Competency, the procuring agency is required to accept the SBA's judgment, and may not require the small business to meet \"any other requirements of responsibility.\"", "Neither Executive Order 13673 nor its proposed implementing materials, to date, appear to contemplate any changes in the Certificate of Competency process. This process could potentially serve to lessen somewhat any adverse effects of the order on small businesses\u2014a topic of concern to some commentators \u2014by providing a check upon agency contracting officers and labor compliance advisors and protecting small businesses from nonresponsibility determinations in borderline cases. However, it seems likely that the SBA would continue to base its determinations as to whether to grant certificates of competency upon the same general standards of responsibility used by the procuring agencies and, thus, would also take any reported violations of labor law into consideration when determining whether to issue a certificate of competency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Questions", "paragraphs": ["The questions and answers in this section address the President's authority to impose the requirements of Executive Order 13673, as well as de facto debarment, challenges to responsibility determinations, contractor representations and disclosures on other matters, and penalties for false certifications.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What is the President's authority to impose these requirements?", "paragraphs": ["When issuing Executive Order 13673, President Obama expressly noted the authority of 40 U.S.C. \u00a7121 and the promotion of \"economy and efficiency\" in federal contracting. In so doing, he referenced the specific citation to and general language of provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPASA), as amended, which authorize the President to \"prescribe policies and directives that [he] considers necessary\" to provide the \"Federal Government with an economical and efficient system for ... [p]rocuring and supplying property and ... services,\" among other things. This is the same authority that President Obama and other Presidents have previously relied upon when imposing requirements upon the procurement process, as Table 2 illustrates.", "Many requirements imposed by Presidents under the authority of FPASA have been seen to involve \"housekeeping\" matters, and have not been subject to legal challenge. However, certain requirements have been challenged on the grounds that they exceed the President's authority. Such challenges have generally failed where a \"sufficiently close nexus\" between the challenged requirements and economy and efficiency in federal procurement is seen to exist. In applying this \"nexus test\" in AFL-CIO v. Kahn , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit expressly noted that economy and efficiency are \"not narrow terms,\" and can encompass factors such as \"price, quality, suitability, and availability of goods or services.\" Subsequent courts have taken a similarly broad view, finding that challenged requirements have the requisite nexus if they can be said to have an \"attenuated link\" to economy and efficiency in procurement, or if the President's explanation for how an order promotes efficiency and economy is \"reasonable and rational.\" ", "Only those requirements which are seen to have too attenuated a link to economy and efficiency, or which are specifically barred by a federal statute, will generally be invalidated. Neither seems likely here under current precedents, at least as to the labor violation provisions that are generally the focus of discussions of Executive Order 13673. President Obama, the Department of Labor, and the FAR Council have all proffered explanations of how disclosure of contractors' labor law violations will promote economy and efficiency in procurement. For example, in issuing its proposed guidance regarding what violations are to be considered in implementing the order, DOL emphasized that contractors' labor law violations ", "create risks to the timely, predictable, and satisfactory delivery of goods and services to the Federal Government, and federal agencies risk poor performance by awarding contracts to companies with histories of labor law violations. Poor workplace conditions lead to lower productivity and creativity, increased workplace disruptions, and increased workforce turnover. For contracting agencies, this means receipt of lower quality products and services, and increased risk of project delays and cost overruns. ", "Given such statements, the link between the labor law disclosure requirements and economy and efficiency appears unlikely to be seen as too attenuated\u2014or unreasonable or irrational\u2014under current precedents, which have opined that an alleged link to procurement is not to be seen as too attenuated just because \"one can with a straight face advance an argument claiming opposite effects or no effects at all.\" The Kahn court similarly noted that economy and efficiency can be said to result even if challenged requirements could result in higher prices. Also, no conflicts between specific statutory requirements and the disclosure or consideration of labor law violations in the responsibility determination process have been noted to date.

It can be seen as improper on this basis alone, because it involves agency action that is not in compliance with the law. In addition, conduct that constitutes de facto debarment can be seen to violate contractors' rights to due process by depriving them of protected liberty interests in being able to challenge allegations about their integrity that could deprive them of their livelihood without notice or an opportunity for a hearing. As was previously discussed, notice and an opportunity for a hearing are provided in exclusion proceedings. (See \" Will contractors who disclose violations be debarred or suspended? \"). However, they are generally not provided in the responsibility determination process. Repeated determinations of nonresponsibility made upon the same basis have been found to constitute impermissible de facto debarment, as have agency statements or conduct evidencing a refusal to do business with a contractor without formally excluding the contractor.", "Some commentators have expressed concern that implementation of Executive Order 13673 will result in the de facto debarment of contractors who disclose labor law violations. Others disagree, arguing that vendors will receive more procedural protections under the executive order than under current law, which, as previously noted, generally does not provide for vendors to receive notice or an opportunity for a hearing before being determined to be nonresponsible. Which of these two views proves to be correct seems likely to depend upon how Executive Order 13673 is implemented by the procuring agencies. ", "The potential for impermissible de facto debarment could be said to exist, particularly insofar as the order can be seen as an attempt to standardize agencies' consideration of labor law violations in the responsibility determination process. Standardization could make it more likely for multiple contracting officers to make the same determination as to responsibility based on the same information. Multiple determinations of nonresponsibility based on the same information are not necessarily impermissible, particularly if that information is the most recent information available. However, the order expressly calls for contracting officers to consider labor law violations over the past three years when making responsibility determinations, and determinations based on the same older information could be more likely to be seen as a systematic attempt to exclude a vendor outside the formal exclusion process, than as the result of individual contracting officers independently reaching the same conclusion. ", "On the other hand, agencies could potentially develop practices or procedures whereby they routinely pursue exclusion or labor compliance agreements in situations where there could be multiple determinations of nonresponsibility based on the same older information. If that were the case, de facto debarment could potentially be avoided, although labor rights activists and competing vendors might then raise concerns about the award of contracts to entities that they believe ought to have been found nonresponsible based on their labor law violations. (See below \" Can nonresponsibility determinations be challenged? \"). "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Can nonresponsibility determinations be challenged?", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, contractors are generally not entitled to notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to being found nonresponsible for the award of a federal contract (see \" What is de facto debarment, and will implementation of the order result in de facto debarment of contractors? \"). The cases of any \"otherwise qualified\" small business contractors who might be found nonresponsible must be referred to the SBA, which may certify as to the firm's responsibility (see \" Will there be changes in the Certificate of Competency process used in determining the responsibility of small businesses? \"). Outside of the SBA Certificate of Competency process, however, the FAR does not make any provisions for review or appeal of contracting officers' determinations as to responsibility within (or outside) the procuring agency. ", "These determinations could, however, potentially be challenged in the course of a bid protest before the procuring agency, the Government Accountability Office, or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, the three forums with jurisdiction over bid protests. In such a protest, a vendor that was denied an award because it was found to be nonresponsible could contest that determination on the grounds that the determination is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Alternatively, a vendor that lost an award to a competitor which was found to be affirmatively responsible could seek to challenge that determination, although GAO regulations, in particular, permit challenges to affirmative determinations of responsibility only in narrow circumstances. ", "Prevailing in such bid protests could be difficult, though, because the reviewing tribunals afford substantial deference to the contracting officers' determinations as to responsibility on the grounds these determinations are committed to agency discretion by law, and the procuring agencies \"must bear the brunt of any difficulties experienced during performance.\" This generally means that the protester must show that the contracting officer's determination lacked \"any reasonable basis,\" or was arbitrary or made in bad faith. Moreover, in cases of nonresponsibility determinations, review is generally limited to the information available to the contracting officer at the time of the determination. The review could potentially encompass information not considered by the contracting officer in cases where the contracting officer has made an affirmative determination of responsibility. However, affirmative determinations of responsibility are not necessarily seen as invalid just because information exists that is adverse to the contractor, so long as this information was known to and not ignored by the contracting officer when making the determination. Limitations on jurisdiction and standing could also effectively limit vendors' ability to challenge responsibility determinations in certain cases, since the protest forums will generally only hear protests that are seen to be timely. The protester may also be required to show that any alleged violations of the law are prejudicial to it, in the sense that the protester would be in line for the award but for the alleged violation.

The Clinton-era amendments also called for vendors to make certain representations and disclosures about whether they have been subject to specified legal actions related to violations of covered laws, as the FAR amendments proposed by the Obama Administration would do.", "On the other hand, there are some notable differences between the Clinton Administration's amendments to the FAR and the FAR amendments proposed, to date, by the Obama Administration to implement the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order. For example, the Clinton Administration considered compliance with the broad categories of \"tax laws, labor and employment laws, environmental laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws,\" while the Obama Administration focuses upon compliance with 14 specific federal labor and employment laws and their state equivalents.

The Obama Administration has not proposed any such changes to date, instead leaving in place the preexisting rules regarding notifications of nonresponsibility determinations (i.e., such notifications are generally not made).", "The Clinton Administration's amendments were revoked by the George W. Bush Administration shortly after their effective date, making it difficult to assess what their effects on the procurement process would have been.
