Today's controversies concern, among other things, exactly what hunting, fishing, or shooting sports should be allowed on federal land, and when. S. 2363 seeks to increase the priority of hunting, trapping, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal lands.", "S. 2363 would also address the issuance of import permits to trophy hunters who legally killed Canadian polar bears in the months before the species was listed under the Endangered Species Act. These hunters have not been allowed to import their trophies; the bill would allow specified imports of these trophies.", "The bill would amend the federal duck stamp program to allow electronic sales of duck stamps in any state that meets certain requirements for such sales.

Once the proposed rule to list polar bears as a threatened species was published in January 2007, an extensive campaign was conducted by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to alert hunters to the potential impact of ESA listing on the ability to import polar bear trophies.

It then explicitly excludes from the definition any areas (a) with a treatment that is a normal agricultural practice, (b) with unmanipulated standing crops, or (c) with standing crops that are or were flooded. The last provision appears to exclude flooded cropland, whether naturally or artificially flooded.", "The section defines normal agricultural practice .

First, the practice is to be considered normal if recommended by the state office of the Cooperative Extension System of the Department of Agriculture. In addition, the applicable state game department is to be consulted and, if requested, may be asked to concur.

The Section 107 definition is broader than the FLPMA definition, and arguably could be interpreted to include all federal lands except those belonging to NPS and FWS. As a result, even though most of the rest of the bill appears to target only BLM and the Forest Service, the bill could include lands under other agencies, such as the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Defense (including the Army Corps of Engineers), the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce, all of which have natural resource conservation as a purpose. A similar, inclusive definition of federal lands was used in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which referred to a number of departments as being necessary to establish rights of way on federal lands: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, and the Interior. Also, as multiple executive orders direct all agencies with land to preserve the environment, it could be interpreted that any such agency has as a purpose the \"conservation of natural resources\" and would be covered by Section 107 of S. 2363 .", "If the Section 107 definition reaches more lands than was intended, the scope could be contained by referring to specific management agencies in the definition rather than trying to describe lands.

Trapping is allowed under some circumstances on some federal lands, but the use of traps (particularly a design called leghold traps) has been controversial and is less common than traditional hunting on federal lands. ", "While the definition in Section 107 concerns hunting , the word recreational precedes it 16 times and it is not clear if this modifier applies to hunting as well as shooting and fishing. The bill does not draw a distinction between hunting and recreational hunting. Similarly, the provision addressing licensing in Section 107(b)(9)(B)(i) refers to \"fish, hunt, and trap,\" which also appears to be inconsistent with the definition, which includes trapping within the definition of hunting.

It appears those activities were intended to be included and encouraged on all of the federal public land as defined in Section 107. Recreational shooting, including shooting ranges, on some of the other lands that might be included in this bill would likely be controversial.
