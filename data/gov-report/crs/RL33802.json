A formulary is a set of drugs for which a Part D drug plan, or other health insurer, has agreed to pay a portion of the costs; the formulary may also specify contingencies for payment. Drug pricing policies do not dictate formularies. A drug pricing policy may have no bearing on which drugs will or will not be included in a formulary. Adopting a drug pricing policy from Medicaid, the VA, or even another country does not imply that the formulary is also adopted. In contrast, knowing the extent to which a formulary will include or exclude pharmaceuticals may help to determine which drug pricing policies would make the most sense. For example, if a formulary was to include every drug on the market, a competitive bidding process would not be the most sensible drug pricing policy, since those policies generally involve accepting the best bid and rejecting the other bidders. In contrast, a competitive bidding process may be a reasonable option for a formulary that only includes one drug in each drug class.

Under GSA procurement regulations, FSS prices for brand name drugs must be no greater than the prices manufacturers charge their Most-Favored Customers (MFC) under comparable terms and conditions. In general, MFC is the customer, or class of customers, which receives the best discount and/or price arrangement on a given item from a manufacturer or supplier. To help VA's contracting officers determine the MFC pricing, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide VA a commercial price list for the proposed items, and are also required to disclose their recent pricing granted to MFCs.", "In general, when awarding a contract to a drug manufacturer, the VA's NAC has to determine the following: 1) whether the government was offered a fair and reasonable price; 2) whether the manufacturer is responsive and responsible; 3) whether the manufacturer completed all certifications and regulatory requirements in their entirety; 4) whether the past performance history of the manufacturer is satisfactory; 5) whether the manufacturer is financially capable; and 6) whether awarding the contract to the drug manufacturer is in the overall best interest of the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance-based Incentive Agreements (Blanket Purchase Agreements)", "paragraphs": ["Under each awarded FSS contract there is a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) clause, which allows the VA to further negotiate with the drug manufacturers and receive additional discounts.

In response, Congress enacted the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-585 ). Section 603 of this act required pharmaceutical companies to list covered drugs on the FSS as a condition of continued participation in the Medicaid program. It also required them to roll back price increases, and created statutorily mandated ceiling prices for sales to the four largest federal purchasers of pharmaceuticals: the VA (including state veterans nursing homes receiving grants under Section 1741 of Title 38, United States Code), DOD, PHS (including the Indian Health Service), and Coast Guard.

The Department's Drug Product and Management division based in Hines, Illinois, managed and monitored drug usage and purchasing for those facilities, but had no utilization oversight responsibilities. In September 1995, the VA established a Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) Health Care Strategic Group, tasked with establishing a national formulary, managing pharmaceutical costs, and overseeing pharmacologic guideline development for common diseases within the VA health care system. In November 1995, as part of its reform efforts the VA created a nationwide system of Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), consisting of 22 geographically defined networks, and each entity was instructed to create a formulary. To develop their formularies each VISN generally combined their medical center formularies, and on April 30, 1996, VISN formularies became effective. To ensure that all veterans have access to pharmaceuticals\u2014no matter where they live in the U.S\u2014the VA established a national formulary by combining the core of drugs common in the VISN formularies. The national formulary took effect on June 1, 1997.

However, larger rebates may not adversely affect wholesalers or pharmacists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Option 3: Establish a Medicare Pharmacy Purchasing System", "paragraphs": ["A new Medicare pharmacy purchasing system would be another option that might help translate lower manufacturer drug prices for Medicare Part D into lower out-of-pocket and overall costs for beneficiaries. One example of such a system could resemble the VA's mail-order pharmacy system. The new Medicare pharmacy purchasing system could negotiate drug prices and purchase drugs from manufacturers or wholesalers, and then distribute the drugs and receive payment from beneficiaries.", "This approach is potentially the most administratively burdensome of the options, since it would require developing a Medicare pharmacy distribution system. Pharmacists may experience increased administrative costs if they were to be required to track and purchase drugs separately for their Medicare customers, since pharmacists rarely track drugs by payer under the current system. Some of the burden could be alleviated through heavy use of a mail-order system.", "If a mail-order system is established, pharmacists, and possibly wholesalers, could lose profits because they would lose Medicare business. The Part D plans might have a considerably reduced role in the new system. As with any price reduction, manufacturers' profits from Medicare might be reduced and they may choose to recoup lost profits by increasing drug prices to other consumers. Finally, a complete mail-order system is not a realistic option because many beneficiaries may prefer to talk to their pharmacist directly, and may not wish to participate in a mail-order program."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
