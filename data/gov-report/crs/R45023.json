PREPA's massive $9 billion debt (incurred before the damage from Hurricanes Irma and Maria) was a particular problem.

Title VI set out a process for voluntary collective action agreements, similar to those PREPA had been negotiating with creditors since 2014. Title III set out a process that draws on procedures from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. PROMESA also established a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (OB) that required PREPA to draw up a fiscal plan. While PROMESA endowed the OB with wide authorities, the governor and legislature of Puerto Rico retained substantial control over public priorities, within constraints of fiscal plans and other provisions of PROMESA.

Building a modernized, flexible electric grid, capable of incorporating more renewable sources of electricity, underpinned by more efficient natural gas combined-cycle power plants and energy storage, may help Puerto Rico accomplish these goals.", "Questions are now being raised as to possible options for rebuilding the electricity grid on the island, given PREPA's debt problem.

The Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority (PRWRA) was formed in 1941 with the aim of consolidating existing power operators into an integrated publicly owned utility that could respond to increased demand for electric power, which Puerto Rico was experiencing at the time. As the agency's name suggested, hydropower originally was a major source of electric power. In that respect, Puerto Rico is very similar to some of its Caribbean island neighbors. As demand for electric power grew, the PRWRA purchased the Puerto Rico Railway Light and Power Company and the Mayag\u00fcez Light Power and Ice Company in 1945.", "Over time, Puerto Rico shifted from hydropower dominance to petroleum. Generating power with fuel oil or diesel was a logical choice in the absence of other nonhydro resources. Currently, heavy fuel oil (e.g., number 5 or 6 residual fuel oil) is the dominant source of electricity in Puerto Rico. Unlike most of its island neighbors, Puerto Rico imports coal to fuel its pulverized coal power plant at Guayama, which represents almost 8% of overall electricity generation.", "In 1950, PRWRA began operating its first thermoelectric facilities fired by petroleum fuels with the San Juan (400 MW), Palo Seco (602 MW), and Costa Sur (990 MW) power plants.

Other major power plants include the Aguirre thermoelectric (900 MW) and Aguirre combined-cycle power (592 MW) plants.

Other large generation (owned by nonutility independent power producers) includes the EcoEl\u00e9ctrica plant, which is fueled by natural gas from imported liquefied natural gas (with about 9% of overall generation capacity), and the AES facility at Guayama, fueled by imported coal.

Approximately 2 million of Puerto Rico's people reside in the large urban areas in and around San Juan, Bayam\u00f3n, and Carolina, on the northern coast of the island. As a result, most electricity must be sent by transmission lines over the island's forested, central mountain range. ", "The almost 6 GigaWatts (GW) in power generation capacity in Puerto Rico has long been dominated by fossil fuels. Figure 2 illustrates that continuing dependency, as petroleum and coal accounted for approximately 64% of generation in 2016.

PREPA is thus seeking to modernize its electric generation options, and renewable energy is expected to be an increasing part of the portfolio.

PREPA maintains that the proposal \"commits PREPA to fiscal responsibility and implements urgently needed infrastructure modernization,\" while allowing for \"revised fuel prices, distributed generation trends, [and] urgent infrastructure investments for needed efficiencies.\" However, the draft plan recognized that PREPA faced major challenges ahead as falling customer demand could mean a 23% drop in energy sales through the forecast period (i.e., from 2016 to 2026).
