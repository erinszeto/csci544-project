Loan forgiveness is rare, but has been used in the past to help businesses that were having difficulty repaying their loans. For example, loan forgiveness was granted after Hurricane Betsy, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Southeast Hurricane Disaster Relief Act of 1965.

The CDBG program provides loans and grants to eligible businesses to help them recover from disasters as well as grants intended to attract new businesses to the disaster-stricken area. In a few cases, CDBG has also been used to compensate businesses and workers for lost wages or revenues.", "Although the President issued the first major disaster declaration to New York for COVID-19, CDBG disaster assistance is not available for all major disasters. States can use CDBG funding to respond to emergencies or other \"urgent needs\" through the conventional CDBG entitlement and states program, but existing (or future) CDBG monies generally must be reprogrammed in consultation with HUD to respond to the emergency. For these reasons, CDBG is generally used for long-term recovery needs rather than providing immediate, direct disaster assistance.", "Thus, Congress could consider providing business grants through FEMA or the SBA. Enlisting FEMA to administer the program may offer several benefits. First, FEMA already has grant processing operations in place. It might be relatively easier to expand the operations to include small businesses disaster grants rather than establishing new grant-making operations within SBA. Second, having FEMA administer the small business disaster grant program may limit duplication of administrative functions between FEMA and SBA. Third, it would provide access to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) which at the time of this writing has roughly $41 billion for disaster assistance activities.", "In contrast, Congress could decide to have SBA administer the program because it already has a framework in place to evaluate business disaster needs and disaster loan eligibility. Congress may need to make statutory changes to SBA's disaster loan account or authorize a new account to receive appropriations for disaster grants.", "Another concern about providing grants to businesses is whether businesses provided SBA EIDL will be eligible for grant assistance. For example, in some cases homeowners and businesses that accepted disaster loans were deemed ineligible for disaster grants. This may make some businesses reluctant to apply for SBA EIDL and instead hold out for the possibility of a grant. Congress may therefore allow businesses to use grant money to pay down their SBA EIDL.", "Another potential concern is waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, Section 1210 of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA, Division D of P.L. 115-254 ) prohibits the President from determining loans as duplicative assistance provided all federal assistance is used toward loss resulting from an emergency or major disaster under the Stafford Act. Consequently, businesses that obtain SBA EIDL and a grant for the same purposes would conceivably not be required to pay back the duplicative award.", "Congress could consider limiting grants to relatively small businesses as compared to what is considered a small business according to SBA size standards. For example, business grants could be limited to businesses with 10 or fewer employees.
