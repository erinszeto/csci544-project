Applying this understanding of the issue, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has identified 78 public mass shootings that have occurred in the United States since 1983. This suggests the scale of this threat and is intended as a thorough review of the phenomenon but should not be characterized as exhaustive or definitive. According to CRS estimates, over the last three decades public mass shootings have claimed 547 lives and led to an additional 472 injured victims.

Policy measures that deal with recovery are also discussed within the context of education and public health initiatives.", "Policy Effectiveness and Outlay of Resources. Many of the policymaking challenges regarding public mass shootings boil down to two interrelated matters: (1) a need to determine the effectiveness of existing programs and (2) figuring out where to disburse limited resources. Finally, baseline metrics related to this problem are often unclear or unavailable. This lack of clarity starts with identifying the number of shootings themselves, since no broadly agreed-to definition exists. Several questions flow from this issue. How many people have such incidents victimized? How much does prevention of, preparedness for, and response to such incidents cost the federal government? What measurements can be used to determine the effectiveness of such programs?", "This report does not discuss gun control policies and does not systematically address the broader issue of gun violence, which can include topics such as gun-related suicide and a wide variety of gun-related crimes.

Any definition of mass shootings requires a somewhat arbitrary threshold demarcating the number of victims killed per incident. This report's threshold is based on a definition of mass murder offered by the FBI. An important caveat deserves mentioning. A compilation of incidents based on any such arbitrary threshold may fail to adequately describe the universe of incidents to which educators, public health professionals, and law enforcement have to react and for which they have to prepare. One author has stated that gunmen \"injure far more victims than they kill; however, they must certainly be considered mass murderers by obvious intentions of their actions.\" In the critical early moments of a shooting, police, teachers, and rescue personnel do not necessarily know how many people are injured versus dead. Personnel and resources are initially mobilized in response to a shooting, regardless of the number of fatalities.", "Indiscriminate Selection of Victims. For this report's definition, a killer's relationship to his or her victims is important. Driven by a desire for revenge and/or power, some killers may target family members or intimate friends. In the incidents described as public mass shootings for this report, the gunmen cannot solely kill such individuals. This particularly rules out cases of domestic violence\u2014instances only involving family members either inside or outside the home\u2014from consideration as public mass shootings.

However, as implied in the above definition, the shooters who perpetrated the incidents counted in this report did not have broad socio-political objectives, such as using violence to advocate the fall of a regime. Thus, gunmen acting in the name of a terrorist organization or a clearly framed philosophy of hate typically were not considered public mass shooters. Also, shootings largely motivated by criminal profit were not counted.

As such, while the federal government may not play a direct role in formulating specific state and local practices, it may influence these practices through the availability of grants. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offers funding via its Homeland Security Grant Program to \"fund a range of preparedness activities, including planning, organization, equipment purchase, training, exercises, and management and administration.\" Although Department of Justice (DOJ) grants are not necessarily framed in terms of prevention, preparedness, or response, they can certainly address these issues regarding mass shootings.

Should the federal government enhance interagency information sharing and coordination on procedures to evaluate and deal with shooting threats? Should it increase law-enforcement-related grant funding to bolster school resource officer training or the number of metal detectors in academic settings? In this area, the Obama Administration's January 16, 2013, report, Now Is the Time: The President's Plan to Protect Our Children and Our Communities by Reducing Gun Violence ( The President's Plan ), included a commitment to using the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program to incentivize police departments to hire more school resource officers.

Some policy makers may wish to incentivize the establishment and training of tactical emergency medical services (EMS) teams to support law enforcement during instances of mass shootings or related events. These teams could provide medical threat assessments, deliver medical care, and promote law enforcement safety, among other things. Little research has evaluated the effectiveness of such tactical EMS teams in the civilian domain, and policy makers may wish to request additional research in this arena.

Although mass murderers often do exhibit bizarre behavior, most people who exhibit bizarre behavior do not commit mass murder.\" Aside from usually, but not always, being male, there are few other characteristics found across mass murderers that would be reliable or valid for creating a general profile for individuals most likely to engage in a public mass shooting. This also holds true when examining individuals who carry out mass shootings in specific settings; for instance, \"[t]here is no accurate or useful profile of 'the school shooter'.\"", "Also of note, criminal profiling is generally utilized after a crime has been committed, and not usually as a preventive tool.

Threat assessments are used after a potentially harmful individual has come to the attention of authorities. The assessment process evaluates the threat he or she poses. Certainly, threat assessments may be used to prevent a mass shooting. Law enforcement efforts to train front-line professionals in the assessment process can be seen as an effort geared toward preparing these individuals to cope with threats.", "The National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC), which is part of the U.S. Secret Service, provides research on threat assessment as well as on targeted violence. The threat assessment approach used by the U.S. Secret Service was developed as part of its broader intelligence activities designed to protect the President and other officials. Nonetheless, it \"can be applied with some modification to evaluating risk for other forms of targeted violence.\" It does not rely on \"profiles\" of potential malicious actors (as profiles have not proven to be reliable predictors for actual threat), nor does it depend on stated threats as a starting point for evaluating risk (because not every person who makes a threat poses a true risk, and not all persons who pose risks make threats). Within this threat assessment framework, it has been suggested that information be collected relating to (1) facts that bring the subject to the attention of authorities, (2) the subject of interest, (3) attack-related behaviors, (4) possible motives, and (5) potential targets. Of note, law enforcement may not be the only authorities involved in evaluating information and conducting such a threat assessment, but the assessment framework may be one of several tools that law enforcement relies on in an attempt to prevent targeted violence, including mass shootings.

For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) enables participating states to supplement death certificates with information from law enforcement agencies, crime laboratories, coroner or medical examiner reports, health providers, and other state and local agencies.

Therefore, potential risk and protective factors may have more utility when public health professionals confront the much broader phenomenon of gun violence, not just public mass shootings. Consequently, potential risk factors such as mental illness, substance abuse, exposure to violence, and easy access to guns are all addressed to some extent in The President's Plan, which covers the wider issue of gun violence. The President's Plan also responds to the suggestion by some that health research related to gun violence has been hampered by a statutory prohibition on the use of certain funding to \"advocate or promote gun control.\" The President's Plan states that research into gun violence is not advocacy, and a Presidential Memorandum directs the Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary to \"conduct or sponsor research into the causes of gun violence.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Prevention of public mass shootings in a public health context would in theory involve interventions targeted at potential perpetrators, not potential victims.

Preventive interventions directed at potential violent offenders may target populations, at-risk subgroups, or high-risk individuals. These approaches may or may not prove effective within the broader context of gun violence, and what effect (if any) they would have on mass shootings is unclear as well.

In both urban and rural areas, some EDs may not function optimally on a day-to-day basis, which would affect their ability to respond to an MCI. EDs may be overcrowded, may \"board\" patients when inpatient beds are unavailable, and may divert ambulances because they are operating at capacity. The federal government supports EDs through a variety of mechanisms including hospital preparedness grants, interagency coordination, and training of emergency health providers. Through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the federal government provides payments to hospitals that deliver care to uninsured patients in hospital EDs. These payments (called disproportionate share payments) are an important source of a financial support for EDs.

Trauma centers are classified into four levels, with lower numbers (I, II) providing more specialized care. Trauma centers may play a role in responding to MCIs, but not all areas have the patient volume to support a trauma center. Distance to the nearest trauma center may be an issue in some MCIs.

However, when an incident occurs, local authorities and health systems are largely on their own during the initial phases of a response. The federal government, through HHS (and, when needed, the Department of Defense), can support local efforts to respond to MCIs, making available mobile medical teams, mobile field hospitals, medical supply and pharmaceutical caches, and medical evacuation and transport. In general, however, mass shootings resolve quickly, often before federal operational assistance can be delivered. ", "In the event of a public mass shooting or other MCI, as with any emergency medical situation, delaying treatment while determining a patient's insurance status or ability to pay for health care services may prove fatal. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) protects against such a delay. EMTALA requires a hospital that receives Medicare payments (as the vast majority of hospitals do) to screen a patient for emergency medical conditions without regard for the patient's ability to pay. If the screening identifies an emergency medical condition, EMTALA requires the hospital to stabilize the patient. In instances where a patient's injuries are too severe to be treated at an ED, a patient may be sent to a trauma center. EMS or local EDs may determine whether a transfer to a trauma center is needed. Trauma centers are also subject to EMTALA (if the hospitals receive Medicare payments) and are required to accept transfers when an ED has determined that the trauma center possesses the specialized services that the patient needs but the ED lacks.

The availability of such services in a timely and accessible manner may also be important for reducing long-term consequences such as posttraumatic stress disorder.

Policy makers may have to decide whether funds should be spread across many activities so that each activity gets some additional funding, or whether funding should be concentrated in fewer programs believed to be most cost effective. This decision is made even more difficult because research on effectiveness is limited for many school security programs. This may lead to consideration of whether more funding should be provided for research into program effectiveness, and if so, whether it would restrict funding for existing school security programs.
