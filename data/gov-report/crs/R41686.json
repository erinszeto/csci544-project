The PTWC was established in 1949 after a strong earthquake and massive landslides off the coast of Southwest Alaska caused a disastrous tsunami that hit the Hawaiian Islands only hours later. The PTWC issued tsunami warnings to Alaska until 1967, when the WC/ATWC was established.

In 2005, the NTWC expanded its scope to include the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, as well as the Atlantic coast of Canada.
