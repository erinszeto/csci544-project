Over the past 20 years, Congress has enacted significant changes in U.S. immigration policy and welfare policy. Congress has also exercised oversight of revisions made by the 1996 welfare reform law (the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, P.L. 104-193) concerning the rules governing noncitizen eligibility for public assistance, and of legislation covering programs with major restrictions on noncitizen eligibility (e.g., Medicaid).", "This report deals with the four major federal means-tested benefit programs: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps), the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance, and Medicaid. Laws in place for the past 20 years restrict the eligibility of legal permanent residents (LPRs), refugees, asylees, and other noncitizens for most means-tested public aid. Noncitizens' eligibility for major federal means-tested benefits largely depends on their immigration status; whether they arrived (or were on a program's rolls) before August 22, 1996, the enactment date of P.L. 104-193; and how long they have lived and worked in the United States.", "LPRs with a substantial work history (defined as 40 quarters of Social Security covered earnings) or military connection are eligible for the full range of programs, as are asylees, refugees, and other humanitarian cases (for at least five to seven years after entry). Other LPRs must meet additional eligibility requirements.", "For SSI, they are not eligible for the first five years even if they had a substantial work history (e.g., as a temporary worker prior to receiving LPR status). For SNAP, they generally must have been LPRs for five years or be under age 18. Under TANF, they generally are ineligible for five years after entry and then eligible at state option.

While Congress did not specify exactly what information was to be included in the SAVE system, it did require the Attorney General to establish an automated record of the sponsors' social security numbers.

These included major public assistance programs like Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC, the predecessor of TANF), the SSI program, food stamps, and Medicaid. With the single exception of emergency Medicaid, unauthorized (illegally present) aliens were barred from participation in all the major federal assistance programs that had statutory provisions for noncitizens, as were aliens legally present in a temporary status (i.e., nonimmigrants such as persons admitted for tourism, education, or employment).", "However, many health, education, nutrition, income support, and social service programs did not include specific provisions regarding alien eligibility, and unauthorized aliens were potential participants. These programs included, for example, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (the WIC program), child nutrition programs, initiatives funded through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), community and migrant health centers, and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program.", "The 1996 Welfare Reform Law", "Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA, P.L. 104-193 ) established comprehensive new restrictions on the eligibility of noncitizens for means-tested public assistance\u2014with significant exceptions for those with a substantial U.S. work history or military connection. For legal permanent residents (LPRs) who were resident as of enactment of the law (August 22, 1996), the act generally barred eligibility (food stamps/SNAP and SSI) or allowed it at state option (Medicaid and TANF). For food stamps/SNAP and SSI benefits, LPRs entering after August 22, 1996 (new entrants) also were denied eligibility, with no time constraint. On the other hand, new entrants applying for Medicaid and the newly established Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program were barred for five years after their entry, and then allowed eligibility at state option.

More extensive modifications to the new alienage rules were then included in P.L. 105-33 , the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, signed into law on August 5, 1997. It amended the welfare reform law to provide that legal immigrants who were receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, continue to be eligible, regardless of whether their claim was based on disability or age. Additionally, those who were here by August 22, 1996, and subsequently become disabled were made eligible for SSI.", "Food stamp/SNAP eligibility was expanded by provisions of P.L. 105-185 , the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998.

Also, Section 409 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibited funds from being used to provide homeowners assistance to foreign nationals who are neither aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, nor authorized to be employed in the United States. P.L. 110-328 extended to nine years (during FY2009 through FY2011) the period of eligibility of certain refugees, asylees, and aliens in other specified humanitarian categories for SSI benefits, provided that the alien has a pending naturalization application or makes a declaration that he or she has made a good faith effort to pursue U.S. citizenship. It also made victims of trafficking among the eligible population. As a result of this provision, the specified LPR must additionally fit within one of several categories, which include being an LPR for less than six years, applying for LPR status within four years of beginning to receive SSI, being at least age 70, or being under age 18. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA 2009, P.L. 111-3 ) allows states to waive\u2014for children and pregnant women who are LPRs and battered individuals lawfully residing in the United States\u2014key elements of PRWORA: the statutory bar, the limited eligibility provision, and the five-year bar, and thus gives states the option of providing Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to children and pregnant women who are LPRs and battered individuals (described in Section 431(c) of PRWORA) lawfully residing in the United States during the first five years that they are living in the United States.", "Sponsorship and Deeming", "\"Public Charge\"", "Historical Development", "Opposition to the entry of foreign paupers and aliens \"likely at any time to become a public charge\"\u2014language found in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) today\u2014dates from colonial times. A bar against the admission of \"any person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge\" was included in the act of August 3, 1882, the first general federal immigration law. Over time, a policy developed in which applicants for immigrant status can overcome the public charge ground for exclusion based on their own funds, prearranged or prospective employment, or an affidavit of support from someone in the United States.", "An affidavit of support on behalf of a prospective immigrant had to be submitted as necessary by one or more residents of the United States in order to provide assurance that the applicant for entry would be supported in this country. Starting in the 1930s and continuing until the 1980s, affidavits of support were administratively required by what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) but had no specific basis in statute or regulation. Court decisions beginning in the 1950s generally held that affidavits of support were not legally binding on the U.S. resident sponsors. The unenforceability of affidavits of support led to the adoption of legislation in the late 1970s and early 1980s intended to make them more effective (see the discussion of \"deeming\" of income and financial resources below).", "1996 Immigration Law Reforms", "The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA, Division C of P.L. 104-208 ), coupled with the 1996 welfare reform law, altered the obligations of persons who sponsor immigrants arriving or adjusting to LPR status in the United States. The IIRIRA standards, which are part of the INA, cover requirements for sponsors, mandatory affidavits for family immigrants, and sponsorship liability, as follows:", "The person petitioning for the immigrant's admission must be the sponsor signing the affidavit of support. Sponsors must demonstrate the ability to maintain an annual income of at least 125% of the federal poverty line (100% for sponsors who are on active duty in U.S. Armed Forces), or share liability with one or more joint sponsors, each of whom must independently meet the income requirement. All family-based immigrants as well as employment-based immigrants who are coming to work for relatives must have affidavits of support filed for them. Sponsors who fail to support sponsored aliens are legally liable to the sponsored aliens and to any government agency that provides sponsored aliens needs-based assistance. As modified by the 1996 immigration law, a sponsor's liability ends when the sponsored alien is no longer subject to deeming, either through naturalization or meeting a work test. Since passage of IIRIRA, the affidavit of support is a legally binding contract enforceable against the affiant (i.e., sponsors) if the immigrant collects any means-tested benefit. Upon notification that a sponsored alien has received designated means-tested benefits, the federal, state, or local entity which provided the benefit must request the sponsor's reimbursement for an amount equal to the cost of the benefit. If the sponsor fails to respond to the request within 45 days, the agency may commence an action in federal or state court. There is a 10-year limit on actions to obtain reimbursement.", "In the context of Medicaid, Section 214 of CHIPRA 2009 ( P.L. 111-3 ) states \"no debt shall accrue under an affidavit of support against any sponsor of such an alien on the basis of provision of assistance to such category and the cost of such assistance shall not be considered as an unreimbursed cost.\" According to the legislative language, this provision applies only to LPRs who are covered under Section 214 of that act; that is, LPRs who are pregnant or children, whom the state opts to provide CHIP and Medicaid during their first five years in the United States.", "\"Deeming\" of Income and Resources", "Pre-1996 Policy", "In response to concerns about the unenforceability of affidavits of support and the perceived abuse of the welfare system by some newly arrived immigrants, legislation was enacted in the late 1970s and early 1980s limiting the availability of SSI, food stamps/SNAP, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to sponsored immigrants. The enabling legislation for these programs was amended to provide that\u2014for the purpose of determining financial eligibility\u2014immigrants who had used an affidavit of support to meet the public charge requirement would be deemed to have a portion of their immigration sponsors' income and resources available to them.", "Post-1996 Requirements", "The 1996 welfare reform law and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 significantly expanded the use of sponsor-to-alien deeming as a means of restricting the participation of new immigrants in federal means-tested programs. Both deeming and the affidavits of support upon which deeming is based are intended to implement the provision of the INA that excludes aliens who appear \"likely at any time to become a public charge.\"", "Appendix C. \"Qualified Aliens\"", "The 1996 welfare law divided noncitizens into two general categories for purposes of benefit eligibility. The least restrictive category is that of qualified aliens , a category that, despite its name, is subject to numerous limitations and does not itself indicate eligibility for assistance. Qualified aliens are legal permanent residents, refugees, aliens paroled into the United States for at least one year, and aliens granted asylum or related relief. The 1996 immigration law added certain abused spouses and children as another class, and P.L. 105-33 added Cuban-Haitian entrants.", "The other, more restrictive category is that of non-qualified aliens . It consists of other noncitizens, including unauthorized (illegal) aliens, nonimmigrants (i.e., aliens admitted for a temporary purpose, such as education or employment), short-term parolees, asylum applicants, and various classes of aliens granted temporary permission to remain. Non-qualified aliens generally are ineligible for almost all federal assistance provided directly to households or individuals. Limited exceptions include emergency medical services and disaster relief.", "In general, qualified aliens compose the \"universe\" of potentially eligible noncitizens. As noted below and in the earlier portions of this report, however, these aliens must, in most cases, pass another test to gain eligibility. In addition, some classes of noncitizens who are not specifically listed as qualified aliens (e.g., Hmong/Highland Laotians, Vietnam-born Amerasians fathered by U.S. citizens, victims of severe forms of trafficking) are indeed eligible for benefits. Qualified aliens are subject to eligibility restrictions that vary by program (see Appendix A ) and may be subject to sponsor-to-alien deeming rules that affect their financial eligibility for aid (noted earlier in this report). The following presents the eligibility for qualified aliens for SNAP, SSI, TANF, and Medicaid:", "To gain eligibility for SNAP, qualified aliens must (1) have a substantial work history or military connection; (2) have been resident in the United States as of August 22, 1996, and meet certain age or disability requirements; or (3) be within seven years of entry (e.g., if a refugee/asylee). To gain eligibility for SSI, qualified aliens must (1) have a substantial work history or military connection; (2) have been an SSI recipient as of August 22, 1996; (3) have been resident in the United States as of August 22, 1996, and be disabled; or (3) be within seven years of entry (e.g., if a refugee/asylee). To gain eligibility for TANF, qualified aliens must (1) have a substantial work history or military connection; (2) be in a state that has chosen to allow eligibility to those resident as of August 22, 1996, and/or new entrants who have been resident five years; or (3) be within five years of entry (e.g., if a refugee/asylee). New entrants are not eligible for five years after entry. To gain eligibility for Medicaid, qualified aliens must (1) have a substantial work history or military connection; (2) be in a state that has chosen to allow eligibility to those resident as of August 22, 1996, and/or new entrants who have been resident five years; or (3) be within seven years of entry (e.g., if a refugee or asylee). For Medicaid and CHIP, new entrants are not eligible for five years after entry, except in the states that have opted to cover children and pregnant LPRs. However, for CHIP, the five-year ban is the only additional citizenship-related eligibility requirement that must be met by qualified aliens."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
