EESA was enacted to address an ongoing financial crisis that reached near-panic proportions in September 2008. The act granted the Secretary of the Treasury authority to either purchase or insure up to $700 billion in troubled assets owned by financial institutions. This authority was granted for up to two years from the date of enactment and was very broad. In particular, the definitions of both \"troubled asset\" and \"financial institution\" allowed the Secretary wide leeway in deciding what assets might be purchased or guaranteed and what might qualify as a financial firm.", "The financial crisis grew out of an unprecedented housing boom that turned into a housing bust. Much of the lending for housing during the boom was based on asset-backed securities that used the repayment of housing loans as the basis of these securities. As housing prices fell and mortgage defaults increased, these securities became illiquid and fell sharply in value, causing capital losses for firms holding them. Uncertainty about future losses reduced many firms' access to private liquidity, with the loss in liquidity being catastrophic in some cases. September 2008 saw the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and the near collapse of American International Group (AIG), which was saved only by an $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve. There was widespread lack of trust in the financial markets as participants were unsure which firms might be holding so-called toxic assets that might now be worth much less than previously estimated, thus making these firms unreliable counterparties in financial transactions. This uncertainty prevented firms from accessing credit markets to meet their liquidity needs.", "As EESA moved through Congress, most attention was focused on the idea of the government purchasing mortgage-related toxic assets, thus alleviating the widespread uncertainty and suspicion by cleaning up bank balance sheets. The initial TARP Capital Purchase Program, however, directly added capital onto banks' balance sheets through preferred share purchases rather than removing assets that had become liabilities through purchasing mortgage-related assets. Several other TARP programs followed, including an asset guarantee program; programs designed to spur consumer and business lending; financial support for companies such as AIG, GM, and Chrysler; and programs to aid homeowners at risk of foreclosure. Eventually, the Public-Private Investment Program resulted in the purchase of some mortgage-related assets, but this remained a relatively small part of TARP. Most TARP programs are now closed.", "With the immediate crisis subsiding through 2009, congressional attention to financial services turned largely to consider broad regulatory changes. The resulting Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203) amended TARP's authority, including (1) reduction of the overall amount to $475 billion; (2) removal of the ability to reuse TARP funds that had been repaid; and (3) removal of the authority to create new TARP programs or initiatives. The original TARP authority to purchase new assets or enter into new contracts expired on October 3, 2010. Outlays under the existing contracts, however, may continue through the life of these contracts. Overall budget-cost estimates for TARP have decreased significantly since the passage of EESA, with the most recent Congressional Budget Office estimates foreseeing $27 billion in costs and Office of Management and Budget estimates foreseeing $39 billion in costs. Most of these costs are from aid for homeowners, for the insurer AIG, and for U.S. automakers. The assistance to banks is generally showing a gain for the government. In the 113th Congress, oversight of TARP has continued, including a hearing held by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was created by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA; P.L. 110-343 ) enacted on October 3, 2008.

The Federal Reserve (Fed) stepped in with emergency measures to restore liquidity, temporarily calming markets. Losses in mortgage markets, however, continued and spilled into other markets.

Unlike most government programs, where funds are simply expended, TARP funds were generally used in ways that resulted in either the holding of assets by the government or in some form of income accruing to the government. The incoming receipts from TARP outlays have taken several forms, including", "funds from the sale of previously purchased assets, repayment of principal from loans, premium payments for insured assets, dividend and interest payments from assets and loans, and proceeds from the sale of warrants issued by companies that sold assets to TARP.", " Table 2 summarizes these incoming revenues from TARP.

Most of the outstanding TARP funds are embodied in assets, such as common stock, that recipients are not obligated to repay; instead, Treasury is expected to sell these assets at a future date and hopefully recoup the funds that were disbursed. TARP funds that are classified as a recognized loss, or as written off, are typically cases where either the asset sales were not sufficient to repay the initial TARP disbursement or a TARP recipient has failed and thus is unable repay the funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Costs of TARP", "paragraphs": ["In arriving at an overall cost to the government of TARP, or any similar program, it is important to account for the difference in time between initial outlay of funds and the receipt of any income. Some TARP contracts run for many years, and the difference in value between a dollar in 2008 and 2013, for example, could be significant. To compare dollar values over time, economists use present value calculations that reduce costs or income in the future relative to the present by a discount rate. Present value calculations can be very sensitive to the rate used if the amount of time involved is large. In preparing the budget cost estimates for TARP, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) are directed by Section 123 of EESA to adjust their estimates by current market borrowing rates, as opposed to the borrowing rate paid by Treasury. Using market rates instead of government borrowing rates increases the net calculated cost of these investments and is meant to better represent the true economic costs of the programs. The cost estimates for TARP have fallen dramatically since the program was started. For example, in March 2009, CBO estimated a $356 billion budgetary cost for TARP. This number fell to $109 billion in March 2010, and the latest CBO estimate is for a total budgetary cost of $21 billion.", "The various programs under TARP have had very different estimated costs. In general, the bank support programs and credit market support programs have produced gains for the government. The losses in TARP are primarily accruing from the support for AIG, the automakers, and housing. ", " Table 4 below summarizes recent detailed estimates of TARP's cost from CBO and OMB. The largest difference between the OMB and CBO estimates is in the amounts expected to be disbursed for the housing support programs. The CBO estimates are also made following the OMB estimates and thus use more current market data.", "The cost estimates of TARP are sensitive to financial markets and the state of the economy. The program's ultimate cost has depended largely on recouping value from the financial assets held in TARP. The assets resulting from bank support programs, including warrants and both preferred and common shares, have turned out to be relatively valuable. Thus, the estimates show an overall gain from these programs as the increases in asset values outweigh any losses from defaults. In the case of the automaker support, however, the estimates indicate that the assets held by the government through TARP ultimately will not return enough to recoup the TARP funds put into the companies, as was the case with the assistance for AIG."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 113th Congress and TARP", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the numerous oversight mechanisms in the original statute, Congress has continued to directly oversee various aspects of TARP through committee hearings, with the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform creating a subcommittee specifically focused on TARP and financial services during the 112 th Congress.

In some cases, this compensation has resulted in government holdings of common stock in amounts that typically would result in the government having a controlling interest in these companies. The government, however, has generally exercised little of the ownership control inherent in these large stakes. Common equity in companies has typically been accepted in return for TARP assistance in order to strengthen the companies' capital positions going forward. Such equity also provides a potential financial upside to the taxpayers if firms have a strong recovery, but it has a potential downside if firms do not recover strongly. Outstanding outlays, such as loans, that have been converted to common equity are no longer directly owed by the company to the government.", "In the case of Citigroup, which converted $25 billion of preferred shares into common shares, the outcome for the government was positive as the share price rose after the conversion, resulting in approximately $6.85 billion in capital gains for taxpayers.

The ownership of AIG equity through TARP resulted in the government realizing a $13.48 billion loss, though this TARP equity loss was offset by a $17.55 billion gain from AIG equity holdings originating with the Federal Reserve. To date, Treasury has realized $1.82 billion in losses from equity holdings in GMAC/Ally Financial, with 16% of the company's equity yet to be sold.

This capital was provided in the form of preferred share purchases by TARP under contracts between the Treasury and banks. The initial contracts with the largest banks prevented these banks from exiting the program for three years. The contracts included dividend payments to be made on the preferred shares outstanding and the granting of warrants to the government. By the end of 2008, the CPP had 214 participating banks with approximately $172.5 billion in share purchases outstanding.", "The Obama Administration and the 111 th Congress implemented changes to the CPP. EESA was amended, placing additional restrictions on participating banks in existing CPP contracts but also allowing for early repayment and withdrawal from the program without financial penalty. With the advent of more stringent executive compensation restrictions for TARP recipients, many banks began to repay, or attempt to repay, TARP funds.

Satisfactory performance in the stress test was one regulatory requirement for large firms that wished to repay TARP funds. Large firms that appeared too fragile in the stress test would be required to raise additional capital, and the firms would have the option of raising that capital privately or from the government through a new Capital Assistance Program. No funding was provided through the Capital Assistance Program, although GMAC, formerly General Motors' financing arm, received funding to meet stress test requirements through the Automotive Industry Financing Program (see discussion under \"U.S. Automakers Assistance\" section below). In addition, Citigroup, one of the initial eight large banks receiving TARP funds, agreed with the government to convert its TARP preferred shares into common equity to meet stress test requirements (see discussion of Citigroup below).", "CPP profits stem from dividend payments, warrants received from recipients, and capital gains in limited cases when shares are sold for more than face value (the standard CPP shares are resold at face value). Losses stem from failure to repay in part or full. The ultimate profitability of the program will be determined by the balance between the two.", "Another source of CPP profits is the proceeds from the warrants received from the companies. Treasury has not generally exercised warrants to take common stock in CPP recipients. Following the contracts initially agreed upon, Treasury has allowed institutions to purchase their warrants directly upon repayment of preferred shares, as long as both sides can reach an acceptable price. To reach an initial offering price, Treasury is using complex option pricing models to price the warrants that require assumptions to be made about future prices and interest rates. Since these pricing models are by their nature uncertain, some critics urge Treasury to auction the warrants on the open market (allowing the issuing firm to bid as well) to ensure that Treasury receives a fair price for them. Open auctions have been used, but only when an agreement between Treasury and the firms cannot be reached.", "CPP earns income from dividends with a rate of 5% for the first five years and 9% thereafter.

Treasury purchased preferred shares from institutions that qualified for the CDCI up to an amount equal to 5% of the institutions' risk-weighted assets for banks and thrifts or 3.5% of total assets for credit unions. These preferred shares pay an initial dividend rate of 2%, which will increase to 9% after eight years. Unlike the CPP, no warrants in the financial institutions were included.

PPIP as envisioned consisted of two asset purchase programs designed to leverage private funds with government funds to remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets. Perhaps closer to the original conception of TARP than other TARP programs, PPIP dedicated TARP resources as equity to (1) acquire troubled loans in a fund partially guaranteed by the FDIC and (2) acquire troubled securities in a fund designed to be used with loans from the Federal Reserve's TALF program or TARP. Both funds would match TARP money with private investment, and profits or losses would be shared between the government and the private investors. Unlike the original conception of TARP, private investors would choose the assets to purchase and manage the funds and the day-to-day disposition of assets. The legacy loan portion of PPIP never advanced past a single pilot sale reported by the FDIC on September 30, 2009. Treasury originally envisioned assets purchases through PPIP would be as high as $1 trillion (using as much as $200 billion in TARP funds), but a maximum of $22.4 billion was committed to the legacy securities portion of the program.", "The PPIP Legacy Securities Program was designed to deal with existing mortgage-related securities on bank balance sheets. Private investment fund managers applied to Treasury to pre-qualify to raise funds to participate in the program. Approved fund managers that raised private equity capital received matching Treasury capital and an additional loan to the fund that matched the private capital (thus, for example, a fund that raised $100 had a total of $300 available to invest). In addition to this basic transaction, Treasury had the discretion to allow another matching loan so that a fund raising $100 could have made a total of $400 available for investment. The funds were to be used to invest in non-agency MBS that were originally rated AAA.

In early January 2010, however, one of the funds reached a liquidation agreement with Treasury and was wound down. By March 31, 2013, another five of the funds had been effectively wound down and all $18.6 billion of the disbursed funds had been returned. ", "Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility", "The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is a Fed program to assist the asset-backed security market, with TARP acting as a backstop in case of any losses. TALF was designed so that income accrues to the Fed with possible losses and some expenses accruing to Treasury. Initial obligation of TARP funds to support TALF was $4.0 billion, with $0.1 billion disbursed. The TARP commitment was reduced to $1.4 billion in June 2012 and canceled in January 2013 because the fees that had accrued from the program at that time were greater than the amount of TALF loans still outstanding. The initial $0.1 billion in disbursements from TARP have been repaid.", "Section 7(a) Securities Purchase Program", "This program supported the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Section 7(a) loan program through purchasing pooled SBA guaranteed securities backed by private loans to small businesses. Beginning in March 2010, Treasury purchased a total of $368 million in securities guaranteed by the SBA. Purchases ended in October 2010 with the expiration of the TARP authority, and all securities have been sold or matured.", "U.S. Automaker Assistance", "In addition to financial firms, nonfinancial firms also sought support under TARP, most notably U.S. automobile manufacturers. While EESA specifically authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase troubled assets from \"financial firms,\" the legislative definition of this term did not mention manufacturing companies. After specific legislation for the automakers failed to clear Congress, the Bush Administration turned to TARP for funding.", "On December 19, 2008, the Bush Administration announced it was providing support through TARP to General Motors and Chrysler under the Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP). The initial package included up to $13.4 billion in a secured loan to GM and $4 billion in a secured loan to Chrysler. In addition, $884 million was lent to GM for its participation in a rights offering by GMAC as GM's former financing arm was becoming a bank holding company. On December 29, 2008, Treasury announced that GMAC also was to receive a $5 billion capital injection through preferred share purchases.", "After January 21, 2009, the Obama Administration continued assistance for the automakers, including support for the automaker warranties under the AIFP (so that consumers would not be discouraged from purchasing cars during the restructuring) and for third-party suppliers to the automakers (the Automotive Supplier Support Program). Additional loans for GM and Chrysler were made before and during the two companies' bankruptcies, and GMAC received additional capital through preferred share purchases as well. At the end of 2009, GM had received approximately $50.2 billion in direct loans and indirect support; Chrysler had received $10.9 billion in loans and indirect support; GMAC had received $17.2 billion in preferred equity purchases and loans; and Chrysler Financial had received $1.5 billion in loans. Some of this assistance is still owed by the companies, some has been repaid, and some has been converted into common equity in the company receiving assistance.", "As of August 15, 2014, TARP support for the auto industry totaled approximately $79.7 billion disbursed, with $61.7 billion repaid and $7.0 billion in income. Approximately $15.9 billion has been written off or taken as a realized loss and $2.1 billion of assistance is outstanding. The assistance outstanding takes the form of government ownership of 16% of the common equity in Ally Financial (formerly GMAC). All other assistance has either been repaid or recognized as lost.", "The most recent OMB cost estimates of assistance to the auto industry made with November 2013 data are for a lifetime cost of $14 billion; CBO also estimated the cost to be $14 billion as of March 2014.", " Table A-8 summarizes the support for the automakers, including current and peak asset holdings or loan amounts, losses or gains, and conditions of the assistance.", "American International Group", "In the fall of 2008, American International Group (AIG) was a federally chartered thrift holding company regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) at the holding company level, with a broad range of businesses, primarily insurance subsidiaries, which are state-chartered and state-regulated. Facing losses on various operations, AIG experienced a significant decline in its stock price and downgrades from the major credit rating agencies. These downgrades led to immediate demands for significant amounts of collateral (approximately $14 billion to $15 billion in collateral payments, according to contemporary press reports). As financial demands on the company mounted, bankruptcy appeared a possibility, as had occurred with Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. Many feared that AIG was \"too big to fail\" due to the potential for widespread disruption to financial markets resulting from such a failure.", "On September 16, 2008 (prior to the existence of TARP), the Fed announced that it was taking action to support AIG in the form of a secured two-year line of credit with a value of up to $85 billion and a high interest rate. In addition, the government received warrants to purchase up to 79.9% of the equity in AIG. On October 8, 2008, the Fed announced that it would lend AIG up to an additional $37.8 billion against securities held by its insurance subsidiaries. In October 2008, AIG also announced that it had applied to the Fed's general Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and was approved to borrow up to $20.9 billion at the facility's standard terms.", "In early November 2008 (following the creation of TARP), financial support for AIG was restructured. The restructured financial support consisted of (1) reducing the size of the Fed loan to up to $60 billion, with the term lengthened to five years and the interest rate reduced by 5.5%; (2) purchasing of $40 billion in preferred shares through TARP; and (3) replacing the $37.8 billion loan with up to $52.5 billion total in asset purchases by the Fed through two Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) known as Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III. The 79.9% equity position of the government in AIG remained essentially unchanged after the restructuring of the intervention.", "In March 2009, the assistance was restructured further through (1) a partial payback of the Fed loan through a swap of debt for equity in two AIG subsidiaries worth approximately $25 billion, reducing the maximum to $35 billion; and (2) commitments for additional future TARP purchases of up to $29.8 billion in preferred shares at AIG's discretion and the conversion of existing shares into shares with optional dividend payments. The Maiden Lane LLCs continued operating under the previous terms, with the actual loans extended to the LLCs totaling $43.9 billion of the possible $52.5 billion at their peak. AIG's access to the CPFF had been reduced to $15.9 billion in January 2009 due to a ratings agency downgrade. AIG continued to access this facility until it expired in February 2010.", "In September 2010, AIG and the government announced another restructuring of the government's assistance. This restructuring closed on January 14, 2011. The expressed goal was to simplify the government's interest in AIG and provide for a path for the divestment of the government's stake in the company. The plan called for (1) ending the Fed's involvement with AIG through loan repayment and transfer of the Fed's equity interests to the Treasury and (2) converting the government's $49.1 billion in existing preferred shares into common shares, which could then be sold to the public over time. The specific steps involved several interlocking transactions, including the initial public offering (IPO) of a large AIG subsidiary, the sale of several other AIG subsidiaries, and the use of up to approximately $20 billion in TARP funds to transfer equity interests from the Fed to Treasury. Once these transactions closed, Treasury held 92% of AIG's common equity (1.66 billion shares) and equity interests in AIG's subsidiaries worth approximately $20.3 billion.", "Treasury sold the AIG equity over time and completed the sales in December 2012. All of the Federal Reserve loans have been repaid, and the assets held in the Maiden Lane LLCs have been sold. The last government-held assets relating to the AIG intervention were TARP warrants that were sold in January 2013.", " Table A-9 summarizes the support received by AIG from both TARP and the Fed, including current and peak asset holdings, losses or gains, and conditions of the support.", "TARP Housing Assistance Programs", "One criticism leveled at TARP in the program's early stages related to its focus on assisting financial institutions, thus providing only indirect assistance to individual homeowners facing foreclosure. Sections 103, 109, and 110 of EESA specifically embody congressional intent that homeowners be aided under TARP. Treasury ultimately created several programs addressing this criticism. Unlike other TARP programs that have resulted in asset purchases that may eventually return some funds to the government, the housing assistance programs have no mechanism for returning funds. Some $50 billion of TARP funding was initially planned for housing assistance efforts. Expected outlays under these programs have been counted as 100% spending with no expected financial return to the government. The amount of spending on these programs, however, has been relatively low, and the programs have been further criticized as ineffective at helping homeowners.", "Home Affordable Modification Program", "In March 2009, the TARP Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) was announced. Through HAMP, the government provides financial incentives to participating mortgage servicers that provide loan modifications to eligible troubled borrowers to reduce the borrowers' monthly mortgage payments to no more than 31% of their monthly income. Servicers receive an upfront incentive payment for each successful permanent loan modification and a \"pay-for-success\" payment for up to three years if the borrower remains current after the modification. The borrower can also receive a \"pay-for-success\" incentive payment (in the form of principal reduction) for up to five years if he or she remains current after the modification is finalized. Investors receive a payment cost-share incentive (that is, the government will pay half the cost of reducing the monthly mortgage payment from 38% to 31% of monthly income), and can receive incentive payments for loans modified before a borrower becomes delinquent. Mortgage modifications can be made under HAMP until December 31, 2016.", "The Administration originally estimated that HAMP would cost $75 billion. Of this amount, $50 billion was to come from TARP funds and $25 billion was to come from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for the costs of modifying mortgages that those entities owned or guaranteed. Over time, Treasury has revised downward its estimate of the amount of TARP funds that will be used for HAMP, with some of these funds used for the other TARP housing assistance programs. As of August 15, 2014, a total of $29.8 billion is obligated for HAMP, with $8.8 billion disbursed.", "Hardest Hit Fund", "On February 19, 2010, the Obama Administration announced that it would make funding available to the housing finance agencies (HFAs) of five states that had experienced the greatest declines in home prices. The states could use these funds to create their own foreclosure prevention programs based on local conditions, as long as the programs they created met the TARP objectives and were approved by Treasury. This program is known as the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF), and several additional rounds of funding, with different criteria for choosing the states, have been announced since its inception, bringing the total number of states receiving funds to 18 plus the District of Columbia. State HFAs must expend the funds by December 31, 2017. The funding comes from the TARP funds that Treasury initially set aside for HAMP. After all of the rounds of funding, the total amount of funding allocated to HHF is $7.6 billion. Of this amount, $4.2 billion had been disbursed as of August 15, 2014.", "FHA Short Refinance Program", "On March 26, 2010, the Administration announced a new Federal Housing Administration Short Refinance Program for homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth. Detailed program guidance was released on August 6, 2010. Under the program, certain homeowners who are current on their mortgages but owe more than their homes are worth may be able to refinance into new, FHA-insured mortgages for an amount lower than the home's current value. The original lender will accept the proceeds of the new loan as payment in full on the original mortgage; the new lender will have FHA insurance on the new loan; and the homeowner will have a first mortgage balance that is below the current value of the home, thereby providing some equity in the home. Homeowners must be current on their mortgages to qualify for this program. Further, the balance on the first mortgage loan must be reduced by at least 10%. This program is voluntary for lenders and borrowers, and borrowers with mortgages already insured by FHA are not eligible. ", "The FHA Short Refinance Program began on September 7, 2010, and is to be available until December 31, 2014. As of August 15, 2014, Treasury has obligated $1.03 billion of the TARP funds originally set aside for HAMP to help pay for the cost of this program, a reduction from the original amount of $8.1 billion. Of this $1.03 billion, $0.06 billion has been disbursed."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
