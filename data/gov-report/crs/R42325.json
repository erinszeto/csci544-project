The FAIR Act sought to address this situation by requiring agencies to compile annual lists of all commercial activities they perform and make these lists available to Congress and the public.

The current version of OMB Circular A-76 says only that \"[a]n inherently governmental activity is an activity that is so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate performance by government personnel.\" However, OMB Circular A-76, also like the FAIR Act, follows its brief definition of inherently governmental function with clarification and examples.

It then notes that \"[a]n activity may be provided by contractor support ... where the contractor does not have the authority to decide on the course of action, but is tasked to develop options or implement a course of action, with agency oversight,\" before listing six factors that agencies should consider to avoid transferring inherently governmental functions to contractors (e.g., the nature of the activity; the degree of discretion involved).

While OMB Circular A-76's characterization of itself in this manner is not necessarily dispositive of its legal effect, courts in some cases have found that OMB Circular A-76 is not the product of a congressional grant of legislative authority promulgated in accordance with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress, which is one of the requirements for a policy document to be seen as legally binding. In other cases, the courts have found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge alleged violations of OMB Circular A-76 .

Two contexts typically prompt courts to determine what is an inherently governmental function. The first context involves litigation under the FAIR Act, OMB Circular A-76, and the FAR. This context actually entails a smaller number of published decisions than the second context, which involves litigation concerning constitutional rights. The litigation concerning constitutional rights itself can take two forms. First, there are cases involving the \"state action doctrine,\" which consider whether private actors are performing inherently governmental functions in determining (1) whether those actors must provide the same constitutional rights to third parties that the government must provide, and (2) whether those actors can claim sovereign immunity for certain actions like government officials can. Second, there are cases involving the \"private delegation doctrine,\" which center upon whether a private party was given impermissible authority to legislate or make rules on the government's behalf. Legislating and rulemaking are inherently governmental functions.", "The courts, like GAO, do not have an independent definition of inherently governmental functions. In deciding cases under the FAIR Act or other authorities, the courts use the definitions provided in these sources. Moreover, in at least some such cases, courts give considerable deference to the executive branch's classification of a function as inherently governmental or commercial because of the political question doctrine, under which courts decline to hear issues that have been entrusted to the discretion of another branch of government and that lack judicially discoverable and management standards for their resolution. In Arrowhead Metals, Ltd. v. United States , for example, the court categorized the coinage of money as inherently governmental because it is one of the powers that the Constitution grants to Congress. However, the court also found that the U.S. Mint has discretion to determine whether the stamping of blanks constitutes coinage. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted its \"desire to avoid a legislative-executive controversy\" regarding whether the striking of blanks in the production of coins constitutes an inherently governmental function.", "In other cases not involving the FAIR Act or specific provisions of procurement law or policy, the courts use a test of inherently governmental functions much like that used by GAO, focusing upon the degree to which a private party exercises substantial discretion, or makes judgments, on the government's behalf. Functions classified as inherently governmental under the constitutional test include: ", "conducting elections; exercising the power of eminent domain; providing police services; investigating allegations of child abuse; exercising prosecutorial discretion; chartering, oversight, and regulation of companies; creation of public monopolies; holding the personal property of prisoners; limiting the First Amendment rights of prisoners; taxing and paying governmental indebtedness or obligations; devising tariff regimes; and hiring diplomatic staff or civil servants. ", "Functions categorized as commercial, in contrast, include providing transportation services to citizens , and selling government land on the government's behalf.", "Designations of specific functions as inherently governmental in judicial decisions have the force of law, at least within the jurisdictions where the decisions are precedent and for so long as the decisions are not overturned. However, a judicial declaration that a function is inherently governmental under a constitutional test would not necessarily preclude the executive branch from contracting out this function under the FAIR Act, OMB Circular A-76, the FAR, or OFPP Policy Letter 11-01. Rather, in the \"state action\" context, the designation of a function as inherently governmental means only that the contractor performing the inherently governmental function (1) owes private individuals the same constitutional rights that the government owes them and (2) can potentially claim sovereign immunity like government officials can. Similarly, in the \"private delegation\" context, the designation means only that any regulations issued by the contractor cannot be constitutionally applied to private individuals. The \"private delegation\" doctrine would not necessarily preclude the contractor from performing other functions under the contract that resulted in the contractor's issuance of the regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In sum, the various authorities discussed herein differ somewhat in their treatment of inherently governmental and other functions. The primary differences between them are arguably not in their definitions of inherently governmental function , however, as Table 1 illustrates. Rather, the key differences are in their provisions elaborating and expanding on the definition of inherently governmental functions, provisions which arguably reflect the source's intended purpose and use, not differing conceptions of what constitutes an inherently governmental functions. For example, OMB Circular A-76, which \"establishes federal policy for the competition of commercial activities,\" includes a definition and discussion of commercial services that is not found in other sources. Similarly, OFPP Letter 11-01, which is designed to \"assist agency officers and employees in ensuring that only Federal employees perform work that is inherently governmental or otherwise needs to be reserved to the public sector,\" includes a definition of critical functions and tests for identifying inherently governmental functions, among other things, not found in other sources.
