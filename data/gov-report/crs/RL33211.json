The letters threatened the property owners and managers with up to 20 years in federal prison for violating the so-called \"crack house statute,\" a provision of the CSA enacted in 1986 that made it a federal offense to \"knowingly and intentionally rent, lease, or make available for use, with or without compensation, [a] building, room, or enclosure for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance.\" The DEA letters also threatened the landlords with seizure of their property under the CSA's asset forfeiture provisions.", "In response, L.A. City Council members wrote a letter to DEA Administrator Karen Tandy in Washington urging her to abandon this tactic and allow them to continue work on an ordinance to regulate medical cannabis facilities \"without federal interference.\" They also unanimously approved a resolution endorsing the Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment, which would prohibit such DEA actions and which was about to be debated in the House, as discussed above. An editorial in the Los Angeles Times called the DEA threats to landlords a \"deplorable new bullying tactic.\"", "In subsequent months, DEA expanded this enforcement mechanism to other parts of California, including the Bay Area. In one lawsuit challenging the right of landlords to evict marijuana dispensaries, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled, in April 2008, that federal law preempts California's Compassionate Use Act. If the ruling is affirmed on appeal, it would threaten the future of medical marijuana in California and elsewhere.", "DEA's actions against medical marijuana growing and distribution operations have provoked other lawsuits. In April 2003, for example, the city and county of Santa Cruz, CA, along with seven medical marijuana patients, filed a lawsuit in San Jose federal district court in response to DEA's earlier raid on the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM). The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, thereby allowing WAMM to resume growing and producing marijuana medications for its approximately 250 member-patients with serious illnesses, pending the final outcome of the case.

Any potential problems associated with smoking, they argue, can be reduced by using higher potency marijuana, which means that less has to be inhaled to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Furthermore, marijuana does not have to be smoked to be used as medicine. It can be cooked in various ways and eaten.

Rather, in their view, it became necessary for them to bypass the FDA and go to the states because of the federal government's resistance to marijuana research requests and rescheduling petitions.", "As for the charge that politics should not play a role in the drug approval and controlled substance scheduling processes, medical marijuana supporters point out that marijuana's original listing as a Schedule I substance in 1970 was itself a political act on the part of Congress.", "Scientists on both sides of the issue say more research needs to be done, yet some researchers charge that the federal government has all but shut down marijuana clinical trials for reasons based on politics and ideology rather than science.", "In any case, as the IOM Report pointed out, \"although a drug is normally approved for medical use only on proof of its 'safety and efficacy,' patients with life-threatening conditions are sometimes (under protocols for 'compassionate use') allowed access to unapproved drugs whose benefits and risks are uncertain.\" This was the case with the FDA's IND Compassionate Access Program under which a limited number of patients are provided government-grown medical marijuana to treat their serious medical conditions.", "Some observers believe the pharmaceutical industry and some politicians oppose medical marijuana to protect pharmaceutical industry profits. Because the whole marijuana plant cannot be patented, research efforts must be focused on the development of synthetic cannabinoids such as Marinol. But even if additional cannabinoid drugs are developed and marketed, some believe that doctors and patients should still not be criminalized for recommending and using the natural substance.", "The New England Journal of Medicine has editorialized that", "[A] federal policy that prohibits physicians from alleviating suffering by prescribing marijuana for seriously ill patients is misguided, heavy-handed, and inhumane. Marijuana may have long-term adverse effects and its use may presage serious addictions, but neither long-term side effects nor addiction is a relevant issue in such patients. It is also hypocritical to forbid physicians to prescribe marijuana while permitting them to use morphine and meperidine to relieve extreme dyspnea and pain. With both of these drugs the difference between the dose that relieves symptoms and the dose that hastens death is very narrow; by contrast, there is no risk of death from smoking marijuana. To demand evidence of therapeutic efficacy is equally hypocritical. The noxious sensations that patients experience are extremely difficult to quantify in controlled experiments. What really counts for a therapy with this kind of safety margin is whether a seriously ill patient feels relief as a result of the intervention, not whether a controlled trial \"proves\" its efficacy.", "Some observers suggest that until the federal government relents and becomes more hospitable to marijuana research proposals and more willing to consider moving marijuana to a less restrictive schedule, the medical marijuana issue will continue to be fought at state and local levels of governance. As one patient advocate has stated, \"As the months tick away, it will become more and more obvious that we need to continue changing state laws until the federal government has no choice but to change its inhumane medicinal marijuana laws.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Medical Marijuana Movement Is Politically Inspired", "paragraphs": ["Advocates have tried to legalize marijuana in one form or another for three decades, and the \" medical marijuana \" concept is a Trojan Horse tactic towards the goal of legalization. \u2014Brief of the Drug Free America Foundation, et al., 2004", "Medical marijuana opponents see the movement to promote the use of medical marijuana as a cynical attempt to subvert the Controlled Substances Act and legalize the recreational use of marijuana for all. They see it as a devious tactic in the more than 30-year effort by marijuana proponents to bring an end to marijuana prohibition in the United States and elsewhere.", "They point out that between 1972 and 1978, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) successfully lobbied 11 state legislatures to decriminalize the drug, reducing penalties for possession in most cases to that of a traffic ticket. Also, in 1972, NORML began the first of several unsuccessful attempts to petition DEA to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II on the grounds that crude marijuana had use in medicine.", "Later, beginning with California in 1996, \"drug legalizers\" pushed successfully for passage of medical marijuana voter initiatives in several states, prompting then-Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey, writing in Newsweek , to warn that \"We're on a Perilous Path.\" \"I think it's clear,\" he wrote, \"that a lot of the people arguing for the California proposition and others like it are pushing the legalization of drugs, plain and simple.\"", "Is it cynical or smart for NORML and other drug reform organizations to simultaneously pursue the separate goals of marijuana decriminalization for all, on the one hand, and marijuana rescheduling for the seriously ill, on the other? It is not unusual for political activists tactically to press for\u2014and accept\u2014half-measures in pursuit of a larger strategic goal. Pro-life activists work to prohibit partial-birth abortions and to pass parental notification laws. Gay rights activists seek limited domestic partner benefits as a stepping stone to full marriage equality. Thus is the tactic used on both sides of the cultural divide in America, to the alarm of those opposed.", "It is certainly true that the medical cannabis movement is an offshoot of the marijuana legalization movement. Many individuals and organizations that support medical marijuana also support a broader program of drug law reform. It is also true, however, that many health professionals and other individuals who advocate medical access to marijuana do not support any other changes in U.S. drug control policy. In the same way, not everyone in favor of parental notification laws supports banning abortions for everyone. And not every supporter of domestic partner benefits believes in same-sex marriage.", "In these hot-button issues, ideology and emotion often rule. Marijuana users in general, and medical marijuana users in particular, are demonized by some elements of American society. The ideology of the \"Drug Warriors\" intrudes on the science of medical marijuana, as pointed out by Grinspoon and Bakalar in the Journal of the American Medical Association :", "Advocates of medical use of marihuana are sometimes charged with using medicine as a wedge to open a way for \"recreational\" use. The accusation is false as applied to its target, but expresses in a distorted form a truth about some opponents of medical marihuana: they will not admit that it can be a safe and effective medicine largely because they are stubbornly committed to exaggerating its dangers when used for nonmedical purposes.", "The authors of the IOM Report were aware of the possibility that larger ideological positions could influence one's stand on the specific issue of patient access to medical marijuana when they wrote that", "[I]t is not relevant to scientific validity whether an argument is put forth by someone who believes that all marijuana use should be legal or by someone who believes that any marijuana use is highly damaging to individual users and to society as a whole. (p. 14)", "In other words, it is widely believed that science should rule when it comes to medical issues. Both sides in the medical marijuana debate claim adherence to this principle. The House Government Reform Committee's April 2004 hearing on medical marijuana was titled \"Marijuana and Medicine: The Need for a Science-Based Approach.\" And medical marijuana advocates plead with the federal government to permit scientific research on medical marijuana to proceed.", "Rescheduling marijuana and making it available for medical use and research is not necessarily a step toward legalizing its recreational use. Such a move would put it on a par with cocaine, methamphetamine, morphine, and methadone, all of which are Schedule II substances that are not close to becoming legal for recreational use. Proponents of medical marijuana ask why marijuana should be considered differently than these other scheduled substances.", "It is also arguable that marijuana should indeed be considered differently than cocaine, methamphetamine, morphine, and methadone. Scientists note that marijuana is less harmful and less addictive than these Schedule II substances. Acceptance of medical marijuana could in fact pave the way for its more generalized use. Ethan Nadelmann, head of the Drug Policy Alliance, has observed, \"As medical marijuana becomes more regulated and institutionalized in the West, that may provide a model for how we ultimately make marijuana legal for all adults.\" Medical marijuana opponents have trumpeted his candor as proof of the hypocrisy of those on the other side of the issue. Others note, however, that his comment may be less hypocritical than astute."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
