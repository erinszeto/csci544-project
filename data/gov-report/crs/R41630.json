Among its provisions, the ACA creates a mandate for most U.S. residents to obtain health insurance and provides for the establishment of insurance exchanges through which certain individuals and families will be able to receive federal subsidies to reduce the cost of purchasing that coverage. The new law expands eligibility for Medicaid; amends the Medicare program in ways that are intended to reduce the growth in Medicare spending that had been projected under preexisting law; imposes an excise tax on insurance plans determined to have high premiums; and makes other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and numerous other programs. The ACA also reenacts, amends, and permanently reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). Specifically, Section 10221(a) of the ACA enacted the Indian Health Care Improvement Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2009 ( S. 1790 ) (hereinafter referred to as the IHCIA Reauthorization and Extension Act). Section 10221(b) of the ACA amended sections of the IHCIA Reauthorization and Extension Act (e.g., Sections 111, 134, and 201) and amended one section of IHCIA not included in the IHCIA Reauthorization and Extension Act (Section 806).

", "IHCIA authorizes many specific IHS activities, sets out the national policy for health services administered to Indians, and sets health condition goals for the IHS service population to reduce \"the prevalence and incidence of preventable illnesses among, and unnecessary and premature deaths of, Indians.\" Prior to the ACA, IHCIA was last fully reauthorized by the Indian Health Amendments of 1992, which extended authorizations of its appropriations through FY2000. The authorizations for all IHCIA programs were later extended through FY2001. Although authority had expired, IHCIA authorized programs continued to receive annual appropriations since FY2001.

IHS provides services in 35 states, subdivided into 12 geographic \"Areas\" that consist of one or more states. Each Area is administered by an Area Office; Areas, in turn, are further subdivided into service units that consist of one or more facilities. IHS may provide services directly, or Indian tribes (ITs) or tribal organizations (TOs) may operate IHS facilities and programs themselves through self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts negotiated with IHS. Although most IHS facilities are located on or near reservations, IHS also funds urban Indian health projects (UIHPs), through grants or contracts to urban Indian organizations (UIOs). ", "The IHCIA authorizes many specific IHS activities, sets out the national policy for health services administered to Indians, and declares that one of the federal goals for the health condition of the IHS service population is to \"provide the quantity and quality of health services that will permit the health status of Indians to be raised to the highest possible level.\" Significantly, IHCIA authorizes direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party insurers. IHCIA also gave IHS authority to grant funding to UIOs, authorized programs to expand the health care workforce providing services at IHS-funded facilities, and authorized programs that address health concerns for the American Indian and Alaska Native population (e.g., substance abuse, suicide, diabetes).

This report is primarily for reference purposes. The material in it is intended to provide context to help the reader understand the intent of the ACA's individual provisions at the time of enactment. The act includes two titles. Title I contains amendments to the eight IHCIA titles. Title II amends and reauthorizes the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act, which authorizes health education, health promotion, disease prevention services, and health professions scholarship programs for Native Hawaiians. This report focuses on Title I, which contains eight sections, each of which amends a specific IHCIA Title. Title I also, with some exceptions, consolidates IHCIA appropriations into a single section, repealing authorizations that had previously been included at the end of each of IHCIA's eight titles. The section numbers below refer to the section numbers in the IHCIA Reauthorization and Extension Act. Where appropriate, sections amended by Section 10221(b) of the ACA are noted. The subtitles below refer to those in the IHCIA Reauthorization and Extension Act, which correspond to the IHCIA title they amend. Each subtitle begins with some background on the IHCIA title it amends to provide context for the descriptions of the law's provisions. This background reflects the policy issues at the time of enactment and does not reflect the effects of the ACA. Table 1 describes the major differences between the IHCIA and the IHCIA Reauthorization Extension Act.

The term \"Secretary,\" as used in this report, means the Secretary of HHS, unless otherwise indicated. The term \"Indian\" in this report refers to \"Indian\" as defined in IHCIA. Under this definition, an Indian is a person who is a member of a federally recognized tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or group, or regional or village corporation, as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The ACA also defined a number of new Indian-related terms. Two of the new terms most frequently used in this report are Indian Health Program and Tribal Health Program. \"Indian Health Program\" (IHP) is defined as (1) any health program administered by the IHS, (2) any Tribal Health Program, or (3) any Indian tribe or tribal organization to which the Secretary provides funding under the Buy Indian Act. \"Tribal Health Program\" (THP) is defined as any IT or TO operating any health program, service, function, activity, or facility funded, in whole or part, by the IHS through, or provided for in, a contract or compact with the IHS under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA).
