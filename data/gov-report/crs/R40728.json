Among its many provisions, the act contains a variety of tax cuts and spending initiatives, whose estimated 10-year cost comes to $787 billion. The tax provisions account for 36% of that amount, or $285.6 billion. Most of this cost is due to tax benefits for individuals, as the 10-year cost of the business tax provisions totals $6.2 billion, or about 2% of the total cost of the tax incentives.", "This report identifies the tax provisions in ARRA that have a significant potential to benefit a large number of small firms in a wide range of industries.

No standard or uniform definition undergirds the federal laws and regulations that provide assistance to small business. Instead, a variety of standards (e.g., employment or asset size) is used to identify eligible firms. In collecting and releasing economic data on small business, the Small Business Administration defines a small firm as any firm with 500 or fewer employees in a recent year. A similar definition implicitly guides the analysis presented here.", "A review of the business tax provisions included in ARRA suggests that 11 of them have the potential to benefit a large number of small firms in a broad range of industries. They include one-year extensions of the bonus depreciation allowance, the enhanced expensing allowance, and the option to claim a refundable tax credit in lieu of the bonus depreciation allowance for unused research and alternative minimum tax credits from tax years starting before 2006.", "Five of the provisions are targeted at small firms: (1) extension of the enhanced expensing allowance through 2009; (2) extended net operating loss carryback period for losses incurred in 2008; (3) temporary increase in the exclusion of gain on the sale of small business stock; (4) temporary reduction of the recognition period for the built-in gains tax for S corporations; and (5) lower estimated tax payments for certain small business owners in 2009.

No standard or uniform definition undergirds the federal laws and regulations aimed at providing assistance to small business. Instead, several criteria are used to identify eligible firms.", "This lack of uniformity is readily apparent in existing federal small business tax preferences. Some rely on the size of assets, gross receipts, or employment to identify eligible firms. A few others confer benefits on small firms not through an explicit size limitation but through the design of the preferences themselves. A case in point is the expensing allowance under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The maximum allowance, which has varied over time and is set at $250,000 in 2009, may be claimed by firms that spend $800,000 or less on qualified depreciable assets and place them in service before the end of that year. But the allowance is reduced dollar for dollar when spending on those assets climbs above $800,000. As a result, firms that spend more than $1,050,000 on qualified assets can claim no allowance in 2009. This phaseout rule effectively confines the benefits of the allowance to firms that are relatively small in asset size.", "The Small Business Act (P.L. 85-536, as amended) grants the SBA the authority to establish or modify the size standards and limits used to determine eligibility for all federal (non-tax) programs to aid small business. With one notable exception, the SBA uses two standards to determine eligibility for the programs it administers: (1) number of employees and (2) average annual receipts in the previous three years. Application of these standards varies by industry. For example, the standard for firms classified in the mining and manufacturing industries is employment size: a firm in either industry is considered small if it employed an average of 500 or fewer workers in the previous year. In the case of firms classified in the service or retail industries, however, the standard is average annual receipt size: a firm in either industry is considered small if its average annual receipts in the previous three years totaled $6 million or less. SBA's limits for the two standards currently range from 50 to 1,500 employees, and from $0.75 million to $35.5 million average annual receipts. The exception is the financial services industry: the SBA considers firms in that industry small if their assets are valued at $175 million or less. Compounding the confusion over how to define a small firm, the SBA uses a single size standard of 500 or fewer employees to identify the firms eligible for the economic data on small business it collects and publishes.", "Ultimately, the definition of a small firm involves making what amounts to arbitrary choices about a standard that applies to all firms in all industries (e.g., employment, assets, revenues) and a size limit for that standard (e.g., fewer than 500 employees, less than $10 million in assets or gross income). Given the differences among industries in such vital characteristics as sources of income, the technologies used to generate output, production inputs, and the nature of competition, it is reasonable to question whether a single standard should apply to all firms in all industries. And even if interested parties could agree on such a standard, there is no simple, obvious, or logical solution to the problem of where to draw the line between small firms and all other firms. Indeed, the difficult challenges posed by those questions may partly explain why current federal support for small business is built around multiple eligibility criteria. Lawmakers may have no other choice, realistically, for one size seemingly does not fit all firms.", "No explicit size standard underlies the following discussion of the tax provisions in ARRA that might benefit many small firms in a wide range of industries.

", "While it is difficult to determine how small firms on the whole are responding to the tax incentives in ARRA, there is a readily available rough indicator of the stimulus they could provide: the revenue effects of ARRA as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). For many business tax incentives, the larger the revenue loss they produce, the greater their effect on some key aspect of business activity, whether it be hiring, cash flow, investment, or sales. According to the JCT, the five tax provisions that are targeted at small firms could produce a combined revenue loss of $5.7 billion in FY2009; the six other tax provisions that could benefit many small firms are expected to result in a combined revenue loss of $52.0 billion in the same year. These amounts should not be seen as equivalent to the added output by companies of all sizes that could arise from the 11 tax provisions. A significant share of the estimated revenue loss represents a deferral of tax liability, which is to say that the deferred taxes will have to be paid in some future tax year. Still, the estimated revenue loss measures the extent to which companies of all sizes take advantage of the tax incentives, and at least some of that usage could eventually show up as greater investment or hiring by certain companies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ARRA Tax Provisions Targeted at Small Firms", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enhanced Expensing Allowance for 2009: Section 1202 of the Act and IRC Section 179", "paragraphs": ["In computing their income tax liability, business taxpayers are allowed to deduct from gross income all the costs they incurred in earning it. For many of these costs, the full amount is deducted in the year when the production inputs are purchased, or in the year when the items made from the inputs are sold.", "But purchases of capital goods and other durable business assets receive different treatment under the tax rules for cost recovery. Their cost generally is recovered not in the year of purchase but over a number of years intended to approximate the actual useful lives of the assets. Over time, the assets lose value through wear and tear and obsolescence. This decline in value is known as economic depreciation. Current tax law allows firms to claim a deduction for the depreciation of their tangible assets; most deductions are based on the depreciation schedules for what is known as the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). ", "Recovering the cost of an asset faster than the rate at which its actual value declines is known as accelerated depreciation. Under this method of cost recovery, firms deduct more of the cost of an asset in the present and less in the future than they would under depreciation schedules based on rates of economic depreciation. This forward shift in the deduction schedule lowers current tax liabilities at the expense of higher tax payments in the future, all other things being equal. Since a deduction is generally worth more to a firm today than in the future, accelerated depreciation has the effect of reducing the marginal effective tax rate on new investments in qualified assets; this reduction in turn lowers the cost of capital for those investments, making them more attractive to business owners and managers. Expensing, which involves writing off the entire cost of an asset in the year when it was acquired or placed in service, is the most accelerated method of depreciation.", "The deferral of income tax entailed by accelerated depreciation also temporarily boosts the cash flow of firms making qualified investments, all other things being equal. The increase is greater for longer-lived assets than shorter-lived ones. An increase in cash flow could trigger a rise in investment by firms that rely heavily on internal funds to finance new investments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Impact of ARRA", "paragraphs": ["ARRA extends through 2009 an enhanced expensing allowance under IRC Section 179. While there is no size limit on the firms that can benefit from the allowance, its design effectively confines its use to smaller firms. The current allowance had expired at the end of 2008.", "Under the expensing allowance, firms may deduct up to $250,000 of the cost of new and used qualified assets purchased and placed in service in 2009; the maximum allowance decreases, dollar for dollar, when a firm's total spending on those assets that year exceeds $800,000. Unlike the bonus depreciation allowance that ARRA extended through 2009, the expensing allowance will remain in effect after 2009, but its maximum amount and phaseout threshold are scheduled to drop so that by 2011 and thereafter, the allowance will be fixed at $25,000 and the threshold at 200,000. The allowance may be claimed for purchases of machinery, equipment, and business software; it does not apply to purchases of real property like commercial or industrial buildings. ", "In combination, the bonus depreciation and expensing allowances extended by ARRA substantially (but temporarily) speed up the depreciation of qualified assets by allowing firms to deduct between 50% and 100% of the cost of those assets purchased and placed into service in 2009. Firms taking both allowances are required to claim the expensing allowance first, followed by any bonus depreciation allowance, and then by any regular depreciation deduction allowed under the MACRS they can take on their remaining adjusted basis in eligible assets. ", "The JCT has estimated that the extension of the enhanced expensing allowance through 2009 will produce a revenue loss of $331 million from FY2009 to FY2013, and $206 billion from FY2009 to FY2018, relative to federal tax law before the enactment of ARRA. The loss decreases over time because it is front-loaded, which is to say that use of the allowance reduces tax payments in the first few years but raises them in later years.", "In extending the bonus depreciation and expensing allowances through the end of 2009, Congress evidently was intending to spur a temporary rise in business investment. There is ample support for such an approach in both theory and empirical reality.", "In theory, a time-limited investment tax incentive like the enhanced expensing allowance should alter the timing of qualified investments, but not necessarily the total amount invested over time. By lowering the cost of capital for purchases of qualified assets during 2009 only, the enhanced allowance, particularly in combination with the extended bonus depreciation allowance, gives many large and small firms an incentive to move forward qualified investments they planned to make in later years. The reduction in the cost of capital is greater for longer-lived assets than it is for shorter-lived ones, as the bonus depreciation allowance causes a larger increase in the present value of depreciation allowances for the former than for the latter, and the enhanced expensing allowance simply amplifies this effect, to the extent it can be used. So in theory, the allowances could be expected to spur a bigger rise in spending on qualified assets with a recovery period of 10 to 20 years than on qualified assets with a recovery period of three to seven years. Moreover, standard economic models of the impact of income taxes on business investment suggest that the allowances are likely to initiate a process where business investment rises right after they go into effect, rises again just before they expire, and then drops after they do expire. Reflecting the temporary nature of the stimulus, the domestic capital stock eventually could return to the level it would have reached without the allowances.", "In addition, several recent studies have concluded that business investment is moderately sensitive to tax incentives. On the whole, they indicate that the elasticity or responsiveness of investment to changes in the effective tax rate is around -0.5; this means that a 10% reduction in the tax rate eventually leads to an increase in investment of 5%. In combination, the bonus depreciation allowance and the expensing allowance can substantially lower the effective tax rate on the returns to investment in qualified assets.", "How are small firms as a whole likely to respond to the two temporary investment tax incentives?", "There are good reasons to doubt that most small firms will substantially increase their investment in response to the two accelerated depreciation allowances\u2014though it would not be surprising if they were to spend more than they otherwise would on the most heavily subsidized qualified assets. This expectation is tied to recent U.S. experience with partial expensing allowances, what is known about the effectiveness of temporary investment tax incentives, and perhaps above all, the weak climate for domestic business investment.", "Available research findings indicate that the bonus depreciation allowances that were available from the final quarter of 2001 through the end of 2004 had a modest impact on the U.S. economy. A 2006 study by economists Christopher House and Matthew Shapiro estimated that in 2003, the allowances may have increased gross domestic product (GDP) by $10 billion to $20 billion and may have been responsible for the creation of 100,000 to 200,000 jobs. The same researchers estimated that purchases of longer-lived assets (i.e., assets with a recovery period of 10 to 20 years under the MACRS) received a subsidy from the allowances that was three to five times greater than the subsidy for shorter-lived assets (i.e., assets with a recovery period of three to seven years). As a result, House and Shapiro concluded that investment in the more heavily subsidized assets rose by as much as 40% relative to what might have occurred without the allowances. Another study found that the same partial expensing allowances had \"only a very limited impact ... on investment spending, if any.\" As supporting evidence, the researchers cited the results of a 2005 survey conducted by the Institute for Supply Management that indicated that less than 10% of the 115 respondents said the bonus depreciation allowances had a significant influence on the timing of their capital spending in the previous two years. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office has noted that there was a lack of solid evidence that the allowances affected the timing of investment around the expiration date, or that they strongly affected investment in the assets that received the greatest subsidy.", "There appear to be no similar studies of the impact of the IRC Section 179 expensing allowance on the timing or long-term level of business investment.", "Still, it is not entirely clear why the earlier bonus depreciation allowances did not have the impact on business investment that some economists and lawmakers had expected. Analysts cite several factors that could explain why their combined short-term effects were so modest. First, most firms may have expected Congress to extend the 50% allowance beyond 2004, lessening their incentive to accelerate the timing of planned qualified investments. Second, many firms may have found it impossible to undertake planned future investments within the time frame for the allowances; for many firms, the planning horizons for new qualified investments may have been too long to take advantage of the allowances. And last but not least, many firms may have had too little income, or too many loss carryforwards, from 2001 to 2004 to benefit from the allowances.", "Some of the same factors may be affecting use of the allowances in 2009. Although lower capital costs should encourage some additional investment by small firms, most of the tax benefit from the allowances in 2009 may end up going to firms that would have made qualified investments without the subsidies. Because both tax incentives were available in 2008, it is also possible that some investments that had been planned for 2009 were moved up to 2008.", "But the current slump in domestic economic activity, coupled with the considerable uncertainty surrounding when and how the economy will recover, a growing reluctance among companies to spend the cash they have, and the difficulties many small firms are having obtaining funds from lenders, appears to be having a stronger effect on small business investment so far in 2009 than the two expensing allowances. ", "Since late 2007, domestic economic activity has been caught in a worsening recession that has shown few signs of abating. From the first quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009, real gross domestic product fell at an average annual rate of 2.6%. Corporate profits, a major factor in business investment, dropped 21% in 2008, when measured on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. U.S. production in manufacturing, mining, and utilities decreased by 13.4% from May 2008 to May 2009, and total capacity use in the three sectors was 68.3% in May 2009, down from 78.9% a year earlier. ", "In response, firms of all employment sizes have been eliminating or postponing investment projects. From the first quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009, real business investment in equipment and software, the main assets targeted by the both the expensing and bonus depreciation allowances, declined at an average annual rate of 15%. Some economic forecasters are predicting that business spending on new plant and equipment will fall more in 2009 than it did in 2008.", "Small firms have not been immune to the effects of the recession on capital spending. The NFIB, a leading trade association for the U.S. small business community, recently reported that small business owners \"continue to defer any (investment) project not essential to the survival of the firm.\" According to the latest NFIB survey of small business owners, only 5% expressed the belief that the period from June through August 2009 will be a good time to expand operations; their actual combined earnings from February through April 2009 were 43% lower than they were from November 2008 through January 2009; and only 20% of owners said they plan to make a capital expenditure in the period from June through December 2009. The reluctance to invest in capital goods reflects not only widespread pessimism among small business owners about the prospects for a sharp rebound in consumer spending in the next year or so, but also a strong interest among those owners in conserving the cash they have and recent sharp cutbacks in the lines of credit available to many small firms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Five-Year Carryback of Net Operating Losses for Qualified Small Firms: Section 1211 of the Act and IRC Section 172", "paragraphs": ["In general, federal tax law allows firms that incur a net operating loss (NOL) to use that loss to lower taxable income in a tax year when they earn (or earned) positive net income. The reduction in taxable income for that year should result in a partial or full refund of any income taxes paid. An NOL arises when a firm's deductions exceed its gross income.", "Under IRC Section 172, firms can carry an NOL back to each of the two tax years preceding the loss year, or carry the NOL forward to each of the 20 tax years following the loss year. Unless a firm elects not to do so, it is required to carry an NOL back two years before applying any remaining loss to a future tax year. There are some exceptions to the two-year limitation on NOL carrybacks. For instance, NOLs incurred in the 2001 or 2002 tax years can be carried back up to five years, and taxpayers may carry back up to three years any portion of an NOL that is due to what are known as \"eligible losses,\" which include farming and natural disaster losses.", "ARRA adds another exception by permitting eligible small firms to carry back more than two and fewer than six years (or from 2003 to 2005) NOLs that began or ended in the 2008 tax year. Those losses can still be carried forward up to 20 years. C and S Corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships can take advantage of this exception only if a firm's average annual gross receipts in the previous three tax years totaled $15 million or less. In the case of firms that did not exist during each of the three tax years before 2008, the gross receipts test applies to the period in which they had business income.", "The JCT has estimated that the extended NOL carryback period will result in a revenue loss of $2.1 billion from FY2009 to FY2013, and $1.0 billion from FY2009 to FY2018, relative to federal tax law before the enactment of ARRA. The loss is front-loaded, as eligible firms with NOLs in 2008 that carry them back an additional three years would have that much less to carry forward.", "How many small firms are likely to benefit from the extended carryback period for NOLs? It cannot be determined from available small business data how many firms are eligible to claim this temporary tax benefit and how many eligible firms had NOLs in 2008. So the question cannot be answered for the time being.", "In theory, the provision could lead eligible firms to do more of anything requiring the expenditure of funds in 2009 than they otherwise would. Use of the extended carryback period for a 2008 NOL makes it possible for a company to receive a refund equal to the amount of the NOL sometime in 2009 or 2010 of federal income taxes it paid in 2003 to 2005. For example, this refund, when paired with the reduction in the cost of capital for qualified investments and boost in cash flow arising from the two accelerated depreciation provisions in ARRA, could allow the company to purchase in 2009 assets that are eligible for both depreciation allowances that it otherwise might not consider acquiring until the economy begins a sustained recovery. This outcome is especially likely for eligible small firms that are profitable (despite the recession) but having difficulty raising capital from lenders or investors. Of course, eligible firms that have no immediate profitable investment opportunities could use any tax refund for numerous other purposes, including increasing employee wages, hiring additional workers, or spending more on research and development.", "Nonetheless, there are several reasons to question whether the extended NOL carryback provision will have such an impact on many eligible firms in 2009.", "One important consideration is the link between the provision and the cost of capital for business investment or consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of real GDP. In general, business spending on structures and equipment is apt to rise when a majority of firms expect their current capacity to deliver goods and services to be insufficient to meet projected increases in demand, and when the expected rate of return on investment in those assets exceeds the cost of capital. But the extended NOL carryback has no direct effect on the cost of capital or consumer spending, making it a relatively ineffective means of stimulating the economy.", "In addition, small firms receiving an infusion of cash during a sustained economic downturn may be more inclined to hold on to it for the time being than to use it to increase investment or hire more workers. The considerable uncertainty over when the U.S. economy will begin to grow again and what forces will drive the growth may reinforce this inclination.", "It also appears that some of the firms that could claim the extended NOL carryback provision would not benefit from it, further restricting its potential to stimulate increased investment and employment among small firms. Basically, the provision mainly benefits small firms that experienced a loss in 2008 but were mostly profitable during the four or five preceding years. Newer firms with a string of losses in recent years would reap no immediate benefit from it, nor would small firms whose owners can offset any business losses with income from other sources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exclusion of Gain on the Sale of Qualified Small Business Stock: Section 1241 of ARRA and IRC Section 1202", "paragraphs": ["Current tax law allows individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers (e.g., partnerships and S corporations) to exclude from gross income up to 50% of any gain on the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock (QSBS). The gain on any QSBS issued by a single firm that may be excluded in a tax year is limited to the greater of $10 million, less any gain excluded in previous tax years, or 10 times a taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock. When this provision was added to the tax code in 1993, the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains was 28%. While this rate has been lowered several times since then and now stands at 15%, the portion of any gain on the disposition of QSBS that is subject to taxation is still taxed at a rate of 28%. As a result, the effective tax rate for gains on the sale of this stock is 14%, compared to an effective rate of 15% on any gains on the sale or exchange of other long-term capital assets. The partial exclusion is treated as a preference item for the purpose of computing the individual AMT.", "To qualify for this preferential treatment, a stock must be acquired by a qualified taxpayer at its original issue and held for at least five years. The stock must also be issued by a C corporation that had adjusted gross assets valued at no more than $50 million and used 80% or more of its assets in the active conduct of one or more qualified trades or businesses, when the stock was issued.", "The partial exclusion is intended to augment the flow of equity capital to small start-up firms that are having difficulty raising funds from traditional sources such as angel investors, banks, and venture capital firms. It does so by boosting the potential after-tax returns an investor could earn by buying and selling QSBS, relative to comparable alternative investments. There are no known studies of how effective the partial exclusion has been in achieving its intended purpose.", "Under the ARRA, 75% of any gain on a QSBS acquired after February 17, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, may be excluded from taxation. This temporary expansion in the exclusion means that any gain on qualified stock realized by an investor in the highest tax bracket under the regular income tax will be taxed at an effective rate of 7% under the regular income tax and 12.9% under the AMT.", "The JCT has estimated that the provision will lead to a revenue gain of $9 million from FY2009 to FY2013, and a revenue loss of $807 million from FY2009 to FY2018, relative to federal tax law before the enactment of ARRA. Most of the revenue loss is projected to occur from FY2014 to FY2016, as the JCT expects many taxpayers who purchase QSBS in 2009 and 2010 to sell it five or six years later.", "The provision is likely to spur greater equity investment in small firms that can issue QSBS than otherwise would be the case. But how large that increase could turn out to be is difficult to project. The search for a plausible answer is hampered by a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of the partial exclusion as a tool for boosting equity investment in new small firms. It is also hindered by the uncertainty surrounding the near-term outlook for the economy and business profits. Investing in small start-up firms has always entailed considerable risk, but the current economic downturn and the large losses suffered by many investors and financial institutions in the previous two years appear to have compounded this risk. There is some evidence that investors have responded to this heightened risk by substantially reducing their investment in small start-up firms. The amount of domestic investment by venture capital firms fell from $7.7 billion in the first quarter of 2008 to $3.0 billion in the same quarter of 2009.

The firms can be organized in a way that subjects them to an entity-level income tax, or they can be organized as some kind of passthrough entity, thus avoiding an entity-level tax. C corporations are subject to a tax on their net income, while passthrough entities such as partnerships and S corporations are not taxed on their net income. Instead, the net income and other tax items (e.g., NOLs, deductions, and credits) of these entities pass through to their owners according to their ownership shares, which means that any net income is added to the owners' taxable income from other sources and reported on their individual tax returns. An important consideration in selecting a legal organizational form is the tax burden on the returns to investment associated with each form.", "An S corporation offers the tax advantage of passthrough treatment, while retaining the non-tax advantages of corporate status under federal securities law and state law. For tax purposes, an S corporation and its shareholders are treated more like a partnership and its partners than a C corporation and its shareholders. To qualify as an S corporation, a business entity must satisfy certain requirements with regard to its capital structure and the size and composition of its shareholders.", "Under current law, S corporations that once were organized as C corporations generally are subject to a corporate-level tax, during what is known as a 10-year recognition period, on any net built-in gains they realize on the sale, exchange, or distribution of assets they held at the time of conversion. The gains occurred when an S corporation operated as a C corporation; so the gains are regarded as built into the assets the latter held when it converted to the former. The tax is limited during the recognition period to the aggregate net built-in gain at the time of the conversion. An S corporation's 10-year recognition period commences on the first day of the first tax year when a corporation that once was a C corporation begins to operate for tax purposes as a newly minted S corporation. No built-in gains tax applies to S corporations that never were organized as a C corporation, or to S corporations that have no assets acquired from a C corporation in a non-recognition transaction, or to assets an S corporation acquires during the period when its S election is valid.", "IRC Section 1374(d)(8) extends the built-in gains tax to any net recognized built-in gain an S corporation realizes during the recognition period from the sale or distribution of assets it acquired in a carryover basis transaction with a C corporation. In such a transaction, the S corporation's basis in the acquired assets is based, in whole or in part, on the C corporation's basis in those assets at the time of the acquisition. ", "The built-in-gains tax is computed by applying the highest corporate income tax rate (35% under current law) to an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for the tax year. Such a gain is defined as the lesser of (1) the amount that would be the taxable income of the S corporation if only the recognized built-in gains and recognized built-in losses were considered, or (2) the corporation's actual taxable income. The amount of gain that can be taxed in a year is limited to the excess of an S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain over the net recognized built-in gain from previous years. Net unrealized built-in gain is the excess of the fair market value of the corporation's assets on the first day it operates as an S corporation over its aggregate basis in those assets.", "There are several ways in which the tax can be reduced in a tax year. Any net operating losses carried forward from tax years when an S corporation operated as a C corporation can be deducted from the net recognized built-in gain of the S corporation. Capital losses that are carried forward from years after the conversion may be used to offset any net recognized built-in gains. And any business tax credits that are carried forward from tax years when the corporation operated as a C corporation may be used to reduce the built-in gains tax of the S corporation.", "In enacting the built-in gains tax in 1986, Congress was trying to prevent C corporations from converting to S corporations mainly to avoid paying a corporate tax on any gains from the sale or exchange of appreciated assets, or their distribution to individual shareholders, as part of a complete liquidation. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ) repealed what was then known as the General Utilities doctrine, which allowed C corporations to make tax-free distributions to individual shareholders before the firms were liquidated. As a result of the repeal, when C corporations distribute appreciated assets to individual shareholders or sell them as part of a complete liquidation, any gains are subject to taxation at both the corporate and individual levels. IRC Section 1374 imposes a double tax on the sale, exchange, or distribution of appreciated assets held by a C corporation at the time it converts to an S corporation: a corporate-level tax applies to net recognized built-in gains that the S corporation realizes during the 10-year recognition period, and the firm's shareholders must also pay taxes on the gains.", "ARRA shortens the recognition period from 10 years to 7 years for S corporations that sell in 2009 or 2010 appreciated assets they held at the time of their conversion from a C corporation. This means that no built-in gains tax will be imposed on those transactions if the tax year immediately preceding either of those years represents the seventh year of an S corporation's recognition period. The 10-year recognition period will be reinstated for qualified assets sold or otherwise disposed of in 2011 and beyond.", "The provision gives owners of S corporations formed through the conversion of a C corporation from 1999 to 2002 more flexibility in responding to the current economic downturn. In 2009 and 2010, they can sell appreciated assets without paying the tax and retain or invest the proceeds as a means of bolstering their prospects for surviving the downturn. Or they can hold on to those assets for another few years in the hope they will fetch higher prices once the economy recovers. Sharp declines in the fair market value of real estate and marketable securities and dramatic losses of liquidity in financial markets in the past two years triggered the recession.

In addition, a firm may benefit from the allowance only if it is the original user of a qualified asset, and it places the asset in service in 2009; a one-year extension of this deadline is available for certain assets with a recovery period of 10 or more years and for certain transportation property.", "In combination, the bonus depreciation and expensing allowances extended by ARRA substantially (but temporarily) speed up the depreciation of qualified assets by allowing firms to deduct between 50% and 100% of the cost of those assets purchased and placed into service in 2009. Firms taking both allowances are required to claim the expensing allowance first, followed by any bonus depreciation allowance, and then by any regular depreciation deduction allowed under the MACRS they can take on their remaining adjusted basis in eligible assets. ", "The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has estimated that the extension of the bonus depreciation allowance through 2009 will produce a revenue loss of $17.7 billion from FY2009 to FY2013, and $6.0 billion from FY2009 to FY2018, relative to federal tax law before the enactment of ARRA. The loss decreases over time because it is front-loaded, which is to say that use of the allowance reduces tax payments in the first two years but raises them in later years.", "In extending the bonus depreciation and expensing allowances through the end of 2009, Congress evidently was attempting to spur a temporary rise in business investment. There is ample support for such an approach in both theory and empirical reality.", "In theory, a time-limited investment tax incentive like the bonus depreciation allowance should alter the timing of qualified investments, but not necessarily the total amount invested over time. By lowering the cost of capital for purchases of qualified assets during 2009 only, the two allowances have the potential to speed up the timing of qualified investments firms planned to make in later years or postponed because of the recession. The reduction in the cost of capital is greater for longer-lived assets than it is for shorter-lived ones, as the bonus depreciation allowance causes a larger increase in the present value of depreciation allowances for the former than for the latter, and the enhanced expensing allowance amplifies this effect, to the extent it can be used.", "In addition, several recent studies have concluded that business investment is moderately sensitive to tax incentives. On the whole, they indicate that the elasticity or responsiveness of investment to changes in the effective tax rate is around -0.5; this means that a 10% reduction in the tax rate eventually leads to an increase in investment of 5%. In combination, the bonus depreciation allowance and the expensing allowance can substantially lower the effective tax rate on the returns to investment in qualified assets.", "How are small firms as a whole likely to respond to the two temporary investment tax incentives? There are good reasons to doubt that most small firms will substantially increase their investment in response to the two accelerated depreciation allowances\u2014though it would not be surprising if they were to spend more in 2009 than they otherwise would on the most heavily subsidized qualified assets. This expectation is tied to recent U.S. experience with partial expensing allowances, what is known about the effectiveness of temporary investment tax incentives, and perhaps above all, the weak climate for domestic business investment. ", "Available studies of the impact of the bonus depreciation allowance that was in effect from late 2001 through 2004 indicate that the allowance had only a modest impact on the economy and business investment. (See page 9 for a summary of the main findings of these studies.)", "It is not entirely clear why the earlier bonus depreciation allowances had less of a stimulative effect than some economists and lawmakers had expected. Analysts cite several factors that could explain why their combined short-term effects were so muted. First, most firms may have expected Congress to extend the 50% allowance beyond 2004, lessening their incentive to accelerate the timing of planned qualified investments. Second, many firms may have found it impossible to undertake planned future investments within the time frame for the allowances; for many firms, the planning horizons for new qualified investments may have been too long to take advantage of the allowances. And last but not least, many firms may have had too little income in 2001 to 2004 to benefit from the allowances.", "Some of the same factors may be affecting use of the allowances in 2009. Although lower capital costs should encourage some additional investment by small firms, most of the total tax benefit from the allowances in 2009 may end up going to firms that would have made qualified investments without the subsidies. These are firms that still have profits and adequate access to funds to finance new investments. Because both tax incentives were available in 2008, it is also possible that some investments that had been planned for 2009 were moved up to 2008.", "Still, the current slump in domestic economic activity, coupled with the considerable uncertainty surrounding when and how the economy will recover, a growing reluctance among companies to spend the cash they have, and the difficulties many small firms are having obtaining funds from lenders appear to be having a stronger effect on small business investment so far in 2009 than the two expensing allowances.

", "To what extent will small firms as a whole benefit from this temporary expansion? No estimates are available, but there are several reasons to question whether the expanded WOTC is likely to spark a wave of job creation among small firms. Given that the economy contracted in four of the six quarters from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2009 and shed 5.7 million more jobs than it created from December 2007 through April 2009, it seems unlikely that a one-time maximum tax credit of $2,400 per qualified worker would be sufficient to convince many small firms to hire more low-wage workers in the next year or so. The credit is only immediately beneficial to firms with tax liabilities, but business profits have declined sharply in recent quarters and show few signs of reversing course anytime soon. Then again, it is possible that many of the small firms that take the expanded credit in the next year or two will end up receiving a tax benefit for jobs that they would have created in any event. One of the major findings of a 2001 study of the use of the credit done for the U.S. Department of Labor was that the credit played \"little or no role\" in the recruitment efforts of the 16 employers interviewed for the analysis. This finding suggested the employers would have hired the members of the targeted groups without the credit.

As a result, the $1 million in bonds are now worth only $500,000. If the corporation were to repurchase the debt at its current market value (or exchange it for other debt that is also valued at $500,000), the $500,000 difference between the original value and the current value would be considered taxable income in 2009.", "There are several exceptions to this general rule.

In their view, DOI income is burdensome partly because the transactions that produce it seldom yield enough cash to pay any tax on it. This burden could worsen during the current recession. For example, a taxpayer who had been counting on other assets or sources of capital to pay any taxes on its DOI income may find that sharp declines in the values of those assets and a lack of liquidity in financial markets have made it difficult to raise the needed funds.", "But critics point out that the main beneficiaries of this temporary tax benefit are likely to be firms that already have adequate reserves of cash to repurchase debt. In their view, these firms would be likely to repurchase their debt in a recession with or without the temporary deferral of DOI income under ARRA; so for them, it can be argued, the deferral constitutes a windfall gain. At the same time, according to some critics, the provision is likely to be of little or no benefit to the firms that have the greatest need of assistance: namely, those who lack the cash reserves to lower their level of debt.

A firm may claim the entire amount of a refundable credit, regardless of whether or not it has a tax liability. Since firms make it a priority to reduce their tax payments as much as possible over time, a key consideration in choosing between the refundable credit and the bonus depreciation allowance is the long-term tax consequences of each option. Some corporations may lower their federal tax burden more by taking the allowance instead of the refundable credit.", "How many small corporations are likely to benefit from the temporary extension of the refundable credit? It is difficult to say. There are no known estimates of how small C corporations are likely to use to it. The current economic downturn is forcing many of them into bankruptcy or liquidation, and many of the small corporations still operating are losing money, cutting their staffing and production capacity, and conserving their cash in a determined bid to outlast the worst of the recession. So surviving small corporations seem unlikely to invest large amounts in 2009 in the assets eligible for the bonus depreciation allowance. And without this investment, no corporation of any size can benefit from the refundable credit. In the current recession, the biggest obstacle to widespread use of the credit by firms with unused research and AMT credits from tax years beginning before 2006 appears to be the requirement that a corporation must purchase assets eligible for the bonus depreciation allowance in order to use the credit.", "This requirement may explain why the JCT expects little revenue loss from use of the refundable credit in 2009.

In 2008, employees with employer-provided health insurance paid, on average, 16% of the cost of their own coverage and 27% of the cost of family coverage. With the subsidy, they pay 35% of the cost of COBRA coverage. After the nine-month subsidy ends, unemployed individuals will have to bear 102% of the premium to maintain their COBRA coverage until their 18-month period of eligibility expires.", "Nor is it known how many small firms will receive the COBRA subsidy for paying for 65% of the cost of COBRA coverage for former employees. In 2008, 62% of firms with three to 199 employees offered health insurance to employees, compared to 99% of firms with 200 or more employees. Nearly 41 million workers between the ages of 18 and 64 received employer-provided health insurance in 2007, or about 50% of all private-sector non-elderly workers with such coverage.", "In the current economic slump, small firms making COBRA payments could face added strains on their cash flow as a result. Though they are reimbursed by claiming a credit against their quarterly employment tax payments by filing Form 941, they must pay for the share of the cost of COBRA coverage not paid by eligible former employees when the premiums are due. If a firm's employment tax liability in a quarter is less than its COBRA payments during that period, then the firm must request a tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service for the excess. Extended delays in receiving reimbursement for COBRA payments could force some small firms that already are losing money to further scale back their operations to conserve cash.", "The JCT has estimated that the COBRA subsidy will result in a revenue loss of $24.8 billion from FY2009 through FY2013. Almost 58% of the loss is projected to occur in FY2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increase in the Income Threshold for and Extension of Use of Non-refundable Personal Tax Credits against the Alternative Minimum Tax: Sections 1011 and 1012 of the Act and IRC Section 55", "paragraphs": ["Current federal tax law requires individuals to compute their income tax liability under both the regular tax and the AMT and pay whichever is greater. An individual taxpayer pays the AMT if his or her tentative alternative minimum tax (TAMT) exceeds his or her regular tax. An individual's TAMT is generally equal to the sum of (1) 26% of the first $175,000 of the taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) above an exemption amount and (2) 28% of the remaining AMTI. As is true for the regular tax, long-term capital gains and dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% through 2010. The highest rate for the AMT (28%) is less than the highest rate for the regular tax (35%).", "A taxpayer's AMTI is his or her regular taxable income modified by certain adjustments and tax preferences. Several tax preferences under the regular tax are added to this income, including tax-exempt interest on certain private-activity bonds, excess depletion allowances, and the excess of accelerated depreciation over straight-line depreciation for certain assets placed in service before 1987. In addition, adjustments are made to some deductions allowed under the regular tax. These differences can be positive, increasing AMTI, or negative, decreasing AMTI. Notable adjustments include differences between the depreciation rates for certain assets under the AMT and regular tax; a denial of certain itemized deductions that are allowed under the regular tax; and the excess of the fair market value over the amount actually received on incentive stock options. The personal exemptions and standard deductions that enter into the determination of regular taxable income do not affect AMTI.", "An individual taxpayer's exemption amount depends on his or her filing status. In 2009, the amounts are $70,950 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $46,700 for unmarried single filers. Without a change in current tax law, the amounts are scheduled to revert in 2010 to the amounts that were in effect from 1993 to 2000: $45,000 for married joint filers and $33,750 for unmarried single filers. The AMT exemption is reduced by 25% of the amount by which a taxpayer's AMTI exceeds certain thresholds. For joint filers, the exemption begins to phase out when AMTI rises above $150,000; for single filers, the phaseout threshold is $112,500. This means that each additional dollar of AMTI above these thresholds lowers the exemption by $0.25.", "Once an individual's TAMT has been calculated, it can be reduced by a variety of personal and business credits. Some of these credits can be permanently used to lower AMT liability (e.g., the child tax credit, the savers credit, the foreign tax credit and the work opportunity tax credit). Others are temporary in that they may be used only if authorized by an act of Congress. ", "Individuals who pay the AMT in a tax year are allowed a credit that can be used only to offset the regular income tax the next time they pay it. The AMT credit may be carried forward indefinitely. It is intended to prevent the double taxation of income associated with tax preferences involving deferral: once under the AMT and a second time in another year under the regular tax.", "ARRA raised the AMT exemption for married couples filing jointly from $69,950 in 2008 to $70,950 in 2009, and for unmarried single filers from $46,200 in 2008 to $46,700 in 2009. Without this provision, the 2009 amounts would have fallen to $45,000 for joint filers and $33,750 for unmarried single filers.", "ARRA also extends through 2009 a rule that allows individual taxpayers to use non-refundable personal tax credits to the full extent of their regular tax and AMT liabilities through 2009. Without this provision, the amount of such credits (with three exceptions) that could be claimed would be limited to the excess of a taxpayer's regular tax liability over his or her TAMT determined without the AMT foreign tax credit. There is no limit on the amount of the child tax credit, the adoption credit, and the retirement savings contribution credit that can be used to offset a taxpayer's regular tax and AMT liabilities.", "In combination, the two AMT provisions of ARRA have the effect of reducing the overall burden of the AMT in a year when the economy is mired in a deep recession and giving little reason to believe a robust recovery is imminent. This reduction means that consumers as a whole have more disposable income that they otherwise would. Not adopting an AMT patch for 2009 might have subjected an additional 26 million individual taxpayers to the AMT, relative to the number of individuals who paid the AMT in 2008. In the absence of the patch, the taxable income of those taxpayers above the exemption amounts would be taxed at a higher marginal rate under the AMT (26%) than under the regular tax (15% or 25%). Allowing individuals to use the full amount of non-refundable personal credits against the regular tax and the AMT mainly benefits higher-income taxpayers.", "It is not known how many small business owners are likely to benefit from the two provisions, but it may be less than a majority. In 2007, according to an estimate by the Tax Policy Center jointly managed by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, 19% of individual taxpayers with small business income (or 6.2 million out of a total of 32 million) paid the AMT at a rate of 26%. Another 4% of those individuals paid the AMT at a rate of 28%, and the remaining 77% of individuals with small business income paid the regular tax at rates ranging from 10% (13% of taxpayers) to 35% (1% of taxpayers). A similar breakdown for a later tax year is not available."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
