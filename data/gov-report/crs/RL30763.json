The FCC generally covers consumers' privacy rights relative to telemarketing practices and the use of the telephone system by telemarketers to transmit information whether via facsimile machine, automated dialing mechanisms, recorded calls, or by a live person.

Such calls to business numbers are permitted. Any person or entity making a telephone solicitation to a private home must provide the name of the individual caller, the name of the person or entity on whose behalf the call is being made, and a telephone number or address where that person or entity may be contacted. Any person or business using autodialers or prerecorded (artificial) voice calls, including calls placed to businesses, must state its identity at the beginning of the message and its telephone number or address during or after the message. Autodialer calls may not lock onto a phone line. Within five seconds of a phone being hung up, the autodialer must release the phone line. In some areas of the country, due to different telephone system technologies, this release may take longer. Customers should check with their local telephone company for additional information. Calls transmitting unsolicited advertisements to home or business fax machines are prohibited unless permission has been granted to do so or there is an established business relationship.

States may adopt more restrictive laws relating to intrastate telemarketing, but may not establish practices less restrictive than the federal regulations. As with the FTC rules, consumers may continue to request that their names be added to individual company do-not-call lists if they so choose.
