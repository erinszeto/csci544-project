Prior toFY1992, Congress would appropriate the full value of direct loans issued by the U.S. government. For commercial loans guaranteed by the United States, Congress placed annual limitations on thetotal amount of these guarantees, but was not required to appropriate any funds. Under the terms of\"credit reform,\" Congress began in FY1992 to appropriate the subsidy value of both direct loansissued and loan guarantees backed by the government. In simple terms, the subsidy value, asdetermined by OMB, is an amount that represents the risk to the U.S. government in issuing orbacking the loan, plus the extent to which, if any, the loan carries a concessional interest rate belowmarket value. Accordingly, there are inherent problems with comparing trends before and afterFY1992 for any element of discretionary spending that includes credit programs.", "Several credit programs operate within Budget Function 150: direct loans under ForeignMilitary Financing (FMF) and (prior to FY1999) P.L. 480 food programs; loan guarantees issued byUSAID; and direct loans and loan guarantees managed by the Export-Import Bank and the OverseasPrivate Investment Corporation. Two examples illustrate the mixed impact on appropriationrequirements of the \"credit reform\" policy changes that took effect for FY1992. In FY1997,Congress enacted a $60 million subsidy appropriation for FMF direct loans , an amount that allowedthe Defense Department to issue military aid loans with a total face value of $540 million. Prior toFY1992, Congress would have had to appropriate the full $540 million instead of the $60 millionsubsidy that backed the loans. On the other hand, in the case of a loan guarantee , Congressapproved in FY1997 a $3.5 million subsidy appropriation permitting USAID's Urban andEnvironmental Credit program to guarantee $29.4 million in loans. These represent loans issued bycommercial lenders for which the United States government guarantees repayment. Before FY1992,no appropriation would have been required. Thus, Congress appropriated in FY1997 $63.5 millionin support of these two programs, whereas budget rules that existed prior to the 1992 credit reformwould have required an appropriation of $540 million to implement these same two activities.", "Because OMB has not adjusted its figures for pre-FY1992 credit programs, comparisonsbetween the two time periods cannot be totally precise. Nevertheless, an assessment of fundingtrends before and after FY1992 is still useful in identifying an illustrative pattern of spendingdecisions. While the application of post-credit reform procedures, on balance, probably tends tooverstate somewhat the degree of reductions in Function 150 spending during the mid-1990s, theextent of this overstatement does not appear to be sufficient to override the general conclusion thatcuts in the international affairs budget were substantial during that period. Comparison of theincreases in FY1999- FY2006 for Function 150 resources with pre-1992 levels face the samemethodological problems. For selected sub-categories of the international affairs budget, however,where no credit programs exist, such as for State Department and public diplomacy programs, thecredit reform changes have no effect on measuring and comparing discretionary spending."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "International Affairs Discretionary Budget Authority", "paragraphs": ["International Affairs discretionary budget authority, measured in real terms, has experiencedseveral cycles over the past three decades. There were periods of rapid growth followed immediatelyby sharp declines during the mid-1980s. After several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s ofrelative stable budget levels, amounts fell -- at first gradually, and then sharply -- through FY1997. The foreign policy budget rose slightly in FY1998 but significantly in FY1999 and FY2000compared to amounts during the mid-1990s. Growth in the Function 150 budget continuedfollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, reaching by FY2004 the highest level offoreign affairs spending in three decades. ", "The early-to-mid 1980s were marked by a steady increase in foreign policy spending, largelythe result of rising amounts of security aid allocated for strategic purposes in Central America,Pakistan, and \"military base rights countries\" such as the Philippines. At the same time that growthin security aid peaked in FY1985, Congress approved two major supplementals: a $2.25 billioneconomic aid package for Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, and about $1 billion in famine relief for Africa. All of these factors combined to set foreign affairs discretionary budget authority at $38.96 billion,in FY2006 dollars, a level about 5% higher than the FY2006 amount.", "Absent the unique combination of these international demands that spiked aid spending inFY1985, and with intensifying pressure in Washington to reduce the federal deficit, Function 150discretionary spending, like other federal spending, fell abruptly in FY1986, and declined further inthe next two years to a point more than 25% less than where the foreign policy budget had stood justthree years earlier. ", "The following period -- FY1988 through FY1993 -- marked a relatively stable level offoreign affairs budget authority, ranging in most years roughly between $28 and $29 billion annually,as calculated in FY2006 dollars. To a considerable extent, this steady period can be attributed toannually negotiated budget agreements between the Administration and Congress for majordiscretionary spending categories, one of which was international affairs. A small, temporaryupsurge occurred in FY1990/1991, primarily the result of a supplemental appropriation for aid toPanama and Nicaragua, additional costs associated with the Persian Gulf War, includingsupplemental assistance for Israel and Turkey, and added expenses for U.S. agencies operating inthe Gulf region.", "Although the foreign affairs budget had been on a long downward trend since FY1985, thedrop in FY1994 was the first significant annual decrease in real terms since FY1988. The 3.8% realcut for FY1994 was followed by two years of increasingly larger reductions for foreign policyprograms. FY1995 discretionary budget authority dropped 5.5% below FY1994, followed by an11.3% cut in FY1996. Reductions continued for FY1997, although at a more modest 1.3% level. ", "This downward cycle reversed in FY1998, with international affairs budget authority risingby 4% in real terms over FY1997, followed by a far more significant rise -- 21.4% -- in foreignpolicy spending for FY1999. In addition to approving modest increases for programs throughout theFunction 150 account, Congress further agreed to nearly $1 billion for U.S. arrearage payments tovarious international organizations and multilateral development banks, about $1.5 billion forsecurity upgrades at American embassies and missions around the world following the embassybombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and large supplementals for Central American victims ofHurricane Mitch ($1 billion) and for Kosovo humanitarian aid relief ($1.1 billion). A similarly largesupplemental in FY2000 supporting a $1.8 billion one-time aid package in support of the WyeRiver/Middle East peace accord and about $1 billion for a Colombian counternarcotics program, plusrising budgets for a number of regular and continuing foreign affairs programs in FY2001 keptforeign policy spending at around $27.4 billion during the FY1999-2001 period, one-quarter higherthan the low point of FY1997.", "The most defining change in U.S. foreign policy spending, however, came following theSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. Since 9/11 American foreign aid anddiplomatic efforts have taken on a more strategic sense of importance and have been cast frequentlyin terms of contributing to the global war on terrorism, including assistance to about 30 \"front-line\"states in the terrorism war -- countries that cooperate with the United States in the war on terrorismor face terrorist threats themselves. (2) Through a series of emergency supplemental appropriations, byFY2003 Congress had boosted the international affairs budget following the 9/11 attacks to $37.4billion, in real terms.", "At roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of U.S. foreignpolicy, the Bush Administration announced other significant initiatives that have added to a growingforeign affairs budget. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is a new aid delivery concept,authorized by Congress and established in early 2004, that is intended to concentrate significantlyhigher amounts of U.S. resources in a few low- and lower-middle income countries that havedemonstrated a strong commitment to political, economic, and social reforms. MCA funding hadbeen expected to grow to $5 billion annually by FY2006, although actual appropriations -- $1.77billion in FY2006 -- have been far more modest.", "Addressing global health problems has further become a core U.S. aid objective in recentyears. Congress created a separate appropriation account for Child Survival and Health activitiesin the mid-1990s and increased funding for international HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseaseprograms. President Bush's announcement at his 2003 State of the Union message of a five-year,$15 billion effort to combat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (Presidential Emergency Plan for AIDSRelief -- PEPFAR) has added greater emphasis to this primary foreign assistance objective andcontributed to higher international affairs spending.", "Resources committed to fighting terrorism and rebuilding Afghanistan and Iraq, plus thelaunch of the MCA and PEPFAR initiatives pushed U.S. foreign policy spending in FY2004 to $53.8billion, in real terms, the highest level in over three decades. Even excluding the $18.45 billion forIraq reconstruction from the total, FY2004 remains one of the largest international affairs budgetsduring this period. Without the significant Iraq reconstruction appropriation of FY2004, the FY2005foreign affairs budget dropped back to $36.8 billion, although it represented an 11% increase forinternational activities other than Iraq. Another large emergency supplemental for FY2005 dealingwith other foreign crises -- tsunami disaster relief, a Palestinian aid package, conflict in the Darfurregion of Sudan, and accelerated Afghan reconstruction efforts -- pushed Budget Function 150 toits highest level (excluding Iraq) since FY1985.", "As overall budget pressures increased in the 109th Congress and the unanticipated emergencyto address the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, for the first time during the BushAdministration, Congress reduced -- by $2.1 billion or 6.4% -- the President's regular foreign policyrequest. Subsequently, however, Congress approved emergency supplemental spending of $4.25billion for Iraq, Afghanistan, and various humanitarian crises around the world.

Although the amount of spending for international activities has grownsignificantly since September 11, compared to changes in the overall size of thefederal budget, the share allocated for foreign policy programs has declined (with theexception of FY2004 and the $18.45 billion supplemental for Iraq). The estimatedlevel for FY2006 is 3.41%, the lowest level for any year in the last three decades andabout one-eighth less than the 3.96% annual average since FY1977. If, however, the\"surge\" in spending for Iraq in FY2004 is folded into the entire post-9/11 period, theannual average of the past four years equals the historic 3.96% average for theinternational affairs account.", "This recent trend, which is somewhat counter-intuitive, results from evenlarger increases in U.S. government spending in non-international sectors, especiallyfor defense, homeland security, and domestic disaster relief. Defense spending,which accounted for roughly half the discretionary budget authority prior to 9/11,grew to more than 54% by FY2004. What the United States now defines as\"homeland security\" spending, a category that did not exist prior to 9/11, has risenby about one-third. A series of emergency supplementals -- totaling about $82.1billion -- for relief of Hurricane Katrina victims pushed shares for other budgetactivities, including Function 150, down for FY2005 and FY2006.", "For the period prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, the patterns inFigures 1 and 2 for foreign policy spending are similar, although the degree of sharpgrowth and decline are muted somewhat when measuring discretionary BA as a %of total budget authority. One of the most notable trends is the substantial continuityin the amount of the budget authority devoted to international affairs during an eightyear period, FY1988 to FY1995. Although dollar amounts for foreign affairs mayhave risen somewhat in FY1991 due to the Gulf War, and fallen through the nextfour years, Function 150's proportion of total discretionary budget authority deviatedonly slightly from a sustained level of 4% annually. In short, even though the foreignpolicy budget fell steadily in the early- to mid-1990s, it declined at roughly the samepace as the total for all other programs funded through discretionary spending. Butin FY1996, this 4% share that had been sustained for eight years ended, and Function150's proportion fell to 3.63%. In FY1997 and FY1998 it fell further to about 3.6%of discretionary BA.
