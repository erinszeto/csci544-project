Even in subsidized markets, broadband infrastructure buildout ultimately rests on business decisions made in the private sector. On average, rural areas are less wealthy than urbanized areas, and have older populations with lower educational attainment\u00e2\u0080\u0094factors which negatively correlate with demand for broadband service. Related barriers to adoption, such as lower perceived value, affordability, computer ownership, and computer literacy, have persisted over many years.", "Markets tend to be highly localized. Those with favorable geography and demographic profiles often have higher demand, and thus present relatively attractive investment opportunities, for broadband providers. However, the federal government has found it difficult to incentivize sustained private-sector investment in more isolated and sparsely populated locales where it is clear that new or upgraded service will be costly to provide, and may fail to attract a large number of new paying subscribers.", "Overall, current federal spending on affordability and adoption programs amounts to less than one-quarter of total spending for rural broadband expansion. The FCC's Lifeline program reduces monthly subscription costs for qualifying low-income households, but enrollment rates are comparatively low. No major federal programs currently support consumer outreach and education, although certain federal grants may use funds for related activities. Other programs to support broadband buildout to schools, clinics, and other community institutions have improved access for residents of rural areas, but it is not clear that these programs have affected overall market demand.", "Broadband advocates frequently identify broadband enabled services like telemedicine and precision agriculture as potential demand drivers. However, lower rates of health insurance coverage in rural areas and certain state regulations limiting Medicaid reimbursement for telemedicine services may depress demand growth and private sector investment in broadband. Likewise, high up-front costs and unfamiliarity have hindered adoption of precision agriculture technology by small producers in isolated rural areas.", "Federal broadband programs have generally been agnostic to the demand side of rural broadband markets, based on the implicit assumption that demand for broadband service will quickly emerge as broadband providers extend new or upgraded service to these locales. Program rules typically require broadband providers to extend service availability to a certain area within a certain timeframe, but they generally do not require them to achieve specific market development goals for adoption and usage. The FCC has expressed concern that some subsidized providers may lack incentive to develop markets in their service areas.", "Options for congressional consideration include measures to address obstacles to adoption and additional incentives for private sector investment in the rural broadband sector. These may include expansion of end-user subsidies, both within the broadband sector and other sectors that utilize broadband-enabled technologies. Congress may also consider measures to encourage broadband providers to increase investment in persistently underserved rural areas and more aggressively develop nascent broadband markets.

Lower demand in rural areas may discourage private-sector investment and reduce the effectiveness of federal efforts to expand and improve broadband service.", "According to the authors of a 2015 study on rural broadband expansion, \"While the vast majority of federal programs dealing with broadband have focused on the provision of infrastructure, many economists and others involved in the debate have argued that the emphasis should instead be on increasing demand in the areas that are lagging behind.\" The study found that rural households' broadband adoption rate lagged that of urban households by 12-13 percentage points and that while 38% of the rural-urban \"broadband gap\" in 2011 was attributable to lack of necessary infrastructure, 52% was attributable to lower adoption rates.

As a result, fixed broadband network infrastructure, which largely relies on wireline connections to the physical addresses of subscribers, is geographically concentrated.

Broadband providers may not be willing to serve these areas without support from direct government subsidies, grants, or loans. Local conditions in rural areas vary widely, though. Some rural markets may be relatively attractive on commercial terms, because of unique characteristics such as the presence of post-secondary educational institutions or tourism attractions, relatively high levels of economic development and educational attainment, favorable demographics, or proximity to urban areas. Other rural markets that lack these characteristics are likely to be less commercially attractive. ", "Long-term demographic trends suggest a growing bifurcation of the rural broadband market. According to a 2018 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) analysis, rural areas have witnessed \"declining unemployment, rising incomes, and declining poverty,\" as well as more favorable net migration rates since 2013. However, the analysis also found that \"people moving to rural areas tend to persistently favor more densely settled rural areas with attractive scenic qualities, or those near large cities. Fewer are moving to sparsely settled, less scenic, and more remote locations, which compounds economic development challenges in those areas.\" ", "For reasons that will be explained in more detail below, household and small business demand for broadband service is likely to be impacted in rural areas by demographic trends, geography, and economic context. As a result, these factors affect the infrastructure investment behavior of broadband providers, raising policy questions about the appropriate level of federal assistance and how it can be distributed most effectively and efficiently.", "The next three sections of this report discuss the adoption of broadband service by rural households and rural small businesses and the implications of market demand for private-sector investment in rural broadband infrastructure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Valuation of Broadband Service by Rural Households", "paragraphs": ["Adoption rates for broadband service are highly dependent on the valuation that households and small businesses place on internet access.

Because rural households tend to be older, less educated, and less wealthy than their urban counterparts, their willingness to pay for broadband also tends to be lower.", "Not all households are the same, of course. A substantial number of low-income households do not subscribe to broadband service even when it is offered to them at no cost, indicating a valuation of zero. At the same time, many reports indicate that some rural residents are willing go to extensive lengths to access the internet for tasks they view as essential, even if broadband service is not available at their home or business. The relatively lower proportion of potential subscribers in rural areas who are both highly motivated to adopt broadband and are able to pay for it complicates the business case. ", "A 2010 study, based on a report commissioned by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), found that survey respondents were, on average, willing to pay an extra $45 per month for \"fast\" speeds adequate for music, photo sharing, and videos. However, on average, respondents were only willing to pay an extra $48\u00e2\u0080\u0094a difference of $3\u00e2\u0080\u0094for \"very fast\" speeds adequate for gaming, large file transfers, and high-definition movies. Households that already had relatively high speed broadband were generally willing to pay more than average for very fast service. ", "While consumer expectations have certainly evolved over the past decade, the 2010 study's findings are broadly consistent with those of subsequent studies: most consumers, regardless of where they reside, value basic internet access at speeds adequate for everyday use, but only a relative few are willing to pay substantially more for very high speeds. Members of the latter group generally have higher levels of broadband connectivity than others, and belong to relatively wealthier, better-educated demographic groups. ", "The FCC sponsored a series of field experiments, beginning in 2012, to gain better understanding of broadband demand among low-income households. The goal of these experiments was to inform administration of the federal Lifeline program, which subsidizes voice and broadband service charges for qualifying low-income consumers. ", "A 2015 report on a field experiment conducted in West Virginia and eastern Ohio found that Lifeline-eligible non-subscribers in that region were overwhelmingly willing to pay $3 more per month to move from bottom-tier speeds (1 megabits-per-second (Mbps), offered at $31.99 per month) to moderate broadband speeds (6 Mbps, offered at $34.99 per month). However, only one out of 118 participants was willing to pay $44.99 per month\u00e2\u0080\u0094an extra $10\u00e2\u0080\u0094to double their maximum download speed from 6 to 12 Mbps. ", "The Lifeline program itself has long been undersubscribed, despite the fact that it frequently reduces consumer out-of-pocket costs to zero (see text box above, \"Why Is the Lifeline Program Undersubscribed?\"). ", "A 2014 study, based on a survey funded by the Department of Commerce of 15,000 non-adopting households at all income levels, found that approximately two-thirds of respondents would not consider adopting broadband at any price, and that non-adopters were disproportionately rural (36% of non-adopters lived in rural areas, as compared to 19.3% of all Americans). The remaining one-third of respondents voiced interest in broadband adoption. Rural respondents were more likely to belong to this group than their urban counterparts, despite making up a disproportionately large share of non-adopters overall. These respondents most commonly identified price and availability as the main barriers to adoption. The study authors estimated that achieving a 10% increase in subscribership among members of the group who reported price as a factor in their decision would require an average price decrease of 15%. ", "A 2012 study of broadband usage among Kentucky farmers broadly tracks with other studies that show a higher propensity for broadband adoption among younger, better educated, higher earning, business-oriented households with experience using the internet, regardless of location. The study found that a representative 45-year-old producer earning more than $50,000 on a 750 acre farm, who had experience using the internet but did not have broadband access, was willing to pay $171.42 as a hypothetical one-time property tax payment to support buildout of the necessary local infrastructure to provide broadband access to area farms. On the other end of the spectrum, a representative 63-year-old producer with a 250 acre farm earning less than $50,000, who had not subscribed to broadband service even when it was available, was willing to pay a one-time payment of just 20 cents to support broadband infrastructure improvements. The average age of survey respondents was 59.2 years. ", "The Kentucky Department of Agriculture reported in 2019 that the demographic profile of Kentucky farmers is shifting, including a larger number of younger producers. This demographic shift may lead to increased demand for broadband service expansion and improvements in the rural areas of Kentucky where it is most pronounced.

The small business broadband adoption rate has increased to 90% as of the date of this survey (April 2010), compared to 74% of adults with broadband access in their homes.... \" Surveys conducted for the SBA study showed that both rural and urban respondents viewed high-speed internet \"as an essential service\" that enabled them to \"achieve strategic goals, improve competitiveness and efficiency, reach customers, and interact with vendors.\" However, the study found that non-agricultural rural businesses were significantly less likely to have their own website than their urban counterparts were. Likewise, they were less likely to be willing to pay substantially more for improved service, even though the study found that they rated the quality of service in rural areas lower than respondents in urban areas did. Most rural businesses surveyed indicated that they were not willing to pay 10% more for significantly improved service.", "Studies that are more recent have made similar findings. Although basic access to the internet in rural areas is much more widespread than it was a decade ago, usage practices of many small businesses do not appear to have changed significantly. Most appear to value basic internet access to support a few essential low-bandwidth functions, such as making the name and location of the business available on internet searches, but proportionately fewer appear to demand high-bandwidth advanced business applications. ", "For example, a 2017 study comparing selected rural and urban areas of North Carolina found that many small rural businesses have no web presence beyond a listing in Google search results, and that more than half of those businesses that did have a web page used it solely to provide basic information about the business. \"Overall, small rural businesses are not using internet-based technology to support their businesses. While they may have broadband access, their use of websites, e-commerce and social media is limited, and it is significantly lower than small urban businesses,\" the study authors wrote. Apparently, small businesses find internet access useful, but many do not use applications requiring high bandwidth.", "It is not clear from these results what immediate benefits would be provided to non-intensive business users in remote rural areas by improvements in broadband service speed and quality. However, broadband advocacy groups have suggested that emerging new applications and encouraging small businesses to adopt more sophisticated web development strategies may increase demand for improved service over time.", "Other studies indicate that the type and location of business activity may have a significant influence on demand for higher-speed broadband. The businesses covered in the North Carolina study were, by and large, small retail establishments in isolated rural areas. Businesses in \"intermediate\" exurban locales that work in healthcare or knowledge-intensive sectors are more likely to use high-bandwidth applications, according to one study. For example, a survey of local businesses by the Central Coast Broadband Consortium, a nonprofit representing independent broadband providers serving the greater Monterey Bay area, found that business respondents had significant data and file transfer needs. The area surveyed includes many sparsely populated rural areas with difficult terrain, but it is also home to significant tourist destinations, large agriculture enterprises, and a University of California campus, and its northern boundary extends to the exurbs of San Jose, one of the most highly developed technology hubs in the nation.

Broadband providers may view investment in rural markets with little history of internet usage as a high-risk endeavor. Subsidies may lower financial risk to broadband providers, but do not change their basic preference for low-risk, high-return projects, which guides private sector investment in expansion of broadband service.", "In a 2019 report, Merit Network, Inc., a nonprofit corporation owned and governed by Michigan's public universities, highlighted the business challenges faced by broadband providers in nascent rural broadband markets. According to the report, \"Despite the significant qualitative benefits that a broadband project may bring, depending on the method of financing, it is critical to accurately estimate adoption rates and build a solid financial model to ensure that adequate revenue will be achieved to repay any loan obligations, maintain ongoing operations and fund depreciation of capital equipment.\"", "\"Even if rural areas are profitable for telecommunications companies, urban areas offer still higher returns on investment. This makes rural areas less attractive markets and perpetuates the urban focus of market decisions,\" according to the authors of one academic study. \"The market for telecommunications shows that a free-market rationale can ensure an efficient use of limited resources, i.e. using the resources for profitable markets in high-density areas, but it cannot ensure an equal delivery of services in all areas, leaving the rural underserved.\"", "A 2019 report from the Arkansas governor's office stated that low broadband adoption rates \"have consistently been a primary barrier to investment by the provider community.\" Noting that age affects adoption rates, the report concluded that \"increased adoption within [the older] demographic has the potential to strengthen the business case for broadband deployment.\" The Arkansas report also highlighted low statewide enrollment in the Lifeline program as a barrier to investment. The FCC estimates that the Lifeline enrollment rate was 18% for Arkansas in 2018. The Arkansas report found that \"raising adoption rates [of the Lifeline program] could also strengthen the business case for private companies to invest in broadband infrastructure, resulting in better internet access for both poor and non-poor Arkansans.... \"", "Studies elsewhere have found a similar relationship between demand and investment. For example, in a 2015 report on its broadband expansion projects, the Appalachian Regional Commission, which serves 13 Appalachian states, found that \"broadband internet service providers [are] less likely to provide services in sparsely populated areas because it initially has a lower return on investment and is less cost-effective.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Programs and Policies", "paragraphs": ["Federal programs and policies play a significant role in the development of rural broadband markets, given their often-challenging economics.

As part of this assessment, and to help determine whether broadband is being deployed in \"a reasonable and timely fashion,\" the FCC has established minimum data speeds that qualify as broadband service for the purposes of the Section 706 determination. In 2015, citing changing broadband usage patterns and multiple devices using broadband within single households, the FCC raised its minimum fixed broadband benchmark speed from 4 megabits-per-second (Mbps) (download)/1 Mbps (upload) to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps.", "The 25/3 Mbps threshold is meaningful in both technical and policy terms, because the legacy copper-based connections utilized by some broadband providers would likely require significant upgrades in order to meet higher thresholds.

Stakeholders in both the public and private sectors have frequently raised the issue of market demand for improved service when justifying their positions on the FCC's annual Section 706 determinations. ", "During the Obama Administration, FCC leadership justified increases in service speed thresholds as necessary to ensure that broadband infrastructure kept pace with changes in consumer behavior and the increasing number of bandwidth-hungry electronic devices and applications. \"Application and service providers, consumers, and the broadband providers are all pointing to 25/3 as the new standard,\" wrote then-Chairman Tom Wheeler when commenting on the agency's 2015 progress report. \"Content providers are increasingly offering high-quality video online, which uses a lot of bandwidth and could use a lot more as 4K video emerges.\"", "Opponents argued that demand does not justify investments in faster service that requires costly fiber-optic installations. Two FCC commissioners then serving released dissenting statements, citing tepid demand for faster broadband service as a reason to refrain from mandating higher speeds.

In public comments submitted for the 2019 FCC progress report, some large broadband providers and associated trade and public policy groups expressed concerns that any increase of speed requirements beyond the existing 25/3 Mbps standard would impose unnecessary burdens on providers based on predicted cost and market demand. \"The Commission should not change benchmarks based on aspirations that do not reflect widespread consumer demand and that are not grounded in the text of Section 706,\" wrote the Free State Foundation. \"Instead, Section 706 implies a realistic analysis that takes stock of actual market data regarding deployment of infrastructure and the availability of advanced capabilities that a substantial majority or at least an early majority of consumers subscribe to.\"", "By contrast, rural co-ops and other independent broadband providers have tended to argue (directly or through trade associations) for a higher speed benchmark, which would lead to federal subsidization of higher-speed service.

[Congress] should recognize that in today's 21 st century economy, broadband systems built to 10/1 or slower speeds cannot support a modern household much less attract and retain new businesses.\" ", "Trade organizations with memberships that include a cross-section of companies by size, corporate structure, and technology type have generally avoided discussing speed benchmarks in their submitted comments, focusing instead on other issues, such as substitutability of mobile broadband for fixed broadband. ", "FCC data released as part of the 2019 progress report indicated that 25.3% of households in the nation's least rural counties where service was available had adopted 100/10 Mbps broadband\u00e2\u0080\u0094more than double the 9.9% adoption rate in the nation's most rural counties (see Figure 2 ). The same data indicated higher overall adoption of the current standard of 25/3 Mbps, with a 57.7% adoption in the least rural counties and 23.1% in the most rural.", "Some recent state and regional reports have questioned whether market demand justifies government-subsidized investment in higher speed broadband in all cases. \"There is an ongoing, multifaceted debate about whether, where, and when the performance advantages of fiber justify the investment in upgrading communications networks,\" according to the Arkansas Development Finance Authority. \"Most uses of the internet today do not require the capacity and speed that fiber internet offers, and internet service providers who deploy fiber don't necessarily experience strong demand for the upgraded service.\" According to an April 2019 report from the Southeastern Indiana Regional Planning Commission, \"Some providers argue that even when broadband is available, customers do not subscribe as expected.\" The authors argued for energetic measures to promote broadband affordability and adoption as a remedy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Programs' Consideration of Market Demand When Awarding Funds for Broadband Infrastructure Buildout", "paragraphs": ["The primary purpose of the RUS and USF High Cost programs is to support expansion of broadband availability in unserved or underserved areas, rather than to promote broadband adoption. Funding under these programs has typically been awarded based on ISP commitments to making a certain level of service available to a certain number of eligible households and businesses within a certain period of time. However, there are some important differences. ", "The RUS programs include loans, which recipients must repay. Applicants for funding under the Rural Broadband Access Loan program are required to complete and submit a financial forecast to demonstrate that they can repay the loan, and that the proposed project \"is financially feasible and sustainable.\" The forecast must include\u00e2\u0080\u0094with few exceptions\u00e2\u0080\u0094a market survey that describes service packages and rates, and provides the number of existing and proposed subscribers. This requirement may incentivize recipients to encourage adoption in their service areas in order to increase revenues that they can then use for loan repayment. At the same time, it may also deter providers from accepting loans to serve areas where the business case for deployment is particularly difficult. ", "Perhaps because of disincentives for investment in unattractive markets, RUS selection criteria and loan terms prioritize buildout to unserved or underserved areas over subscription rates or other business performance metrics. According to the application guide, \"Priority must be given to applicants that propose to offer broadband service to the greatest proportion of households that, prior to the provision of the broadband service, had no incumbent service provider.\" Program administrators prioritize projects according to four tiers, which range from 25% to 100% of households unserved. The standard loan term is 3 years, but applicants can request up to a 35-year repayment term and a principal deferral period of up to 4 years if at least 50% of the households in the proposed service area are unserved.", "The RUS ReConnect program has similar goals, but also includes grants and loan-grant combinations. Applicants can likewise request more generous loan terms if they plan to serve a Substantially Underserved Trust Area (typically tribal lands), and their application may be granted priority status. Reviewers score applications against evaluation criteria using a points-based system. They award points for population density (less dense areas receiving preference), number of farms served, number of businesses served, number of educational facilities served, performance of the offered services, and other criteria. Neither projected business performance metrics nor adoption rates are included in the evaluation criteria. ", "Under the High Cost program, federal subsidies are premised on the absence of a business case for broadband expansion. In announcing the latest proposed round of support, known as the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), the FCC stated that it would prioritize buildout in areas where \"there is currently no private sector business case to deploy broadband without assistance.\" USF programs only require that participating broadband providers advertise the availability of broadband service within their service areas, and that the broadband provider be able to provide service at rates \"reasonably comparable to rates offered in urban areas\" to any area household within 10 business days if requested to do so. Census blocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094the administrative-territorial unit used by the FCC to measure broadband coverage\u00e2\u0080\u0094are considered served if a local broadband provider meets these conditions. As with the RUS programs, the High Cost program has prioritized buildout and higher broadband performance over adoption. Phase I of the proposed RDOF program would prioritize support to broadband providers that serve \"completely unserved areas\" at higher data speeds, higher usage allowances, and lower latency, but sets no specific adoption benchmarks.", "The FCC expressed concerns in its RDOF proposal that recipients of support might lack any incentive to aggressively market their services or otherwise stimulate demand beyond relatively low-cost high-return areas, and might even take measures to limit subscription in order to protect profits. ", "Since [RDOF] support may require certain providers to offer much higher data caps than they do to [non-RDOF] subscribers and price the services similarly, such providers may have an incentive to limit [RDOF] subscribers to sell their capacity to more profitable [non-RDOF] subscribers. Spectrum-based providers that do not have a network sufficient to serve most locations in a geographic area would also have an incentive to limit subscription if expanding capacity would be less profitable than limiting subscription and collecting [RDOF] subsidies based purely on deployment. Even wireline bidders may lack the proper incentives to serve additional customers in some areas, given that it may not be profitable without a per-subscriber payment to run wires from the street to the customer location and install customer premises equipment. ", "Having expressed these concerns, the FCC put forward a proposal to introduce subscribership milestones for RDOF recipients. It requested comment on several different implementation options. One proposal would offer a baseline level of support to broadband providers and then add per-subscriber payments. Another would withhold a certain percentage of support if broadband providers failed to meet subscription milestones, although it raised the question of what milestones were appropriate given \"the unique challenges of serving rural areas.\" Eliciting private sector participation in rural broadband programs appears to be a concern for the FCC, just as it is for USDA. In its last round of USF funding support, FCC increased the term of support to broadband providers from 5 years to 10 years in order to gain \"robust participation\" in the program.

The program subsidizes enrollees to cover the recurring monthly service charges associated with broadband subscribership. Support is not given directly to the subscriber but to the subscriber-selected service provider. Although stimulating broadband demand is not an explicit purpose of the Lifeline program, expansion of Lifeline enrollment may improve the business case for broadband deployment in rural areas, which on average have a disproportionately high number of low-income residents. ", "In many cases, facilities-based telecommunications providers sell excess capacity in areas they already serve to resellers, who then rebrand the service and market low-cost plans to eligible Lifeline beneficiaries. In 2017, the FCC proposed changes to the Lifeline program that would bar resellers from participation. Some in Congress claimed that these changes would reduce enrollment by 70% from current levels.
