Hurricane Harvey was the first major hurricane to strike the continental U.S. coast since 2005, achieving category 4 strength before making landfall along the Texas coast on August 25, 2017. According to the NHC, Harvey \"was the most significant tropical cyclone rainfall event in United States history, both in scope and peak rainfall amounts, since reliable records began around the 1880s.\" Hurricane Irma was the second major hurricane to strike the continental U.S. coast in 2017, making landfall in the Florida Keys on September 10. Irma's large wind field produced significant storm-surge flooding along the northeastern coast of Florida, even though the storm made landfall in southwestern Florida. Puerto Rico was still recovering from damage caused by Hurricane Irma when Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20. Maria was the deadliest storm of 2017 and is widely regarded as the worst natural disaster on record to strike Puerto Rico.", "For the 2018 hurricane season, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), within the NWS, predicted 10-16 named storms, 5-9 hurricanes, and 1-4 major hurricanes in its May 24, 2018 announcement.

Most Atlantic hurricanes, for example, begin to form just west of the African continent over the ocean. NOAA weather satellites primarily provide the remote-sensing observations during the early stages of tropical storm development in the eastern Atlantic. NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) are stationed over the same location spanning North America (two satellites make up the active GOES constellation, often referred to as GOES East and GOES West) and provide continuous data as the storms form and intensify during their journey across the Atlantic from Africa to North America."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approaching the Coast", "paragraphs": ["If an Atlantic hurricane is judged to pose a threat to the U.S. coastline, NOAA hurricane aircraft and U.S. Air Force aircraft (often referred to as Hurricane Hunters ) fly directly into the storm and above the storm to collect real-time data.

Data collected from the Hurricane Hunters and other aircraft (e.g., the NASA Global Hawk) are checked at CARCAH and provided to NHC forecasters. If the storm gets closer, approximately 280 miles from the coast, land-based radars begin to provide the NHC with precipitation and wind-velocity data.

Essentially, the model uses the observational data to understand the state of the atmosphere and then uses mathematical equations to produce forecasts. ", "Not all hurricane forecast models are the same; they may differ in how they process information, such as when observations are fed into the model, which equations are used, how the solutions to the equations are used to make forecasts, and other factors. These differences explain why NHC hurricane forecasts may differ from those of other countries or institutions that also produce hurricane forecasts (e.g., the European Center for Medium-Range Forecasts produces Atlantic hurricane forecasts, as do some research institutions within the United States, such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research). "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hurricane Track and Intensity Forecasts: Improvements and Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Hurricane forecasts generally are divided into two categories: hurricane track (the path of the hurricane) and hurricane intensity (the sustained wind speed). The ability to forecast hurricane tracks has improved steadily since the 1960s ( Figure 1 ), increasing the likelihood of more accurately predicting landfall location. Figure 1 shows that the track errors in the current decade are less than half of what they were in the 1990s. Also, through the 1990s, the forecasts extended out for only three days; today, forecasts typically extend out for five days. That increased accuracy and extended timeframe provides useful information to local, state, and federal emergency managers faced with decisions about evacuating coastlines and the need to stage emergency equipment and supplies.

Intensity forecast errors from 2010 to 2017, the black line in Figure 2 , are about 15 knots (17 miles per hour), between 72 and 120 hours (3-5 days). That is the largest incremental improvement since the 1970s; however, that margin of error corresponds roughly to a difference of one hurricane category on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.

Of these, the HSU produces the final, official public forecast products, issued every six hours after a storm forms and more frequently if a hurricane watch or a hurricane warning is issued. The HSU also provides briefings on tropical storms to emergency managers and to the public, and it cooperates with meteorological services in other countries (e.g., Mexico, as well as Central American and Caribbean countries). The TAFB supports the HSU by providing tropical cyclone position and intensity estimates, conducting media interviews, and assisting in tropical cyclone operations.", "The HLT is sponsored through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and is comprised of federal, state, and local emergency managers, FEMA personnel, and NWS forecasters and hydrologists. On or before the beginning of hurricane season, the NHC director requests that FEMA activate the HLT, which remains active throughout hurricane season. If a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic or eastern Pacific basin threatens the United States or its territories, then the NHC can request that NWS meteorologists or hydrologists be assigned to the HLT until the storm threat has passed.

Storm surge, combined with high precipitation from a hurricane, can create dangerous flood conditions for coastal communities during tropical cyclones and other intense storms. (Superstorm Sandy, for example, produced a storm surge that inundated the heavily populated coastline in New Jersey and New York to cause enormous damage, despite the storm itself being a relatively weak hurricane immediately prior to landfall.) The combination of a storm surge and high tide produces what is referred to as a storm tide ( Figure 3 ).

The cyclone was trending to the northwest as it made landfall but stopped its northwestern motion and made a slow loop from August 26 into August 27, then drifted southeastward for a few days before moving offshore again. However, the front did not move far between August 27 and August 28, allowing warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico to feed the storm, resulting in heavy rainfall over land even though the storm had diminished to tropical storm status.

The NHC indicated that the dichotomy in intensity forecast errors likely was due to the cyclone weakening faster than expected over land between the 36- and 48-hour forecast intervals. In contrast, the NHC noted that it correctly forecast that Harvey would stay a weak cyclone at the long-range forecasts.

Irma's large wind field produced significant storm-surge flooding along the northeastern coast of Florida, even though the storm made landfall in southwestern Florida. The significant flooding along the banks of the St. Johns River near Jacksonville, FL, for example, resulted from the combination of storm-surge and rainfall runoff into the river, along with easterly winds ahead of Irma pushing seawater upstream, causing the water to rise initially.

Section 413, Title IV, requires NOAA to acquire backup capabilities for Hurricane Hunter aircraft to prevent a single point of failure for that part of the hurricane observing system. ", "At a July 18, 2018, hearing of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, witnesses focused on recovery activities from the 2017 hurricane season and preparedness for the 2018 season. It is likely that Congress will maintain its interest in federal hurricane forecast abilities every year given the annual threat hurricanes pose to populated coastal regions of the United States."], "subsections": []}]}}
