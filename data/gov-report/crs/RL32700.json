As in the debate on the withdrawal resolution introduced in 2000 (see section of PastActivity on next page), the salient arguments in favor of the resolution as put forward by itssupporters in the debate are likely to be: the encroachment on U.S. sovereignty by virtue of U.S.membership in the WTO and submission to the obligations under the WTO Agreement; usurpationof Congress' constitutional power \"to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations\"; violation of the U.S.Constitution by implementing the WTO Agreement as a Congressional-Executive agreement ratherthan a treaty; and, more tangibly, the perceived, for the United States adverse, results of the WTOdispute settlement mechanism (16) in cases where the United States is either the complainant or thedefendant.", "Again, as in 2000, the opposition to the resolution is likely to argue that the WTO hascontributed greatly to the expansion, regulation and transparency of international trade -- includingthat of the United States -- and that some deficiencies of the WTO regime as seen by the supportersof the resolution are nonexistent and their adverse effects exaggerated and merely in need of reformrather than being a sufficient reason for United States' withdrawal from the WTO.", "In the event that the withdrawal resolution is adopted and actually implemented by the UnitedStates' withdrawal from the WTO, such withdrawal would, on the most general level, exclude theUnited States from participation in an international multilateral system of trade rules and practices,which initially (in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1947) was formulated andpromoted principally by the United States itself. Since then, it has been greatly expanded in the formof the WTO Agreement, likewise with the United States' participation and under its leadership, intoa world-wide, comprehensive code of rules covering most aspects of international trade. This codehas radically reduced tariff and nontariff obstacles to free flows of world commerce in goods andservices and provided a forum for settling international trade disputes. U.S. withdrawal from theWTO also would likely erode the U.S. leadership position in international trade relations andthereby possibly put a strain on the cohesiveness of the organization.", "On a more specific, functional level, the withdrawal would relieve the United States from theobligations stemming specifically from the WTO agreement, but also preclude it from benefittingfrom its rights under the agreement, particularly, from access to WTO dispute settlement mechanism.Except for that access, however, this exclusion from the WTO regime would in practice be likelyto result in very limited selective changes in the United States' position in international trade, at leastin the short run. ", "On the U.S. side, most obligations under the WTO Agreement have been enacted by theURAA as general U.S. domestic law and would not be automatically repealed by the withdrawalresolution. To that extent, they would continue to apply not only to WTO members but to U.S.trading partners in general. Some provisions of the WTO Agreement have been substantively ineffect on the basis of earlier, also generally applicable legislation; others have been amended ornewly enacted by the URAA, again as generally applicable domestic legislation. Such applicabilitywould not cease due to the U.S. withdrawal from the WTO.", "Similarly, those U.S. present rights under the WTO (i.e., obligations of other WTO memberstoward the United States) which are reflected in those countries' generally applicable statutes orregulations would not cease to apply to the United States. In either case, appropriate action (in theUnited States, by new legislation) would need to be taken to nullify their reciprocal applicability. ", "If the United States withdraws from the WTO, its trade relationships with a number ofcountries could continue to be regulated by earlier bilateral compacts with them, substantially lesscomprehensive than the WTO, which are still in force but currently suspended while both parties aremembers of the WTO, and by later agreements not related to the WTO (e.g., free-trade agreements).", "Within these parameters, the United States, but also all other WTO members, would be freeof any restraint that is now mandated by WTO rules, if they wished to take any adverse action againsteach other. By acting in such manner, however, they would be open to unrestrained retaliation andcounter-retaliation without recourse to the established WTO mediatory or conciliatory procedure.In this context, U.S. withdrawal from the WTO would result in a major disadvantage for the UnitedStates: the loss of access to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, with the concomitant loss of potential WTO approval of a WTO-legal retaliatory action on the part of the United States in theevent that the challenged U.S. measure could have been found not to be in violation of WTO rules.
