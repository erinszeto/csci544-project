In the autumn of 2008, Pakistan was in urgent need of an estimated $4 billion in capital to avoid defaulting on its sovereign debt. The elected government of President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani sought short-term financial assistance from a number of sources, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), China, and an informal group of nations (including the United States) known as the \"Friends of Pakistan.\"", "The Pakistani government reached an agreement with the IMF for $7.6 billion in loans, but their capital crisis continues. In February 2009, Pakistan requested an additional $4.5 billion in assistance from the IMF and Prime Minister Gillani traveled to Beijing seeking financial support. According to a recent study by the Atlantic Council, Pakistan needs $4 billion - $5 billion in the next 6 to 12 months to avoid another possible default.", "Pakistan's continuing capital crisis is affecting the nation's overall economic performance and raising concerns about its political stability. During her Asia trip in February 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made several references to the importance of solving Pakistan's economic problems in the continued campaign to combat Islamic militants in the region. The Atlantic Council has called for an increase in U.S. assistance \"to avert an economic meltdown.\" The severity of Pakistan's economic situation has also been raised by several members of Congress.", "Several different research groups have recently issued reports on the situation in Pakistan that contain recommendations on what the United States could do to help alleviate Pakistan's economic problems. There are indications that Congress may consider some of these recommended actions, including an increase in U.S. non-military assistance and the creation of \"reconstruction opportunity zones\" in Pakistan.", "This report will be updated as circumstances warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["A stable, democratic, prosperous Pakistan is considered vital to U.S. interests.

Progress on these issues was severely threatened in 2008 by a sharp decline in Pakistan's economic stability, culminating in an immediate need for capital assistance. U.S. officials and independent analysts are increasingly concerned that a failing Pakistani economy could undermine multilateral efforts to stabilize South Asia and curtail the incidence of Islamist radicalism.", "Since his ascension to the presidency in September 2008, President Asif Ali Zardari has attempted to address Pakistan's economic problems, with the support of his chief economic advisor, Shaukat Tarin. On September 19, 2008, acting finance minister Naveed Qamar released new economic policies designed to bring about macroeconomic stability and avoid seeking IMF assistance that included the elimination of fuel, electricity and food subsidies, and a reduction in the government deficit. On November 3, 2008, Tarin announced reforms of Pakistan's tax system, including the politically sensitive taxation of large landowners, to reduce the incidence of tax evasion. President Zardari has emphasized the importance of his nation's economic problems, stating, \"The greatest challenge this government faces is an economic one.\"", "Despite the September announcement of new economic policies, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves declined markedly throughout 2008. The State Bank of Pakistan's holdings of foreign exchange reserves fell from $14.2 billion at the end of October 2007 to $3.4 billion at the end of October 2008\u2014barely enough to cover one month of imports. Pakistan needed $4 billion to $5 billion in assistance by the end of November in order to avoid defaulting on maturing sovereign debt obligations. ", "During the autumn of 2008, Pakistan sought the needed capital from a variety of sources, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), China, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and an informal group of nations known as the \"Friends of Pakistan.\" Although some assistance was provided by international organizations such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Islamic Development Bank (IDB), as well as $500 million from China, most of the capital Pakistan required to avoid the impending capital crisis came in the form of a $7.6 billion \"stand-by arrangement\" with the IMF, finalized on November 24, 2008. ", "The IMF stand-by arrangement provided for $3.1 billion in immediate assistance, with the remainder to be distributed over the next two years, following quarterly reviews of Pakistan's economic progress. Access to the IMF assistance was subject to a number of \"conditionalities,\" including a significant reduction in Pakistan's fiscal and current account deficits; a tightening of Pakistan's monetary policy (via higher interest rates); and \"a strengthening and better targeting of social assistance.\"", "Even though the autumnal capital crisis was averted, Pakistan claimed it needed $10 billion to $15 billion over the next two to three years to continue to service its capital account deficits and its outstanding debt. As a result, it continues to seek assistance from various sources. Pakistan reportedly requested an additional $4.5 billion in assistance from the IMF during bilateral talks in Dubai in mid-February 2009. A few days later, President Zardari traveled to China, where he reportedly requested aid.", "In addition, there are signs that Pakistan's economic problems are growing worse. The global economic recession has apparently contributed to a slowdown in Pakistan's merchandise trade. Despite the decline in global food and energy prices, inflation remains high in Pakistan, causing economic hardship for Pakistan's urban and rural poor. Pakistan reportedly requested an easing of the IMF conditionalities during the meetings in Dubai. There is rising concern that the economic conditions are contributing to a growth in support for Pakistan's Islamist extremists, including al Qaeda and the Taliban. In his testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair stated:", "The [Pakistan] government is losing authority in parts of the North-West Frontier Province and has less control of its semi-autonomous tribal areas: even in the more developed parts of the country, mounting economic hardships and frustration over poor governance have given rise to greater radicalization.", "In a February 2009 report, the Atlantic Council stated, \"Pakistan faces dire economic and security threats that threaten both the existence of Pakistan as a democratic and stable state and the region as a whole.\" The Atlantic Council called for an additional $4 billion - 5 billion of immediate financial aid for Pakistan to avert \"an economic meltdown.\" The report's honorary co-chair Senator John Kerry has indicated that he and Senator Richard Lugar \"will soon introduce our Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan legislation.\" The legislation is expected to be very similar to the \"Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2008\" ( S. 3263 ), introduced in the 110 th Congress by then-Senator and currently Vice President Joseph Biden.

Pakistan's consumer price index (CPI), which had fluctuated around 7%-9% for several years, jumped to over 25% during the summer of 2008, primarily due to a sharp increase in global food and energy prices. More alarming, however, was the dramatic decline in Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves, which plummeted from over $14 billion in June 2007 to $3.4 billion in October 2008, driven by a rapidly deteriorating current account balance. In the autumn of 2008, Pakistan was in danger of defaulting on its sovereign debt.

At first, Pakistan was unable to secure a firm commitment for support from most of these sources. There was speculation that the individual nations were waiting to see if the IMF would provide assistance, and what conditions the IMF would place on this aid. Pakistan, however, was initially reluctant to accept IMF support, for fear that its \"conditionalities\" would generate unacceptable hardship for Pakistan's poor and possibly threaten the stability of the Pakistan government.

In an interview prior to his departure, Tarin stated, \"We will not require IMF support in case we succeed in getting money from Saudi Arabia.\" Saudi relations with Pakistan, however, have been cool lately for several reasons, including Pakistan's quest for an oil facility from Iran.

According to various reports, informal talks between Pakistan and the IMF had been going on for some time in Dubai.", "The Pakistani government was reluctant to accept formal IMF assistance for several reasons. First, there is a history of poor relations between Pakistan and the IMF. Second, relations between the Pakistani government and the IMF may have been further strained by recent reports that the IMF applied pressure on the World Bank to cancel $300 million in aid to Pakistan. Third, Pakistan was concerned that the changes in Pakistan's economic policy the IMF would require as conditions for providing assistance would have undesirable political and/or economic consequences.

According to an Atlantic Council report, Pakistan has the lowest tax-to-GDP ratio in South Asia, with less than 1% of its population paying income tax. Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is to integrate the nation's income and general sales tax (GST) to broaden the tax base and reduce tax evasion. Pakistan already increased the GST rate to 16% for fiscal year 2008/2009. The FBR is also to develop a plan for the adoption of a comprehensive value-added tax (VAT). These combined measures are supposed to raise revenues by 0.5% of GDP.", "Pakistan is to reduce its federal expenditures by 2.75% of GDP primarily by eliminating a number of subsidies. Prior to the finalization of the stand-by agreement, Pakistan raised petroleum prices three times to eliminate its petroleum subsidies. It has also begun the process of eliminating electricity subsidies by the end of June 2009. In addition, a research and development subsidy for the textile industry has been eliminated.

Second, the SBP was to refrain from financing the federal deficit by the purchase of Pakistani treasury bills and other government securities. ", "Pakistan has operated a de-facto managed float of its exchange rate for a number of years. Under the terms of the stand-by agreement, Pakistan is to reduce its intervention in foreign exchange markets, including the provision of foreign exchange for petroleum imports. However, the SBP is allowed to intervene in order to meet the agreed foreign reserve targets. ", "Finally, to offset the adverse effects of inflation and the economic slowdown, Pakistan is to increase its expenditures on social safety net programs from 0.6% to 0.9% of GDP.

Pakistan was able to finance its modest trade and capital account deficits in part due to the inward FDI and in part due to remittances from overseas Pakistanis.", "In 2007 and 2008, a rise in fuel and food prices, combined with political instability, led to a rapid rise in inflation, a spike in the trade and current account deficits, and a devaluation of the Pakistani rupee. Although global fuel and food prices are on the decline, the U.S. financial crisis has precipitated a possibly extended global recession. For Pakistan, a global recession will likely reduce demand for its exports, inward FDI flows and overseas remittances. Official Pakistan estimates for inward foreign direct investment in 2009 reportedly show a decline of over 32% when compared to last year.", "When he announced the previously mentioned economic policies in September 2008, acting Finance Minister Qamar said that the economic stabilization package would create jobs, promote agriculture and manufacturing, and reduce poverty. There is concern in Pakistan, however, that the higher interest rates required by the IMF will force smaller businesses into bankruptcy and the repayment of the IMF loan will stunt future economic growth.", "For now, the focus of the government appears to be on the current economic problems. The combination of high inflation and high unemployment apparently has contributed to a rise in poverty and hunger in Pakistan. According to one estimate, Pakistan's unemployment rate in urban areas is nearly 40% and in rural areas over 60%. A recent United Nations study reportedly determined 10 million Pakistanis are undernourished and over half of Pakistan's population can be considered \"food insecure.\" ", "According to a recent news report, the price of wheat\u2014a staple food in Pakistan\u2014has more than doubled since April 2007, while the price of palm oil\u2014which is used in cooking\u2014has more than tripled. The cost of food has reportedly also affected the ability of people to obtain medical care, \"In this era of high inflation, poor people can't afford to seek medical treatment, even for kids.\" ", "There is also evidence that the recent growth in poverty and hunger is exacerbating Pakistan's political problems. Anecdotal accounts of popular dissatisfaction are collaborated by a recent popular opinion poll conducted by the International Republican Institute (IRI) in October 2008. When asked if Pakistan was heading in the right or wrong direction, 88% of the people surveyed said it was heading in the wrong direction, compared to 44% in February 2007. In response to a question about the change in their personal economic situation over the past year, 73% said their situation had worsened, compared to 30% in February 2007. In addition, 59% of the respondents said they expected the economic situation to get worse over the next year; in February 2007, only 14% expected things to get worse.

The most common answer\u2014selected by 58% of the respondents\u2014was inflation. The second most common answer (12%) was unemployment. Suicide bombings was third (10%), even though the bombing of the Islamabad Marriott Hotel\u2014which resulted in the death of 53 people\u2014had occurred less than a month before the survey was conducted.

Although the United States provides both military and humanitarian assistance ($968 million in FY2008), Pakistan is increasingly turning to other friendly nations\u2014such as China and Saudi Arabia\u2014for support. Pakistan's trade relations have shifted so that China is its largest trading partner, followed by Saudi Arabia and the United States. However, the United States remains Pakistan's largest export market.

In their view, with the IMF loan settled, there is an opportunity for the United States to demonstrate its support for Pakistan by providing a portion of the $2 billion - $7 billion Pakistan will likely still need to cover its capital shortfall.

The act would also have required the Secretary of State\u2014in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and such other government officials as may be appropriate\u2014develop a comprehensive strategy for the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, and report the findings to Congress. It has been reported that Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar will reintroduce S. 3263 \u2014or a very similar bill\u2014in the near future.", "Besides direct assistance, Congress could help Pakistan's economic recovery by altering current U.S. trade policies in ways that would increase bilateral trade and investment.

The \"Afghanistan and Pakistan Reconstruction Opportunity Zones Act of 2009\" ( S. 496 ) and the ''Afghanistan-Pakistan Security and Prosperity Enhancement Act' ( H.R. 1318 ) were introduced by Senator Maria Cantwell and Representative Chris Van Hollen, respectively. Both bills seek to promote economic growth and development along the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan by creating ROZs. Under the terms of the legislation, the President would have the authority to proclaim duty-free treatment for articles manufactured within the ROZs and imported into the United States, subject to certain conditions in existing U.S. trade law. ", "Beyond the past and pending legislation proposals, other suggestions have been made on how Congress could stimulate Pakistan's economic recovery. For example, the Atlantic Council has recommended the United States should conduct a geological survey of Pakistan to identify potential mineral resources to develop. If adopted, these suggestions might require Congress to appropriate additional funds.", "Finally, Congress could encourage the Obama Administration to take actions that do not require appropriations or changes in federal law. For example, Congress could recommend that the Obama Administration press other nations to provide greater assistance to Pakistan, via such mechanisms as the next meeting of the Friends of Pakistan\u2014scheduled to be held in Tokyo on March 27, 2009. In addition, Congress could support the negotiation of a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with Pakistan, in the expectation that it would increase U.S. foreign direct investments in Pakistan.
