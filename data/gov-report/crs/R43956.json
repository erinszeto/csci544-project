The NRC issued its final report on this study in 2005.", "The NRC concluded that any decisions on additional eligibility for downwinders should not be made solely on the basis of geographic area. Thus, it advised against simply adding more downwind counties. Citing studies showing that NTS fallout covered the entire country and that people living far beyond the current downwinder eligibility area may have been exposed to higher amounts of radiation, the NTC recommended an alternative science-based approach to determining downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits. ", "Individuals' exposure to fallout depended on multiple factors, including where they lived, the amount of time they spent outdoors, and their consumption of milk. That last factor is especially significant because the most important pathway of exposure was the ingestion of Iodine 131 ( 131 I) through the consumption of milk from cows and goats that ate contaminated vegetation.", "To be equitable, the NRC report recommended that the RECA program use a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits instead of basing downwinder eligibility solely on geography and a presumption of eligibility. Under this model, each applicant's individual absorbed dose of radionuclides would be estimated using geographic, demographic, and behavioral factors and every person in the country would be eligible to apply for benefits. This estimated dose would then be used to calculate, using established radio-epidemiology formulas developed by NCI, the probability that the individual's specific type of cancer was caused by his or her exposure to ionizing radiation. Congress would then have to set the threshold at which to award benefits or perhaps award varying levels of benefits based on a sliding scale of probabilities. ", "This model, which is similar to one of the methods used to determine eligibility for benefits under Part B of EEOICPA and for disability compensation provided by the VA, has never been part of the RECA program or its amendments to expand the downwinder area. No legislation has ever been introduced to convert RECA downwinder eligibility from a model based on geography to one based on the probability of causation. In addition, in both the EEOICPA and veterans' programs, the probability of causation model has been largely supplanted by a presumption of eligibility model similar to that used in RECA.", "The presumptive eligibility model used by RECA may be favored by some advocates for compensation because the probability of causation model recommended by the NRC is likely to result in fewer successful claims. This is due to the generally low levels of radiation exposure from fallout and the fact that ionizing radiation is not an especially potent cancer-causing agent. In the executive summary to its report, the NRC states,", "The scientific evidence indicates that in most cases it is unlikely that exposure to radiation from fallout was a substantial contributing cause to developing cancer. Moreover, scientifically based changes that Congress may make in the eligibility criteria for compensation in response to this report are likely to result in few successful claims.

For example, the current Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) annual exposure limit for radiation of 4 WLM is higher than the annual exposure limit of 1 WLM recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), meaning that current uranium miners can be exposed to higher than recommended levels of radon while still being in compliance with federal safety standards.", "The intent of the RECA program, as expressed in Section 2 of the statute is to make \"partial restitution\" to persons who were affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners who were working in mines \"that were providing uranium for the primary use and benefit of the nuclear weapons program of the United States Government,\" in recognition that the \"lives and health of uranium miners and of individuals who were exposed to radiation were subjected to increased risk of injury and disease to serve the national security interests of the United States.\" ", "An expansion of RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would largely cover workers in the commercial uranium sector, which would expand the program beyond its original statutory intent.
