Traditionally, it contributes to refugee appeals both to alleviate the suffering of innocent victims and out of concern that refugee flows can lead to instability in countries or regions important to U.S. foreign policy interests. The United States is also the largest resettlement country. The money for humanitarian assistance and some of the costs of resettlement in the United States is authorized under the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account of the Department of State Authorization bill and appropriated in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. Though not the topic of this report, the bulk of assistance for refugees who resettle in the United States is authorized and appropriated in the Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS) legislation. This report discusses the size of the U.S. international refugee assistance budget and its allocation between humanitarian assistance and admissions.", "With the end of the Cold War, U.S. refugee policy began to evolve to reflect changes taking place in the international arena. The nearly exclusive anti-communist focus began to shift as conflicts among nations moved away from the constraints of superpower politics and toward a more complex array of internal disputes. These new conditions led to a change in the nature of refugee emergencies and in the types of programs that the United States and the international community provide for refugees and other people forced to flee their homes. In addition, it resulted in a tremendous increase in the number of people needing assistance. These factors also influenced the continuing debate between the Administration and the Congress and within the Congress about the U.S. role with regard to refugees.", "The MRA is part of the foreign aid appropriation, and because humanitarian emergencies are growing in number, complexity, and size, it faces enormous budget pressures, both from traditional foreign assistance programs and from newly emerging national priorities. While refugee assistance enjoys considerable support, Congress and the Administration face the difficult task of funding humanitarian needs within a constrained budget. For the last several years, with the exception of FY1999, the appropriation for the MRA account has remained at about $700 million.", "P.L. 107-115, signed into law on January 10, 2002, appropriated $705 million for the MRA and $15 million for the Emergency Refugee and Migration assistance (ERMA) for FY2002. The President requested $705 million for MRA and $15 million for ERMA for FY2003. The Senate Committee on Appropriations (S.Rept. 107-219) recommended $782 million for the MRA and $32 million for ERMA, whereas the House Appropriations Committee (House Rept. 107-663) recommended $800 million for the MRA and $20 million for ERMA.

While the global trend suggests that the numbers of refugees may have stabilized in recent years, the ebb and flow of population movements remain largely dependent upon external events and usually require an immediate response. Two major factors influence U.S. decisions to aid refugees: (1) an American bipartisan tradition of humanitarian concern for suffering people and (2) a concern that refugee flows can lead to instability in countries important to U.S. foreign policy. U.S. assistance takes the form of aid to refugees in their countries of asylum and admission to the United States for some refugees of special concern. The problem for Congress is how to respond programmatically to refugee needs in a way that satisfies both the American tradition of providing assistance and U.S. budgetary limitations. This report examines the problem, and the response over time by Congress and the executive branch. It also considers the role of the international community through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Before reviewing the U.S. financial assistance to refugees, this report will examine the evolution of the refugee problem worldwide and briefly review the international response to it."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Expanding Needs of Refugees Worldwide", "paragraphs": ["UNHCR, established by the U.N. General Assembly in 1950 and made operational in 1951, is mandated by the United Nations to lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems. UNHCR's initial mission was to help resettle European refugees after World War II, and its mandate reflects this history. UNHCR became the institutional mechanism for the implementation of the 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees. This Convention established the definition of a refugee and the organizational tasks and responsibilities of the international community toward refugees. However, the definition of a refugee was not universal; the 1951 Convention allowed states to limit the definition of refugees to those created by events occurring in Europe prior to 1951.", "When international and intergovernmental refugee organizations were established in the 1950s and 1960s, their mandates were fairly specific and defined refugees as persons who fled their country in response to persecution on the basis of race, religion, ethnic or social group, or political opinion. While refugee situations did not always conform to these definitions, they usually could be accommodated within the mandates of the humanitarian relief agencies. Refugee emergencies usually did not receive worldwide media attention. There was little news coverage of the hardships faced by refugees in their exile. Refugee assistance was also provided in a relatively safe setting because humanitarian assistance was given with the agreement of the host government involved.", "In response to subsequent large refugee movements that increasingly occurred outside of Europe, the time and geographical limits of the 1951 Convention were eliminated with the 1967 Protocol, to which the United States is a party. Furthermore, the UN General Assembly passed resolutions requesting that UNHCR not only help refugees, but also provide assistance to asylum seekers, returnees, and those displaced within the borders of their own countries; these many groups make up the \"people of concern\" to UNHCR.", "The number of refugees in camps around the world increased steadily as a result of the conflicts that erupted after the end of the Cold War, straining the regular budgets of the agencies that assist them. But the numbers displaced by warfare or other manmade disasters within the borders of their own countries grew even more. These internally displaced persons (IDPs), such as those in Sierra Leone, Bosnia, or Chechnya, currently outnumber traditional refugees.", "According to UNHCR, the number of people of concern declined from a record 27 million in 1995 to 19.8 million by January 2002. This figure included approximately 12 million refugees (persons who fled from their country), 462,700 returnees (people returning to their country but not fully resettled), 940,800 asylum seekers, 5.3 million IDPs, 241,000 returned IDPs, and another million others of concern. UNHCR estimates that an additional 20-25 million may be displaced for political or other reasons from their homes, with the majority receiving little or no international assistance. The number of refugees and displaced persons in Africa numbered 20,000 in 1989. Today there are more than six million refugees, IDPs and returnees in Africa. Much of the increase in numbers of refugees and displaced is blamed on the rise in ethnic conflict unleashed after the Cold War.", "Changing circumstances in refugee producing countries have also altered the international response and created greater pressure to act. Increasingly, refugee problems are part of longstanding political disagreements within countries rather than between nations. Resolving them may require the unified action of many governments, if not the U.N. Security Council, and raises the sensitive issue of the limits of a sovereign government's freedom to repress or harm its own citizens. International consensus is difficult and often takes years to achieve. In the interim, humanitarian suffering and destruction continues in the affected countries. Where the underlying issues remain unresolved, humanitarian assistance is often the only course which can be agreed upon.", "Within the last decade and a half, new kinds of humanitarian situations have become increasingly common and in fact make up the bulk of international disaster situations. In addition, the long-held, generally agreed doctrine that nations should not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries, unless invited to do so, has begun to be questioned. This has placed humanitarian aid workers in increasingly dangerous situations and has led to an increased military role for the United Nations and its member states in activities that range from providing security to delivering aid. These and other factors have driven up the cost and sometimes reduced the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Changing Nature of Refugee Situations", "paragraphs": ["The typical profile of the refugee situation is quite different today from that of post-World War II, and as a result humanitarian needs have changed as well.

For decades these IDPs suffered from lack of international attention even though their compatriots who fled to another country often received humanitarian aid as refugees. Examples of this situation today are Afghanistan, the Balkans, Chechnya, Sudan, and Sierra Leone. One response to the growing numbers of people in this type of situation has been a broadening of the UNHCR activities or area of responsibility. In October 1992, UNHCR donor nations approved an expansion of the UNHCR role to include assistance to the millions of people displaced within their own countries by war and/or famine resulting from war. This change made UNHCR responsible for nearly twice as many needy people almost overnight, although in fact the agency had been assisting many of them previously with informal donor support. In other cases, such as the current situations in Colombia and Afghanistan, people are prevented from fleeing warfare because surrounding countries close their borders and UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies must assist them in extremely difficult and dangerous situations. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard C. Holbrook made the plight of IDPs a special concern of his. Both the U.N. Secretary General and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees have also called for increased attention to IDPs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complicating Factors Exacerbated by War", "paragraphs": ["Persons in need may be victims of a combination of a refugee emergency and a natural disaster, which may be exacerbated by warfare. Drought in Ethiopia/Eritrea and Afghanistan while warfare continues are current examples. Other situations include farmers who cannot farm because of warfare or minefields, leading to food shortages and lack of livelihood, or families unable to maintain sanitation due to lack of water and waste systems, posing increased risks to health. The needs of these people have been served by the international agencies that respond to natural disasters, by the refugee relief agencies, as well as by the humanitarian agencies, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which respond to civil conflict situations. To address problems of program overlap among the international agencies and the lack of clear mandate by any one agency to help, the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in December 1991 created the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Although it was somewhat successful in coordinating the international response to all disasters, either manmade or natural, Annan abolished it under his 1997 reorganization plan and established instead a U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator in the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), thereby raising the level of attention paid to humanitarian assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seeking Assistance in Failed States", "paragraphs": ["Humanitarian emergencies occurring in countries without a functioning government make it difficult for relief agencies to get assistance to victims of civil war. In these situations, issues such as visas, shipping clearance, use of roads and airport facilities, water, and power cannot be addressed centrally. Nor can the issues of protection of aid workers or aid supplies be resolved. In addition, warring political factions often insist on separate negotiations concerning all facets of providing assistance. In the cases of Somalia and Liberia, the international community attempted to restore order through the introduction of foreign military forces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Humanitarian Assistance as a Tool for War", "paragraphs": ["In some internal wars civilians, and the humanitarian agencies who try to help them, are specifically attacked in order to change the outcome of the war. Humanitarian aid personnel have been the targets of various factions in a number of countries. Their protection has become an area of increasing concern to the United Nations. Between January 1, 1992, and June 2002, 214 civilian U.N. employees were killed, and dozens more were wounded, some in deliberate, premeditated armed attacks. If UN contractors from non governmental organizations (NGOs) are included, the numbers are much higher. The recent U.N. response has been to use U.N. peacekeeping forces to assist in providing humanitarian aid and protecting aid workers. Deputy U.N. Secretary-General Louise Frechette called on governments to address these deaths in the following ways: conduct vigorous investigations and punish the guilty; ratify the two international conventions which address protection of international personnel; provide additional funding to international agencies specifically for improved security; and use whatever government influence is available to bring irregular forces under better control and discipline. In one report to the General Assembly on this topic, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan calls for the expenditure of $30 million per year to protect civilian staff in conflict situations. In his report, he states that only nine headquarter professionals and 60 field security officers are responsible for managing a security system to protect 70,000 staff and dependents at 150 duty stations. In May 2002, Annan appointed Mr. Tun Myat as full-time security coordinator.

International donors have recognized the need to provide rehabilitation to these countries as well as the usual short-term repatriation assistance, but the rehabilitation funding has not always been made available. This assistance may include a very wide range of activities such as help in the election of a new government, mine-clearing, establishment of banking and commercial facilities, and other non-traditional humanitarian assistance programs. Kosovo and East Timor are the most recent examples of countries that received such help. Cambodia, Mozambique, Angola, and El Salvador can be included as well.

She noted that military involvement has sometimes undermined coordination among civilian humanitarian agencies and may create the perception, in the eyes of the combatants, that refugees are parties to the conflict. U.N. Secretary General Annan has also cautioned against mixing military and humanitarian actions. He stressed that no government should fear that accepting humanitarian aid will lead to military intervention.

There is widespread agreement that prevention is the best way to address refugee flows. President Clinton created the new position of Under Secretary for Global Affairs to allow the Department of State to focus more attention on the underlying causes of refugee flight. The Clinton Administration also reorganized the Bureau of Refugee Programs to include population and migration, in order to consolidate all departmental responsibility for these related matters.

First, it provides legal protection to those who fall within its mandate. Governments establish procedures to determine who is a refugee and his or her rights in accordance with their own legal systems. UNHCR offers advice and non-binding guidelines to these governments. In countries which are not party to international refugee treaties but request UNHCR assistance, UNHCR may determine refugee status and offer its own protection and assistance. The core rights accorded to refugees are acceptance of asylum seekers at the border, non-forced repatriation (non-refoulement), protection of their safety, access to fair and efficient procedures for determination of refugee status, the same rights and basic help provided any other foreigner who is a legal resident, and appropriate lasting solutions concerning their status.", "Second, UNHCR seeks permanent solutions to refugee situations. In general, there are three solutions for refugees: 1) voluntary repatriation, 2) local integration in the country of first asylum, and 3) resettlement from the country of first asylum to a third country. UNHCR prefers voluntary repatriation, whereby refugees return to their home countries. If repatriation is impossible, the UNHCR seeks to locally integrate the refugees and, if this is impossible, then seeks to resettle the refugees in a third country.", "Refugees and IDPs returning home are also assisted by UNHCR. These repatriations often require follow-on rehabilitation of agricultural land and infrastructure to ensure that the refugees can survive in homelands devastated by war. Although in the long run repatriation is the best and least expensive solution, in the short run it is often more expensive and dangerous than maintaining refugees in camps. Additional complications may make the expense even higher. In many recent cases, UNHCR has been urged to repatriate refugees in a short period of time so that they can participate in elections in their homeland. At the same time, refugees remaining in exile must be offered care and support to ensure that they are not coerced into returning to a situation where their lives will be endangered.", "Third, UNHCR also coordinates assistance from numerous NGOs that provide emergency humanitarian relief to refugees, including shelter, food, and health care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of UNRWA", "paragraphs": ["The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), established in 1949, provides relief assistance and programs for Palestinian refugees.

Raising money in a timely fashion has become increasingly difficult for the international agencies, both for humanitarian assistance programs and for repatriation programs. Since many countries earmark their funds for specific programs, the shortages are not spread evenly to all the humanitarian emergencies or even to all programs in a country. Other disaster agencies have similar patterns of uneven expenditures. The UNHCR has expressed concern that the continuing failure of donors to meet the funding needs of the humanitarian aid programs means that UNHCR has not been able to meet the very real needs of refugees, returnees, and IDPs. The high level of contributions of rich nations to the Kosovo crisis and lack of contributions to African crises have established what is described by some as a double standard.

Since UNHCR relies primarily on voluntary contributions, it depends on the annual generosity of its donors and cannot anticipate from year-to-year how much money will be available nor how much it will have to spend. Some pledged contributions are also late. These problems create a general cash availability crisis. In February 2002, UNHCR froze its administrative budgets.

The unpredictability of global conflicts also contribute to UNHCR's financial difficulties. UNHCR cannot fully anticipate the extent and costs of new refugee emergencies. During CY2002, UNHCR had to make a supplemental appeal to fund new emergency needs in Afghanistan, Macedonia, East Timor, Liberia, Angola, and Zambia, as well as the new programs to protect U.N. personnel.

The Clinton Administration expected to continue these reductions based on fewer admissions from the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia. Refugees located in camps throughout Southeast Asia that the United States pledged to accept under the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA, a 1989 international agreement to address the refugee crisis in Southeast Asia), have mostly been admitted.

Actual figures show the FY1999 total as 85,525; FY2000 admissions came to 73,147. For FY2001, 69,304 refugees were admitted (with a ceiling of 80,000) and by contrast, following the terrorist events of September 11, 2001 and greater security concerns, in FY2002 only 27,113 were admitted. The ceiling established for FY2003 is 70,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Finding Funds for Emergency Assistance", "paragraphs": ["The cost of responding to refugee and humanitarian emergencies has risen. Pressure on the Foreign Affairs budget, the 150 account, caused by rising emergency costs, has led to concerns about the bilateral development assistance programs. In the last few years, many of the private voluntary agencies working in the development field, as well as U.N. and U.S. development specialists have expressed concern that the rising costs of emergency assistance are reducing the amount of money available for development assistance.", "Several approaches have been used to address the growing need for refugee assistance and the anticipated growth in refugee repatriation needs without further draining the development aid accounts. For example, in response to the need to help Kurdish refugees displaced after the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Congress transferred interest on money from the Persian Gulf Regional Defense Fund and Defense Cooperation Account, two funds established to channel contributions from other countries to counterbalance U.S. Iraqi war expenses. A supplemental appropriation in FY1994 provided assistance for the Rwanda emergencies. Supplemental legislation enacted in the Spring of 1999 ( P.L. 106-31 ) reimbursed the agencies and provided new funding for aid both in Central America and the Caribbean, for natural disaster response, and to pay for humanitarian assistance to Kosovo. The Administration requested an FY2000 supplemental to meet the continuing needs in Kosovo and most recently in the FY2002 supplemental request for Afghanistan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving the Efficiency of International Refugee Programs", "paragraphs": ["Meeting the growing need for humanitarian assistance to refugees in other countries within a constrained budget can also be helped by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of international refugee organizations. The Clinton administration emphasized the need for efficiency in the U.N. refugee agencies. Consolidation of humanitarian assistance programs, which partly address refugee issues, was one of the Department of State's suggestions for U.N. reform. In the United Nations, OCHA now issues consolidated appeals for major humanitarian emergencies. These appeals simplify donations and eliminate overlap and competition among the agencies included such as UNHCR, UNICEF, World Food Program (WFP), and WHO."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
