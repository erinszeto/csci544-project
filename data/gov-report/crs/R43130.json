It held its first universal suffrage elections in 1994, after a transition from white minority rule under apartheid, a system of state-enforced racial segregation and socioeconomic discrimination. South Africa entered a period of mourning in late 2013, upon the death of its first post-apartheid president, Nelson Mandela. He is viewed as the founding father of the country's nonracial democratic system, the 20th anniversary of which was recently celebrated prior to national elections on May 7. South Africa is influential regionally, due to its political, trade, and investment ties across Africa and its active role within the African Union. It is viewed as a U.S. strategic partner in Africa, despite periodic foreign policy differences. In mid-2013, President Obama traveled to South Africa, among other African countries. Key issues addressed in South Africa included bilateral political and trade and investment ties, development cooperation, and shared U.S.-South African aims regarding similar issues across Africa, as well as democracy, youth leadership development, and peace and security.", "Congress has long been engaged with South Africa, notably during the anti-apartheid struggle, and with regard to post-apartheid socioeconomic development efforts, a key focus of bilateral ties. Since 1992, South Africa has been a leading recipient of U.S. foreign aid, mostly devoted to addressing HIV/AIDS and other health challenges. Aid oversight has drawn the bulk of South Africa-related congressional attention in recent years. U.S. policy makers are also increasingly focused on efforts to strengthen already growing U.S.-South African trade and investment ties. Other key areas of bilateral engagement include security cooperation and an ongoing U.S.-South African Strategic Dialogue. Established in 2010, the Dialogue centers on health, education, food security, law enforcement, trade, investment, and energy, among other issues.", "South Africa has the largest, most diversified, and highly industrialized economy in Africa. It has enjoyed moderate economic growth in most recent years. Average per capita incomes and access to education have grown across racial groups, notably for blacks. Despite post-apartheid national socioeconomic gains, South Africa remains a highly unequal society with respect to wealth and income distribution and access to jobs, social services, utilities, and land. Most blacks are poor, and average black incomes are far smaller than those of the historically privileged white minority. Blacks also suffer very high unemployment rates (36% in 2011), and have far less access to education. Shortages of quality housing, utilities, and social services in townships\u2014the vast, high-density housing settlements where many of the poor live\u2014spur ongoing social and political tensions. Other key problems include public corruption and widespread violent crime. Vigilante justice and mob violence is not uncommon, and heavy-handed police tactics sometimes result in human rights abuses. South Africa also suffers high rates of HIV/AIDS.", "In late 2012, the governing African National Congress (ANC) party, despite some reported internal divisions, reelected as its president Jacob Zuma, ahead of the May 2014 national elections. The parliament elected Zuma to his first term as president of South Africa in 2009. The ANC government faces the substantial challenges noted above, along with others, including labor unrest, rising dissatisfaction within key labor constituencies, and dissatisfaction among youths. Youth populations face particularly high jobless rates and may lack older generations' continuing allegiance and gratitude to the ANC for helping to end apartheid. To address these diverse challenges, all of which are electoral issues, the government is investing billions of dollars to upgrade infrastructure and improve public service delivery, but is likely to face continuing challenges in meeting popular expectations."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Current Issue: Elections", "paragraphs": ["On April 27, 2014, South Africa celebrated Freedom Day\u2014marking the 20 th anniversary of the first non-racial democratic elections in 1994 and \"the end of over three hundred years of colonialism, segregation and white minority rule\"\u2014ahead of the fifth democratic post-apartheid national election on May 7. The governing African National Congress (ANC) political party is widely expected to maintain an electoral majority after the polls, though its share of the vote may shrink. As discussed in this report, the ANC faces substantial, increasing criticism focusing on its governance record by many in the general public, a range of civic leaders, and by rival political parties, the number of which has recently grown by two. An early 2014 opinion poll pegged the ANC's level of support at 53%, while it garnered about 66% in two recent polls.

The President also announced plans to host a U.S.-Africa heads of state summit in the United States in 2014, now slated to be held in early August, and the roll-out of Power Africa, \"a new initiative that will double access to [electrical] power in sub-Saharan Africa.\" While in South Africa, the President held a meeting and a joint press conference with President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, which he described as a \"critical partner\" of the United States. Their meeting focused on U.S.-South African bilateral relations, which President Obama said are \"extraordinarily strong,\" and a wide range of regional and global political, security, economic, and development issues. ", "Among other activities in South Africa, the President also held a town hall meeting as part of his Young African Leaders Initiative, initiated in 2010; met with the African Union Commission chair on continental issues and regional organization capacities; and visited the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation Youth Center. The Center visit was intended to highlight community-based solutions to healthcare challenges and the Administration's global health agenda, in particular efforts to help improve public health systems in South Africa and elsewhere in Africa.", "The State Department characterizes South Africa as a U.S. \"strategic partner,\" and President Obama's trip to the country underlined that bilateral ties remain close, as they have been since 1994, despite periodic differences on some foreign policy issues. Socioeconomic development is a key focus of bilateral cooperation; since 1992, South Africa has been a leading African recipient of U.S. aid, the bulk of which supports HIV/AIDS and related health programs. U.S.-South African trade ties are also important. Total trade (exports and imports) more than doubled over the past decade, reaching a record of $16.7 billion in 2011 before declining slightly to $16.2 billion in 2012 and $15.8 billion in 2013. South Africa has enjoyed a significant but declining trade surplus with the United States and is a major export and investment destination for U.S. businesses in Africa. Security cooperation is another key area of engagement. In 2010, the two countries established a Strategic Dialogue centering on cooperation related to health, education, food security, law enforcement, trade, investment, energy, and nonproliferation. South Africa hosted two visits by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as by other top U.S. officials. John Kerry had not made a visit to South Africa as Secretary of State as of early May 2014. First Lady Michelle Obama traveled to South Africa in 2011, as did Vice President Joseph Biden and his wife in 2010, when they attended the World Cup.", "Congress has played an active role in U.S. relations with South Africa. This was particularly true during the struggle against apartheid, beginning in the late 1960s, through the first decade that followed the 1994 transition to majority rule. In recent years, congressional engagement with South Africa has mainly focused on foreign aid program oversight, particularly relating to HIV/AIDS and other healthcare-related programs. In addition to these traditional areas of interest, efforts to bolster trade and investment ties with South Africa, and with Africa generally, are drawing increasing congressional attention. Trade was a key focus of an early 2013 bicameral congressional delegation to South Africa."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Country Overview", "paragraphs": ["South Africa, a multi-racial but predominantly black country about twice the size of Texas, has the largest, most diversified, and most industrialized economy in Africa.

It has enjoyed economic growth for more than a decade, apart from 2009 when the economy contracted, and average per capita incomes and access to education have grown across racial groups, notably for blacks. Nonetheless, South Africa remains a racially unequal society with respect to wealth and income distribution and access to jobs, social services, and utilities. There are also significant regional, rural-urban, and intraracial disparities. Most black South Africans live in poverty, and average per capita black incomes are one-sixth as large as those of the historically privileged white minority, although this disparity has gradually declined. Blacks are also disproportionately unemployed, at a rate of 36% in 2011, compared to 5.9% for whites, and have relatively less access to education, although black education rates are steadily increasing.", "South Africa faces multiple challenges, many related to poverty and public service provision. Most South African cities are surrounded by vast, high-density informal housing settlements, known as townships, which are populated mostly by blacks and coloureds. Shortages of formal housing (i.e., legally registered, generally durable cement houses, as opposed to improvised shanty structures often constructed by squatters), water, electricity, and social services in townships have contributed to growing social and political tensions. Township protests demanding improvements in these areas have increased in recent years. Labor unrest is also common and rose sharply in 2012, and has remained so, notably in the mining sector. Public corruption is another key challenge, and there are high rates of violent crime, particularly rape. There are periodic reports of vigilante and mob violence, and police reportedly often use heavy-handed tactics to respond to crime and public unrest, occasionally resulting in serious human rights violations. South Africa is afflicted by high and gradually increasing rates of adult HIV prevalence. The rate in 2012 was 17.9%."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Politics and Governance Under President Zuma", "paragraphs": ["The ANC has held a large majority in the National Assembly (parliament) since the first universal suffrage elections in 1994, and currently holds a majority just shy of the two-thirds required to amend the constitution.

The ANC customarily nominates its party president to serve as national president, with some exceptions (see textbox below). The assembly elected the incumbent ANC president, Jacob Zuma, to his first term as national president in 2009. ", "Despite rising criticism of Zuma and internal party challenges to his candidacy, Zuma mounted a carefully crafted, successful campaign to ensure his reelection as head of the ANC at a late 2012 ANC party congress. He easily thwarted a belated and reportedly ill-coordinated rival bid by his deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe. Zuma's election as head of the ANC means that he is almost certain to win a second term as South Africa's president."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The ANC and Other Political Parties", "paragraphs": ["While the ANC is the dominant party in South Africa, it faces a growing number of opposition parties. The ANC, an ideologically leftist political party, earned much of its political support by leading the struggle against the apartheid system. It is dedicated to ending the diverse, deep-rooted, enduring social inequalities created by apartheid; and to ensuring social unity and equal access to rights, opportunities, land, and other resources, including through affirmative action and redistribution. It seeks to attain these ends by creating a \"developmental state\" built on a mixed economy combining state and other forms of collective ownership with private property and a market-based system. The ANC often supports social democratic-leaning development policies, and many of its political documents are steeped in leftist, often radical political doctrine, but ANC-led state decision makers often implement more centrist, pragmatic, market-based policies. The ANC governs in a tripartite alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP). Under the alliance, which guides ANC policy, COSATU and SACP are independent entities, but their members nominate political candidates through the ANC, hold ANC leadership posts, and help shape ANC policies. ", "The second-largest party in parliament, the Democratic Alliance (DA), was formed as a means of challenging ANC dominance. In subsequent elections at various levels of government the DA gradually increased its electoral strength, and in 2009 won a majority in the provincial legislature of the Western Cape. In 2010, another opposition party, the Independent Democrats, announced that it would merge with the DA. The currently female-led DA has a substantial white and coloured support base, but has faced challenges in attracting broad black support.", "A long-time key opposition party is the mostly ethnically Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), headed by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who has been active in politics for decades. The IFP has steadily lost parliamentary seats since the 1994 election, however, in recent years due partially to the rise of Zuma, whose own Zulu background and popularity have drawn the support of many Zulus. The IFP also suffered defections in 2011, when its former chairwoman left the party to form the National Freedom Party.", "A newer party is the Congress of the People (COPE), formed by a dissident group of former ANC government ministers in 2008, ahead of the 2009 election. COPE was formed in the wake of Zuma's successful ouster of Mbeki as head of the ANC in 2007, which caused enduring rifts between the two leaders' supporters. There is substantial animosity within the ANC for COPE. COPE won 30 seats in 2009, becoming the third-largest party in parliament and arguably curtailing the strength of the ANC, but fared poorly in municipal elections in 2011, when it garnered only 2.6% of votes. ", "In July 2013, another key ANC dissident, Julius Malema, a former ANC Youth League (ANCYL) president expelled from the ANC for breaking party rules in 2012, launched a rival party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), together with allied ANC dissidents and others. The EFF is seen as an important challenger to the ANC but not, to date, a major one. It appears to draw from the ANC's more radical and poorer political base: jobless youth, workers, and other constituencies whose members feel disenfranchised by or alienated from the ANC, or who seek the kinds of radical nationalist economic policy changes that the EFF supports. It is also seen as likely to take votes from some smaller opposition parties. ", "The EFF may well win some seats in the National Assembly, as discussed below, and if so, Malema would likely lead the party's parliamentary delegation. Malema's future, however, is in question, as he faces money-laundering, fraud, and racketeering charges related to alleged state contracting malfeasance, and bankruptcy and asset seizures related to a tax probe. Malema is a former avid supporter of Zuma and was elected ANCYL president in 2008, but he broke with Zuma and became one of his most vocal critics after Zuma became president. He was essentially expelled from the ANC for repeatedly harshly criticizing Zuma and other top ANC leaders. Malema's charismatic leadership style and inflammatory rhetoric\u2014such as calls to nationalize the country's mines and seize and redistribute to poor blacks white-owned farmland, among other radical policy solutions to challenges facing the ANC\u2014have earned him both impassioned followers, but also many strong critics. They have also prompted official sanction on occasion; prior to being expelled from the ANC, he was convicted for hate speech in 2011. ", "There are a number of minor parties, and in early 2013 Mamphela Ramphele, a veteran anti-apartheid activist, academic, and businesswoman, announced the formation of a new one, Agang (\"let us build\" in the minority Sepedi language), aimed at contesting ANC rule. Many analysts judge its prospects alone as poor, but it adds to the number of parties that could coalesce into a more potent challenge to the ANC. That potential was reflected in an early 2014 decision by Ramphele to lead Agang into an electoral alliance with the DA under which she would have become the DA's presidential candidate. Internal Agang opposition to the alliance, however, led Ramphele to terminate it a week later, prompting questions over her political acuity, reliability, and leadership skills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2014 Elections", "paragraphs": ["On May 7, voters will cast separate ballots to elect members of the National Assembly and of nine provincial legislatures under a direct vote closed-list proportional representation system.

Seats will be awarded to individual candidates based on their position on ranked lists of party-selected nominees for office. At the national level, the lists are made up of 400 candidates, equivalent to the number of seats in parliament, divided into 200 members selected from national party lists and 200 from regional party lists. One seat is allocated to a party for each 0.25% of the vote it receives.

Twenty-nine parties are contesting the national elections. The same parties, a sub-group thereof and, in some cases, additional parties are contesting each provincial election.", "At issue in the election are mainly the key policy challenges that are the focus of widespread discontent with the ANC. The main ones include high unemployment; lack of access to and poor quality education; corruption; crime and security challenges, including police abuses; and alleged ANC anti-democratic actions, especially related to cases of alleged constraints on expression and access to information. Public discontent over poor public goods and services provision, despite a significant post-1994 rise in access to such resources under the ANC, is another major issue. President Zuma has been a key object of rising public ire regarding an allegedly non-transparent $23 million government upgrade of his personal homestead compound and other matters (see textbox on Nkandla, below). He is seen as a potential electoral liability for the ANC by many observers\u2014he has been booed at several public appearances, including before a global audience during a televised memorial for Nelson Mandela, and has received a large amount of negative press coverage. The party has nevertheless defended him, and many long-standing ANC supporters voters are likely to vote for the party despite their discontent over Zuma's record. These and other issues and controversies are discussed further below.", "A fundamental question at issue is whether the majority ANC will gain enough seats (at least two-thirds, or 267 seats) to give it power to amend the constitution\u2014or whether its share of the vote might dip below 50%. This would require it to form a governing coalition with one or more parties and would suggest that voters were no longer willing to support it on the basis of its anti-apartheid leadership role, and had repudiated it based on its post-1994 governance record. Opposition parties are sharply contesting the ANC's electoral dominance. In addition, the ANC faces dissent within its own traditional support base associated with political and strike-related turmoil within the traditionally ANC-affiliated labor movement. This has led some observers to predict the eventual establishment of a labor party. A number of high-profile former ANC members or supporters citing a poor ANC governance record\u2014including Anglican Archbishop Emeritus and Nobel prizewinner Desmond Tutu\u2014have also publicly stated that they will not vote for the ANC or have called for voters to spoil their ballots or vote for small parties. This slow fragmentation of the ANC's base\u2014and the political independence and relative political disengagement of the so-called \"Born Free\" generation, those born in 1994 or later, about 40% of the population, who reportedly vote in far smaller numbers than older generations\u2014has prompted some observers to predict a gradual loss of ANC dominance in future elections.", "Despite such challenges, the ANC is widely seen as likely to maintain a parliamentary majority, and Zuma, as head of the ANC, is almost certain to be re-elected as national president. Polling in 2014 has varied, with support for the ANC by one key polling firm, Ipsos, showing the ANC with 53% in late 2013 and 66% in March 2014. Other key parties that have drawn polling-related media attention are the DA and the EFF. The same Ipsos polls showed the DA with an 18% and then a 22.9% share, and the EFF with a 4% and then a 3.7% share. As with many polls, the Ipsos findings have come under methodological criticism from some quarters, but other polls have shown broadly proportionally similar numbers, typically with support for the ANC being reported in the low 60 th percentile. Similarly, separate educated guesses by three political analysts in the latter half of 2013 projected 56% to 62% for the ANC; 23% to 27% for the DA; and between 1% and 10% for the EFF. Other smaller key parties, like Agang, Cope, and the IFP, were allocated between 2% and 6%.

A shadow has also been cast on the country's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and its administration of the election following a finding by the Public Protector, akin to a government-wide inspector-general, that the chair of the IEC was guilty of \"maladministration and misconduct\" in a reportedly non-transparent IEC procurement case. Several opposition parties sued to have the chair, Pansy Tlakula, removed from office based on allegations that her leadership undermines the credibility of the IEC and of the May election. After an early May hearing in the case, however, the Electoral Court postponed further proceedings until June, meaning that Tlakula will administer the polls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Zuma/ANC Agenda: Policy Approaches and Challenges", "paragraphs": ["South Africa has made great socioeconomic strides since the end of apartheid, but popular expectations and demands for change remain high, and the country faces a raft of problems.

As the group most disadvantaged by apartheid, however, blacks continue to be the most impoverished portion of the population. Black access to education has grown substantially, as have black incomes, although massive gaps remain vis-a-vis whites. The range of other challenges that the country faces is diverse. According to analyses presented in a major 20-year national development plan (NDP) by the National Planning Commission (NPC), an executive branch entity:", "Unemployment and underemployment rates are very high; the quality of education, especially for the black majority, is poor; and South Africa remains a divided society, both socioeconomically and spatially (e.g., there are sharp rural-urban divides, and poor urban areas are often located at a distance from jobs, infrastructure, and public services), but most of all racially. Infrastructure is poorly located, inadequate, and under-maintained. Scaled-up investment in integrated freight and passenger transport systems, communication technology, and electricity generation and distribution systems is needed. Spatial divides hobble inclusive development; the poor often reside far from jobs, housing, infrastructure, and economic opportunity zones. Integrated urban and rural-urban planning investments are needed. The economy is unsustainably natural resource-intensive. Land, water, and mined commodity reserves are under stress, and climate change threats loom. Public health systems cannot meet demand or sustain quality services, and compete with the private sector for trained workers and other resources. Public services have been scaled up but cannot meet demand. Quality is also uneven and often poor, in part due to political rather than professional management and a lack of accountability structures. Public corruption levels are high, partly due to weak, abuse-prone financial and procurement systems; lack of capacity to monitor for and sanction abuses; and unequal wealth distribution.", "The NDP lays out detailed goals and plans for addressing the problems identified above, among many others, and has been endorsed by parliament. It tracks closely both with other short- to long-term government economic development plans and with the ANC's political and policy agendas, which closely inform and guide government action.

A wave of often violent mass labor strikes in 2012 was accompanied by a sharp rise in protests over inadequate township service delivery in 2012. At least 226 such protests occurred during the first eight months of 2012 and, as with labor protests, many were violent. Such protests have been common for many years but have steadily risen. Ineffective police responses or other actual or perceived failures by the criminal justice system have also often been the focus on local protests in recent years. In some instances, protests turn into acts of vigilante justice (e.g., lynchings and extra-judicial mob beatings or killings of suspected criminals).

The same is true of the ANC's reportedly often politicized management of public goods and services, which frequently appears to financially benefit its local or national leaders, their kin, or associates. Such practices and the local political violence that they may generate are a reflection of the dearth of economic opportunities for blacks. For blacks with limited education and job prospects, local government posts gained through party ties may be one of the few ways out of poverty. Such actions often breed antipathy, however.

In addition, it is common for perpetrators of crimes like robbery to aggravate such acts by also violently assaulting, raping, or killing their victims. Explanations for such brutality vary, and often trace the culture of violence among criminals to a mix of factors. These include norms formed under the apartheid system, including resistance to state repression and the widespread use of personal small arms; continuing stark socioeconomic disparities; patriarchal social mores and gender inequality; and other self-replicating norms of violence. Among violent crimes, the rape of women and children is very common, and rape and murder also features in identity-based hate crimes targeting sexual minorities.

Two other crimes in early 2013 also drew global attention to issues of gender violence and police misconduct in South Africa, the most high-profile being the killing by double leg amputee Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius of his girlfriend, which many women's rights activists have viewed as a crime of gender violence. ", "Police misconduct incidents, ranging from serious human rights abuses\u2014including torture and targeted killings \u2014to high-level corruption to lesser misconduct, such as roadside bribery and absenteeism, are part of a trend, according to many observers and many media reports. Such problems reportedly have multiple roots. Management challenges are a key factor, in part because the SAPS is a large, nationally dispersed force of about 200,000 personnel. Other factors include training deficits, partially arising from a wave of post-apartheid hiring; a purported code of silence regarding internal misconduct reporting; and the residual effects of repressive apartheid-era police practices. Abuses also stem from a hardnosed policing culture that appears to be a reaction to the highly violent crime context that officers confront daily. Despite problems of misconduct, the SAPS reportedly has a core of well-trained officers and a number of highly specialized units, notably the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, a serious organized and commercial crime and high-level corruption unit.

Demonstrating strikers, mostly NUM members, were then assaulted by NUM officers, leaving two strikers fatally shot. Days of running clashes with police and mine security guards ensued, resulting in 10 reported deaths.

The Zuma government later dropped the charges in the face of harsh criticism. The police were further criticized after investigations suggested that some of the dead protesters had been shot in the back and or were killed at a distance from the main protest site. The massacre is the subject of a broad-ranging official commission of inquiry that remained active in early 2014. After the killings, workers and their relatives at the site continued to strike for several weeks and there were further non-fatal clashes with police.

Such investments support infrastructure construction, job skills training, public works and service jobs, and selected private sector projects determined to have the potential to increase employment and enhance economic productivity. In late 2010, the Zuma Administration launched a medium-term growth strategy, the New Growth Path . Its centerpiece is an industrial policy aimed at expanding economic output, creating 5 million new jobs, and reducing unemployment from 25% to 15% by 2020. It targets large public infrastructure investments in five key areas: energy, transport, communication, water, and housing. It also funds investment and human resource development programs aimed at increasing jobs and output in the \"green economy\" (solar, wind, and biofuels industries); agriculture; manufacturing; tourism and other services; and mining. It calls for the creation of a state mining firm focused on value-added processing and \"enhanced resource exploitation in competition with a strong private mining sector.\" It also calls for state fiscal discipline and emphasizes diverse roles for the private sector. Some aspects of the new strategy, including proposals to cap wages and bonuses, have met with objections from unions and from business interests, which fear that private sector pay bonus caps may deter FDI. ", "Spending on such infrastructure and capital investment projects, along with institution capacity-building projects, is forecast to total about $97 billion over the next three years and $600 billion over the next decade. Increasing public expenditures are reflected in South Africa's first-ever trillion-plus Rand (about $150 billion) budget in its 2012/2013 budget year. The government has also suggested that it may expand the role of state development finance institutions in funding its agenda, although most spending is set to come from state agencies' operating capital and 30% from the open market. This agenda has left private industry unsure of its role in the government's plans and has led business interest groups to call for the creation of infrastructure-focused public-private partnerships. Critics have also questioned whether state agencies and parastatals (partially or wholly publicly owned commercial entities) are up to the job, in light of factors such as massive state project delays, cost overruns, and failures to expend funding allocated for infrastructure construction. State efforts to access financing to fund public investments could be hindered by labor unrest and corruption. In late 2012, these factors helped spur country economic risk rating downgrades or warnings (e.g., by Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch), which may make public investment financing more expensive, and potentially prompt the government to seek funding from international financial institutions or non-Western lenders, such as China.

", "Implementation of BEE goals is mandatory for public entities. The government promotes private sector investment in BEE goals by working with industries to set up sector-specific transformation best practice \"charters\" and \"sector codes,\" but the main tool for fostering attainment of BEE goals is BEE scorecards, which assess a business's attainment of a range of benchmarks. BEE scorecards are used as eligibility criteria in public procurement, some forms of licensing, participation in public-private partnership deals and transactions (e.g., sales of state-owned assets), tax preferences, public company stock listings, and other matters of economic concern to firms. Higher scores can be attained if a firm's suppliers meet BEE goals, a measure aimed at using business demand to drive private sector adoption of BEE policies. There are some exemptions from BEE policies for small firms. For larger and more complex firms, BEE compliance is highly legalistic and is accompanied by paperwork-intensive reporting requirements.

After the transition to majority rule, most of this land remained in white hands. To address these challenges, the government initiated a series of land reform programs. One key set of programs has sought to compensate those dispossessed of land during apartheid through a mix of land restitution, financial compensation, and resettlement aid. Another has centered on efforts to achieve more racially equitable land distribution by redistributing state-owned land, some purchased from whites, to blacks and other non-white groups that had suffered apartheid-era economic discrimination. Some land transfers also involve the provision of financing, training, and farm extension services to land transfer recipients, in order to help them make their holdings economically viable and spur economic growth.", "For the most part, transferred land has been bought by the state from white sellers under a constitutionally grounded, so-called \"willing buyer, willing seller\" principle under which mutually acceptable land sale prices are negotiated. Private sales have also contributed to a growing number of transfers. Most restitution claims have reportedly been settled, but programs to aid land transfer recipients have also come under criticism for being administratively inefficient or underfunded. Land transfers have often been burdened by complex legal proceedings, in part due to differences between land sellers and buyers over property values. As a result of the slow redistribution process, there have been periodic calls for a more active approach to state redistribution land acquisitions, potentially including forced sales or even uncompensated seizures, akin to the situation in Zimbabwe. ", "For the most part, the South African government has to date resisted such proposals, opting instead to hasten sales through changes to administrative and legal procedures. At its 2012 party conference, however, the ANC resolved to pursue a new \"radical\" land reform program. Among other objectives, it would devote larger financial resources to existing land reform efforts; reopen the land restitutions claims process; and \"expedite\" enactment of a proposed Expropriation Act, a bill that could facilitate a greater number of compulsory state \"public interest\" purchases of land from unwilling sellers. It would do so by allowing factors other than market value (e.g., current property uses and acquisition history; relative state and private investments in the property, if any; and the intended purpose of an expropriation) to be used to define \"just and equitable\" pricing of transferred land. ", "How such reforms might affect the pace of future land transfers is unclear, both because transfers could still be legally contested, and because bureaucratic inefficiencies may continue to hinder reform programs. The ANC is pursuing these aims via several vehicles, however. In early 2014, a bill known as the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment was passed. It re-establishes a process for lodging land rights restitution claims relating to apartheid-era land seizures. Such claims had previously been permitted until 1999; new ones will now be permitted until 2019. A state estimate projects that about 379,000 new land claims will be made under the extended deadline and cost the state R179 billion, raising questions over how new claims would be funded; the current annual budget for this purpose is reportedly about R3 billion. Under another proposed law, the Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill, owners of land expropriated by the state could potentially receive less than market value for their property and lose the right to sue for ensuing damages, and would be subject to a state-determined payment schedule. In certain cases where the state does not appropriate land, but merely acts as a custodian of it, owners might receive no compensation.

According to the FY2015 CBJ, such programs are slated to center on \"detection, identification, inspection, interdiction, and prosecution of illicit transfers of WMD and WMD-related items and technologies\" and strengthening of South African \"licensing implementation and government-to-industry outreach capabilities.\" A small number of South African officers receive DOD Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program training. The DOD humanitarian assistance program undertakes small school construction projects; carries out a military HIV/AIDS Program under PEPFAR; and sponsors medical and engineering civic action field program exercises. ", "Since 2005, South Africa has received peacekeeping training under the U.S. Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance program (ACOTA). The SANDF also participates with the U.S. forces in multiple annual cooperative bilateral and regional military training exercises. These focus mainly on maritime and border security, peacekeeping training, and military humanitarian/civic action. In 2005, South Africa and the New York National Guard (NG) formed the first U.S. NG State Partnership Program (SPP) partnership in Africa, which focuses on mutually beneficial capacity-building programs. DOD also regularly supports South Africa's biennial African Aerospace Defense Exhibition. The major forum for U.S.-South African security cooperation coordination is the U.S.-South Africa Defense Committee (DEFCOM), formed in 1997. The Pentagon hosted an annual DEFCOM meeting in September 2012."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Outlook", "paragraphs": ["South Africa appears likely to remain politically stable for the foreseeable future. Still, dissatisfaction among miners, unemployed youth, township residents, and others concerned with government performance, crime, and corruption could lead to localized volatility and unrest. Such discontent could also translate into weakened political support for the ANC and political opportunities for opposition parties. The 2014 elections will serve as a test of the ANC's political dominance and the relative depth of the challenges it faces, and gauge public support for the ANC's wide-ranging policy agenda and state-led economic and political vision for the country. ", "Despite significant challenges, South Africa's economy is large and diversified, and appears to have the capacity to expand moderately in the coming years. The IMF projects a slight uptick in real growth in 2013, to 2.8%, and then to 4.1% in 2014. Given South Africa's economic linkages to and investment in sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa may also benefit as other African economies continue to expand. Trade with the United States is likely to grow. South Africa is making a range of large-scale public infrastructure investments, which could help boost economic growth. Such spending could, however, gradually become a burden on the state, which is facing revenue limitations and must balance infrastructure spending goals with a need to finance education, healthcare, and other social services.", "South Africa may gradually increase as a U.S. investment and export destination, due to South African demand and regional economic growth; increasing U.S. government and private sector efforts to expand trade and investment ties; and opportunities created by South Africa's infrastructure investment initiatives. U.S.-South African ties are growing closer in other areas as well; under the two countries' Strategic Partnership, there have been an increasing number of high-level exchanges and visits. Over the medium term, one question for policy makers will be how, if at all, the nature and level of relatively large levels of U.S. aid in the healthcare sector\u2014specifically to counter HIV/AIDS\u2014should change, in light of shared U.S. and South African government plans to transition to a situation in which South Africa funds most of its own HIV/AIDS programs.
