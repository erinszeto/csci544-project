Encryption uses the art of cryptography to change information which can be read (plaintext) and make it so that it cannot be read (ciphertext). Decryption uses the same art of cryptography to change that ciphertext back to plaintext. Encryption takes five elements to work: plaintexts, keys, encryption methods, decryption methods, and ciphertexts. Data that are in a state of being stored or in a state of being sent are eligible for encryption. However, data that are in a state of being processed\u2014that is being generated, altered, or otherwise used\u2014are unable to be encrypted and remain in plaintext and vulnerable to unauthorized access.", "Purposes of Encryption", "Today, encryption is as ubiquitous as the devices that connect to the Internet. Encryption is a tool that information security professionals and end users alike can employ to ensure that the data in their custody remain confidential to only those who are authorized to access the data. It also helps to ensure that data is accessed as the authorized users intend, and not altered by a third party.", "Strong encryption helps users around the world trust the systems and data they are using, thereby facilitating the transactions that allow society to operate, such as economic activity, control of utilities, and government. This is important because the world has become more connected, and attackers have become more persistent and pervasive. It is difficult to overemphasize the extent to which Internet-connected systems are under attack. But the frequency with which data breaches are exposed in the news media can act as an indicator of the prevalence of active exploitations. Encryption is a tool used to thwart attempts to compromise legitimate activity and national security.", "Major Issues", "However, encryption has posed challenges to law enforcement and elements of national security. Strong encryption sometimes hinders law enforcement's ability to collect digital evidence and investigate crimes in the physical world. As more real world transactions are conducted via digital means and adversaries continue to perpetrate crimes, this problem may become more pronounced. There are multiple sides to the encryption debate, but the sides generally reduce to two main parties: those who favor cryptosystems built as strongly as possible, and those who favor cryptosystems built with the opportunity for access if necessary and approved by a judicial authority.", "Encryption has created new issues for end users, as well. The technology was adopted rapidly, and users were not afforded the same opportunities to alter their habits as with the more steady adoption of technologies in the past. With the quick adoption of encryption, users left themselves more vulnerable to being unable to access or share their own data, for instance in the event that they forget the key or lack a way to share that key.", "One proposal to alleviate concerns over access to encrypted data by law enforcement includes mandating access for law enforcement while retaining strong encryption. However, this proposal undermines how encryption systems are built by introducing some extraordinary access into the system beyond the direct access of the user. This proposal carries risk as it creates an attack vector which adversaries of all types could seek to exploit. The increased risk raises the possibility that a persistent adversary will be able to circumvent the protections put in place to allow limited access and compromise the data and systems in use.

However, many modern encryption implementations use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES was developed as a result of a call for proposals from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and once publicly scrutinized, it was accepted as a standard by the Department of Commerce in 2001. Many cryptosystems today use AES as the method for how data are substituted and transposed to ensure security.

This second technique is common in securing website connections.", "Depending on the implementation of the cryptosystem, the key may be the password (or passphrase or passcode). Or, it could be an element necessary to generate the key used in the cryptosystem, as is the case with the iPhone. In the iPhone's cryptosystem, the user generated passcode is combined with the phone's unique identifier to create the key each time the passcode is entered. In this system, the key is not stored on the device.", "The secrecy of the key is a crucial element that ensures a cryptosystem is secure. An adversary may intercept the ciphertext and know the encryption standard in use on that system. However, the key will remain a secret, and as a result, so too will the ciphertext.

Intermediaries may become the target of a variety of attacks. Hackers will seek to circumvent any security put in place to protect the keys, seeking to reap the payload of an unknown trove of users' keys\u2014and data. It is also foreseeable that governments may use the range of tools at their disposal (espionage, legal, economic, etc.) to obtain the keys. The use of an intermediary to reserve encryption keys arguably creates a weakness by which all users may have their data compromised. Current strong cryptosystems limit knowledge of the key to only the creator of the key (and with whomever that user decides to share their key). Creating one or more repositories for keys (the escrow) increases the opportunities for the keys to become known.

Proponents of this structure suggest that those holding the pieces of a key must independently agree, and in a majority, to allow access to data.

And public keys are held by trusted third parties which provide access to those keys when requested so that users may use them on demand. An example of this is when a user connects to a website via Hypertext Transfer Protocol-Secure (HTTPS). To enable the secure connection to the website, a user starts the process by sending a request to the site. The site would then send their public key to the user, and the user's computer would then generate a new key (to be used in the HTTPS connection), encrypt it with the website's public key and send that back. The user knows that only the website that has the private key could decrypt the information the user just sent.

If such a weakness exists, anyone with the capability to exploit the weakness will have access to the information. It is unlikely that any single party will remain the sole user of a backdoor. Because of the increased amount of information generated with computer systems, and the connectedness of those systems, the systems are inherently a target for illegitimate access.

", "In addition to having a mathematically sound standard to use for the encryption and decryption method, using very large prime numbers (numbers that are divisible only by themselves and one) in the algorithm is necessary to ensure that the secret key remains undiscoverable. If a number other than a prime number is used, the adversary may be able to use factors of that number (a pair of numbers that may be multiplied to generate a new number) to generate a key. That is, if a divisible number is used, the adversary may chance upon the solution by finding two other numbers that are factors of the chosen number. This is otherwise known as a \"collision.\" Such primes are so large that they are not written out in character form but are represented exponentially, such as 2 44,497 -1. Additionally, strong ciphers are necessary. Such strong ciphers use 128 bits and 256 bits of data in modern encryption. And finally, large key bit length is necessary to ensure that adversaries cannot compute a key through a brute force attack. A weakness in any one of those elements\u2014the mathematics behind the standard, the key bit length, the key itself, or the prime numbers used\u2014can compromise the cryptosystem, either in its entirety or for a group of users.

In this type of attack, the adversary has encrypted data and its corresponding plaintext and tries to determine the key. 3. Attack ing chosen plaintexts . In this type of attack, the adversary selects plaintexts to be enciphered with a cryptosystem and receives the resulting ciphertexts.

A practically uncrackable system is one in which trying to attack a system using brute force\u2014that is, guessing every possible iteration of the key until the key is discovered\u2014cannot accomplish the goal within any usable amount of time. Cryptosystems are built to require processors to run through multiple instructions and multiple iterations of those instructions before something is encrypted or decrypted. Those iterations require time. Strong cryptosystems, using strong keys, would require multiple times the age of the universe to discover a key with today's computing power. ", "Because of the large amount of possibilities, those seeking to use a brute-force attack do not just start at zero and add characters until they get to the key. Instead, they attack other elements of the system. For instance, knowing that users choose simple passwords, the attacker could start guessing likely options to greatly reduce the time to find the key. ", "Or, an attacker could circumvent a cryptosystem entirely and insert themselves between the user and the information they are accessing. Data can only be encrypted while at rest (stored) or in transit (being sent). While a user accesses the data, or is otherwise processing the data, it is in plaintext. So, rather than try to compromise the cryptosystem, an attacker may determine that it is better to compromise the device that is employing the cryptosystem (e.g., the computer or the cell phone). If the attacker puts malicious software on the device that allows them access to what the user is viewing, they could see what the user intends to encrypt before the cryptosystem is activated. ", "So, although the encryption is still sound, it does not protect against other forms of attack. In this scenario, the attacker would have access to the unencrypted data on the device. So, if the device in question is a corporate laptop that uses full-disk encryption, when the user logs in and connects to a network, the laptop's contents are decrypted and available to the attacker.

Conversely, the public debate has also lacked specific information on how strong, end-to-end encryption has stymied security activities and put the public at risk. Without this specific information, the public is generally unable to accurately determine the risk presented by encryption, or the lack of it. Instead, the debate is informed by extreme cases which present dire scenarios from which to form a position, but which may not accurately reflect the risk involved."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Information Security", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, individual users are under constant attack online from adversaries near and far. The ease with which attacks can be carried out, regardless of geographic location, further exasperates information security professionals. Encryption is a tool information security professionals and end-users can employ to ensure the data under their care remains confidential and its integrity remains intact.", "The systems users rely upon are under similar attack. Some of these systems govern life-sustaining and life-saving applications, such as wireless medical devices. Pervasive encryption within these systems helps ensure the trustworthiness of those systems. ", "Additionally, any system that stores a key would also be vulnerable to an insider threat. An insider, or authorized user or employee, is a threat to such a system because they have legitimate access to the system. Insiders can violate security policies and compromise the security of a system unintentionally or intentionally.", "However, information security costs users in both time and computing power. Users also lose opportunities for their information to become available to loved ones or investigators if they are a victim and unable to provide the information.

Without a balance between the advances in technology and government capabilities, some argue that law enforcement agencies at all levels are unable to enforce the rule of law through effective investigations. With this perceived imbalance, crimes online (such as child pornography and financial thefts) and crimes against online infrastructure (such as ransomware and denial of service attacks) will arguably go un- or under-investigated.

The discussion has generally not addressed the level of criminal activity that may go un- or under-investigated (through evidence being encrypted or otherwise) for the government to still maintain the rule of law.

The Burr-Feinstein draft, otherwise titled the \"Compliance with Court Orders Act of 2016,\" would require a provider of computing services to either decrypt a communication or assist the government in decrypting the message in compliance with a court order. Under this proposal, a judge could issue a court order invoking this act in one or more of the following cases: (a) the crime resulted in or threatened death or serious bodily harm; (b) foreign intelligence, espionage and terrorism; (c) crimes against minors; (d) violent felonies; (e) serious Federal drug crimes; or (f) the state equivalents of any of the above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What other policy options have been discussed to address encryption?", "paragraphs": [" Continue to allow the courts to develop case law on encryption . This status quo option would continue to allow cases such as the one concerning the San Bernardino iPhone to come up in courts. But after a few years of this strategy both the government and the technology community are coalescing around a view that Congress legislate on the matter of the availability of encryption and law enforcement's access to encrypted communications, in order to provide uniformity and certainty. Additionally, some have suggested that barring congressional action, market forces and other stakeholders (such as other governments) would be in a position to drive policy. Force platforms to maintain a way to access the plaintext of data. Rather than focus on the users, this proposal would focus on the platform itself. In this reference, a platform is the suite of hardware, software, or databases that support the service being used (e.g., the Messages application for Apple, Inc. devices). This would allow a solution to arrive at scale, that is, for many users at once, since the providers of the encryption service would build in a mechanism to read plaintexts of data using their platform rather than rely on the individual compliance from users. However, this proposal would, by its nature, introduce a weakness in the security of that platform, one which would likely become the target for adversaries. Although the solution would apply across all users for legitimate access, it would be equivalent to providing adversaries with the opportunity to access the data for all users. One example of this proposal is for platforms to act as administrators of devices or services they provide, and use their administrator access to provide data to law enforcement. Improve the government's ability to investigate and extract digital evidence. This proposal was offered by Susan Landau, a professor in cybersecurity policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in testimony to the House Judiciary Committee. In this proposal, the U.S. government would invest in research, capabilities, and capacity to continue to carry out investigations despite any technology employed which may act as a hindrance to the investigation. The cost of such an investment is unknown. Create \"compelled disclosure\" laws. Otherwise known as \"key disclosure laws,\" this proposal would make it a criminal penalty to fail to produce plaintext versions of documents requested by law enforcement when asked for data held by someone with access. Australia implemented such a law. However, such a law would likely face Constitutional challenges. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
