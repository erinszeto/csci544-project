The Bush Administration has furthertightened restrictions on travel for family visits, other categories of travel, and on sending privatehumanitarian assistance to Cuba. While there appears to be broad agreement on the overall objectiveof U.S. policy toward Cuba -- to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island,there are several schools of thought on how to achieve that objective. Some advocate maximumpressure on the Cuban government until reforms are enacted; others argue for lifting some U.S.sanctions that they believe are hurting the Cuban people.

The case generated anoutpouring of emotion among the Cuban population as well as in south Florida.", "Wet Foot/Dry Foot Policy. Since the 1995migration accord, the U.S. Coast Guard has interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea and returned themto their country, while those deemed at risk for persecution have been transferred to Guantanamo andthen found asylum in a third country. Those Cubans who reach shore are allowed to apply forpermanent resident status in one year, pursuant to the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-732). This so-called \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy has been criticized by some as encouraging Cubans to risktheir lives in order to make it to the United States and as encouraging alien smuggling. Othersmaintain that U.S. policy should welcome those migrants fleeing Communist Cuba whether or notthey are able to make it to land. ", "U.S. prosecution against migrant smugglers in Florida has increased in recent years withnumerous convictions. There have been several violent incidents in which Cuban migrants havebrandished weapons or in which Coast Guard officials have used force to prevent Cubans fromreaching shore. In July 2003, a U.S. federal court in Florida convicted a Cuban national for hijackinga plane to Key West on April 1, 2003. Another six Cubans were convicted in Key West inDecember 2003 for hijacking a Cubana Airlines plane to Florida in March 2003.", "The Cuban government has taken forceful action against individuals engaging in aliensmuggling. Prison sentences of up to three years may be imposed against those engaging in aliensmuggling, and for incidents involving death or violence, a life sentence may be imposed. On April11, 2003, the Cuban government executed three men who had hijacked a ferry in Havana on April2 in an attempt to reach the United States. The ferry hijacking had been preceded by the hijackingof two small planes to the United States. The summary execution prompted worldwidecondemnation of the Cuban government. The Cuban government maintained that it took the actionto prevent additional hijackings.", "The U.S. Interest Section in Havana has officers that visit the homes of returned migrants toassess the Cuban government's treatment of those repatriated. The Department of State (pursuantto P.L. 105-277 , Section 2245) makes a semi-annual report to Congress on the methods employedby the Cuban government to enforce the the 1994 migration agreement and on the Cubangovernment's treatment of those returned. In the most recent report to Congress, submitted in May2004, the State Department noted that it has been unable to monitor returnees outside Havana sinceMarch 2003. The State Department noted, however, that prior to that time, \"a majority of thereturnees it monitored did not suffer retribution from the Cuban authorities as a result of theirattempt to depart illegally\" but noted that \"there continued to be clear and credible instances ofharassment and punishment of returnees.\" (72) ", "On July 21, 2003, the U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 15 Cubans who had been interdicted ona Cuban government vessel that had been stolen on July 15 (12 of the Cubans were involved instealing the boat and overpowered the three others who were guarding the government vessel.) TheUnited States returned the Cubans after assurances from the Cuban government that no one wouldface execution and no one would serve more than 10 years in prison. The Cuban government laudedthe return of the migrants for being in line with the 1995 migration agreement. The repatriation ofthe migrants prompted widespread criticism of the Administration in Florida and among someMembers of Congress. Some critics called for an investigation into the U.S.-Cuban negotiations thatled to the return of the migrants and some have called for the Administration to change the policyof repatriating those Cubans interdicted at sea. Supporters of the policy maintained thatimplementation of the migration accords is important for preventing another mass exodus of Cubansfleeing to the United States.", "On October 10, 2003, the President announced that the United States would increase thenumber of new Cuban immigrants each year, improve the method of identifying refugees, redoubleefforts to process Cubans seeking to leave Cuba, and initiative a public information campaign inFlorida and Cuba to better inform Cubans of the routes to safe and legal migration to the UnitedStates. The President's announcement was in part a response to the criticism of the Administration'smigration policy in the aftermath of the July 2003 repatriation of several Cubans involved in stealinga Cuban government vessel. ", "Migration Talks. Semi-annual U.S.-Cuban talks(held alternatively between Cuba and the United States) had been held regularly on theimplementation of the 1994 and 1995 migration accords, but the State Department cancelled the 20thround of talks scheduled for January 8, 2004. According to the State Department, Cuba has refusedto discuss five issues identified by the United States: (1) Cuba's issuance of exit permits to allqualified migrants; (2) Cuba's cooperation in holding a new registration for an immigrant lottery; (3)the need for a deeper Cuban port utilized by the U.S. Coast Guard for the repatriation of Cubansinterdicted at sea; (4) Cuba's responsibility to permit U.S. diplomats to travel to monitor returnedmigrants; and (5) Cuba's obligation to accept the return of Cuban nationals determined to beexcludable from the United States. (73) ", "In response to the cancellation of the talks, Cuban officials maintained that the U.S. decisionwas irresponsible and that it was prepared to discuss all of the issues raised by the UnitedStates. (74) The last timetalks were suspended was in 2000 by the Cuban government when Elian Gonzalez was in the UnitedStates. The cancellation of the talks has increased concern among those in Cuba seeking visas tomigrate legally.", "Excludables. Under a 1984 U.S.-Cubanmigration accord, Cuba agreed to take back 2,746 so-called excludables, criminal alines and mentallyill people, who had arrived in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. To date, Cuba has taken back over 1,600 ofthose on the 1984 list. Another issue in U.S.-Cuban relations is the return of Cubans in the UnitedStates not on the 1984 list who are no longer eligible to remain in the United States because ofcriminal offenses. Over 900 Cubans reportedly fall into this category, and Cuba will not accept theirreturn. (The Supreme Court announced in January 2004 that it wold rule on whether the federalgovernment can indefinitely imprison Cubans and other immigrants who have finished their prisonsentences but whose home countries will not accept their return.) (75) The United States hasproposed a technical working group from both governments to explore options that would allow forthe return of some of these excludables.
