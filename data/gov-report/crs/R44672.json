Uruguay's decision to grant refugee status to six individuals who had been detained at the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 2014 also has drawn congressional scrutiny.

This economic weakness has depressed tax collection and contributed to growing fiscal deficits but has not brought down Uruguay's persistently high inflation. V\u00e1zquez has sought to address these economic challenges by reducing expenditures, increasing taxes, holding down wage increases, and investing in infrastructure through public-private partnerships.

This policy mix, combined with a boom in international prices for Uruguay's agricultural commodity exports, produced several years of strong economic growth and considerable improvements in living standards.

The coalition has positioned Uruguay on the leading edge of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Latin America by allowing LGBT individuals to serve openly in the military, legalizing adoption by same-sex couples, allowing individuals to change official documents to reflect their gender identities, and legalizing same-sex marriage. Additionally, the Broad Front has legalized abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy and has enacted legislation that legalizes and regulates every aspect of the cannabis market, from production to consumption (see \" Security Concerns and Marijuana Legalization ,\" below).

The World Bank now classifies Uruguay as a \"high-income\" country. The poverty rate, which had spiked during a 1999-2002 economic and financial crisis, has fallen dramatically. Between 2004 and 2015, the percentage of Uruguayans living in poverty declined from 39.9% to 9.7%. Some groups continue to face more challenging circumstances, however, as nearly 22% of Afro-Uruguayans remain below the poverty line. In relative terms, Uruguay's middle class is the largest in Latin America, encompassing 60% of the population.", "Although President V\u00e1zquez sought to build on Uruguay's socioeconomic advancements with campaign pledges to improve the quality of the education system and create a Comprehensive National Care System to address the needs of infants, the disabled, and the elderly, he has spent much of his second term dealing with the country's deteriorating economic situation. Uruguay's economic growth decelerated to less than 1% in 2015, down from 3.2% in 2014 and 4.6% in 2013. The economy is expected to continue slowing in 2016, with 0.1% growth. The slowdown appears to be largely the result of external conditions, including declines in international prices for Uruguay's agricultural commodity exports and economic recessions in Argentina and Brazil, which are two of Uruguay's top trading partners as fellow members of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) customs union. ", "The economic deceleration has depressed revenue collection and contributed to growing fiscal deficits. In 2015, Uruguay's annual deficit widened to 3.6% of GDP and general government gross debt climbed to 64.3% of GDP. The labor market has remained relatively strong, but between August 2014 and August 2016 unemployment increased from 6.7% to 7.7% and the labor force participation rate declined slightly. Despite this economic weakness and low international energy prices, annual inflation has risen above the Uruguayan Central Bank's target range of 3%-7%. Persistent high inflation is reportedly the result of various factors, including the depreciation of the Uruguayan p eso and the country's widespread practice of indexing wages to the cost of living. ", "The V\u00e1zquez Administration has taken steps to respond to these challenges. To reduce the fiscal deficit to 2.5% of GDP by 2019 and stabilize public-debt levels, the government has deferred some public spending and introduced a fiscal reform that aims to increase income taxes on middle- and high-income earners and to reduce corporate tax exemptions and tax evasion. The V\u00e1zquez Administration also has sought to reduce inflationary pressures by using its position on tripartite salary councils to hold down wage growth. At the same time, the government is attempting to boost economic growth by using public-private partnerships to invest $12 billion over four years in transportation, communications, energy, and port infrastructure.", "These policy priorities have generated tension within the Broad Front. Some leftist legislators and a portion of the coalition's base opposes the V\u00e1zquez Administration's efforts to reduce government expenditures, increase taxes on middle-income earners, and limit cost-of-living wage adjustments. Some also oppose private-sector participation in public works. V\u00e1zquez has tried to convince Uruguayans that these policies are necessary to maintain the country's investment-grade credit rating, attract foreign investment, and keep inflation under control. Opponents have pushed back. In July 2016, for example, Uruguay's umbrella trade union, the PIT-CNT ( Plenario Inter s indical de Trabajadores-Convenci\u00f3n Nacional de Trabajadores ), which is closely affiliated with the Broad Front, organized the largest general strike since the country's return to democracy to push for higher wages and a reversal of the government's austerity policies. ", "Polls indicate that although most Uruguayans accept the V\u00e1zquez Administration's argument that economic adjustments are necessary, many are unsatisfied with the government's management of the economy. This discontent, combined with rising security concerns, has taken a toll on V\u00e1zquez's approval rating. Between July 2015 and October 2016, the percentage of Uruguayans approving of V\u00e1zquez's performance in office fell from 51% to 33% and the percentage of Uruguayan's disapproving of V\u00e1zquez's performance increased from 20% to 45%.

Nevertheless, perceptions of insecurity have increased in recent years, along with rates of crime and violence. Uruguay experienced a 5% increase in robberies and an 8% increase in homicides in 2015. Although crime rates remain low by Latin American standards, Uruguayans consistently rank crime as one of the top problems facing their country. Security analysts and Uruguayan officials have linked much of the criminality to small-scale drug trafficking and gang activity. ", "In response, the V\u00e1zquez Administration has increased police patrols in areas where crime is most concentrated and committed more resources to social development programs that provide opportunities to youth at risk of being recruited by gangs or other criminal elements. Additionally, the government has continued efforts under way since 2010 to incorporate new technologies and equipment into policing and investigatory practices, including expanded video surveillance, the use of geospatial technology to identify crime locations and deploy police resources, and the establishment of a DNA bank and a fingerprint-identification system.", "Uruguayan officials argue that the country's cannabis-legalization initiative also will improve security conditions by taking a market worth an estimated $30 million-$40 million out of the hands of drug traffickers and improving the government's ability to address the negative social, economic, and health impacts of drug use. The law, enacted in December 2013, allows Uruguayan citizens who are at least 18 years of age to register with the government to grow up to 480 grams of marijuana per year, purchase up to 40 grams of marijuana per month from licensed dispensaries, or join smoking clubs that provide marijuana for members. The law also empowers a new government agency to regulate the entire cannabis production chain, including planting, cultivation, harvesting, processing, storage, distribution, and sales. At the same time, the law provides for educational and health efforts to prevent and treat problematic drug use. Uruguay decriminalized all drug possession for personal use in 1974. ", "Although much of the marijuana legalization law has been implemented, the Uruguayan government is still finalizing a key component\u2014sales to registered users at licensed dispensaries. This step has proven challenging, as only 50 of the country's 1,200 pharmacies had registered with the government to sell marijuana as of August 2016. Moreover, most of those pharmacies are concentrated in the Montevideo metropolitan region, potentially leaving large portions of the country without a single dispensary. Many pharmacies reportedly are concerned that marijuana sales could generate security problems or damage their image among socially conservative clients. Polls have consistently found that about 60% of Uruguayans are opposed to the legalization initiative. Despite these challenges, sales are expected to begin before the end of 2016.", "Once implementation is complete, the Uruguayan government will face several challenges as it attempts to supplant the illegal marijuana market. Although state-regulated marijuana is expected to be competitive in price and superior in quality compared to illegal marijuana, the Uruguayan government has acknowledged that it may not be able to satisfy demand when sales first begin. Even once a sufficient supply of state-regulated marijuana exists, some users may turn to the black market to sidestep government caps on purchases. Additionally, many marijuana users may be hesitant to register with the government. According to a 2015 study of frequent marijuana users in Montevideo, 40% of those surveyed stated that they were unlikely to register. Some were concerned about the confidentiality of their information, some were philosophically opposed to the registry, and some did not think there was anything to be gained by registering. The extent to which legalization will impact the finances of drug traffickers and dealers likely will depend on the Uruguayan government's ability to bring marijuana users into the state-regulated market.", "During the debate over legalization, opponents warned that legalization would lead to increased consumption of marijuana and other drugs. Proponents, on the other hand, argued that creating legal channels for marijuana sales could facilitate efforts to treat those with the most problematic consumption habits and prevent Uruguayans from coming into contact with more dangerous drugs, such as \" pasta base ,\" a highly addictive cocaine derivative that some observers have linked to rising crime rates. In 2014 (the most recent year for which data are available), 9.3% of Uruguayans reported they had consumed marijuana in the previous year, up from 8.3% in 2011. It is unclear if the legalization initiative played a role in the increase, however, because marijuana consumption had been growing steadily since 2001. Increased marijuana consumption does not appear to have led to increased consumption of other drugs. In 2014, 1.6% of Uruguayans reported using cocaine in the previous year, down from 1.9% in 2011."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S.-Uruguayan Relations", "paragraphs": ["U.S.-Uruguayan relations are strong and have grown closer in recent years.
