The following report addresses these issues, and others, by providing a statistical overview of President Obama's nominees to U.S. circuit court of appeals and U.S. district court judgeships, current through May 31, 2012. Findings include the following:", "President Obama thus far in his presidency has nominated 41 persons to U.S. circuit court judgeships, 29 of whom have been confirmed. Of the 150 persons nominated thus far by President Obama to U.S. district court judgeships, 117 have been confirmed. The greatest number of President Obama's circuit court nominees have been confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (6) and the Second Circuit (5). The greatest number of President Obama's district court nominees have been confirmed to judgeships located within the Ninth Circuit (22) and the fewest to district court judgeships within the First Circuit (3). District court vacancies have grown in number over the course of the Obama presidency, from 42 judgeships vacant when President Obama took office to 59 at present. There currently are 13 circuit court vacancies (the same number as when President Obama took office). During the Obama presidency thus far, fewer circuit court nominees have been confirmed by the Senate than were confirmed during the first terms of any of the four preceding Presidents (Reagan through G.W. Bush). Likewise, fewer Obama district court nominees have been confirmed by the Senate than were confirmed during the first terms of the four preceding Presidents. President Obama is the only one of the three most recent Presidents to have begun his fourth year in office with more circuit and district court judgeships vacant than when he took office. During the Obama presidency, the average waiting time from nomination to committee hearing has been, thus far, 69.6 days for circuit court nominees and 83.2 days for district court nominees. During the Obama presidency, the average waiting time from Senate Judiciary Committee report to Senate confirmation has been 139.7 days for circuit court nominees and 105.1 days for district court nominees.", "Various factors might help explain differences or variation found in judicial appointment statistics across recent presidencies.", "A President's opportunities to make circuit and district court appointments will be affected by the number of judicial vacancies existing at the time he takes office, as well as by how many judges depart office, and how many new judgeships are statutorily created, during his presidency. The time taken by a President to select nominees for judicial vacancies may be affected by whether the selection of lower court nominees must compete with filling a Supreme Court vacancy, whether the selection process itself is a priority for a President, the level of consultation between a President and a nominee's home state Senators, and the time taken by home state Senators to make judicial candidate recommendations. Institutional and political factors which may influence the processing of judicial nominations by the Senate include ideological differences between the President and the opposition party in the Senate, the extent of interest group opposition to certain nominees, the presence or absence of \"divided government,\" the point in a congressional session when nominations arrive in the Senate, whether nominees have the support of both of their home state Senators, and whether the blue slip policy of the Senate Judiciary Committee requires the support of both home state Senators before a nominee can receive a hearing or committee vote."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The process by which lower federal court judges are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate has, in recent decades, been of continuing interest to Congress. During Senate debates in the 112 th Congress over judicial nominations, differing perspectives have been expressed about the relative degree of success of a President's nominees in gaining Senate confirmation, compared with nominees of other recent Presidents. Senate debate often has concerned whether a President's judicial nominees, relative to the nominees of other recent Presidents, encountered more difficulty or had to wait longer, before receiving consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee or up-or-down votes on confirmation. Of related concern to Congress have been increases in recent years in the number and percentage of vacant judgeships in the federal judiciary and the effect of delayed judicial appointments on judicial vacancy levels.

Bush.", "For confirmed circuit court nominees, the fewest days, on average, that elapsed from first committee report to confirmation occurred during the G.H.W. Bush presidency (i.e., 7.8 days). The mean number of days from first committee report to confirmation increased over 10 times from the G.H.W. Bush presidency to the Clinton presidency, from 7.8 to 82.2 days. From the Clinton presidency to the G.W. Bush presidency, the average waiting time for circuit court nominees from first committee report to confirmation increased slightly to 83.1 days, only to increase substantially, by nearly 57 days, under President Obama to an average (thus far) of 139.7 days.", "The median number of days from first committee report to confirmation also increased after President G.H.W. Bush but remained relatively short during the Clinton and G.W. Bush presidencies. The median line graph for circuit court nominees in Figure 5 shows that roughly half of President Clinton's 65 confirmed circuit court nominees (during his two terms) were confirmed within 14 days of their nominations being reported out of committee. Likewise, roughly half of President G.W. Bush's 61 confirmed circuit court nominees (during his two terms) were confirmed within 18 days of their nominations being reported. In contrast, President Obama has, thus far, had no circuit court nominees confirmed under 25 days of their nominations first being reported out of committee. Instead, the median number of days for President Obama's 29 confirmed circuit court nominees is 132.0, roughly 7.3 times greater than the median number of 18 days for the 61 confirmed circuit nominees of his immediate predecessor, President G.W. Bush.", "The average number of days that elapsed from first committee report to confirmation for circuit court nominees during the Clinton and G.W. Bush presidencies was noticeably greater than the median number of days experienced by these nominees for the report to confirmation stage. These differences reflect the fact that many noncontroversial nominees were confirmed relatively quickly after their nominations were reported out of committee (thus, pushing down the median figures) while a smaller number of cases stayed on the Senate Executive Calendar for relatively lengthy periods of time, and often involved multiple nominations of the same individual. These outliers (the nominees experiencing relatively lengthy waits between first report and confirmation) had a greater statistical effect on the average number of days between first report and confirmation than on the median number of days.", "As with President G.H.W. Bush's confirmed circuit court nominees, district court nominees during his presidency waited, on average, a shorter time from first committee report to confirmation (i.e., 4.6 days) than did the district nominees of the four other Presidents. The average number of days increased to 28.2 days during the Clinton presidency and to 37.5 days during the G.W. Bush presidency. During the Obama presidency, the average number of days, thus far, has increased further to 105.1 days as 42 (35.9%) of President Obama's 117 confirmed district court nominees waited at least 100 days from first committee report to confirmation.", "As Figure 5 shows, the median number of days between first committee report and confirmation of district court nominees by presidency also increased during this period, starting with the nominees of President G.H.W. Bush. From the low median of 1.0 days for nominees during the G.H.W. Bush presidency, the median increased to 8.0 days for Clinton district court nominees. It then increased about 2.6 times from the Clinton to G.W. Bush presidency, to 21.0 days, and about 4.3 times from the G.W.

According to CRS data, 5 (or 6.0%) of President Reagan's 83 confirmed circuit nominees and 1 (2.4%) of G.H.W. Bush's 42 circuit court nominees were approved by roll call votes.

Various factors influence the number of such opportunities a President will have during his tenure in office. One such factor, at the start of a presidency, will be the number of judicial vacancies already in existence (i.e., the judicial vacancies a President inherits when taking office). The number of inherited vacancies, in turn, will be influenced by various factors. These include the frequency with which judicial departures occur and new judgeships are statutorily created in the years or months immediately prior to the new presidency; the extent to which the outgoing President, during this same period, makes nominations to fill judicial vacancies; and the rate at which the Senate confirms these nominations before the new President takes office. ", "A large number of judicial vacancies created before the start of a new presidency might or might not result in many appointment opportunities for the incoming President. Much would depend on how prompt the previous President was in making nominations to fill newly created judicial vacancies and on how willing the Senate was to confirm those nominations. The different rate, for instance, at which the Senate confirmed district court nominations immediately prior to the G.W. Bush and Obama presidencies was one factor in how many district court appointment opportunities each President inherited upon taking office. During the presidential election year of 2000, 56 district court nominations were pending in the Senate, of which 31 (or 55.4%) were confirmed. In contrast, during the presidential election year of 2008, 37 district court nominations were pending in the Senate, of which 24 (64.9%) were confirmed. This variation contributed to differences in the number of appointment opportunities for Presidents G.W. Bush and Obama.", "Legislation creating new judgeships might also provide a new President with the opportunity to appoint a greater number of judges than he might have inherited. Legislation substantially increasing the number of authorized judgeships was enacted in 1978 (Omnibus Judgeship Act, P.L. 95-486 ); 1984 (Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act, P.L. 98-353 ); and 1990 (Federal Judgeship Act, P.L. 101-650 ). The large number of district court vacancies, for example, inherited by President Clinton contributed, in turn, to the relatively large number of district court confirmations during his presidency. The large number of district court vacancies inherited by President Clinton was, in part, the result of 74 new district court judgeships created by the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990.", "Over the course of a presidency, opportunities for a President to make circuit and district court appointments continue to be affected by the rate at which judges depart office (by taking senior status, retiring, resigning, or dying). During some presidencies, substantial new judicial appointment opportunities also have arisen because of the statutory creation of new circuit and district court judgeships. Both factors\u2014judicial departures and the statutory creation of new judgeships\u2014can, throughout a President's tenure, affect the number of persons nominated by the President and the number confirmed by the Senate.", "For example, a study found that, largely as a result of judges retiring from full-time service on the bench, President Obama was confronted during his first three years in office with more judicial vacancies than his two immediate predecessors:", "92 judges took senior status in the first three years of the Obama administration compared to 72 and 70 in the Clinton and Bush administrations' first three years.... Had district judges taken senior status in Obama's first three years at the same rate they did under Clinton or Bush, there would have been almost no increase in vacancies...."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Selection of Nominees by a President", "paragraphs": ["A variety of factors can affect how long a President takes to select a nominee to fill a judicial vacancy. These factors include how many individuals are involved in identifying and vetting potential nominees, the specific selection criteria a President desires to emphasize in identifying nominees, whether a Supreme Court vacancy occurs, and, if so, the resources devoted to filling that vacancy. A vacancy on the Supreme Court, for example, occurred early in both the Clinton and Obama Administrations, and in both instances, while the Administrations' searches were underway for a Supreme Court nominee, the Presidents sent few lower court nominations to the Senate.", "The level of consultation between a President and a nominee's home state Senators also can influence the President's pace in selecting nominees for judicial vacancies. Home state Senators traditionally play an important role in the selection of district and, to a lesser extent, circuit court judges. The pace might be slowed by communication or other difficulties between the President and those Senators who represent states with vacant federal judgeships. Additionally, if the home state Senators are themselves slow in recommending a candidate, or if they and the President cannot agree on a suitable candidate, the nomination of an individual to fill a vacant judgeship may be delayed.", "Another factor affecting a President's pace in selecting judicial nominees is the degree of priority he attaches to the process. According to one account, for example, judicial selection may not have been a priority for the Obama Administration during the 111 th Congress. \"The surest key to understanding the politics, processes, and outcomes of the Obama judicial selection record in the 111 th Congress,\" according to the account, is \"the recognition that judges were not seen as a priority by those closest to the President. Judicial selection was not a major focal point in the [A]dministration's legislatively driven domestic policy agenda, nor was it seen as a 'legacy' issue.\"", "Finally, the speed at which a President selects nominees might be influenced by the length of his Administration's vetting process. One recent study, for example, found that the time from vacancy to nomination during the first 14 months of the Obama Administration was longer than at the same point in the G.W. Bush Administration, especially for circuit court nominees. The greater time for President Obama to submit nominees, the study said, was likely due in part to the pre-nomination candidate vetting by the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. The G.W. Bush Administration, the study noted, chose not to have its judicial candidates rated by the ABA committee (prior to submitting them to Congress). By contrast, the Obama Administration \"brought the committee, and thus the additional 30 to 45 days typically consumed by its investigations, back into the pre-nomination stage.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Processing of Judicial Nominations by the Senate", "paragraphs": ["As in the nominee selection stage, the processing of judicial nominations by the Senate from first nomination to final Senate action is also affected by many institutional and political factors. Various studies, for example, have concluded that how long lower federal court nominees wait in the Senate confirmation process, from first nomination to final action, is affected by such factors as the extent of ideological differences between the President and the opposite party in the Senate, or of interest group opposition to certain nominees. Other factors cited were whether nominees had \"champions\" on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the point in a session when nominations arrived in the Senate, and the kind of ratings given nominees by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Some of these factors might also contribute to other features of the confirmation process discussed in this report, e.g., whether a nominee is ultimately confirmed, and, if so, whether he or she is confirmed by roll call vote rather than voice vote.", "The presence or absence of \"divided government\" (with the President and Senate majority of opposite political parties) also might influence the processing of judicial nominations by the Senate. One study concludes, however, that whether the President and Senate majority are of the same party or not, \"presidents continue to select judges according to the same criteria and the Senate confirms or does not confirm nominations according to the same criteria.\" Divided government, though, may affect the procedural strategies used to oppose a President's nominees. It has been suggested, for example, that Senators \"may rely on certain types of ... tactics during the confirmation process more or less depending on\" whether the party controlling the presidency is also the majority party in the Senate.", "Some factors might influence how quickly judicial nominations are processed at the committee level but not on the floor (and vice versa). For example, the role of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary in evaluating judicial candidates may be seen as a factor in the time that a circuit or district court nomination is pending in the Judiciary Committee (but not in the time that a reported nomination is pending on the Senate Executive Calendar). If the ABA committee's role is (as it usually has been over the decades) to evaluate judicial candidates before the President selects a nominee, then the ABA's evaluation does not add to the time between when the President makes a nomination and the Senate Judiciary Committee reports it. If, however, the ABA's role is (as it was during the G.W. Bush presidency) to evaluate only after a person has been nominated, then the time taken for that evaluation will add to the total time that the nomination is pending in the Judiciary Committee.", "Once a nomination has been reported from committee, the time taken until final Senate action might be influenced by political or other factors not present (or minimally so) at the committee level. Even if a nominee is non-controversial and received bipartisan support from the committee, significant delays in filling a judicial vacancy might occur when a judicial nomination, after being placed on the Executive Calendar, is blocked for one reason or another from floor consideration by Senators through the use of \"holds,\" or objections to unanimous consent requests.", "Finally, another factor that might affect the processing of judicial nominations by the Senate (and, thus, judicial confirmation statistics) is the blue slip policy of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as set by its chair. Under this policy, which dates back to at least 1917, the committee chair seeks the assessment of Senators regarding various nominations for offices in their states, including those for U.S. district court judgeships, U.S. circuit court judgeships, U.S. attorneys, and U.S. marshals.", "In practice, the chair sends a blue-colored form to both home state Senators regarding judicial nominations in their state. If a home state Senator has no objection to a nominee, the blue slip is returned to the chair with a positive response. If a Senator, however, has misgivings about the nominee and wants to stop or slow committee action, he or she can decide not to return the blue slip, delay returning it, or return it with a negative response. Most chairs of the Judiciary Committee have required a return of positive blue slips by both a state's Senators before allowing consideration of a nomination. ", "It should be noted, however, that the return of positive blue slips by both home state Senators does not always lead to a relatively speedy confirmation. In the 112 th Congress, circuit and district court nominations have been reported by the Judiciary Committee only after home state Senators returned positive blue slips for the nominations. Nevertheless, the average time in the current Congress during which circuit and district court nominations have been pending on the Senate Executive Calendar before being confirmed has reached historically high levels."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
