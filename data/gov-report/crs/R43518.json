Genetically engineered salmon have been modified to grow more quickly and to use feed more efficiently. However, some are concerned that, in this rapidly evolving field, current technological and regulatory safeguards are inadequate to protect the environment and ensure that these products are safe to eat.", "Nearly twenty years ago, AquaBounty Technologies Inc. began the application process to obtain FDA approval for a genetically engineered Atlantic salmon. In 2009, AquaBounty submitted the last required study for its new animal drug (NAD) application. The FDA is regulating GE Atlantic salmon as an NAD under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7321). An NAD is approved by the agency only after the drug is shown to be safe and effective. FDA has concluded that AquAdvantage Salmon is as safe as food from non-GE salmon and determined that there are no significant food safety hazards or risks associated with the product.", "Environmental concerns related to the development of GE salmon include the potential for competition and interbreeding with wild fish. According to some, escaped GE salmon could spawn with wild Atlantic salmon and introduce the modified genetic material to the wild population. To address these concerns, AquaBounty will produce salmon eggs (all sterile females) in Canada, ship these eggs to Panama, grow and process fish in Panama, and ship table-ready, processed fish to the United States for retail sale. Aquabounty will limit production to land-based facilities to isolate GE salmon from the environment and minimize the likelihood of harm to wild fish populations. Production from these facilities is limited to approximately 100 metric tons, which is a small fraction of the current U.S. fresh and frozen salmon supply of 700,000 metric tons.", "Some have asserted that FDA approval of AquAdvantage Salmon was overdue and that delays have hindered investment and development of the U.S. biotechnology sector. Others have questioned the adequacy of FDA's review of GE salmon and whether the existing approval process is equipped to fully evaluate the risks of this technology, especially potential environmental harm. Additional concerns have been voiced concerning food safety, labeling of GE salmon, and economic effects on existing wild salmon fisheries.", "In response to concerns related to the production and use of GE salmon as food, legislation has been introduced during the last several Congresses to restrict the production and require the labeling of GE organisms. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress related to labeling GE salmon specifically or to GE organisms generally includes H.R. 393, S. 738, H.R. 913, S. 511, and H.R. 1599.

H.R. 394 would prohibit most uses of GE fish, with some exceptions or if certain conditions are met. In addition to labeling requirements, S. 738 would require an environmental impact statement for any application to produce GE salmon intended for human consumption.

FDA also has proposed voluntary guidelines for using labels that indicate whether food products are derived from GE salmon. ", "By a broad definition, \"genetic modification\" refers to changes in an organism's genetic makeup that do not occur in nature. For millennia, farmers and scientists have modified the genetics of animals by selecting those individuals with desirable traits for further breeding. With the advent of modern biotechnology (e.g., genetic engineering or bioengineering), it is now possible to take a gene (or genes) for a specific trait from an organism and transfer it to another organism of a different species. For the purpose of FDA's guidance to industry, FDA defines genetically engineered (GE) animals as those animals modified by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), known as rDNA, techniques, including the entire lineage of animals that contain the modification. ", "Recombinant DNA techniques expand the range of traits that may be transferred to another organism and increase the speed and efficiency by which desirable traits may be incorporated into organisms. Desirable traits may reduce production costs and sometimes make the organism or products made from it more desirable to consumers. Genetically engineered plant varieties, such as herbicide-resistant corn and soybeans, have already been widely adopted by U.S. farmers. These techniques are now being used to develop genetically engineered organisms for the aquaculture industry.", "Approximately 50 species of fish have been subject to genetic modification and more than 400 fish/trait combinations have been developed. Fish and other marine organisms are being modified to reduce production costs of human food, to produce pharmaceuticals, to test water contamination, and for other uses. Fish are particularly attractive candidates for genetic engineering because they produce eggs in large quantities and their eggs are more easily manipulated because they are fertilized and develop externally. Aquaculture also supplies a rapidly expanding market of different seafood products. Countries with active research programs for genetically engineered fish include China, Cuba, India, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand. ", "Some have claimed that FDA's approval of GE salmon has been long overdue and the delays have been caused by political interference. They conclude that delays have hindered investment and development of the U.S. biotechnology sector. They also question whether biotechnology industries in the United States will be able to compete with companies in other parts of the world. Moreover, they hypothesize that the availability of GE salmon at relatively low prices could benefit consumers who are seeking low-fat and affordable options. ", "Development of GE fish has prompted some advocacy groups to raise a number of environmental concerns. For example, if fish are accidently released into the environment, they may spread and be difficult to contain. GE fish that escape to the wild could compete with wild fish and harm wild populations. Another concern is that GE fish may interbreed with wild fish and allow the modified genetic material to become assimilated into the wild fish population. Sterilization and bioconfinement have been proposed to isolate GE fish from wild fish populations. ", "Food safety concerns also have been expressed by consumer groups who question whether genetically modified organisms could pose unique hazards to public health. These groups also support mandatory labeling of GE products because they believe consumers have a right to make informed choices. ", "In addition, some in the fishing industry are concerned that greater efficiency in the aquaculture industry could harm salmon fisheries. Salmon farm production in the 1990s depressed salmon prices and affected fishing businesses and coastal communities that depend on wild fisheries. ", "In response to these concerns, legislation has been introduced during the last several Congresses to restrict the use and require the labeling of GE organisms. In the 114 th Congress, two bills have been introduced ( H.R. 393 and S. 738 ), which would require labeling of GE salmon. In addition, two more general bills ( H.R. 913 and S. 511 ) would require labeling of GE food products, including GE salmon. H.R. 1599 would preempt any state authority over GE labeling in favor of a voluntary National Genetically Engineered Food Certification Program under the federal Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. The certification program would establish national standards for labeling both GE and non-GE foods. Two FY2016 appropriations bills for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies ( S. 1800 and S. 2129 ) include provisions that would provide funds to implement labeling requirements for GE salmon. ", "H.R. 394 would prohibit most uses of GE fish, with some exceptions or if certain conditions are met. Applications for uses that would be prohibited under H.R. 394 would require an environmental assessment (EA) with a finding of no significant impact in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. 4321) or an environmental impact statement (EIS). The EIS also would be required to include analysis of the risk associated with the escape of GE fish. In addition to labeling requirements, S. 738 would require an EIS before approval of any application to produce GE salmon intended for human consumption.

Under the FFDCA, drugs are defined in Section 201(g) as \"articles intended for the use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function in the body of man or other animals.\"", "On January 15, 2009, CVM released its industry guidance for producers and developers of GE animals and their products. The guidance provides an approach to satisfy applicable statutes and regulations. The guidance states (on page 6): \"The rDNA construct in a GE animal that is intended to affect the structure or function of the body of the GE animal, regardless of the intended use of products that may be produced by the GE animal, meets the FFDCA drug definition.\"", "An NAD is assumed to be \"unsafe\" unless FDA has approved a new animal drug application (NADA) for that particular use, or the NAD is for investigational use and subject to an exemption from the drug approval requirement (among a few other specified exemptions). FFDCA and federal regulations describe information that must be submitted to FDA as part of NADAs. The industry guidance lays out the pre-market approval process, including the information required of applicants which fulfills the regulatory requirements. Required information is broken out into six categories, which include product identification, molecular characterization of the construct, molecular characterization of the GE animal lineage, phenotypic characterization of GE animal, genotypic and phenotypic durability assessment, and the food/feed safety and environmental safety assessments. ", "The food safety assessment includes examination of both the direct toxicity (including allergenicity) potential of food from a GE animal as well as any indirect toxicity. Food and feed will be considered safe if the composition of edible materials from the GE animal can be shown to be \"substantially equivalent\" to that from a non-GE animal. Therefore, if animals of the same or comparable type are commonly and safely consumed, there is a presumption that food from the GE animal is safe and the product will not have to be labeled.", "An FDA decision regarding an NADA is a federal action subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. 4321). NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the environmental consequences of an action before proceeding with it and to involve the public in its decision-making process. To demonstrate compliance with NEPA, federal agencies must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for federal actions anticipated to have \"significant\" impacts on the environment. The EIS is a detailed evaluation of the proposed action and provides opportunity for the public, other federal agencies, and outside parties to provide input into the process. In this case, the FDA is ultimately responsible for determining whether or not an EIS is necessary. ", "To assist the agency in making the determination of whether an EIS is necessary, an applicant for an NAD must submit documentation to support a claim for a categorical exclusion or for drafting a preliminary EA. Actions that, based on an agency's past experience with similar actions, have no significant impacts are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EA or EIS. If an EA is developed and it is found that the NAD would have no significant environmental impacts, the agency would issue a finding of no significant impact (FONSI). If the EA determines that the environmental consequences of an NAD are anticipated to be significant, an EIS is prepared. In cases where significant impacts are anticipated, the federal agency may decide to prepare an EIS without first preparing an EA.

This approach can limit the opportunity for public comment before approval. Some critics called for more transparency during the pre-market approval process for Aquadvantage Salmon.", "The FDA guidance does not require evaluation of genetically engineered organisms such as GE salmon as a food additive. A food additive is \"any substance, the intended use of which results directly or indirectly, in it becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food.\" Food additives require pre-market approval from FDA, unless the additive has been evaluated by scientific experts and determined to be \"generally regarded as safe\" (GRAS). If made subject to a food additive review, products such as GE salmon would have to undergo comprehensive toxicological studies.

USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) earlier had expressed its intention to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on GE animals, possibly in 2008. Instead, in concert with FDA's notice on its draft guidance, APHIS published, in the September 19, 2008, Federal Register , a request for information from the public and scientists on how GE animals might affect U.S. animal health.

The notion of \"substantial equivalence\" guides food labeling requirements; if a food containing GE material is \"substantially equivalent\" to a food not containing GE material, federal regulations do not require that it be labeled as containing GE material. When there is no material difference between products, FDA does not have the authority to require labeling on the basis of consumer interest alone. If there is a material difference between GE and non-GE foods, FDA could require such differences to be identified in food labeling. Companies that might wish to label their foods as not containing bioengineered products may do so, if they can definitively show that the foods do not contain GE products.", "Genetically engineered crops became commercially available in the mid-1990s. Generally, FDA has not found that food from GE organisms warrants different or greater safety concerns than non-GE organisms or exhibits different characteristics such as nutritional value or functional characteristics than from non-GE organisms. Today, oil from bioengineered soy and canola, soy protein, and high fructose corn syrup can be found in many manufactured foods, perhaps as high as 60%-70% of processed foods. The FDA has found most GE crops to be \"substantially equivalent\" to non-GE crops and approved their safety for human consumption in processed foods.", "In 1992, FDA published a policy statement on foods derived from new plant varieties, including those developed through genetic engineering. This policy statement did not establish any special labeling requirements for bioengineered foods as a particular class of foods. FDA stated that the agency had no basis for concluding that bioengineered foods differed in any meaningful way from non-bioengineered foods, and therefore had no basis for requiring that such foods be labeled. ", "Although the 1992 policy statement did not require special labeling for bioengineered foods, FDA did advise that any labeling requirements that apply to foods in general also apply to bioengineered foods. Under Section 201(n), the label of the food must reveal all \"material facts\" about the food. FDA currently requires special labeling of bioengineered foods if the food has a significantly different nutritional property. For example, if a new food contained an allergen that consumers would not expect to be present, or if a food contained a toxic ingredient above acceptable limits, FDA would require that the food be labeled as such. ", "FDA subsequently issued a 2001 draft guidance document for the voluntary labeling of foods that have or have not been developed by bioengineering. These guidelines address how the agency interprets revealing \"material facts\" about a food on a label. In their guidelines, FDA suggests that terms such as \"GMO free\" or \"not genetically modified\" could be technically inaccurate and misleading. On the other hand, labeling statements that the food or its ingredients were not created by bioengineering processes would likely be appropriate. For example, currently, no bioengineered watermelons are on the market. A statement that a watermelon was not genetically engineered might be deemed misleading by FDA because it implies that other watermelons might be bioengineered.

Proponents of mandatory labeling for bioengineered foods argue that consumers should have the right to know what they are purchasing. Even if FDA states that a bioengineered product is, from a food-safety perspective, \"substantially equivalent\" to its traditional counterpart, labeling proponents assert that the consumer should be able to choose between those foods that may contain bioengineered products and those that do not.

As the global food system is currently constructed, segregating bioengineered products from non-bioengineered products would be technically complex and costly. Labeling opponents also argue that the increased food prices as a result of labeling would be borne by all consumers, not just those who wish to avoid bioengineered products.

These stocks are abundant and productive, largely because there have been relatively few human disturbances on major salmon rivers in Alaska such as dams. Stocks in the Pacific Northwest vary widely in health, but most are in relatively poor condition because of historic overfishing and degradation of riverine habitat. These stocks are of limited commercial importance although they still support recreational fisheries and contribute to local economies. Production in both Alaska and the Pacific Northwest is enhanced by releases of salmon from hatcheries which are subsequently harvested after growing to adult size in the ocean.

Most production is from net pens that are suspended in coastal waters, but salmon can be grown in freshwater raceways, tanks, or recirculating systems where adequate water supplies are available. Salmon farming has an advantage over the wild seasonal fishery because it can provide a consistent fresh product throughout the year.

FDA and NMFS engaged in technical discussions during 2010 and 2011 and based on those discussions NMFS did not object to the proposed action. However, critics have questioned whether FDA has sufficient expertise to identify and protect against all potential ecological damage that might result from the widespread use of transgenic fish.

According to FDA, it has verified that AquAdvantage Salmon will be produced and grown in secure facilities. The escape and survival of GE salmon from containment into the local environments of PEI and Panama is considered by FDA to be extremely remote. The environment around the egg producing facility and the grow-out facility are described by FDA as inhospitable. In the event that fish escape and survive, reproduction in the wild would be unlikely because the AquAdvantage Salmon will be all female triploid fish which are nearly all sterile. In the EA, FDA concluded that it \"found no evidence that approval of an NADA for AquAdvantage Salmon would result in significant impacts on the environment in the United States.\" If significant new information or challenges arose in the public comments, FDA could have required a full EIS prior to the approval of AquaBounty's application.", "NEPA does not require an analysis of environmental effects in other countries and therefore, potential effects on the environment in Canada and Panama were not considered. These effects would be evaluated only if potential exposure pathways exist which could cause significant effects on the environment in the United States. Social and economic effects were not analyzed in the EA because the proposed action, if implemented as required, is not anticipated to significantly affect the physical environment of the United States.

On May 25, 2011, these groups filed a formal citizen petition urging FDA to withhold approval until an EIS has been completed. FDA decided that the AquaBounty application did not require an EIS.

", "On February 7, 2012, three nongovernmental organizations petitioned the FDA's Office of Food Additive Safety (OFAS) to review the AquaBounty application under the FFDCA food additive provisions. The petitioners argued that the gene expression product (GEP) of the genetic construct creating the AquAdvantage Salmon is a food additive under FFDCA (\u00a7201(s), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7321). AquAdvantage Salmon exhibit an elevated level of Insulin Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), which they asserted is a novel food additive and constitutes a \"material fact\" about the GE-salmon compared to its non-GE counterpart.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Interbreeding with Wild Atlantic Salmon", "paragraphs": ["Experiences with farmed Atlantic salmon may provide some insights regarding potential interactions of GE Atlantic salmon and wild Atlantic salmon. Farmed Atlantic salmon frequently escape from fish farms in areas both within and outside their native ranges. Escaped farmed salmon have been found on spawning grounds during the period when wild Atlantic salmon spawning occurs. Farmed salmon also spawn in these areas, but with lower success than wild Atlantic salmon. Successful spawning appears to have most frequently occurred between farmed females and wild males. The offspring of farmed and farmed and wild salmon (hybrids) occupy areas also inhabited by wild salmon. It is not known whether the presence of farmed and hybrid juveniles limit food and resources for wild fish and competitively displace native juveniles. The outcomes of interactions between farmed and wild juveniles are likely to vary depending on specific circumstances such as the quality and availability of habitat and associated resources. ", "Domestication of farmed salmon has changed their genetic composition and reduced genetic variation. These changes have occurred because limited numbers of brood fish are used for spawning farmed fish and farmers select for specific traits. Much of present-day farm production of Atlantic salmon is now based on five Norwegian strains. Farmed and wild hybrids and backcrossing of hybrids in subsequent generations may change genetic variability and the frequency and type of alleles present in wild populations. The extent and nature of these changes to genetic variability may affect survival (fitness) of these populations. Changes in the genetic profiles of wild populations have been shown to have occurred in several rivers in Norway and Ireland where inter-breeding of wild and farmed fish is common. Large-scale experiments in Norway and Ireland show highly reduced survival and lifetime success of farmed and hybrid salmon compared to wild salmon. ", "Given previous experiences with farmed salmon, opponents hypothesize that farmed GE salmon eventually will escape from aquaculture systems and interbreed with wild Atlantic salmon. GE salmon may exhibit different fitness-related traits, such as higher feeding and growth rates. Researchers have questioned whether the flow of a gene or genes from transgenic fish such as GE salmon may confer specific advantages to hybrids relative to wild fish resulting in population-wide consequences. The \"Trojan gene hypothesis\" speculates that populations could become extinct when a gene that confers a reproductive advantage also renders offspring less able to survive in the natural environment. However, comments to the VMAC from one of the researchers who framed the hypothesis stated that the Trojan gene effect occurs only when there is a conflict between mating success (if GE salmon were to mate more successfully) and viability fitness (offspring were less likely to survive in the wild). He concluded that the risk of harm is low because data conclusively show that in this case there is no Trojan gene effect and because the data suggest that the transgene will be purged by natural selection. However, the potential consequences of the interbreeding of farm (including GE salmon) and wild Atlantic salmon remain a long-term concern of those attempting to conserve wild Atlantic salmon populations.

This is a concern both within and outside the range of Atlantic salmon. Previous deliberate attempts to introduce Atlantic salmon have failed and no self-sustaining populations of anadromous Atlantic salmon have been established outside the natural range of the species. In British Columbia, Atlantic salmon that escaped from fish farms have spawned and produced wild-spawned juvenile Atlantic salmon, but it is uncertain whether they have established self-reproducing breeding populations. Experimental crosses between GE Atlantic salmon and wild brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) have been shown to be viable and to confer a growth advantage to the hybrid. Researchers concluded that transgenic hybrids could detrimentally affect wild salmon populations but that introgression of the gene into the brown trout genome through backcrossing is unlikely.", "If GE salmon were to escape and establish self-sustaining populations, competition for resources would be another potential concern. Because GE salmon grow more quickly and may be more aggressive than wild fish, it has been suggested that they may outcompete wild fish for habitat and food. Laboratory experiments on AquAdvantage relatives indicate that they are more likely to feed in the presence of a predator than non-GE controls. Another study which compared GE and non-GE salmon fry under food-limited conditions in simulated environments showed no difference in territorial dominance, growth, or survival of first feeding fry at high densities. Biotechnology proponents argue that GE fish, if they escape, would be less likely to survive in the wild, especially when they are reared in protected artificial habitats and have not learned to avoid predators. ", "The consequences of potential competition would also depend on many factors, including the size and health of the wild population, the number and characteristics of the escaped fish, and local environmental conditions. Some argue that once transgenic fish become established, they could be difficult or impossible to eradicate, as in the case of many invasive species. This scenario would depend on reproduction of GE salmon in the wild.

Some have speculated that subsequent proposals will be subject to less scrutiny, and they question whether future proposals are more likely to be considered as benign.

For example, Maryland, Florida, Washington, Oregon, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and California have passed laws on the use of GE fish in state waters.

In 2002, prices paid to Alaska fishermen were less than half of the average prices paid from 1980 to 2005. Changes to salmon markets were actually much more complex during this period because the industry was transformed by a variety of factors in addition to the growth in the total supply of salmon. Salmon markets were also affected by the availability of different types of salmon products, the timing of production, and development of market standards. ", "Some believe that the wide use of GE salmon would depress salmon prices. Potential interactions between GE salmon aquaculture, ongoing salmon aquaculture, and wild fisheries are difficult to fully assess. Part of the difficulty is related to the complex nature of interrelated drivers of aquaculture and wild salmon production. For example, public acceptance can affect prices which in turn may affect salmon production. Major categories of drivers include the regulatory framework, production, markets, and the public ( Figure 1 ). ", "Although some assume that approval of GE technology will be followed by a rapid increase in farmed salmon production, this outcome is unlikely. At least initially, annual production at the AquaBounty Panama facility is limited to a capacity of approximately 100 metric tons compared to the total U.S. fresh and frozen salmon supply of approximately 700,000 metric tons in 2014. Significant production increases would depend on approval of additional sites in salmon producing regions of the world. The regulatory framework will determine which production methods would be used and where they are allowed. If only land-based facilities are allowed, then greater aquaculture production would depend on whether the advantages of using GE salmon (higher growth rate and feed conversion efficiency) can outweigh the greater costs of land-based facilities. Currently, the economic viability of most land-based salmon grow-out facilities is questionable. Significant increases in land-based production also may be constrained by the number of available sites with sufficient water quality and volume. Therefore, the magnitude and timing of greater salmon production, if it were to occur, is very uncertain.", "Some in the commercial fishing industry have stated that it has successfully educated the public to discriminate among fish from different sources, such as wild and farmed salmon.
