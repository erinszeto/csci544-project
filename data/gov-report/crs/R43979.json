{"id": "R43979", "title": "Patent Litigation Reform Legislation in the 114th Congress", "released_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00", "summary": ["This report describes how current patent litigation reform legislation would change existing patent law to address the perceived problems caused by entities that engage in patent litigation tactics that have been criticized as abusive or deceptive. The bills introduced in the 114th Congress include the Innovation Act (H.R. 9), Protecting American Talent and Entrepreneurship Act (PATENT) Act (S. 1137), Demand Letter Transparency Act of 2015 (H.R. 1896), Targeting Rogue and Opaque Letters (TROL) Act (H.R. 2045), and the Support Technology and Research for Our Nation's Growth (STRONG) Patents Act of 2015 (S. 632). The legislation includes the following changes to the patent system:", "Heightened Pleading Requirements: The Innovation Act and the PATENT Act would require parties alleging patent infringement in a civil action to include in the court pleadings specified details concerning each claim of each patent infringed, and the acts of the alleged infringer.", "Limits on Discovery: The Innovation Act (as reported by the House Judiciary Committee) and the PATENT Act propose limitations on discovery pending the resolution of certain motions, including motions to dismiss, transfer venue, and drop parties.", "Transparency of Patent Ownership: The Innovation Act and the PATENT Act would require plaintiffs in patent cases to disclose to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the court, and all adverse parties information relating to entities that own or have a financial interest in the patent.", "Customer-Suit Exception: The Innovation Act and the PATENT Act would allow a court to stay litigation against a customer of a product that contains allegedly infringing technologies, if the manufacturer of the product is a party to the same or other action on the same patent and other requirements are satisfied.", "Shifting of Attorney Fees: The Innovation Act would require a district court to award attorney fees to a prevailing party in patent cases, unless the court finds that the nonprevailing party's position and conduct \"were reasonably justified in law and fact or that special circumstances ... make an award unjust.\" The PATENT Act would require the prevailing party to make a motion to the court to determine whether the nonprevailing party's position and conduct were \"objectively reasonable\"; if they were not, then the court must award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party unless there are special circumstances that would make an award unjust.", "Fee Recovery: The Innovation Act and the PATENT Act contain provisions that address the situation when the nonprevailing party alleging infringement is unable to pay the fee award and other expenses. The Innovation Act (as reported) and the PATENT Act would allow a defendant to submit a statement early in the litigation claiming that the plaintiff's primary business is the assertion and enforcement of patents; the plaintiff would then need to certify that it has sufficient funds to satisfy any potential award of attorney fees that may be assessed, and to identify (and provide notice to) any \"interested parties\" that could be held accountable for the award if the plaintiffs are unable to pay it.", "Demand Letters: Several bills propose various approaches to address demand letters. The STRONG Patents Act and the TROL Act would impose specific enforcement and content requirements for demand letters. The Innovation Act expresses the sense of Congress that purposely evasive demand letters are abusing the patent system in a manner contrary to public policy. The Demand Letter Transparency Act proposes both disclosure and content requirements directed towards \"abusive\" demand letter practices, and the PATENT Act focuses on pre-suit notifications.", "Post-Grant Review Reforms: The Innovation Act, PATENT Act (as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee), and the STRONG Patents Act would mandate that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), in inter partes review (IPR) and post-grant review (PGR) proceedings, follow the same claim construction standard used by district courts. The Innovation Act and the PATENT Act (as reported) would require the PTAB to consider prior claim construction by a court in a civil action in which the patent owner was a party. In addition, the Innovation Act and the PATENT Act would narrow the estoppel effect arising from a PGR. The Innovation Act (as reported) and the STRONG Patents Act would heighten the standing requirements for persons wanting to initiate a PGR or IPR. The STRONG Patents Act would also require the IPR/PGR petitioner to prove unpatentability of a patent claim by \"clear and convincing evidence.\"", "Elimination of USPTO Fee Diversion: The STRONG Patents Act would permit the USPTO to spend all fee revenue that it collects without further appropriation action or fiscal year limitation.", "Venue: The Innovation Act (as reported) would impose limitations on the judicial districts in which a civil action may be brought for patent infringement or for a declaratory judgment that a patent is invalid or not infringed.", "Assistance for Small Businesses: The Innovation Act, STRONG Patents Act, and the PATENT Act contain provisions designed to help small businesses that participate in the patent system either as patent owners or as defendants."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction1", "paragraphs": ["Congress has shown significant interest in altering the current patent system in response to concerns about entities that engage in patent litigation tactics that have been criticized as abusive or deceptive. Many congressional hearings on the topic of patent litigation abuse have been held in the 114 th and 113 th Congresses, and several legislative proposals have been introduced; one bill in the 113 th Congress, H.R. 3309 , the Innovation Act, was passed by the House in December 2013. In June 2015, the House Judiciary Committee approved the Innovation Act ( H.R. 9 ) by a vote of 24 to 8, and the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the PATENT Act ( S. 1137 ) by a vote of 16 to 4; both bills are awaiting floor action. This report describes how the major provisions of current patent litigation reform legislation, with a particular focus on these two bills that have seen the most legislative activity, would change existing patent law to address the perceived problems in the patent litigation system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Patent Law Fundamentals", "paragraphs": ["According to Section 101 of the Patent Act, one who \"invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or any composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefore, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\" Thus, in order for an invention to qualify for patent protection, it must fall within one of the four statutory categories of patent-eligible subject matter: processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has articulated certain limits to Section 101 of the Patent Act, stating that \"laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas\" may not be patented.", "The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issues a patent to an inventor after USPTO examiners approve the submitted patent application for an allegedly new invention. An application for a patent consists of two primary parts: (1) a \"specification,\" which is a written description of the invention enabling those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and (2) one or more claims that define the scope of the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. Therefore, these claims define the scope of the patentee's rights under the patent.", "Before a patent may be granted, the USPTO examiners must find that the new invention satisfies several substantive requirements that are set forth in the Patent Act. For example, one of the statutory requirements for patentability of an invention is \"novelty.\" For an invention to be considered \"novel,\" the subject matter must be different than, and not be wholly \"anticipated\" by, the so-called \"prior art,\" or public domain materials such as publications and other patents. Another statutory requirement is that the subject matter of an alleged invention must be \"nonobvious\" at the time of its creation. A patent claim is invalid if \"the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\" Finally, the invention must also be \"useful,\" which means that the invention provides a \"significant and presently available,\" \"well-defined and particular benefit to the public.\"", "The Patent Act grants patent holders the exclusive right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling their patented invention throughout the United States, or importing the invention into the United States. Whoever performs any one of these five acts during the term of the invention's patent, without the patent holder's authorization, is liable for infringement. A patent holder may file a civil action against an alleged infringer in order to enjoin him from further infringing acts (by securing an injunction, also referred to as injunctive relief). The patent statute also provides federal courts with discretion to award damages to the patent holder that are \"adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer.\" The usual term of patent protection is 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. At the end of that period, others may use the invention without regard to the expired patent.", "Because the Patent Act expressly provides that \"patents shall have the attributes of personal property,\" patent holders may sell their patent rights in a legal transfer called an \"assignment.\" Alternatively, patent holders may grant others a \"license\" to exercise one of the five statutory patent rights. A license is not a transfer of ownership of the patent, but rather is the patent holder's permission to another entity to use the invention in a limited way, typically in exchange for periodic royalty payments during the term of the patent. A patent holder may grant to a licensee the right to practice the invention through a contract (typically known as a patent licensing agreement). The terms of the licensing agreement, however, may include conditions upon the grant of rights\u2014for example, restricting the licensee from making the invention but allowing that party to sell it. A licensee that performs an act that exceeds the scope of the license (through a violation of the limitations and conditions of the grant of rights) or refuses to comply with the terms of the license agreement (such as by refusing to pay the required royalties) is potentially liable to the patent holder for breach of contract as well as for patent infringement.", "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) is a specialized tribunal established by Congress that has exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases. Parties dissatisfied with the Federal Circuit's rulings may petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the appellate court's decision. However, the Supreme Court is not required to entertain the appeal; it has discretion to decide whether to grant certiorari to review the case.", "Besides seeking legal relief for infringement in the federal courts, U.S. patent holders may also obtain an order from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC or Commission) preventing the importation of foreign goods that infringe their rights. The ITC is an independent, nonpartisan, quasi-judicial federal government agency responsible for investigating and arbitrating complaints of violations of Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \u00a71337), which prohibits unfair methods of competition or other unfair acts in the importation of products into the United States. Section 337 also prohibits the importation of articles that infringe valid U.S. patents, copyrights, processes, trademarks, or protected design rights. (The majority of unfair competition acts asserted under Section 337 involve allegations of patent infringement.) The ITC has the power to order several forms of prospective injunctive relief, including ordering the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to stop imports from entering U.S. borders (an exclusion order), or issuing cease and desist orders that prohibit parties from distributing or selling infringing articles from existing U.S. inventory. However, unlike the federal courts, the ITC lacks the statutory authority to award monetary damages for patent infringement (past or future). ", "Although issued patents are presumed to be valid, accused infringers may assert in court that a patent is invalid or unenforceable on a number of grounds. The accused infringer could raise this argument as an affirmative defense or counterclaim when sued for patent infringement. A party could also preemptively file a \"declaratory judgment action\" against a patent owner to challenge a patent's validity, if there is a case or controversy between them. ", "However, the constitutionally based \"case or controversy\" requirement for federal judicial proceedings significantly limits the ability of members of the public to challenge the USPTO's decision to grant a patent. Unless the patent holder becomes involved in an actual, continuing controversy with another person, that person cannot successfully request that a court determine whether the patent is valid or not. To address this perceived deficiency, Congress established several administrative procedures that are conducted by the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, through which any interested person may challenge the validity of an issued patent. Three trial proceedings comprise the current system of administrative patent challenges: inter partes review (IPR), post-grant review (PGR), and the transitional post-grant review for covered business method patents (CBM). The three proceedings have different rules, timing, and eligibility requirements. The proceedings may result in the confirmation of patentability of the original claims, an amended patent with narrower claims, or a declaration of patent invalidity. A party dissatisfied with the PTAB's final written decision in an IPR, PGR, or CBM review may appeal directly to the Federal Circuit. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Patent Assertion Entities35", "paragraphs": ["\"Patent assertion entities\" are people or companies that do not develop, manufacture, or sell any product covered by the patents they own. The business model of a patent assertion entity (PAE) instead focuses on buying and asserting patents against companies that have already begun using and developing the patent, often without knowledge of the PAE's ownership of the patent. PAEs emerged alongside the burgeoning tech industry around the turn of the 21 st century and gained notoriety with lawsuits claiming exclusive ownership of such ubiquitous technologies as wireless email, digital video streaming, and the interactive web. The vast majority of lawsuits brought by PAEs end in settlements because litigation is risky, costly, and disruptive for defendants, and PAEs often offer to settle for amounts well below litigation costs to make the business decision to settle an obvious one. PAEs are frequently referred to as \"patent trolls,\" after the villains of folklore known to lie in wait under bridges they did not build, then emerge from the smog to demand tolls from unsuspecting travelers. The term \"troll\" is controversial because it is both pejorative and ambiguous, often used imprecisely for any opportunistic or unpopular patent holder. Instead, PAEs describe themselves as critical intermediaries. Some claim to offer \"department stores\" for patents, providing one-stop shopping for licensing and purchase. Others suggest they serve key functions by enabling individual inventors to earn returns despite lacking the resources to enforce or commercialize their patents themselves. ", "However, while PAEs may be considered a type of \"non-practicing entity\" (NPE), other NPEs can serve similar intermediary functions without engaging in \"trolling\" tactics. PAEs are alleged to be one-of-a-kind in that they are said to speculate on patents\u2014they bet on how much more a patent will be worth in the future, when it is asserted, and focus on high-risk high-yield acquisitions. The Federal Trade Commission has explained that while other NPEs transfer technologies that they or their clients invented and developed so that licensees can benefit from not having to develop them in-house, PAEs transfer nothing but a legal right not to be sued for using a technology that the licensee may have already invested in developing on its own, without help from the PAE or its patents. PAEs also diverge from other NPEs that enforce patents because they focus on acquiring patents outright and asserting them on their own behalf, as opposed to providing services and collecting fees or a slice of the litigation award.", "Critics of PAEs argue that they extort the patent system through litigation by extracting licensing fees or damage awards from companies that cannot afford the cost of litigation. Critics also argue that \"patent trolling\" deters innovation and discourages companies from seeking patents, and thus delivering new products to the market. According to the White House:", "PAE activities hurt firms of all sizes. Although many significant settlements are from large companies, the majority of PAE suits target small and inventor-driven companies. In addition, PAEs are increasingly targeting end users of products, including many small businesses.", "However, defenders of PAEs argue that they actually promote invention by increasing the liquidity and managing the risk of investments in applied research and invention, as well as by compensating small inventors. By enlivening a secondary market for patents, PAEs provide an exit option and/or extra revenue stream for a variety of patentees. They absorb and manage the high risk by spreading it across large portfolios of patents and extracting value out of otherwise low-value or dormant patents. Patentees who do not or cannot commercialize in the \"primary\" market for technology might recoup their costs and perhaps see some returns by selling their patents to PAEs and retaining a cut of future royalties. PAEs suggest this function is especially essential for small inventors and NPEs that would otherwise have a hard time getting any value from their inventions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislation in the 114th Congress", "paragraphs": ["The remainder of this report discusses and analyzes the key provisions of legislative proposals that have been introduced in the 114 th Congress related to patent litigation abuse. The subject matter of the patent law reforms is presented below in no particular order."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Heightened Pleading Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Supreme Court recently adopted a rule, which went into effect on December 1, 2015, that abolished Federal Rules of Civil Procedure's Form 18. According to Form 18, a complaint for patent infringement needed to include four statements that assert jurisdiction, patent ownership, patent infringement by the defendant, and a demand for relief. Plaintiffs typically relied upon the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure's Form 18 to structure their patent infringement complaint. Generally, the Federal Circuit had applied the \"notice pleading standard\" to patent infringement pleadings for the purpose of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim (a typical method by which a defendant may attempt to have a case dismissed at the beginning of the case). Under this standard, a court finds that the patent pleading statements contain sufficient particularity to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim if they notify parties of the general issues of the case. In K-Tech Telecommunications v. Time Warner Cable, the Federal Circuit held that the information required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure's Form 18 is sufficient for pleading a patent infringement claim as the form states a plausible claim and places the alleged infringer on notice. Additionally, the Federal Circuit in McZeal v. Sprint Nextel Corporation found that a party does not need to describe the relationship between each element of the claim and the infringing device in a patent infringement complaint. According to the court, specific information such as this \"is something to be determined through discovery.\" ", "Under the Supreme Court's recent changes to the federal rules, patent plaintiffs may no longer rely on the standard outlined in Form 18 but will likely need to comply with the higher pleading standard under Ashcroft v. Iqbal and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly . In Twombly and Iqbal, the Supreme Court established that federal courts must evaluate the \"plausibility of claims\" made at the pleading stage when determining whether a civil complaint should survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Therefore, under the Twombly/Iqbal standard, a complaint must contain enough factual allegations to state a claim that is plausible on its face. However, prior to the Supreme Court's recent changes, courts have generally found that Iqbal and Twombly do not apply to patent litigation pleadings because of Form 18 and its inherent notice pleading standard. The Federal Circuit held in the 2012 case In re Bill of Lading Transmission and Processing System Patent Litigation that a patent plaintiff needs only to follow the requirements in Form 18 to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court stated that \"to the extent the parties argue that Twombly and its progeny conflict with the Forms and create different pleadings requirements, the Forms control.\" Without Form 18, however, patent plaintiffs will likely need to conform their patent pleadings to the higher Twombly/Iqbal standard.", "The Innovation Act, H.R. 9 , proposes additional heightened initial pleading requirements for an infringement claim, as compared to the current requirements under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure's Form 18. Under these new requirements, a party alleging infringement in a complaint must include specific details regarding the following:", "each patent allegedly infringed; all claims necessary to produce the identification of each process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter (\"accused instrumentality\") that is alleged to infringe any claim of each patent identified above; for each accused instrumentality alleged to infringe a claim, an identification with particularity (if known) of the name or model number of each accused instrumentality or a description of each accused instrumentality; for each accused instrumentality, a clear and concise statement of how it infringes each claim of each patent; for each claim of indirect infringement, the acts of the alleged indirect infringer that contribute to, or are inducing, a direct infringement; the authority of the party alleging infringement to assert each patent and the grounds for the court's jurisdiction; and each complaint filed that asserts any of the same patents", "Like the Innovation Act, the Senate's PATENT Act also proposes heightened pleading requirements, including such details as", "the identification of each patent allegedly infringed; the identification of each claim of each patent that is allegedly infringed; the identification (including the name, model number, or description) of the accused instrumentality that has allegedly infringed the patent; a description of how the accused instrumentality is allegedly infringing specific elements of the claim; and a description of the acts of the alleged infringer that allegedly contributed to or induced the direct infringement, for claims of indirect infringement.", "The PATENT Act would not require such details in the initial pleading as the authority of the party alleging infringement to assert each patent and the principal business of the party alleging infringement, as outlined in the House's Innovation Act. Instead, the Senate bill would require the patentee to disclose specific information to the court and each adverse party no later than 14 days after the filing of the pleading. These disclosure requirements would cover the identity of the patent assignee(s), the right to enforce the patent at issue, any ultimate parent entity, and entities that would have a particular financial interest in the patent at issue. Both the Innovation Act and PATENT Act would also explicitly eliminate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure's Form 18.", "Both the PATENT Act and the Innovation Act provide that if the information is not readily accessible, then the party may generally describe the information with an explanation of why such undisclosed information was not readily accessible. Similarly, both bills also exempt from the proposed heightened pleading requirements any civil action that includes a claim for relief arising under Section 271(e)(2) of the current Patent Act relating to certain drug claims. Commentators have linked \"patent trolls\" together with the current patent pleading requirements for a patent infringement claim. They have argued that the minimal information required in a patent infringement complaint encourages PAEs to initiate \"frivolous\" lawsuits that otherwise would not survive the initial pleading state under a more stringent standard. Proponents of these pleadings changes state that such heightened pleading requirements would force a plaintiff to consider the alleged infringement instrumentality more carefully and decide whether infringement has occurred before filing the suit. Supporters of heightened pleading requirements also argue that \"not providing the necessary information at the beginning of a case in the complaint slows down the litigation and makes it inefficient and expensive for both parties.\" Additionally, these proponents assert that heightened pleadings standards would not impose a greater burden on the plaintiff, who would develop a good-faith case, and providing such information at the early stages of litigation would improve efficiency and costs. However, some commentators believe that the heightened pleading requirements would render patent enforcement impractical. According to these opponents, the plaintiff may not have the information available at this stage of litigation, as the discovery process typically reveals the information necessary to build a successful infringement claim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limits on Discovery and Cost-Shifting", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit discovery into any unprivileged matter that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party. This broad definition leads to costly discovery in patent litigation. During the discovery process, the court may decide to hold a \"Markman hearing,\" during which a judge examines evidence concerning the parties' disputes over the meaning and language of a patent claim that defines the boundaries of the invention. (Also referred to as \"claim construction,\" or the interpretation of a patent's claims, this process largely determines the scope of the patent owner's proprietary rights.) For these hearings, courts must consider volumes of evidence produced during discovery relating to many different aspects of claim construction including evidence regarding the definition, meaning, scope, and pertinent art of the claim.", "The Innovation Act (as reported) would postpone discovery if the defendant makes a motion to (1) sever a claim or drop a party for misjoinder; (2) transfer the action to another venue; or (3) dismiss the action. Such motion must be filed within 90 days after service of the complaint and must include a declaration or other evidence in support of the motion. There are four exceptions to this stay of discovery provision: ", "1. the court may allow such discovery that the court deems is necessary to decide the motion to sever, drop a party, dismiss, or transfer the action; 2. the provision does not apply to an action in which the patent holder seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent harm arising from the manufacture, use, sale, or importation of an allegedly infringing product that competes with a product made or sold by the patent holder; 3. parties may consent to voluntary exclusion from these proposed limitations on discovery; and 4. the provision does not apply to any civil action that includes a claim for relief arising under 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e)(2) relating to certain drug claims. ", "Like the Innovation Act (as reported), the Senate's PATENT Act would require a court to stay discovery pending the resolution of preliminary motions (which must be filed prior to the first responsive pleading), including the motion to dismiss, the motion to transfer venue, and the motion to sever accused infringers. The bill would provide a court with the discretion to allow limited discovery to resolve these motions or a motion for a preliminary injunction or to preserve evidence or otherwise prevent specific prejudice to a party, if the court would find that additional discovery is necessary. Similar to the Innovation Act, the PATENT Act would also grant parties with the opportunity to exclude themselves voluntarily from these proposed limitations.", "Supporters of these proposed limitations on discovery note that the technical nature and complexity of patent litigation inherently leads to the extensive document discovery, and correspondingly encourages frequent settlements to avoid this high cost. These supporters have stated that the propensity towards settlements in patent litigation encourages PAEs to file infringement suits. Critics of these discovery limitations have raised concerns that the discovery limitation provision may cause \"patent litigation in the overwhelming majority of patent cases [to] incur significant across-the-board delays and increased expense for all parties.\" Others have argued that the discovery stay provision could be subject to abuse; for example, a \"defendant could ... invoke a stay of discovery by moving to transfer venue or to sever, even though the merits of a venue or severance motion have no bearing whatsoever on whether or not the plaintiff will ultimately be allowed discovery.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transparency of Patent Ownership88", "paragraphs": ["Under current law, within a month after the filing of a civil action involving a patent, the clerks of the federal courts must provide written notice of the action to the USPTO director that describes the names and addresses of the parties, the name of the inventor, and the number of the patent upon which the action is based. The USPTO director is then required to enter this information in the file of that patent. ", "Section 4 of the Innovation Act would amend this section of the Patent Act to impose specific disclosure requirements upon plaintiffs upon the filing of an initial complaint for patent infringement. (Similar to the exemption for the new pleading requirements, the Innovation Act's patent ownership disclosure requirement would not apply to any civil action that includes a cause of action for patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7271(e)(2).) Upon the filing of an initial complaint for patent infringement, plaintiffs would be required to disclose to the USPTO, the court, and all adverse parties the following information relating to entities that own or have a financial interest in the patent:", "1. the assignee(s) of the patent(s) involved in the case; 2. any entity with a right to sublicense or enforce the patent(s) at issue; 3. any entity, other than the plaintiff, that the plaintiff knows to have a financial interest in the patent(s) at issue or in the plaintiff; 4. the ultimate parent entity of any assignee, or the entities identified in #2 and #3 above; 5. a clear and concise description of the principal business, if any, of the party alleging infringement; 6. a list of each complaint filed, of which the party alleging infringement has knowledge, that asserts or asserted any of the patents identified above; 7. for each patent identified, a statement as to whether the patent is subject to certain licensing requirements (imposed by the federal government, a foreign government, or by a standards development organization).", "Section 4 of the Innovation Act would require the plaintiff to notify the USPTO of any changes in the identity of the assignee of the patent or the entities described above, within 90 days of such change. Failure to comply with this ongoing duty of disclosure would result in the plaintiff being barred from recovering either enhanced damages or reasonable fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the infringement lawsuit (with respect to infringing activities occurring during the period of noncompliance), \"unless the denial of such damages or fees would be manifestly unjust.\" In addition, the Innovation Act directs a court to award to a prevailing party accused of infringement any reasonable fees and other expenses that the party incurred to uncover the updated information about the assignee or entities, \"unless such sanctions would be unjust.\"", "Section 4 of the Innovation Act grants the USPTO director the power to issue regulations to establish a registration fee in order to recover the cost of administering the \"disclosure of interests\" requirement, which includes the costs to facilitate collection and maintenance of the information submitted by plaintiffs and \"to ensure the timely disclosure of such information to the public.\"", "According to the sponsors of the Innovation Act, the amendments made by Section 4 \"will ensure that patent trolls cannot hide behind a web of shell companies to avoid accountability for bringing frivolous litigation.\" However, a critic of this provision argued that it would be \"needlessly burdensome\" and that the required disclosure \"could lead to the revelation of confidential financial and licensing agreements\"; furthermore, he noted that if such information is relevant to the litigation, \"it is readily discoverable under current rules, with appropriate protective orders to maintain needed confidentiality.\"", "The PATENT Act would require similar initial disclosures by a patentee in a patent infringement lawsuit as the Innovation Act. Within 14 days of the patentee filing the pleading, the patentee would be required to notify the court and each adverse party of the following information:", "1. The identity of each: assignee of the patent(s) at issue, and any \"ultimate parent entity\" thereof; entity with a right to sublicense to unaffiliated entities or to enforce the patent(s) at issue, and any ultimate parent entity thereof; any other entity that the patentee knows to have a financial interest in the patent(s) at issue, or in the patentee (and any ultimate parent entity thereof); and 2. For each patent that the patentee alleges to be infringed: a list of other complaints filed by the patentee in the three years before the filing of the action, as well as any other complaints filed in the United States (not by the patentee but that the patentee was aware of) that asserted the patent during the same three-year period; a statement as to whether the patent is subject to certain licensing requirements (imposed by the federal government or by a standards development organization).", "The PATENT Act would allow the patentee to file such information under seal if the patentee considers the information to be confidential (such as the home addresses of any individuals); the Innovation Act does not contain a similar provision.

Like the Innovation Act, the PATENT Act would also require a court to award to a prevailing accused infringer reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred to discover the identity of any undisclosed entity that was required to be disclosed.

Thus, the patent holder has the right to bring a lawsuit against not only the manufacturer or seller of products that incorporate allegedly infringing components, but also the customers who purchase and use those products. Over the past few years, businesses (including restaurants, retailers, and grocery stores) and individuals increasingly have faced charges of patent infringement for their use of certain equipment that contain technologies such as Wi-Fi, PDF scanning, email, and vehicle tracking. A witness at a congressional hearing in 2013 described the situation as follows:", "Another patent litigation practice that has been sharply criticized is the institution of suits against large numbers of assemblers, distributors or retailers rather than the original manufacturer or provider of the component or product alleged to infringe. This tactic takes advantage of the fact that such suits threaten defendants with the disruption of aspects of their businesses that are at best tangentially related to the invention which is the subject of the patent, and that each individual defendant has less motivation to litigate the issue to final conclusion than the manufacturer of the product at issue. The result can be to collect enormous sums as the result of a very large number of small settlements whose cumulative value far exceeds the amount that could have been recovered from the original manufacturer.", "The judicially created response to such customer lawsuits is the so-called \"customer suit exception\" doctrine, which allows courts to prioritize litigation against or brought by the manufacturer of infringing goods over a lawsuit by the patent owner against customers of the manufacturer in the interest of efficiency and judicial economy. The doctrine permits a court to stay an earlier-filed action against a customer involving an infringement product pending the outcome of a later-filed declaratory judgment action brought by the manufacturer of the accused product. As explained by the First Circuit Court of Appeals (prior to the creation of the Federal Circuit), \"At the root of the preference for a manufacturer's declaratory judgment action is the recognition that, in reality, the manufacturer is the true defendant in the customer suit.... [I]t is a simple fact of life that a manufacturer must protect its customers, either as a matter of contract, or good business, or in order to avoid the damaging impact of an adverse ruling against its products.\" However, the doctrine \"has long existed in a state of relative disuse\" and the Federal Circuit has affirmed its application in only one case in the last three decades.", "Section 5 of the Innovation Act would codify a modified version of the customer suit exception by amending the Patent Act to require a court to suspend or postpone litigation against a customer of a product or process that contains allegedly infringing technologies, if several requirements are satisfied:", "1. the manufacturer is a party to the civil action or a separate action involving the same patent(s); 2. the customer agrees to be bound by the decisions of the court in the action involving the manufacturer, with respect to any issues that the customer and manufacturer have in common; and 3. the customer requests the court to stay the action no later than the later of (a) 120 days after the date on which the first pleading in the action is served (if such pleading specifically identifies the product or process that is the source of the customer's alleged infringement of the patent, and the pleading specifically explains how the product or process is alleged to infringe the patent), or (b) the date on which the first scheduling order in the case is entered.", "The Innovation Act provides two limited exceptions to the manufacturer and customer's entitlement to a stay: (1) if the action involving the manufacturer will not resolve a major issue in the suit against the customer; or (2) if the stay unreasonably prejudices and would be manifestly unjust to the party seeking to lift the stay. In addition, like the exemption for the new pleading and patent ownership disclosure requirements, the Innovation Act exempts from the customer suit stay provision any action that includes a cause of action for patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e)(2).", "Though the stay provision would only postpone, and not terminate, a cause of action against the customer, supporters of the stay provision assert that \"in the vast majority of cases, a suit involving the manufacturer will eliminate all potential infringement liability of the customer.\"", "The Innovation Act (as reported) contains definitions of \"covered customer,\" \"retailer,\" and \"end user\" that limit the applicable scope of the customer stay provision, as follows:", "1. A \"covered customer\" is a retailer or end user who is accused of patent infringement based on sale or use of a product/process alleged to infringe a patent, if the retailer or end user did not materially modify such product/process for their own purposes. 2. An \"end user\" is a user of a product/process alleged to infringe a patent and also an affiliate of such an end user, but does not include an entity that manufactures (or causes the manufacture of) the product/process. 3. A \"retailer\" is an entity that generates its revenues mostly through sale of consumer goods or services, or an affiliate of such an entity, but does not include an entity that manufactures (or causes the manufacture of) the product/process alleged to infringe a patent.", "The PATENT Act includes a customer stay provision similar to that of the Innovation Act (as reported). ", "Both the Innovation Act (as reported) and the PATENT Act would require the written consent of the manufacturer to obtain a stay of an action against a customer only if the manufacturer had been made a party to the action on motion by the customer. The PATENT Act contains the same provisions as the Innovation Act pertaining to situations in which a stay may be lifted: if the action involving the manufacturer will not resolve major issues in the suit against the customer, or the stay unreasonably prejudices or is manifestly unjust to the party seeking to lift the stay.

The 1952 revision of the patent laws codified this provision at 35 U.S.C. Section 285. This section of the Patent Act provides a court with the discretion to award \"reasonable\" attorney fees to the prevailing party (plaintiff or defendant) only \"in exceptional cases.\" ", "However, the Federal Circuit in its 2005 opinion, Brooks Furniture Manufacturing, Inc. v. Dutailier International, Inc ., established that courts may find an \"exceptional case\" under Section 285 in only two limited circumstances: (A) \"when there has been some material inappropriate conduct\" (during the litigation or in obtaining the patent from the USPTO) or (B) when the litigation is both (1) brought in subjective bad faith and (2) objectively baseless. In addition, Brooks Furniture held that the prevailing party must prove its entitlement to attorney fees by \"clear and convincing evidence.\" In part due to this strict standard, federal judges have rarely award these fees.", "In April 2014, the Supreme Court in Octane Fitness v. Icon Health & Fitness unanimously overruled the Federal Circuit's Brooks Furniture standard because the two-prong test \"is unduly rigid, and it impermissibly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.\" Instead, the Court adopted a more lenient standard, holding \"that an 'exceptional' case is simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party's litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.\" The Court explained that district courts must make the Section 285 determination by considering the \"totality of the circumstances.\" The Court also rejected the Federal Circuit's requirement that prevailing parties establish their entitlement to legal fees by \"clear and convincing evidence\" and instead embraced a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. In a companion case decided the same day as Octane Fitness , the Supreme Court in Highmark v. Allcare Health Management rejected the Federal Circuit's position that a district court's \"exceptional case\" determination is to be reviewed on appeal \"de novo\" and \"without deference.\" Instead, the Court held that the district court's Section 285 determination must be reviewed on appeal under an abuse-of-discretion standard. ", "By overruling the Federal Circuit's restrictive interpretation of Section 285, Octane Fitness and Highmark provide district courts with greater discretion in deciding whether to award fees, thus likely increasing the number of patent cases in which attorney fees are shifted. Thus, in evaluating whether to award attorney fees, a court must first assess whether the case is \"exceptional\" in accordance with the standard announced in Octane Fitness, and if so, the court may (or may not) choose to award the fees. It is unclear the extent to which these recent Supreme Court decisions will impact the filing of patent infringement lawsuits by patent assertion entities, yet supporters of patent litigation reform express hope that the increased prospect of paying the other party's litigation expenses could be a significant financial disincentive to PAEs' litigation tactics. However, some observers predict that Octane Fitness and Highmark will not have a significant impact on PAEs because fee-shifting will remain limited:", "[R]ecent Supreme Court cases ... make clear that a case is exceptional only if it is unusually weak. Moreover, because district courts now have substantial discretion to decide whether to award fees, district courts that signal a reluctance to shift fees will invariably attract greater proportions of future patent lawsuits from plaintiffs eager to avoid any risk of fee-shifting. Finally, even when a court does shift fees to a plaintiff, the shell-corporation structure of many abusive litigants precludes any meaningful recovery for the defendant. So long as the entity that owns the patent rights holds no other assets, patent plaintiffs can effectively render themselves judgment proof.", "Section 3(b) of the Innovation Act would amend Section 285 to require a court, in any patent case, to award attorney fees to a prevailing party (plaintiff or defendant), unless the court finds that either", "1. the nonprevailing party's position and conduct are \"reasonably justified in law and fact\" or 2. there are \"special circumstances (such as severe economic hardship to a named inventor) [that] make an award unjust.\"", "Although not explicitly stated by the legislation, the nonprevailing party would appear to have the burden of demonstrating the existence of either of these exceptions in order to rebut the presumption of an award of attorney fees. Supporters of the Innovation Act's fee-shifting provision believe that \"allowing more liberal shifting of attorney fees against losing parties would reduce the frequency of such nuisance settlements, and would allow more defendants to challenge patents that are invalid or that have been asserted beyond what their claims reasonably allow.\" On the other hand, those wary of fee-shifting provisions are concerned that they may benefit wealthy corporate parties to the disadvantage of individual inventors. They assert that \"[a] 'loser pays' provision will deter patent holders from pursuing meritorious patent infringement claims and protects institutional defendants with enormous resources who can use the risk of fee-shifting to force inventors into accepting unfair settlements or dismissing their legitimate claims.\"", "The Support Technology and Research for Our Nation's Growth (STRONG) Patents Act of 2015 ( S. 632 ) does not include a fee-shifting provision; instead, Section 101 of S. 632 (the \"findings\" section) asserts that the Supreme Court's Octane Fitness and Highmark rulings \"significantly reduced the burden on an alleged infringer to recover attorney fees from the patent owner, and increased the incidence of fees shifted to the losing party.\"", "Section 7(a) of the PATENT Act expresses a \"sense of Congress that, in patent cases, reasonable attorney fees should be paid by a nonprevailing party whose litigation position or conduct is not objectively reasonable.\" Unlike the Innovation Act's creation of what appears to be a presumption of an award of attorney fees, Section 7(b) of the PATENT Act would require the prevailing party to first make a motion for the fees, after which the court must determine whether the position of the nonprevailing party was \"objectively reasonable in law and fact, and whether the conduct of the nonprevailing party was objectively reasonable.\" If the court finds that the nonprevailing party's position and conduct does not satisfy these standards, the court must award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party, unless special circumstances would make an award unjust. On June 4, 2015, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved two additions to the PATENT Act's fee-shifting provision: ", "1.

Proponents of this proposed provision state that mandatory joinder would encourage greater transparency by granting patent defendants with further knowledge regarding all the parties who may have an interest in the litigation beyond the PAE \"shell company.\" Proponents of the joinder provision also argue that such a change would allow prevailing defendants to seek a greater financial award against PAEs, who may not have extensive financial resources, by permitting the defendants to seek financial recovery against additional parties. Opponents of this provision argue that the mandatory joinder of third parties is \"one-sided\" and may restrict the ability of patent owners to enforce their patents. Some have stated that joinder provisions such as the one proposed by the Innovation Act may harm business relationships that arise through licensing by forcing parties to join in order to pay damages and other fees. Opponents also contend that joinder in this context for the purposes of fee-shifting raises constitutional concerns as the provision would create standing for parties that would otherwise not have standing. Specifically, the opponents point to the scenario where \"a defendant may join [as] a third-party at the end of the case for the purposes of fee-shifting, but the third-party had no standing to assert or defend themselves during the course of the legal proceedings.\"", "The PATENT Act contains a mechanism for recovering fee awards from interested parties that is similar to the Innovation Act (as reported).

The notice must also inform the recipient that the recipient may be held accountable for any award of attorney fees (or a portion thereof) resulting from the action in the event the plaintiff cannot satisfy the full amount of such award, unless the recipient submits a statement to the court and parties in the action, within 120 days of receiving the notice, that renounces its interest related to the enforcement of the patent. The PATENT Act would make any interested parties who are timely served with this notice potentially liable to pay any attorney fees, or portion thereof, awarded by the court, in the event that the party alleging infringement cannot satisfy the full amount of the award. However, interested parties would not be accountable if \"a true and correct certification\" is filed with the court that the plaintiff will have sufficient funds to pay for any potential award of reasonable attorney fees, or that the party's primary business is not the assertion and enforcement of patents (or the licensing that results from it).", "The PATENT Act grants an interested party the right to intervene in the action for purposes of contesting its identification as an interested party or its liability for attorney fees.

A patentee may use demand letters to prove willfulness in a patent infringement lawsuit, a high bar after recent court decisions. In the 2007 case, In re Seagate Technology , the Federal Circuit established a two-pronged test for willful infringement in a patent case. First, the patentee must show, by clear and convincing evidence, \"that the infringer acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its actions constituted infringement of a valid patent.\" Then the patentee must prove \"subjective recklessness,\" which means that the accused infringer knew or should have known the risk of infringement.

Instead, the Innovation Act and PATENT Act (as reported) would require that the PTAB, in IPR and PGR proceedings, use the same claim construction standard that is applied by federal courts; that is, the PTAB would need to construe a patent claim \"in accordance with the ordinary and customary meaning of such claim as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and the prosecution history pertaining to the patent.\" ", "The Innovation Act and the PATENT Act (as reported) would also require the PTAB to consider prior claim construction by a court in a civil action in which the patent owner was a party.", "Sections 102 and 103 of the STRONG Patents Act contain similar amendments regarding the claim construction standard to be used in IPR and PGR proceedings. The PATENT Act does not include a provision that would alter the existing claim construction standard.", "Former USPTO Director David Kappos has observed that currently, \"the speed mandated for post-grant procedures is leading to greater interaction between court interpretations and USPTO interpretations of the same patent claims, and having the USPTO apply a different standard than the courts [for claim construction] is leading, and will continue to lead, to conflicting decisions.\" However, he notes that there are valid arguments for retaining the broader standard for post-grant proceedings, such as that the BRI standard \"requires patentees to define their claims clearly over the prior art during proceedings\" before the USPTO.", "Others have asserted that changing the claim construction standard in IPR and PGR from BRI to \"ordinary and customary meaning\" would be a positive benefit to patent owners who feel that the BRI standard makes it easier to invalidate their patents in the AIA-established post-grant reviews than in federal courts.", "However, some groups oppose the inclusion of these changes to the IPR/PGR claim construction standard in the patent litigation reform bills, arguing that they \"will undermine post grant review procedures that have proven to be an effective and useful tool in weeding out the weak patents that are often asserted in the most abusive of patent cases.\" Technology companies have explained their opposition to the IPR/PGR amendments as follows:", "[T]he changes to the claim construction standard in IPR proceedings ... would eliminate a necessary and significant difference between the court system and USPTO standards for claim construction. In district court, the purpose is to determine liability for patent infringement; whereas the purpose of an IPR proceeding is for the USPTO to ensure its decision to issue a patent was, in fact, correct. The IPR process was amended in the AIA to provide a more streamlined, cost-effective method to challenge patent validity outside the court system.

Section 9 of the Innovation Act and Section 14(a) of the PATENT Act would narrow the estoppel effect arising from a PGR by removing the phrase \"or reasonably could have raised\" in the statute. Thus, this provision would effectively permit parties to later assert in a civil action that a patent claim is invalid on any ground that the party \"reasonably could have raised\" during the PGR.

It has been estimated that, since 1999, over $1 billion in USPTO fee revenue has been withheld from the USPTO and directed towards unrelated government programs and operations.", "The America Invents Act (AIA) that was enacted in 2011 made several changes to the handling of fees collected by the USPTO. Under the AIA, the use of fees generated is still subject to the appropriations process, whereby Congress provides the budget authority for the USPTO to spend these fees. To address the issue of fees withheld from the office in the past, the AIA created within the Treasury a \"Patent and Trademark Fee Reserve Fund\" into which fee collections above that \"appropriated by the Office for that fiscal year\" are to be placed. These funds are to be available to the USPTO \"to the extent and in the amounts provided in appropriations Acts\" and may only be used for the work of the USPTO.

Johnson Gas Appliance Co., applied the general federal venue statute (Section 1391(c)) to patent infringement cases, arguing that Congress, in amending the general venue statute in 1988, intended to change the scope of the patent venue statute in Section 1400(b):", "Other than by the clear language of the statute, Congress has not given any indication of whether it intended to change the scope of venue under \u00a7 1400(b).
