This would be achieved by creating federal jurisdiction overclass action suits when the total amount in dispute exceeds $5,000,000 and when any plaintiff livesin a state different from that of any defendant. The bill would treat certain \"mass actions\" with morethan 100 plaintiffs as class actions for purposes of jurisdiction. S. 5 would requirejudges to review all settlements based on the issuance of coupons to plaintiffs and limit attorney'sfees to the value of the coupon settlements actually received by class members. It would also requirecareful scrutiny of \"net loss\" settlements in which class members ultimately lose money. Thelegislation would ban settlements that award some class members a larger recovery because they livecloser to the court. It would allow federal courts to maximize the benefits of class actionsettlements. Among other things, S. 5 would also require that a notice of proposedsettlements be provided to the appropriate state and federal officials such as the state attorneysgeneral. It was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee without amendment. On February10, 2005, the Senate passed S. 5 (72-26) without amendment. On February 17, 2005,the House also passed S. 5 without amendment, 279-149 and it is expected to be signedby the President."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Section 1.

Findings and Purposes of the Act. Theact sets out Congress' findings describing in essentially these words the: (1) circumstances in whichclass actions are valuable to our legal system; (2) abuses of the class action process that have harmedclass members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly, adversely affectedinterstate commerce, and undermined public respect for our judicial system; (3) the manner by whichclass members have been harmed by a number of actions taken by plaintiffs' lawyers, which providelittle or no benefit to class members as a whole, including (i) plaintiffs' lawyers receiving large fees,while class members are left with coupons or other awards of little or no value, (ii) unjustifiedrewards made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members, and (iii) confusingpublished notices that prevent class members from being able to fully understand and effectivelyexercise their rights; (4) abuses in class actions which undermine the national judicial system, thefree flow of interstate commerce, and the concept of diversity jurisdiction as intended by the framersof the United States Constitution, in that State and local courts are (i) keeping cases of nationalimportance out of federal court, (ii) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias againstout-of-state defendants, and (iii) making judgments that impose their view of the law on other statesand bind the rights of the residents of those states.", "The act's stated purposes are to (1) ensure prompt and fair recovery of legitimate class actionclaims; (2) reflect the purpose behind the Constitution's diversity jurisdiction clause; and (3) toencourage commercial innovation and consumer-friendly prices.", "Section 3. Consumer Class Action Bill of Rights and ImprovedProcedures for Interstate Class Actions. S. 5 would add five newsections to 28 U.S.C. which are intended to provide greater protections for class members. Inparticular, section 3 would add the following:", "Section 1711-Class action definitions", "(1) Class Action-The term is defined to include any civil action filed in federal district courtunder Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as actions filed under similar rulesin state court that have been removed to federal court.", "(2) Class Counsel-The term is defined as \"the persons who serve as the attorneys for the classmembers in a proposed or certified class action.\"", "(3) Class Members-The term is defined as \"the persons (named or unnamed) who fall withinthe definition of the proposed or certified class in a class action.\"", "(4) Plaintiff Class Action-The term is defined as \"a class action in which class members areplaintiffs.\"", "(5) Proposed Settlement-The term is defined as \"an agreement regarding a class action thatis subject to court approval and that, if approved, would be binding on some or all class members.\"", "Section 1712-Judicial scrutiny of coupon and other noncashsettlements", "This provision is aimed at certain proposed settlements of class actions, in which theplaintiffs' lawyer and the defendant work out a settlement that provides class members withessentially valueless coupons while rewarding the lawyers with substantial attorneys' fees. Toaddress this problem, this section provides that a judge may approve a proposed settlement underwhich the class would receive noncash benefits or would otherwise be required to expend funds inorder to obtain part or all of the proposed benefits only after a hearing to determine whether, andmaking a written finding that, the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate for class members.

Notifications to appropriate federal and stateofficials", "This provision requires defendants to notify the appropriate state and federal official of theparticulars of any class action settlement and delays the effective date of the settlement until 90 daysafter they have done so.

Federal District Court Jurisdictionof Interstate Class Actions. Article III of the Constitution protects out-of-statelitigants against the prejudice of local courts by allowing for federal diversity jurisdiction when theplaintiffs and defendants are citizens of different states. However, under current law, federaldiversity jurisdiction for a class action does not exist unless every member of the class is a citizenof a different state from every defendant, and every member of the class is seeking damages inexcess of $75,000. (9) Thissection would change the law by providing additional protection for out-of-state litigants by creatinga minimal diversity rule for class actions and by determining satisfaction of theamount-in-controversy requirement by looking at the total amount of damages at stake.", "Under the proposal, federal district courts receive original jurisdiction over any class actionin which the amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeds $5,000,000 and in which(A) \"any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State different from any defendant;\" (B)\"anymember of a class of plaintiffs is a foreign state or a citizen or subject of a foreign state and anydefendant is a citizen of a State;\" or (C) \"any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a Stateand any defendant is a foreign state or a citizen or subject of a foreign state.\" This rule holds trueif less than one-third of the plaintiffs and the primary defendants come from the state where the suitis filed; has no application if two-thirds or more of the plaintiffs and a primary defendant come fromthe state where the suit is filed; and applies at the discretion of the federal court if more thanone-third but less than two-thirds of the plaintiffs and the primary defendants come from the statewhere the suit is filed.

Removal of Interstate Class Actions to Federal DistrictCourt. Under existing federal law, civil actions filed in state court, which mighthave been filed in federal court, can be removed to federal court under some circumstances, see 28U.S.C. 1441 et. seq. Section 5 would permit removal from state court of minimum diversity casesthat section 4 would permit to have been filed originally in federal court. It would allow class actionlawsuits to be removed from state court to federal court by any defendant without the consent of anyof the other defendants. (13) ", "Section 6.

Enactment of Judicial ConferenceRecommendations. This section, which perhaps survives through a scrivener'serror, first appeared in bills introduced early in 2003 and was designed to accelerate the effectivedate of class action reform amendments to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, see H.Rept. 108-144 , at 45 (2003). Those amendments, then scheduled to become effective onDecember 1, 2003, did in fact become effective on that date.
