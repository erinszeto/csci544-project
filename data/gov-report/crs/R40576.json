The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) has long sought to improve quality by supporting better professional development, effective recruitment and retention, and smaller class sizes. In perhaps its most direct effort to improve teacher quality, the 107 th Congress established new federal highly qualified teacher requirements through the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB, P.L. 107-110 ). In recent years, researchers and policy-makers have begun to consider and implement ways to use compensation reform to improve teacher quality; however, federal policy up to this point has not been heavily focused on the issue of teacher pay.", "There is growing concern that the single salary schedule currently in place in nearly all of the nation's schools may be a barrier to improving quality. Many believe that teachers' pay should be used to leverage changes in behavior, knowledge, and skills, and make teaching more financially attractive to successful teachers and to highly able individuals outside of teaching. The recent policy focus on student academic achievement has led some reformers to advocate for various systems of pay-for-performance based on achievement gains, including the use of value-added methods. Others argue that pay differentiation should reward a broader set of factors. These reforms include incentives based on such things as teacher evaluations, advanced credentials, career ladders, and service in hard-to-staff schools or high-need subject areas.", "Apart from the recently enacted Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF), federal education policy has not significantly addressed the nature of teacher compensation. Nevertheless, significant amounts of funding from several federal programs support the salaries of certain kinds of teachers, including teachers and paraprofessionals serving educationally disadvantaged students under the compensatory education program (ESEA, Title I-A), newly hired teachers under the continuation of activities provided by the Class Size Reduction program (antecedent to ESEA, Title II-A) and special education teachers (under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act).", "As Congress moves to reauthorize the ESEA, proposals to leverage federal education spending to reform teacher compensation systems may receive serious consideration. Congress could scale up the current federal role in compensation reform through continued expansion of the TIF program; which is basically providing funding for promising programs that already exist (mainly) at the local level. However, Congress may also consider alternative approaches that would alter or expand the federal role. An example of such a proposal would be to strengthen current language supporting pay reform under ESEA Title II (Sections 2113 and 2123).", "This report is intended to discuss a variety of issues that relate to compensation reform and the proposals Congress may consider during ESEA reauthorization.

Prior to that time, \"room and board\" and \"grade-based\" compensation models allowed large discrepancies to develop, particularly along racial and gender lines. By the 1920s, new systems of uniform pay steps were taking hold to ensure teachers with the same years of experience and education level would receive the same salary. These systems came to be known as the single salary schedule and have been nearly universal in public schools since the mid-20 th century; adopted in 97% of all schools by 1950 and operational in 96% of schools in 2000.", "Teacher salary schedules are primarily determined at the level of the individual school district. They are often the subject of negotiation between local school boards and teacher unions where applicable. This salary schedule bases a teacher's pay primarily on two factors\u2014the number of years of teaching experience the individual has and the number of educational credits and degrees the individual has earned. Increases in both teaching experience and credits/degrees lead to increases in salary, up to absolute limits imposed by the applicable pay schedule.", "Critics view the single salary schedule as largely rewarding longevity and the accumulation of college credits, not classroom effectiveness. Some researchers have found that the schedule's main factors\u2014experience and level of education\u2014have relatively little beneficial impact on classroom effectiveness as measured by the achievement of a teacher's students. Hanushek and Rivkin have concluded: \"The results [of a review of the available research] are startlingly consistent in finding no strong evidence that teacher-student ratios, teacher education, or teacher experience have an expected positive effect on student achievement.\" Other research challenges these conclusions. For example, based on their analysis of the literature, Rob Greenwald et al. concluded: \"[R]esource variables that attempt to describe the quality of teachers (teacher ability, teacher education, and teacher experience) show very strong relations with student achievement.\"", "Regardless of the strength of the relationship between teacher quality and student achievement, the single salary schedule (and perhaps low overall pay, see box below) is argued by some to fail to draw the highest caliber of potential teachers into the field; to fail to reward teachers who are exceptionally productive; or to fail to allocate the supply of teachers to fields where they are most needed (like math and science). Criticism of the single salary schedule has undergirded efforts to implement performance-based pay plans in elementary and secondary education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elements of Compensation Reform", "paragraphs": ["Teacher compensation reform efforts have a long history and have fallen into and out of favor in public schools repeatedly throughout the 20 th century. Throughout this history there has been a consistent tension in the balance between rewarding inputs versus outputs . Put simply, should teachers be given additional pay for improving the skills and abilities they bring into the classroom or should they get additional pay for improving the skills and abilities their students carry away from school? Reflecting this debate, a recent review of the history of compensation reforms described the two classic approaches as (1) knowledge-based pay and (2) merit-based pay. ", "Many writing in this area conflate these two reforms (among other reforms) under terms like \"performance-based pay\" and \"pay-for-performance.\" To avoid confusion, in this report, the term performance-based pay is used to refer strictly to output-based compensation reforms that reward teachers for improving student performance. Input-based incentives (such as rewards for improving a teacher's knowledge) are referred to as competency-based pay . In addition to these two types of reform, there exists a third category that will be called service -based pay . These reforms include financial rewards for those teaching in hard-to-staff schools and hard-to-staff subject areas, but can also include rewards for those who move up the career ladder to serve in more advanced roles (e.g., team leadership) and take on additional responsibilities (e.g., mentoring)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Performance-Based Pay", "paragraphs": ["In the labor market generally, performance-based pay policies attempt to correlate employee pay directly with employee output and take the form of either individual incentive plans or group incentive plans. Performance-based pay is consistent with widely held beliefs that employees should be rewarded based on effort and with theories of human motivation which contend that effective motivation is predicated on a close relationship between performance and rewards.", "Most employers rely principally on time-based pay (paying employees on an hourly or salaried basis) but incorporate some form of performance-based pay on an adjunct basis. Implementation of performance-based pay requires supervisory time and, consequently, entails costs for employee monitoring among other managerial problems. However, it is presumed that because of the additional incentives to individual performance, less supervision will be required than under strictly time-based pay. These performance incentives may reward productive workers with larger annual wage increases (or one-time bonuses) on an individual basis. ", "As an alternative to supporting individual performance, group incentive plans reward organization-wide effort. Because group incentive plans ideally foster cooperation and teamwork rather than competition among coworkers, they overcome one of the potential limitations of individual incentive plans. On the other hand, group incentive plans are sometimes criticized for not sufficiently recognizing individual effort. In practice, many employers rely on both group and individual incentives to try and enhance individual performance and teamwork. Gain-sharing plans, which tie part of pay to some measure of group effort, often include some components of individual performance plans, thereby potentially enhancing group and individual effort. Gain-sharing rewards are tied to improvements in organizational performance attributable to factors controllable by employees. Thus, gain-sharing plans affect performance by influencing employee motivation and organizational culture."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Merit Pay for Teachers", "paragraphs": ["The first wave of performance-based pay reforms for teachers mainly took the form of so-called merit pay . Merit pay is a, \"system that hinges on student outcomes attributed to a particular teacher or group of teachers rather than on 'inputs' such as skills or knowledge.\" Following the release of A Nation at Risk in 1983, a significant number of public school districts began considering merit pay as a supplement to the single salary schedule. These merit pay systems provided bonuses to individual teachers, groups of teachers, or schools based on any number of factors including student performance, classroom observations, and teacher portfolios. ", "A 2002 report by the Progressive Policy Institute found that the most common form of merit pay were school-based performance awards. These bonus awards were based on the aggregate performance of schools that may include a wide range of possible measures. Student-related measures may include achievement levels, attendance rates, dropout rates (for secondary schools), participation rates in advanced placement courses (for secondary schools), and college going rates (for secondary schools). Measures of school performance need not be student-based. For example, they may include the extent of parental and community involvement in school activities, or whether the schools have developed and implemented new curricula. The awards are made to individual schools for use at the school level. Some, but not all, of the initiatives being implemented that include school-based performance awards require the distribution of these awards to individual teachers as additional compensation.", "Early pay reform efforts demonstrate that measuring teacher performance is quite difficult. Many highly valued activities by teachers are qualitative, and as a consequence, hard to measure:", "One key problem in predicting teacher quality is that managers using the criteria demand quantitative measurements, while the factors that actually relate to classroom performance are typically qualitative and vague. Even if the factors important in producing a good teacher were known, specifying true quality and implementation standards would still be exceedingly difficult.", "Historically, merit pay reforms foundered frequently on the evaluation portion of the plans which often involved subjective assessments of teacher performance by principals, teachers, or others. In many instances, teachers considered this process to be ill-defined, overly subjective, or basically biased. Measuring performance remains one of the biggest obstacles to these reforms. Heneman et al. point out that teachers do not necessarily object to merit pay itself, \"but the way in which plans were designed, implemented, and administered.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measuring Performance and Value-Added Modeling", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, much has changed in the area of measuring teacher performance. With the growth of student assessments and related data systems, student test scores are increasingly used as a measure of teacher effectiveness. To many advocates, test scores are viewed as a more quantitative and less subjective way of gauging teacher performance than traditional evaluation procedures. Debate over the use of student test scores for this purpose focuses on the attribution of changes in student test scores to the effectiveness of an individual teacher, given the multitude of other factors, including family background and the quality of previous teachers, that are known to influence achievement. In addition, issues arise concerning the validity and reliability of the testing instruments, and whether such assessment instruments measure the full range of student outcomes that policymakers and others desire. Goldhaber summarizes the debate this way, \"while such research has taught us valuable lessons about the appropriate ways to measure teacher effectiveness, it is an overstatement to suggest that debates about how precisely to measure teacher contributions to student learning are anywhere close to settled.\"", "One avenue of research that has attempted to address the debate over the use of student assessments for teacher evaluation has come to be known as value-added modeling (VAM). Most notably tied to the work of William Sanders at the University of North Carolina and later at the SAS Institute, Inc., VAM attempts to estimate the improvement in student achievement that can be attributed to teachers' interventions net of the effect of all other factors. In its pure form, these procedures use linked student-teacher unit records to identify teacher effects; however, at the present time such data systems exist in only a handful of states. A recent comprehensive review of VAM research undertaken by the RAND corporation declared the lack of these data systems to be \"among the greatest challenges facing VAM\" and concluded that \"the research base is currently insufficient to support the use of VAM for high-stakes decisions.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Competency-Based Pay", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to performance-based pay incentives that attempt to reward teacher output, other pay reform programs reward teachers for improving inputs thought to lead to better student performance.

The framework attempts to describe the full range of teacher performance, from beginner to expert. It defines four performance domains: planning and preparation, the classroom environment (classroom management), instruction, and professional responsibilities.

Finally, the population of students served by the position may require special skills or may be otherwise difficult to teach.", "Hard-to-staff schools might be most directly identified by human resource data such as unfilled vacancies at the start of the school year and the rate of teacher turnover; however, often proxy measures are used such as poverty rates, school lunch subsidies, crime statistics, and Medicaid enrollment.

While this can be considered a type of knowledge-based pay system, it fits more in the service-pay category because, unlike pay systems for knowledge and skills (which are generally designed to be consistent from year-to-year), pay systems for high-need subjects areas may shift as the needs of a given school change from year-to-year.

Federal education appropriations have historically accounted for less than 10% of all education spending. In the 2005-2006 school year, a total of $529 billion was spent on public elementary and secondary education; $39 billion (7.4%) of these funds came through ED. That same year, $274 billion of the total was spent on instruction and nearly all ($246 billion) of that amount was used for staff salaries and benefits. A recent ED study found that roughly half of the major sources of federal K-12 education funds are used by schools and districts for instructional staff (e.g., 59% of Title I funds, 63% of Title II funds, and 55% of Title III funds). Even with these large shares of the federal effort going to instructional staff, it is still a very small proportion of all spending on teacher salaries and benefits. With respect to Title I, the ED report concluded that, \"In an average-size Title I school of 500 students, Title I resources added a total of 3.5 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff, including 1.9 teachers, 1.2 teacher aides, and 0.4 non-instructional staff.\"", "Until recently, the federal role has also been limited in terms of the way in which teachers are compensated. Prior to the creation of the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF), this role was limited to the inclusion of pay reforms among a list of allowable uses of funds under the two main federal teacher programs. The HEA, Title II-A, Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants program (enacted through the 1998 HEA amendments) authorized participating states to develop \"performance-based compensation systems.\" Although the 2008 amendments to the HEA eliminated the Title II grants to states, the retained Title II partnership grant program contains support for activities that may include \"bonus, differential, incentive, or performance pay\" for mentor teachers. The ESEA, Title II-A, Improving Teacher Quality State Grants program (enacted through the NCLB amendments of 2001) allows grantees to use these funds for, among many other activities, \"merit pay programs\" to promote teacher retention. According to a recent study, only 4% of ESEA, Title II-A funds were used for \"scholarships, signing bonuses, or other financial incentives, such as differential pay\" or \"merit pay programs.\"", "The establishment of the TIF represents a notable change in the federal stance on teacher compensation. Rather than simply allowing states and districts to use federal funds for incentive pay (as is the case under the ESEA and HEA, Title II programs), the TIF actively seeks out and supports promising pay reform efforts. Though limited in scope, this program establishes a targeted federal role in supporting compensation reforms. Funding has always been one of the major barriers to the development of pay reform. The merit pay reforms of the 1970s and 1980s came in the form of bonuses (instead of salary increases) that did not outlive periodic budget shortfalls.

Van Hook further indicated that districts working with TAP often use their federal Title II funds to support their performance pay activities. Results from ED's most recent survey on the use of Title II funds suggests that nationally this is a rare occurrence. The Department's report states that among the districts surveyed only, \"Four percent of Title II, Part A funds were spent on mechanisms and strategies to help schools recruit and retain highly qualified teachers, principals and specialists in core academic areas, such as scholarships, loan forgiveness, signing bonuses or differential pay for teachers\" [emphasis added]. Still, it is quite possible that the small fraction of the nation's 14,000 school districts which are working with TAP may use their Title II funds very differently than the typical district.
