In the majority of the other cases, the contest was dismissed based on reasons including lack of evidence; a determination that voting irregularities, fraud, or misconduct was insufficient to affect the results of the election; failure to sustain the burden of proof necessary to award the contested seat to the contestant; and improper initiation of a contest or other procedural failures.", "With regard to procedures followed on the first day of a new Congress, of the 107 contested election cases considered by the House since 1933, it appears that in at least 15 cases, the Member-elect was asked to \"step aside\" or \"remain seated\" while the oath of office was collectively administered to the other Members-elect.

In the remaining 11 of the 15 cases where a Member-elect was asked to step aside, in most instances, the House adopted a resolution providing merely that the Member-elect \"be now permitted\" to take the oath of office, with no specific reference to final determination of the right to the seat nor any express reference to a filed election contest.

A \"Member-elect\" is not a \"Member of Congress\" until that person is sworn in and seated by the respective House. Under express provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the final authority over the \"Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members\" is clearly lodged within each House of Congress.", "Although procedures have not been absolutely consistent, House practice is that any Member-elect, on the first day of the new Congress and before the Members-elect have been sworn (i.e, at the time when the Speaker asks the Members-elect to rise to take the oath of office), may object to the seating of another Member-elect based on the objecting Member-elect's own \"responsibility as a Member-elect\" and/or on \"facts and statements\" that the Member-elect \"considers reliable.\" The Member-elect about whom the objection is made is generally asked to step aside, or to remain seated, while the other Members-elect rise to be collectively administered the oath of office.", "Generally, there are three different procedures that may then be followed with regard to the challenged Member-elect. The House may agree to a resolution to simply seat the Member at that time, determining both \"his prima facie as well as final right to the seat.\" Second, with regard to a Member-elect who presents valid credentials and is \"qualified\" to be a Member, a resolution may be offered to seat the Member-elect provisionally or conditionally (even though those words are not expressly used), based on his or her prima facie right to the seat, by resolving to seat the Member-elect but to refer the question of the final disposition of his or her entitlement to the seat to the appropriate committee of jurisdiction (now the Committee on House Administration). In some instances, the resolution offered to swear in the challenged Member-elect did not expressly provide that condition or mention any election contest filed, but the House later considered the matter of \"election\" on merely a majority vote basis, thus demonstrating, in fact, that the swearing in and \"seating\" was provisional, conditional, or \"without prejudice\" to the House's right to eventually and finally resolve the question of who was \"duly elected.\" As stated by Brown and Johnson in House Practice, A Guide to the Rules, Precedents and Procedures of the House , \"[t]he seating of a Member-elect does not prejudice a contest pending under the Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA) over final right to the seat.\" Third, the resolution may refer both the prima facie right to the seat, as well as the final right to the seat, to the committee without authorizing the swearing in (and seating) of anyone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cases Where Member-elect Was Asked To \"Step Aside\" or \"Remain Seated\" on the First Day of a New Congress", "paragraphs": ["Of the 107 contested election cases considered by the House since 1933, it appears that in at least 15 cases, the Member-elect was asked to \"step aside\" or \"remain seated\" while the oath of office was collectively administered to the other Members-elect on the first day of a new Congress. Of those 15 cases where a Member-elect was asked to step aside, it appears that in at least 2 instances, the Member-elect was subsequently administered the oath on an expressly provisional basis.

In respect to the contestant's charge that not all election board members signed the returns in some precincts and that in others, none signed the returns, the committee stated:", "The Constitutional and statutory provisions relating to suffrage may be divided into two classes: First, mandatory, which defines the right of suffrage; second, directory, which directs the manner of its exercise. The first confers the right, and the last throws safeguards around that right. The laws enacted for the purpose of conserving the right of the elector to exercise his franchise are mandatory or directory depending upon whether the statutes make them so. If the statute provides that unless a certain procedure is followed the election is void, then the law is mandatory. If, however, it prescribes for the doing or not doing of a certain thing in a certain manner by the election officers and fixes a penalty for the disobedience of the law, but does not provide that such violation shall void the election, then it is directory. The rules prescribed by law for conducting an election are designed chiefly to accord an opportunity for the free and fair exercise of the elective franchise to prevent illegal voting, and to ascertain with certainty the result. A departure from the mode prescribed will not vitiate an election, if the irregularities do not deprive any legal voter of his vote, or admit an illegal vote, or cast uncertainty on the result, and has not been occasioned by the agency of a party seeking to derive benefit from them.", "The committee concluded that the contestant had failed to establish fraud in this case.", "Disposition of the contest \u2014H.Res. 386, declaring contestee Burnham to have been duly elected, was passed by the House on May 15, 1934 (78 Cong.
