The commission reviewed prior practice regarding governmental compensation for prisoners of war and the value of benefits already received by the former hostages under other laws in making its recommendation. The commission focused on the obligations it found the U.S. government owes as an employer, and concluded that \"compensation in the tort sense\" was not appropriate. It did, however, recommend a \"token\" payment of tax-exempt detention benefits in the amount of $12.50 per day of captivity, similar to benefits paid to Vietnam prisoners of war and interned civilians as well as to the crew of the USS Pueblo who were detained by the government of North Korea for 11 months in 1968.", "In making this recommendation, the commission was mindful of the fact that the Algiers Accords precluded the former hostages from suing Iran for damages, but agreed with the government's position that this did not constitute a \"taking\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment because:", "(1) the President had statutory and constitutional authority to settle the potential hostage claims; ", "(2) the hostages could not establish for purposes of a taking claim that they suffered an actual uncompensated loss since (a) their claims were settled for considerable value, i.e., their release and (b) their right of action against Iran was of dubious value because of the unlikelihood that the U.S. courts would have been available as a forum in which to sue Iran in light of certain provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.", "The commission recommended that the government \"assume the costs of restoring the hostages to health, provide disability compensation if their health cannot be restored, provide compensation for material losses and safeguard their employment rights and career prospects.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Court Actions", "paragraphs": ["Notwithstanding the Algiers Accords' provision barring lawsuits, many of the former hostages brought suit against Iran for damages.

United States , the United States Claims Court entered summary judgment in favor of the government, holding that the signing of the Algiers Accords did not effect a \"taking\" of private property because it primarily benefited the plaintiffs, the barring of claims was not novel or unexpected or outside the recognized authority of the President, and alternatively, that the presidential decision to bar claims amounted to a political question. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the extinguishment of the plaintiffs' claims was not novel or unexpected, and \"cannot be said to have 'interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations.'\" The appellate court also agreed that the matter was non-justiciable as a political question:", "It involves a policy decision made by the President during a time of crisis. The appellants apparently contend that the President should not have entered into the Algiers Accords because he could have obtained better terms, and that the Accords themselves were illegal because the President was coerced into agreeing to them. The determination whether and upon what terms to settle the dispute with Iran over its holding of the hostages and obtain their release, necessarily was for the President to make in his foreign relations role. That determination was \"of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,\" and there are no \"judicially discoverable and manageable standards\" for reviewing such a Presidential decision. A judicial inquiry into whether the President could have extracted a more favorable settlement would seriously interfere with the President's ability to conduct foreign relations.", "The court concluded that if any compensation of the plaintiffs for their mistreatment and suffering were to be forthcoming, it would have to be provided by \"one of the other 'coordinate branches of government.'\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986", "paragraphs": ["When Congress returned to the issue of compensation for former hostages in 1985, the House Foreign Affairs Committee rejected the amount recommended by the commission in favor of a per diem payment based on the average government allowance for travel.

At the time that the President's Commission on Hostage Compensation presented its findings, many felt that the Commission's recommendation that the hostages receive $12.50 per day for every day in captivity vastly underestimated both the captivity itself and the sympathy of the American people for the captives' plight. Others suggested that any cash award should be upward of $100 per day or more. The per diem rate chosen by the committee is a uniform rate which is a reliable gauge of the Government's obligation to its employees when they are engaged in official business away from the normal duty station.", "This formula would have provided compensation in the amount of $66 per day for each former hostage.

It is substantially similar to Section 122 of S. 1635 , but it provides for compensation for qualifying children of former hostages in the amount of $600,000 and clarifies that, in the event of a deceased former hostage whose estate lacks immediate direct heirs, state intestacy laws will apply and recipients under such laws are to be paid last from the fund. Although the bill expressly includes the estates of qualifying spouses and children, it does not define how or when compensation is distributed in the event there are no immediate direct heirs. Compensation paid under the bill would be exempt from income tax and estate tax requirements under federal law. Because the bill would preclude judicial or administrative review of any decisions made under it, it appears that heirs would be unable to contest decisions denying them compensation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Sanctions Violations Involving Iran", "paragraphs": ["In order to assess how much revenue the fund envisioned by the bills described above could likely be expected to accrue, CRS has compiled data available from several sources in order to estimate the total revenue from penalties and settlement agreements connected with violations of regulations proscribing economic activity with Iran for the calendar years 2005-2014. Information was obtained from the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) website; the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Annual Reports to Congress for the years 2005-2014; and a report of major violations from the Department of Justice. CRS identified 373 penalties stemming at least in part from violations of sanctions against Iran (there may be more than one penalty per violation). The data include criminal fines, forfeitures, significant special assessments, and civil penalties that were reported to have some connection with Iran. Because the data sets are not complete through the time covered, and because it is not always easily ascertained whether the enforcement action summarized pertained to Iran, the following should be considered an estimate only. Moreover, CRS has not undertaken a thorough legal analysis of the bills' language concerning which laws and regulations might be deemed to be included under the definition of covered penalties and settlements. It is not clear, for example, whether laws providing for forfeiture are necessarily included.", "So far in 2015, OFAC and the Department of Justice report a total of $1,958,030,478.00 in forfeitures and fines having to do in part with violations of sanctions against Iran, some of which has gone to state law enforcement and regulatory agencies. It should be noted that a few large penalties primarily against banks account for the bulk of the total, as shown in Table 2 . These large penalties involved violations of other sanctions programs in addition to the Iran sanctions. The imposition of a 30% surcharge could result in a restructuring of future similar settlement agreements in order to isolate the violations related to Iran. As an example of how such restructuring might reduce expected penalties subject to surcharge, it might be useful to survey the case against Credit Agricole resolved in October 2015. Included in the assessment of a total of $787.3 million in civil forfeitures and penalties assessed against Credit Agricole were some factors that might mean that a surcharge would not be applicable. For example, only 16 of the 4,055 transactions found to be in violation of federal economic sanctions laws involved Iranian transactions. Moreover, although all of the civil money penalties were premised on transactions violating the economic sanctions regulations, some of the penalties were imposed pursuant to New York State law or pursuant to federal or state banking laws or regulations. Sanctions relief envisioned under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) addressing Iran's nuclear capabilities could reduce the future expected assessment of penalties, particularly involving foreign banks.
