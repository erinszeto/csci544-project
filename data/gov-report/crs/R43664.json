Subsequently, the Administration opted to screen all unaccompanied children for possible asylum claims. In addition, the TVPRA gives USCIS asylum officers \"initial jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by\" an unaccompanied alien child.", "Only a small portion of the unaccompanied children apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have requested asylum with USCIS thus far.

The treatment of adults and families with children is prescribed by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as notably amended by the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. By contrast, two statutes and a legal settlement (as well as the INA) most directly affect U.S. policy for the treatment and administrative processing of unaccompanied children: the Flores Settlement Agreement of 1997; the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA; P.L. 107-296 ); and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA, P.L. 110-457 ).

Critics of this policy argued that illegal aliens were arriving without proper documents, filing frivolous asylum claims, and obtaining work authorizations while their asylum cases stalled in lengthy backlogs. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the mass exodus of thousands of asylum seekers from Central America, Cuba, and Haiti prompted further concerns that the then-current policy was unwieldy and prone to abuses because it provided for multiple levels of hearings, reviews, and appeals.", "In response, the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA, P.L. 104-208 ) amended the INA to require DHS immigration officers to summarily exclude a foreign national arriving without proper documentation, unless the foreign national expresses a fear of persecution if repatriated. Absent a stated fear, a DHS Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer is allowed to exclude foreign nationals without proper documentation from the United States without placing them in removal proceedings.

Prior to the TVPRA revisions, the unaccompanied child who sought asylum did so during a removal proceeding before an immigration judge in EOIR.

This policy guidance provided that unaccompanied children would have the opportunity to seek asylum during removal proceedings before an EOIR immigration judge. The policy guidance further stated: \"[E]xisting guidelines permit granting a waiver, deferring the inspection, or employing other discretionary means, if applicable, including withdrawing of an application for admission.\" It further directed that expedited removal might be applied to unaccompanied children if the minor has previously been issued a final order of removal, had a criminal record, or engaged in criminal activity in the presence of an INS officer.", "For years after the Flores Settlement , immigration rights and child welfare groups continued to criticize immigration officials who were responsible for unaccompanied children. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) divided responsibilities for the processing and treatment of UAC between the newly created Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). The HSA also established a statutory definition for \"unaccompanied alien children\" as children who lack lawful immigration status in the United States, who are under the age of 18, who are without a parent or legal guardian in the United States, or for whom no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.

More specifically, the TVPRA requires that children from contiguous countries be screened within 48 hours of being apprehended to determine whether they should be returned to their country or transferred to HHS and placed in removal proceedings. In these cases, within 48 hours CBP personnel must screen these unaccompanied children to determine the following: that the child has not been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons and that there is no credible evidence that the minor is at risk should the minor be returned to his country of nationality or of last habitual residence; that the child does not have a possible claim to asylum; and that the child is able to make an independent decision to voluntarily return to his country of nationality or of last habitual residence. Although TVPRA requires the initial CBP screening for unaccompanied children from contiguous countries, in March 2009 DHS issued a policy that, in essence, made the screening provisions applicable to all unaccompanied alien children. Those children who opt not to return voluntarily as well as unaccompanied children from noncontiguous countries are transferred to the care and custody of HHS while they go through formal removal proceedings.

In addition, USCIS has initial jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by unaccompanied alien children with pending claims in immigration court, with a case on appeal before the Board of Immigration Appeals. ", "USCIS guidelines require that the asylum officer conducts \"child-appropriate interviews taking into account age, stage of language development, background, and level of sophistication.\" The guidelines also note that the child's age may affect the analysis of his or her asylum status (e.g., in considering whether the harm the child suffered amounts to persecution, in evaluating the child's possibly limited knowledge of events, etc.). Where a child is unable to identify all relevant motives for the persecution, the guidelines state that \"a nexus can still be found if the objective circumstances support the child's claim that the persecutor targeted the child based on one of the protected grounds.\" If the asylum officer decides that an unaccompanied child in removal proceedings is not eligible for a grant of asylum, case processing will depend on the status of the child's case before EOIR.", " Figure 1 presents a flow chart of the procedures for asylum seekers who are unauthorized adults or unauthorized families with children compared with the procedures for unaccompanied alien children.

In this case, proponents maintain that the children would be afforded a credible fear screening, as adults currently are. Only those who meet the credible fear threshold would be able to request asylum before an EOIR immigration judge during their formal removal proceeding. On the other hand, some call for a more generous \"child-sensitive\" standard of immigration relief for unaccompanied children, particularly those fleeing violence. In this instance, advocates emphasize that the \"best interests of the child\" should be the governing principle, even when it might conflict with the INA provisions on unauthorized migration. Those who support current law assert that the policies in place strike the proper balance, notably by affording unaccompanied children the opportunity to recover from their potentially traumatizing journey before they make their asylum claims.
