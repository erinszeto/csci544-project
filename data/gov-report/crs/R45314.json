The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the government may exclude such aliens without affording them the due process protections that traditionally apply to persons physically present in the United States. Instead, aliens seeking entry are entitled only to those procedural protections that Congress has expressly authorized. Consistent with this broad authority, Congress established an expedited removal process for certain aliens who have arrived in the United States without permission.", "In general, aliens whom immigration authorities seek to remove from the United States may challenge that determination in administrative proceedings with attendant statutory rights to counsel, evidentiary requirements, and appeal. Under the streamlined expedited removal process created by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and codified in Section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), however, certain aliens deemed inadmissible by an immigration officer may be removed from the United States without further administrative hearings or review.", "INA Section 235(b)(1) applies only to certain aliens who are inadmissible into the United States because they either lack valid entry documents or have attempted to procure their admission through fraud or misrepresentation. The statute generally permits the government to summarily remove those aliens if they are arriving in the United States. The statute also authorizes, but does not require, the government to apply this procedure to aliens who are inadmissible on the same grounds if they have been physically present in the country for less than two years.", "As a matter of practice, however, immigration authorities have applied expedited removal in more limited fashion than potentially authorized by statute\u2014in general, the process is applied strictly to (1) arriving aliens apprehended at a designated port of entry; (2) aliens who arrived in the United States by sea without being admitted or paroled into the country by immigration authorities, and who have been physically present in the United States for less than two years; or (3) aliens who are found in the United States within 100 miles of the border within 14 days of entering the country, who have not been admitted or paroled into the United States by immigration authorities. Nevertheless, expedited removal accounts for a substantial portion of the alien removals each year. And in January 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to expand expedited removal within the broader framework of INA Section 235(b)(1). The agency has yet to promulgate regulations implementing this directive.", "In some circumstances, however, an alien subject to expedited removal may be entitled to certain procedural protections before he may be removed from the United States. For example, an alien who expresses a fear of persecution may obtain administrative review of his claim, and if his fear is determined credible the alien will be placed in formal removal proceedings where he can pursue asylum and related protections. Additionally, an alien may seek administrative review of a claim that he is a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, admitted refugee, or asylee. Unaccompanied alien children also are statutorily exempted from expedited removal.", "Given the streamlined nature of expedited removal and the broad discretion afforded to immigration officers to implement that process, challenges have been raised contesting the procedure's constitutionality. In particular, some have argued that the procedure violates aliens' due process rights because aliens placed in expedited removal do not have the opportunity to seek counsel or contest their removal before a judge or other arbiter. Reviewing courts have largely dismissed such challenges for lack of jurisdiction, or, in the alternative, rejected the claims on the grounds that aliens seeking entry into the United States generally do not have constitutional due process protections. But such cases have concerned aliens arriving at the U.S. border or designated ports of entry, and such aliens may be entitled to lesser constitutional protections than aliens located within the United States. Expanding the expedited removal process to aliens located within the interior could compel courts to tackle questions involving the relationship between the federal government's broad power over the entry and removal of aliens and the due process rights of aliens located within the United States."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Federal immigration laws set forth procedures governing the exclusion and removal of non-U.S. nationals (aliens) who do not meet specified criteria regarding their entry or presence within the United States. Typically, aliens within the United States may not be removed without due process. Commensurate with these constitutional protections, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) generally affords an alien whose removal is sought with certain procedural guarantees, including the right to written notice of the charge of removability, to seek counsel, to appear at a hearing before an immigration judge (IJ), to present evidence, to appeal an adverse decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and to seek judicial review.", "Congress, however, has broad authority over the admission of aliens seeking to enter the United States. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the government may exclude an alien seeking to enter this country without affording him the traditional due process protections that otherwise govern formal removal proceedings; instead, an alien seeking initial entry is entitled only to those procedural protections that Congress expressly authorized.", "Consistent with this broad authority, Section 235(b)(1) of the INA provides for the expedited removal of arriving aliens who do not have valid entry documents or have attempted to gain their admission by fraud or misrepresentation. Under this streamlined removal procedure, which Congress established through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996, such aliens may be summarily removed without a hearing or further review. ", "In limited circumstances, however, an alien subject to expedited removal may be entitled to certain procedural protections before he may be removed from the United States. For example, an alien who expresses a fear of persecution may obtain administrative review of his claim and, if the review determines that his fear is credible, the alien will be placed in \"formal\" removal proceedings where he can pursue asylum and related protections. Additionally, an alien may seek administrative review of a claim that he is a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident (LPR), admitted refugee, or asylee. Unaccompanied alien children also are not subject to expedited removal. ", "In addition to providing for expedited removal of certain arriving aliens, INA Section 235(b)(1) also confers the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with the ability to expand the use of expedited removal to aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled if they have been in the country less than two years and do not have valid entry documents or have attempted to gain their admission by fraud or misrepresentation. In practice, the government has employed expedited removal only to (1) arriving aliens; (2) aliens who arrived in the United States by sea within the last two years, who have not been admitted or paroled by immigration authorities; and (3) aliens found in the United States within 100 miles of the border within 14 days of entering the country, who have not been admitted or paroled by immigration authorities.", "Nevertheless, expedited removal is a major component of immigration enforcement, and in recent years, it has been one of the most regularly employed means by which immigration authorities remove persons from the United States. Furthermore, in January 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing DHS to apply expedited removal within the broader limitations of the statute. To date, however, DHS has not yet implemented this policy. ", "This report provides an overview of the statutory and regulatory framework that governs expedited removal under INA Section 235(b)(1). The report also highlights the exceptions to expedited removal, including provisions that permit an alien to seek review of an asylum claim before he may be removed. Finally, the report addresses the scope of judicial review of an expedited removal order, some of the legal challenges that have been raised to the expedited removal process, and briefly considers potential legal issues that may arise if expedited removal were expanded to cover additional categories of aliens present in the United States. A glossary of some terms used frequently throughout this report can be found in Appendix A ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Government's Plenary Power and Constitutional Protections for Aliens Subject to Removal", "paragraphs": ["The Supreme Court has long recognized the federal government's authority \"to expel or exclude aliens\" from the United States. The Court has described this authority as a \"fundamental act of sovereignty\" that stems not only from Congress's legislative power, but also from \"the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation.\" The Court also has repeatedly recognized that an alien's admission into the United States is a privilege, but the alien lacks a vested right to be admitted into the country. ", "Guided by these principles, the Supreme Court has held that the government's decision to exclude an alien from entering the United States generally lies beyond the scope of judicial review. Moreover, the Court has determined, \"the decisions of executive or administrative officers, acting within powers expressly conferred by [C]ongress, are due process of law\" for aliens seeking to enter this country. Thus, the government's decision to deny entry is often deemed \"final and conclusive,\" and immigration officials are fully \"entrusted with the duty of specifying the procedures\" for implementing that authority.", "Initially, the Supreme Court held that the government's broad authority covered not only the expulsion of foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States, but also aliens who were already within the territorial boundaries of this country. The Court explained that \"[t]he right of a nation to expel or deport foreigners who have not been naturalized, or taken any steps towards becoming citizens of the country, rests upon the same grounds, and is as absolute and unqualified, as the right to prohibit and prevent their entrance into the country.\" ", "Gradually, the Supreme Court modified its position regarding the reach of the government's authority. For example, the Court determined that lawfully admitted aliens were entitled to Fifth Amendment due process protections in formal removal proceedings. The Court explained that \"'once an alien lawfully enters and resides in this country he becomes invested with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution to all people within our borders.'\" In these circumstances, the alien is \"entitled to notice of the nature of the charge and a hearing at least before an executive or administrative tribunal.\" ", "The Supreme Court eventually went further and declared that all aliens who have entered the United States\u2014including those who entered unlawfully\u2014may not be removed without due process. The Court declared that aliens physically present in the United States, regardless of their legal status, are recognized as \"persons\" guaranteed due process of law by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Consequently, the Court reasoned, \"[e]ven one whose presence in this country is unlawful, involuntary, or transitory is entitled to that constitutional protection.\" ", "Although the Supreme Court has afforded due process protections to aliens physically present in the United States, the Court has consistently held that aliens seeking to enter the country may not avail themselves of those same protections. The Court has reasoned that, although \"aliens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law,\" an alien \"on the threshold of initial entry stands on a different footing\" because, theoretically, he is outside of the geographic boundaries of the United States, and thus beyond the scope of constitutional protection.", "This distinction, known as the \"entry fiction\" doctrine, allows courts to treat an alien seeking admission as though he had never entered the country, even if he is, technically, physically within U.S. territory, such as at a border checkpoint or airport. In those circumstances, the alien is legally considered to be \"standing on the threshold of entry,\" and outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. By contrast, once an alien \"enters\" the country, \"the legal circumstance changes,\" and he may become subject to constitutional rights and protections. ", "The Supreme Court has applied this principle not only with respect to aliens seeking entry into the United States, but also to aliens seeking entry who are detained within the country's borders pending determinations of their admissibility. For example, in United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy , the German wife of a U.S. citizen challenged her exclusion without a hearing under the War Brides Act. The German national was detained at Ellis Island during her proceedings, and, therefore, technically within U.S. territory. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held that the government had the \"inherent executive power\" to deny her admission, and that \"[w]hatever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.\"", "Similarly, in Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei , an alien detained on Ellis Island for more than 21 months argued that the government's decision to deny admission without a hearing violated due process. Citing \"the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government's political departments,\" the Court determined that the Executive was authorized to deny entry without a hearing, and that the decision was not subject to judicial review. Further, the Court held, although the alien had \"temporary harborage\" inside the United States pending his exclusion proceedings, he had not effected an \"entry\" for purposes of immigration law, and could be \"treated as if stopped at the border.\"", "Therefore, existing Supreme Court jurisprudence recognizes that the federal government has broad plenary power over the admission and exclusion of aliens seeking to enter the United States, and may deny admission without affording due process protections such as the right to a hearing. Aliens seeking entry are thus generally entitled only to those protections that Congress explicitly authorized. Conversely, an alien who has entered the United States is generally entitled to due process protections prior to removal. Under the \"entry fiction\" doctrine, however, aliens who are detained within the United States pending a determination of their admissibility may be \"treated, for constitutional purposes\" as though they have not entered this country. The extent to which the entry fiction doctrine may apply to aliens who are already within the United States remains an unresolved question. While some courts have held that aliens apprehended near the U.S. border may be treated as though they had not effected an entry into the country, the degree to which this principle may be applied to aliens within the interior of the United States is unclear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Creation of the Expedited Removal Process", "paragraphs": ["Congress established the expedited removal process when it enacted IIRIRA in 1996. Before IIRIRA, federal immigration law distinguished between arriving aliens and aliens who had entered the United States. Based on this distinction, there were two types of proceedings to determine whether an alien should be removed: exclusion proceedings, which were \"the usual means of proceeding against an alien outside the United States seeking admission,\" and deportation proceedings, which applied to aliens \"already physically in the United States.\" In both types of proceedings, however, the alien had statutory rights to counsel, a hearing, and administrative and judicial review before he could be removed from the United States.", "Confronted with what it perceived as mounting levels of unlawful migration, Congress enacted IIRIRA in 1996 and made sweeping changes to the federal immigration laws. One major shift was to replace the exclusion/deportation framework, which turned on whether an alien had physically entered the United States, with a new framework that turned on whether an alien had been lawfully admitted into the country by immigration authorities. Under the new framework, aliens who were lawfully admitted could be removed from the United States if they fell under the grounds of deportability listed in INA Section 237(a). On the other hand, aliens who had not been admitted into the United States\u2014whether first arriving to the United States or having entered the country without being lawfully admitted\u2014could be denied admission and removed from the United States if they fell under the grounds of inadmissibility listed in INA Section 212(a). ", "Secondly, IIRIRA removed the distinction between deportation and exclusion proceedings. Instead, it established a standard, \"formal\" removal proceeding under INA Section 240 applicable to aliens regardless of whether they are charged with being inadmissible or deportable. These formal removal proceedings generally entail the same statutory rights and protections that previously governed deportation proceedings. ", "IIRIRA also created a new, expedited removal process generally required for certain arriving aliens. This expedited removal process, codified in INA Section 235, does not apply to all arriving aliens who are believed inadmissible, but only to those who are inadmissible because they lack valid entry documents or have attempted to procure their admission through fraud or misrepresentation.", "Under this new procedure, the federal government could summarily remove these aliens without a hearing or further review unless they expressed an intent to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution. In a separate provision, Congress gave the Attorney General (now the Secretary of DHS) \"the sole and unreviewable discretion\" to apply this procedure to \"certain other aliens\" inadmissible on the same grounds if (1) they were not admitted or paroled into the United States, and (2) they could not establish that they have been physically present in the United States continuously for two years at the time of their apprehension. ", " Table 1 illustrates the differences between expedited removal proceedings, pre-IIRIRA deportation/exclusion proceedings, and post-IIRIRA formal removal proceedings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation and Expansion of Expedited Removal", "paragraphs": ["Following IIRIRA, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initially applied the new expedited removal authority to circumstances mandated by the governing statute (i.e., to arriving aliens), and not to other circumstances where the Attorney General was authorized (but not required) to exercise such authority. In addition, because the expedited removal provisions exempted aliens from countries in the Western Hemisphere whose governments did not have full diplomatic relations with the United States, and who arrived by aircraft at a port of entry, Cuban nationals who arrived in the United States by aircraft were not subject to expedited removal. ", "While the expedited removal statute governs the removal of certain aliens who are \"arriving\" in the United States, it does not define this group. When promulgating regulations implementing the new expedited removal authority, the INS defined the term \"arriving alien\" to include (1) aliens seeking admission into the United States at a port of entry, (2) aliens seeking transit through the United States at a port of entry, and (3) aliens who have been interdicted at sea and brought into the United States \"by any means, whether or not to a designated port-of-entry, and regardless of the means of transport.\" ", "Over the years, however, the INS and its successor agency DHS gradually expanded the implementation of expedited removal authority to cover (1) aliens who entered the United States by sea without being admitted or paroled by immigration authorities, and who have been in the country less than two years; (2) aliens apprehended within 100 miles of the U.S. border within 14 days of entering the country, and who have not been admitted or paroled by immigration authorities; and, (3) ultimately, Cuban nationals who met the criteria for expedited removal. But despite these expansions, the agency has never employed expedited removal to the full degree authorized by INA Section 235(b)(1), which would include both arriving aliens and, potentially, all aliens physically present in the United States without being admitted or paroled who have been in the country less than two years and who fall under the expedited removal statute's specified grounds of inadmissibility.", " Table 2 shows how the INS and DHS implemented their expedited removal authority since 1997.

Aliens who arrived in the United States by sea, who have not been admitted or paroled, and who have been in this country for less than two years. 3. Aliens who are encountered within 100 miles of the border, who have not been admitted or paroled, and who have been in the United States for less than 14 days. ", "Aliens in these categories are subject to expedited removal only if they fall under the grounds of inadmissibility found in INA Section 212(a)(6)(C) and (a)(7). These grounds of inadmissibility generally apply to aliens who lack valid entry documents or who attempt to procure admission through fraud or misrepresentation.", "More specifically, the two inadmissibility grounds apply to the following:", "An alien who is not in possession of (1) a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document; and (2) a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or document of identity and nationality if required under applicable regulations. This provision applies, for example, to aliens who arrive with proper documents for entry into the United States for certain purposes, but who intend to enter the United States for reasons that require different authorizing documents. An alien whose immigrant visa has been issued in violation of the provisions regarding the numerical limitations on the distribution of immigrant visas. An alien whose passport will expire within six months after his authorized period of stay in the United States. An alien who is not in possession of a valid nonimmigrant visa or border crossing identification card at the time of his application for admission.

An alien who falsely represents (or has falsely represented) himself to be a U.S. citizen. ", "Importantly, expedited removal is available in cases where the alien is charged only with being inadmissible under these grounds.

The alien will also be barred from reentering the United States for five years, with lengthier or even permanent bars to admission if special factors are present.", "While expedited removal is a more streamlined process than formal removal proceedings, it nonetheless can involve a number of determinations by multiple agencies and agency subcomponents\u2014particularly in cases where an alien intends to apply for asylum or expresses a more generalized fear of persecution that could potentially render the alien eligible for relief from removal. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the DHS component with primary responsibility for immigration enforcement along the border and at designated ports of entry, typically takes the lead role in the expedited removal process, from the initial inspection or apprehension of the alien through the issuance of an order of expedited removal. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the DHS component primarily responsible for interior enforcement and removal, also regularly plays a significant role, such as when the alien seeks asylum or expresses a fear of persecution, and ICE takes responsibility for the alien's detention and removal. Another DHS component, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), is responsible for interviewing aliens who have claimed a fear of persecution and assesses whether such claims are credible. If such claims are not deemed credible, the agency may issue an expedited removal order. Finally, IJs within the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review may become involved in the expedited removal process when either (1) an IJ is asked to review a USCIS determination that an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution or (2) in the event that an alien is determined to have a credible fear, the alien is placed in formal removal proceedings before an IJ where the alien's claim for relief can be adjudicated.", "The following sections provide further explanation of the expedited removal process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inspection", "paragraphs": ["An alien arriving in the United States or an alien present in the United States who has not been admitted is considered an \"applicant for admission\" who is subject to inspection by an immigration officer.

In order to make that determination, the immigration officer may obtain statements under oath about the purpose and intention of the applicant in coming to the United States. DHS regulations provide that \"[i]nterpretative assistance shall be used if necessary to communicate with the alien.\"", "At other locations (e.g., in cases where the alien is found between ports of entry), an alien who is apprehended by immigration authorities is typically taken to a U.S. Border Patrol station for inspection and processing to determine whether the alien is inadmissible and subject to expedited removal."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadmissibility Determination and Issuance of Expedited Removal Order", "paragraphs": ["DHS regulations provide that, if an immigration officer determines that an alien is inadmissible and subject to expedited removal, the officer must prepare a Record of Sworn Statement in Proceedings (Form I-867), which contains the facts of the case and any statements made by the alien.

Applying this standard, the court found that an arriving alien's contention that his expedited removal violated his right to counsel lacked merit because nonadmitted aliens have no right to representation, and \"are entitled only to whatever process Congress provides.\" By contrast, in another unlawful reentry case, the Ninth Circuit held that an alien was entitled to due process during his expedited removal proceedings because he was already within the United States when he was apprehended, and that the immigration officer's failure to provide the alien notice of his inadmissibility charge and an opportunity to review his sworn statement violated due process.

As discussed in this report, an alien subject to a final order of removal generally may file a petition for review of that order in the judicial circuit where the administrative removal proceedings were completed. The courts of appeals, however, have dismissed petitions for review challenging expedited removal orders, citing INA Section 242(a)(2)(A)'s language barring judicial review of claims arising in the context of expedited removal proceedings.

Thus, DHS has the statutory authority to expand expedited removal on a much larger geographic and temporal scale.

In response, some immigrant rights advocates reportedly \"denounced the proposed expansion ... warning that the policy would strip more immigrants of due process rights to seek asylum or other legal protections that would allow them to remain in the country.\" ", "While federal statute clearly confers DHS with authority to employ expedited removal in a broader fashion, extending the process to aliens away from the border or its functional equivalent would likely prompt legal challenge. As previously discussed, the Supreme Court has long recognized that, while aliens seeking entry into the United States have no constitutional rights regarding their applications for admission, aliens who have entered the United States, even unlawfully, are entitled to some due process protections before they can be removed. Such due process protections typically involve the right to a hearing and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. As discussed in this report, an alien subject to expedited removal has no right to a hearing or further review of a determination that he should be removed from the United States. Thus, expanding expedited removal to cover aliens present in any part of the United States could come into conflict with these constitutional notions. Moreover, although some courts have, in light of the entry fiction doctrine, determined that aliens apprehended near the border may not avail themselves of these constitutional protections, the extent to which this principle may be applied to aliens in the interior, or who have developed ties to the United States, is far from certain.", "However, the Supreme Court, at times, has appeared to view admission into the United States by immigration authorities as the key factor that determines whether an alien is entitled to constitutional protections. For example, in Landon v. Plasencia , the Supreme Court stated that \"once an alien gains admission to our country and begins to develop the ties that go with permanent residence his constitutional status changes accordingly.\" The Court has also suggested that the length of time that an alien has spent in the United States may inform the scope and degree of constitutional protections. These principles might support the argument that expedited removal can be applied on a wider basis to aliens within the interior of the United States who have been in the country for relatively short periods of time.", "But notwithstanding the language in Landon, the Supreme Court has continued to describe an alien's physical presence in the United States, whether lawful or unlawful, as the critical factor in assessing whether due process attaches. Therefore, if DHS undertakes a future expansion of expedited removal, the courts may be confronted with further challenges to the agency's implementation of that procedure down the road. Until now, courts have addressed such challenges only within the confines of enforcement actions at or near the border. If DHS implements expedited removal on a broader scale throughout the United States, the courts may need to address critical questions concerning the scope of the federal government's plenary power over the admission of aliens, and the limits of that \"sovereign prerogative\" with respect to aliens already present in the United States. ", "Appendix A. Glossary", "Appendix B. Implementation and Expansion of Expedited Removal: 1997-2017", "The following discussion is a more comprehensive overview of the Executive's implementation and expansion of expedited removal following the passage of IIRIRA in 1996.", "Arriving Aliens", "Initially, the former INS limited the application of its expedited removal authority to aliens arriving in the United States. In order to clarify the scope of the term \"arriving alien,\" the INS issued regulations that defined the term to include aliens seeking admission into the United States at a port of entry, aliens seeking transit through the United States at a port of entry, and aliens who have been interdicted at sea and brought into the United States \"by any means, whether or not to a designated port-of-entry, and regardless of the means of transport.\" ", "In response to opposition to the inclusion of aliens interdicted at sea in the definition of \"arriving alien,\" the INS pointed to BIA precedent holding that \"the mere crossing into the territorial waters of the United States has never satisfied the test of having entered the United States,\" and reasoned that \"[a]liens who have not yet established physical presence on land in the United States cannot be considered as anything other than arriving aliens.\" Furthermore, the INS declared, \"[t]he inclusion of aliens interdicted at sea in the definition of arriving alien will support the Department's mandate to protect the nation's borders against illegal immigration.\"", "The INS further determined that \"[a]n arriving alien remains an arriving alien even if paroled pursuant to INA Section 212(d)(5), and even after any such parole is terminated or revoked.\" The INS explained that the inclusion of paroled aliens was based on the language of INA Section 212(d)(5), which indicated that the parole of an alien did not constitute an admission into the United States, and that the alien would be considered an applicant for admission once the purpose of the parole had been served. ", "Looking ahead, the INS \"reserve[d] the right to apply expedited removal procedures to additional classes of aliens within the limits set by the statute , if, in the Commissioner's discretion, such action is operationally warranted.\" This expanded category of aliens, the INS explained, \"may be localized, in response to specific needs within a particular region, or nationwide, as appropriate.\" The agency declared that \"a proposed expansion of the expedited removal procedures may occur at any time and may be driven either by specific situations such as a sudden influx of illegal aliens motivated by political or economic unrest or other events or by a general need to increase the effectiveness of enforcement operations at one or more locations.\" ", "The INS, however, recognized that expanding the reach of expedited removal would \"involve more complex determinations of fact and will be more difficult to manage,\" and indicated that, for the time being, it would apply the new procedures \"on a more limited and controlled basis.\" Therefore, upon IIRIRA's passage, the new expedited removal statute covered only arriving aliens in the United States, which, in turn, encompassed (1) aliens arriving at a port of entry, (2) aliens in transit at a port of entry, and (3) aliens interdicted at sea who have been brought into the United States. Nevertheless, at the outset, the INS's expedited removal authority \"dramatically affect[ed] the pool of persons subject to expedited procedures.\"", "Criminal Aliens Held in Texas Correctional Facilities (Proposed but Not Implemented)", "In 1999, the INS considered, but ultimately did not implement, a \"pilot program\" that would have extended expedited removal to aliens who (1) had been convicted of unlawful entry; (2) had not been admitted or paroled into the United States, and had been physically present in the United States for less than two years; and (3) were serving criminal sentences in designated correctional facilities in Texas. ", "To support its proposed expansion, the INS cited INA Section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii) and its implementing regulations, which gave it the authority to apply expedited removal to aliens who entered the United States without being admitted or paroled, and who have not been in the United States for at least two years. Citing a lack of detention space and an increase in the number of criminal alien apprehensions, the INS determined that a more effective procedure to remove aliens serving short criminal sentences was warranted. Despite this proposed expansion, neither the INS nor DHS implemented this policy.", "Aliens Who Arrived in the United States by Sea", "In 2002, the INS authorized expedited removal for a \"newly designated class\" of aliens: those who arrived in the United States by sea, \"either by boat or other means,\" and who (1) have not been admitted or paroled, and (2) have not been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least two years at the time of their apprehension. As it had done before, the INS cited INA Section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii) as the statutory authority for expanding expedited removal to aliens \"who arrive illegally by sea.\" The INS noted that this expansion did not include aliens who arrived in the United States at a designated port of entry, or who were interdicted at sea and brought into the United States, because they were already subject to the expedited removal process for arriving aliens. In addition, the INS did not apply its expansion to Cuban nationals who arrived in the United States by sea because of the \"longstanding U.S. policy to treat Cubans differently from other aliens.\"", "Therefore, apart from Cuban nationals, all aliens who unlawfully arrived by sea in the United States, in a location other than a port of entry, would now be subject to expedited removal, and, with limited exceptions, detained pending any determination as to whether they had a credible fear of persecution. The INS claimed that this expansion would \"assist in deterring surges in illegal migration by sea, including potential mass migration, and preventing loss of life.\" The agency explained that \"[a] surge in illegal migration by sea threatens national security by diverting valuable U.S. Coast Guard and other resources from counterterrorism and homeland security responsibilities.\" In addition, channeling the original legislative intent behind IIRIRA's amendments, the agency determined that its decision was \"necessary to remove quickly from the United States aliens who arrive illegally by sea and who do not establish a credible fear.\" The INS thus announced that it would implement expedited removal for aliens who arrived in this country by sea on or after November 13, 2002.", "Aliens Unlawfully Present in the United States Within 100 Miles of\u00a0the Border", "A few years later, in 2004, DHS (which had now replaced the INS) authorized CBP to implement expedited removal for aliens who were unlawfully present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, if (1) they were apprehended within 100 miles of the border, and (2) they had not been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least 14 days. As the statutory basis for this expansion, the agency again cited INA Section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii), which gave it the discretion to apply expedited removal to aliens who were physically present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, and who could not establish their continuous physical presence in this country for up to two years. ", "In support of its decision to extend expedited removal to border areas, DHS pointed to \"an urgent need to enhance [its] ability to improve the safety and security of the nation's land borders, as well as the need to deter foreign nationals from undertaking dangerous border crossings, and thereby prevent the needless deaths and crimes associated with human trafficking and alien smuggling operations.\" DHS thus determined that expanding the reach of expedited removal to aliens encountered shortly after they unlawfully entered the United States through the border would improve national security, \"increase the deterrence of illegal entries by ensuring that apprehension quickly leads to removal,\" and \"impair the ability of smuggling organizations to operate.\"", "Ultimately, though, DHS limited its new designation of expedited removal to aliens who were neither nationals of Mexico nor Canada, and Mexican and Canadian nationals who had histories of criminal or immigration violations. With regard to non-Mexican and non-Canadian nationals (\"third-country nationals\"), DHS explained that there were logistical difficulties of initiating formal removal proceedings against nearly 1 million aliens apprehended each year, particularly along the southern border with Mexico, and that, while the majority of those aliens were Mexican nationals who could be \"voluntarily returned\" to Mexico without any formal removal process, aliens from other countries could not simply be returned to Mexico. Instead, they had to be detained pending arrangements for their return by aircraft, or pending formal removal proceedings. Given the agency's lack of resources to detain all third-country nationals, DHS explained, many of these aliens were released with instructions to appear for their removal proceedings, only to subsequently disappear in the United States. For these reasons, DHS had a greater incentive to apply expedited removal to third-country nationals in border areas, than it did for Mexican and Canadian nationals. On the other hand, given the agency's interest in improving national security and public safety, Mexican and Canadian nationals with prior criminal or immigration violations would be subject to expedited removal.", "DHS also limited the scope of its new expedited removal designation to border areas. The agency recognized that INA Section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii) did not geographically restrict expedited removal for aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, and that the statute permitted expedited removal for aliens who could not establish their continuous physical presence in this country for up to two years. Nevertheless, the agency concentrated its enforcement resources \"upon unlawful entries that have a close spatial and temporal nexus to the border.\" Therefore, instead of implementing expedited removal nationwide, DHS limited it to \"aliens who are apprehended immediately proximate to the land border and have negligible ties or equities in the U.S.\" The agency determined that an area within 100 miles of the border was \"immediately proximate\" to the border \"because many aliens will arrive in vehicles that speedily depart the border area, and because other recent arrivals will find their way to near-border locales seeking transportation to other locations within the interior of the U.S.\" DHS also cited to agency regulations that had already established that the 100-mile range was a \"reasonable distance\" from the external boundary of the United States. ", "Accordingly, DHS limited its new application of expedited removal to aliens apprehended within 14 days after they entered the United States, and within 100 miles of any international land border. Aliens falling into this category would be detained pending their removal and any determination as to whether they feared persecution. Consistent with other expedited removal designations, however, DHS excluded Cuban nationals because their removal to Cuba \"[could not] presently be assured and for other U.S. policy reasons.\" ", "DHS indicated that it would implement expedited removal for aliens apprehended in border areas beginning on August 11, 2004. Based on this latest expansion, DHS could now apply its expedited removal authority not only to aliens who arrived in the United States at ports of entry or by sea, but also to aliens who were encountered within this country's border regions between ports of entry.", "Expansion to Entire Southwest Border", "Initially, DHS limited the implementation of its new expedited removal authority to parts of the southwestern United States, specifically the border sectors of Tucson, Arizona; Yuma, Arizona; McAllen, Texas; Laredo, Texas; San Diego, California; and El Centro, California. On September 14, 2005, DHS announced the expansion to three additional border sectors in Del Rio, TX; Marfa, TX; and El Paso, TX\u2014thereby implementing the policy across the entire Southwest border. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, who headed the agency at the time, declared that the expansion \"gives Border Patrol agents the ability to gain greater control of our borders and to protect our country against the terrorist threat.\" Further, according to DHS, the expedited removal process \"will disrupt the vicious human smuggling cycle that occurs along the southwest border.\" Following the announcement, DHS implemented expedited removal along the entire land border with Mexico.", "Expansion to Entire U.S. Border", "A few months later, on January 30, 2006, DHS announced the implementation of expedited removal along the entire U.S.-Canadian border and all U.S. coastal areas. Noting decreased unlawful border crossings since expedited removal began in the southwestern United States, Secretary Chertoff asserted that expanding the process along all borders \"will provide DHS agents and officers with an additional tool to protect our nation's boundaries and quickly remove those who entered our country illegally.\" According to the agency, expedited removal had proven to be \"an effective border management process that swiftly returns illegal aliens to their countries of origin while maintaining protections for those who fear persecution.\" DHS also pointed to the disruption of \"human smuggling cycles\" as a factor warranting the expansion of expedited removal. Therefore, with this expansion in place, DHS could now implement expedited removal in the northern border sectors of Blaine, WA; Spokane, WA; Havre, MT; Grand Forks, ND; Detroit, MI; Buffalo, NY; Swanton, VT; and Houlton, ME.", "Cuban Nationals Arriving in the United States", "On July 20, 2015, the United States formally restored diplomatic relations with Cuba. In addition, on January 12, 2017, former President Barack Obama announced an end to the long-standing \"wet-foot, dry-foot\" policy, which allowed Cubans who arrived on American soil the right to remain in the United States and apply for lawful permanent resident status, while those who were detained at sea were returned to Cuba.", "In response to the restoration of diplomatic relations, DHS eliminated the exception to expedited removal for Cuban nationals who arrive in the United States at a designated port of entry by aircraft. The agency observed, moreover, that the policy justifications for exempting Cuban nationals were no longer valid given Cuba's agreement to facilitate the return of Cuban nationals ordered removed from the United States. In addition, DHS determined that \"a significant increase in attempts by Cuban nationals to illegally enter the United States\" meant that an exception for Cuban nationals would significantly undermine efforts to remove aliens who had no authorization to be in this country. Therefore, Cuban nationals who arrived in the United States at a designated port of entry by aircraft were now subject to expedited removal.", "DHS additionally eliminated the exception for Cuban nationals who arrive in the United States by sea, who have not been admitted or paroled, and who have not been physically present in this country for less than two years. DHS also removed the exception for Cuban nationals who are encountered within 100 miles of the border, who have not been admitted or paroled, and who have not been in the United States for less than 14 days. The agency again cited the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba and other \"significant changes\" in the relationship between the two countries as factors that warranted a change in policy that \"reflect[ed] these new realities.\" Therefore, regardless of the manner in which they came to the United States, Cuban nationals were now subject to expedited removal if they met the statutory criteria for that process."], "subsections": []}]}}
