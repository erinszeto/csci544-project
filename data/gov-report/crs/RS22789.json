That legislation sought to protect the women and children most often the victims of both international and domestic trafficking with a series of diplomatic, immigration, and law enforcement initiatives. H.R. 3887 follows in its path. This report is limited to the bill's law enforcement initiatives or more precisely its proposals to amend federal criminal law.", "Representative Lantos introduced H.R. 3887 on October 17, 2007, for himself and several other Members. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs reported an amended version of the bill on November 6, 2007. A further revised version passed under suspension of the rules on December 4, 2007. When the bill reached the Senate its criminal law proposals included newly assigned sex trafficking offenses, a sex tourism offense, a coerced services offense, obstruction of justice offenses, an importation of prostitutes offense, a false statement offense, and provisions for civil liability, victim assistance, forfeiture, extraterritorial jurisdiction, Justice Department reorganization, and a model state statute.", "This is an abridged version of CRS Report RL34323, William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 3887 as Passed by the House): Criminal Law Provisions, by [author name scrubbed] without the footnotes, quotations, or citations to authority found in the longer report."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sex Trafficking (Subsections 221(a) and 221(f))", "paragraphs": ["Section 221, among other things, offers two new sex trafficking offenses.

The other, sex trafficking (proposed 18 U.S.C. 2430), expands federal jurisdiction to reach persuasion, inducement, or enticement to engage in unlawful prostitution when it occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce, without regard to the age of the beguiled or the absence of coercion, fraud, or force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aggravated Sex Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["Proposed 18 U.S.C. 2429 would condemn knowingly recruiting, enticing, harboring, transporting, providing or obtaining another individual, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or within U.S. special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, with the knowledge that the individual would be used to engage in a commercial sex act either as child or through force, fraud or coercion. The proposed section would condemn profiting from such a venture as well. In either case, offenders would face imprisonment for any term of years not less than 15 years or for life (not less than 10 years if the child were 14 years of age or older).

It features a more expansive jurisdictional base than 18 U.S.C. 1591. The proposed section would match the jurisdiction reach of Section 1591 and its proposed replacement Section 2429 (in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, etc.), but unlike those sections, Section 2430 would cover attempted violations. It would also cover persuasion, inducement or enticement to commit consensual acts of prostitution involving only adults (i.e., unlike Section 1591 and proposed Section 2429, it would not require that the offense involve either a child under the age of 18 or the use of fraud, force, or coercion as a means of persuasion, inducement or enticement). It would prohibit persuasion, inducement or enticement of an adult to engage in a commercial sex act when it would affect interstate commerce. Such conduct is only a federal crime now if actual interstate or foreign travel is involved.

In its current form, Section 1592 proscribes the knowing destruction, concealment, or possession of another person's passport or similar documentation, either (1) in the course of a trafficking offense, or (2) with the intent to commit a trafficking offense, or (3) to unlawfully restrict the travel of a trafficking victim.

First, it streamlines the document-seizure prohibition. Second, like Section 1589, it outlaws obtaining labor or services through an abuse of authority or legal process. Unlike Section 1589 which only applies to forced labor, it outlaws such abuse when used to obtain either labor or commercial sex acts. Third, like Section 1589, it outlaws obtaining labor or services using a threat of harm.

As a general rule, restoration or remission is only possible where the claimant has or had a legally-recognized interest in the confiscated property and where the claimant played no part in the offense which gave rise to the forfeiture. The proposed amendments appear designed to overcome the second limitation; they permit victims to recover notwithstanding their participation in the confiscation-triggering offense. The courts, however, may find in the use of the terms \"restoration and remission\" an intent to continue in place the ownership requirement. Under the proposals, exploited victims might be thought entitled to no more than the return of property that can be shown to once have been theirs. It seems possible that rather than permitting victims to recover property confiscated from them because of violations of the peonage and trafficking laws, drafters intended to require or permit victim restitution to be paid out of forfeited assets of their oppressors.
