Collecting statistics and facts on the condition and progress of education was the core function of the earliest version of the Office of Education (P.L. 39-73, enacted March 2, 1867). However, a coordinated national undertaking resembling today's research and statistics effort did not begin to take shape until the mid-1970s with the creation of the National Institute of Education (NIE) under the Education Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-318) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) under the Education Amendments of 1974 ( P.L. 93-380 ). In 1985, the NIE was replaced by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) through executive authority. The present-day federal educational research and statistics effort is carried out by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), which replaced OERI in 2002 through provisions adopted with the passage of the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA, Title I of P.L. 107-279 ).", "ESRA established IES as an independent research institute housed within the Department of Education (ED) headed by a Director, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve a term of six years. ESRA also established a technical panel composed primarily of researchers, the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES), to advise the Director on the policies of the institute and approve research priorities and procedures for technical and scientific peer review. Additionally, this panel is charged with assessing the progress of IES and making recommendations for improvement.", "ESRA established three National Education Centers to conduct the work of IES in three areas: the National Center for Education Research (NCER), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE). Subsequently, P.L. 108-446 , which reauthorized the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), amended ESRA by adding a fourth center to operate within IES, the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER). ", "Along with ESRA, P.L. 107-279 enacted two additional acts\u2014the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA, Title II of P.L. 107-279 ) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA, Title III of P.L. 107-279 ). ETAA authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local entities for the purpose of supporting varied technical assistance activities and to states for statewide, longitudinal data systems. NAEPAA authorizes the Commissioner of Education Statistics to carry out a national assessment, state assessments, and a long-term trend assessment in reading and mathematics in grades 4, 8, and 12.", "Overall, while many changes that affect federal educational research and statistics activities were enacted through ESRA, among the particularly prominent changes were those leading to the creation of an independent research institute and those specifying \"scientifically-based\" or \"scientifically-valid\" standards for research. Under the provisions of ESRA, IES operates as an independent institute and is afforded more freedom from ED than OERI had as an office (headed by an Assistant Secretary) within ED. At the same time, ESRA provides for greater oversight of the work and work processes of IES by a technical panel (NBES) in comparison to what was required under provisions in OERI's authorizing legislation. ESRA also notably goes further than prior authorizing legislation in terms of specifying standards for educational research supported under the act. Specifically, ESRA defines and requires scientifically based research standards, scientifically valid research, and scientifically valid educational evaluations. Collectively the provisions outlining and requiring adherence to these \"scientifically-based\" or \"scientifically-valid\" standards have in effect signaled that methodological rigor is a top priority for IES-supported research.
