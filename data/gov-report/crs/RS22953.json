{"id": "RS22953", "title": "Regulation of Real Estate Appraisers", "released_date": "2012-06-26T00:00:00", "summary": ["Real estate appraisers attempt to measure the value of a property that is being purchased or refinanced. In mortgage contracts, the property serves as collateral for the loan. Banks and their regulators may rely on the appraisal to reduce the potential losses if the borrower fails to repay the loan. Property purchasers may also rely on an appraisal if they wish to reassure themselves that the price they offered was reasonable given market conditions. This report discusses the regulation of appraisers and provides information on related statutes and rules.", "The fallout from the housing bubble raised questions about the effectiveness of the regulation of residential real estate appraisers before and during the financial crisis. Real estate prices rose rapidly in some areas, then fell rapidly. When the real estate bubble burst, questions arose about the accuracy of the appraisals that supported the mortgage loans during the housing bubble.", "Traditionally, regulation of real estate appraisers was handled at the state level, with a federal agency, the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC), overseeing the state boards that licensed and certified appraisers. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act, P.L. 111-203) increased federal requirements for real estate appraisers and transferred some federal oversight powers from banking regulators to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).", "The Appraisal Foundation, a professional organization, issues the specific standards for conducting appraisals. These standards form the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), but are not federal law. The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) of the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (FFIEC) provides some of the funding for the Appraisal Foundation and oversees its activities.", "Business practices of banks and securities firms that offer or purchase a large share of mortgages can influence appraisal standards. The rules that banking regulators and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) set for these institutions can influence industry-wide standards, even when the rules do not technically apply to all firms. During the financial crisis, the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC) was an informal industry standard created as part of a settlement between the attorney general of New York and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are regulated by the FHFA. The Dodd-Frank Act included a sunset provision for the HVCC, and directed the banking regulators to propose interim regulations until the CFPB began operating.", "Title XIV, subtitle F of the Dodd-Frank Act included other changes to the regulation of real estate appraisals. Major provisions of subtitle F include a requirement of a property visit for appraisals of a home financed by a high-risk mortgage; conditions for a second appraisal at no cost to the home purchaser; mandated independence for appraisers; portability of some residential property appraisals; rules for customary and reasonable fees; standards for appraiser education; and a mandatory annual report to Congress by the ASC on its activities.", "The ASC, banking regulators, and the CFPB are proposing and implementing several new rules. For example, the agencies issued an interim final rule for reasonable and customary fees for appraisers, as required by Section 1472 of the Dodd-Frank Act."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Real Estate Price Volatility and Appraisal Regulation", "paragraphs": ["Appraisers provide an estimate of the value of real estate prior to the completion of a sale or refinance of the property. Lenders typically rely on independent real estate appraisers because the property serves as collateral for the loan used to finance the transaction. The lender is in a position to seize and sell the property if the borrower defaults. Borrowers who are purchasing or refinancing the property may also desire an appraisal in order to reassure themselves that the price of the property is in line with an objective evaluation of its value. Either the buyer or the seller may be dissatisfied with the property appraisal if prices rise or fall rapidly after the sale; as a result, reexamination of appraisal regulation is not unusual following a real estate related financial crisis. ", "Current regulation of property appraisals is based on legislation passed following two financial crises linked to real estate bubbles. Legislation governing appraisal regulation includes Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA, P.L. 101-73 ) enacted after the Savings and Loan Crisis, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act, P.L. 111-203 ) enacted after the Subprime Mortgage Crisis. In addition to the changes included in the Dodd-Frank Act, requirements for appraiser independence were included in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008.", "FIRREA created a federal framework to oversee the state licensing and certification of real estate appraisers. It did so by establishing the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) within the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (FFIEC), but the licensing and certifying of appraisers was left to the states. FIRREA required the states to establish licensing and certification requirements and to coordinate through the ASC and a nongovernmental organization, the Appraisal Foundation, which establishes the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Federal banking regulators established the threshold for requiring an appraisal for federally related loans, and the states created appraisal boards to license and certify appraisers. ", "The mortgage crisis that began in 2007 has primarily affected residential properties, not commercial properties. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred some of the regulation of residential mortgages to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), established more specific criteria for residential property appraisals and the appraiser profession, and also required a property visit for appraisals financed by a high risk residential mortgage. Other changes mandated in the DFA include mandated independence for appraisers, requiring regulators to establish customary and reasonable fees for appraisal activities, requiring that banks separate the loan officers who underwrite loans from the people who pick the appraisers, and establishing standards for the professional education of licensed and certified appraisers. ", "The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA, P.L. 110-289 ) included a provision designed to increase the independence of appraisers. It prohibited mortgage lenders, mortgage brokers, mortgage bankers, real estate brokers, appraisal management companies, employees of appraisal management companies, and any other people with an interest in a real estate transaction from improperly influencing, or attempting to improperly influence, the development, reporting, result, or review of a real estate appraisal in connection with a federally related mortgage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federally Related Mortgage Transactions", "paragraphs": ["Federal regulation of appraisals is typically linked to federally related transactions.

It also includes any loans originated with the intent to be eligible for sale to the housing government sponsored enterprises (GSEs). However, not all property sales and transfers require a mortgage; therefore, there are some property transactions for which federal appraisal regulation would have limited applicability.

In the agreement, the New York attorney general agreed to end the state investigation of Fannie Mae if Fannie Mae agreed to purchase mortgages only from banks that did not conduct home appraisals in-house. A similar agreement was reached with Freddie Mac, the other secondary mortgage market GSE.
