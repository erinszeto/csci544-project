Issues under debate include the pros and cons of deepened trade relations withLatin America and the Caribbean, and whether the current focus on bilateral and regional FTAs isthe most appropriate trade policy. Some analysts do not believe that such a policy is a good ideabecause it is creating a complicated network of trade agreements throughout the region could slowdown the FTAA process.

RTAs may be categorized as bilateral, multilateral,or sub-regional. With no formal definitions, these terms are sometimes used loosely to describevarious groupings. A bilateral trade agreement is usually an agreement between two countries toreduce tariffs and quotas on items between themselves. While this definition seemingly indicatesan agreement between just two countries, it is sometimes used to describe trade agreementsinvolving more than two countries. ", "There are a number of types of arrangements including free trade agreements, customsunions, common markets, and economic unions. (1) Free trade agreements (FTAs) are the most common form ofregional economic integration in which members of a group remove tariffs and some nontariffbarriers to trade among member countries. (2) At the same time, each member retains its independent trade policy,including its tariffs, towards nonmember countries. FTAs are those in which member countriesagree to eliminate tariffs and nontariff barriers on trade in goods within the free trade area, but eachcountry maintains its own trade policies, including tariffs on trade outside the region. FTAs accountfor 84% of all RTAs in force in the world, and 96% of those that are pending. The likely reasonthere are more FTAs than customs unions is that they can be concluded more quickly and require lesspolicy coordination among members. In an FTA, member countries maintain their own trade policyvis-a-vis non-member countries. (3) The U.S.-Chile free trade agreement is an example of a bilateralFTA.", "Customs unions are agreements in which members conduct free trade among themselves andmaintain a common trade policy towards non-members. These agreements require the establishmentof a common external tariff and harmonization of external trade policies. Such agreements implya greater loss of autonomy over the parties' commercial policies and require longer and morecomplex negotiations and implementation periods. Geographical considerations play an importantrole in defining the objective of economic, and sometimes political, integration among the membercountries. (4) The SouthernCommon Market (Mercosur) in South America is an example of a customs union. ", "Common markets are those in which member countries go beyond a customs union byeliminating barriers to labor and capital flows across national borders within the market. TheEuropean Union is the most prominent example of a common market.", "In economic unions, member countries merge their economies even further than commonmarkets by establishing a common currency, and therefore a unified monetary policy, along withother common economic institutions.

Political and security factors also play a role in forming RTAs. Countriesusually enter into trade agreements to improve their country's or region's bargaining position inglobal negotiations, attract foreign direct investment to increase economic growth, achieveeconomies of scale, and expand export markets. Countries also see RTAs as building blocks forfurther trade liberalization under the World Trade Organization (WTO) or for forming larger freetrade areas such as the FTAA. ", "Expanding market access is probably the primary motivation for entering into tradeagreements. RTAs give the signatories trading preferences in each other's markets while excludingother nations from the same privileges. These preferential trade arrangements reduce tariffs and othertrade barriers among trading partners, providing partners with broader market access for their goodsand services. Trade liberalization allows countries to achieve economies of scale as they are ableto expand their export market. Smaller countries benefit from trade agreements because producersin these countries can lower their unit costs by producing larger volumes for regional markets inaddition to their own smaller domestic markets. (7) When more units of a good or a service can be produced on a largerscale, companies will have a better chance to decrease cost of production. ", "Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) is another reason for forming RTAs, especiallyfor developing countries. The lowering of foreign investment restrictions through trade agreementsimprove investor confidence in a country, which helps attract FDI. Multinational firms invest incountries to gain access to markets, but they also do it to lower production costs. One of themotivating factors in Mexico's interest in forming NAFTA was to attract FDI. It was also amotivating factor for Central American countries and the Dominican Republic in the CAFTA-DR. ", "The slow progress in multilateral negotiations may also contribute to the increasing interestin regional trade blocs. Some countries may see smaller trade arrangements as \"building blocks\" formultilateral agreements. For example, the United States recently ratified CAFTA-DR and is movingforward on negotiations with Panama and the Andean countries as part of its overall trade strategyfor free trade in the Americas. ", "Some countries form RTAs for political reasons. Governments may seek trade agreementsas a way to promote peace or increase regional security. Countries may want to demonstrate goodgovernance by locking in political and economic reforms through trading partnerships. Largercountries may use RTAs to forge new geopolitical alliances and strengthen diplomatic ties, whichcould ensure or reward political support. For example, the United States formed RTAs with Israeland Jordan as a way of reaffirming U.S. support of these countries and to strengthen relations withthem. Some analysts believe that the choice of RTA partners is increasingly based on political andsecurity concerns and not so much on economic rationale.

By adopting a more regional approach, countries havebeen able to go beyond that which was attainable or desirable at the unilateral and multilateral levels. Most of the regional integration to date has involved trade in goods and has not advanced as far inother areas such as trade in services or intellectual property rights.

RTAs, by definition, run counter to the MFN principle because products ofRTA member countries are given preferential treatment over nonmember products. (11) However, the WTO allowsmember countries to form regional trade agreements under strict rules. The WTO position is thatregional trade agreements can often support the WTO's multilateral trading system by allowinggroups of countries to negotiate rules and commitments that go beyond what was possible at the timeunder the WTO.

", "Economists are in general agreement that RTAs can provide economic benefits, but not thatthere are also associated costs. In general, they see RTAs as beneficial for an economy to the extentthat they provide trade creation over trade diversion. When a trade agreement lowers trade barrierson a good, production may shift from domestic producers to lower cost foreign producers and resultin substituting an imported good for the domestic good. This process is called trade creation. Tradecreation provides economic benefits as consumers have a wider choice of goods and servicesavailable at lower costs. Trade creation also results in adjustment costs, however, usually in theform of domestic job losses as production shifts to another country. ", "The drawback to RTAs is that they may result in trade diversion because they are not fullyinclusive of all regional trading partners. Trade diversion results when a country forms an RTA andthen shifts the purchase of goods or services (imports) from a country that is not an RTA partner toa country that is an RTA partner. For example, if the United States was purchasing an item fromAsia prior to NAFTA and then began to purchase this item from Mexico after NAFTA was enforced,solely as a result of the trade agreement, even though the Asian country was the lower-cost producer,then NAFTA would be associated with trade diversion. Mexico would now be the producer of thatitem, not because it produced the good more efficiently, but because it was receiving preferentialaccess to the U.S. market. ", "The effects of trade creation versus trade diversion are complex and difficult to measure. Much depends on the market structure and costs in which an RTA intervenes and the long-termdynamic effects of the RTA. A report by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) states thatmost studies have found that \"trade creation greatly dominates trade diversion\" in most regionalintegration trade arrangements. The study indicates that in the case of NAFTA, all members standto gain, particularly Mexico. In the case of Mercosur, the study indicates that Argentina, Brazil, andUruguay have the potential of increasing their GDP.

There are an increasing numberof overlapping trade agreements, each with its own tariff schedule and rules of origin regime. Someeconomists believe that these arrangements may pose challenges for developing countries and putthem in a \"weaker position than under the multilateral framework.\" (17) Developing countries mayhave difficulties in navigating the maze of rules that accompany RTAs, and they may not be able tofully benefit from the new trade rules. Another disadvantage for developing countries is that RTAsmay result in a decreasing reliance on nonreciprocal trade preferences such as the duty-free treatmentthat Andean countries receive from the U.S. ATPDEA. According to the WTO study on RTAs, thereplacement of preferential trade arrangements with RTAs could present developing countries withchallenges as they transition from non-reciprocal trade preferences to mutual tradeliberalization.
