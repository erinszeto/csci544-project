Historically, HHS has been one of the larger federal departments in terms of budgetary resources. Estimates by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) indicate that HHS has accounted for at least 20% of all federal outlays in each year since FY1995. Most recently, HHS is estimated to have accounted for 27% of all federal outlays in FY2019. (FY2019 funding levels are generally considered final, whereas some FY2020 funding levels remain estimates.)", "The FY2021 President's budget request was submitted to Congress on February 10, 2020. Subsequently, on March 17, 2020, the President submitted a letter to Congress about FY2021 budget amendments (along with a supplemental appropriations request for FY2020) related to the response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. According to the letter, these budget amendments would have budgetary effects for the FY2021 President's request for some HHS accounts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The letter did not contain sufficient details to incorporate potential effects of these amendments into the FY2021 request numbers contained in this report. As a result, the report reflects the President's initial request as submitted on February 10.", "Under the FY2021 President's budget request, as submitted in February 2020, HHS would spend an estimated $1.37 trillion in outlays in FY2021. This would be $48 billion (+4%) more than estimated HHS outlays in FY2020 and $156 billion (+13%) more than actual HHS outlays in FY2019. Mandatory spending typically comprises the majority of the HHS budget. Two mandatory spending programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094Medicare and Medicaid\u00e2\u0080\u0094are expected to account for 86% of all estimated HHS outlays in FY2021, according to the President's budget request. Medicare and Medicaid are entitlement programs, meaning the federal government is required to make mandatory payments to individuals, states, or other entities based on criteria established in authorizing law.", "While mandatory spending is controlled (but not always provided) by authorizing laws, all discretionary spending is controlled and provided through the annual appropriations process. Discretionary spending accounts for about 8% of HHS outlays in the FY2021 President's budget request. Although discretionary spending represents a relatively small share of the HHS budget, the department nevertheless receives more discretionary money than most federal departments. According to OMB data, HHS accounted for nearly 8% of all discretionary budget authority across the government in FY2019."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "About the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)", "paragraphs": ["The mission of HHS is to \"enhance the health and well-being of Americans by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering sound, sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine, public health, and social services.\" ", "HHS is currently organized into 11 main agencies, called operating divisions (listed below), which are responsible for administering a wide variety of health and human services programs, and conducting related research.

Many of the proposals in the President's budget would require changes to laws that govern mandatory spending levels or policies, which are typically established on a multiyear or permanent basis. Discretionary spending , however, which is roughly one-third of the budget, is decided and controlled each fiscal year through the annual appropriations process. While Congress is ultimately not required to adopt the President's proposals or recommendations, the submission of the President's budget typically initiates the congressional budget process and informs Congress of the President's recommended spending levels for agencies and programs. ", "The FY2021 President's budget request was submitted to Congress on February 10, 2020. Less than two months before this, all 12 of the annual appropriations acts for FY2020 had been enacted into law on December 20, 2019. The FY2020 funding levels shown in FY2021 President's budget materials generally reflect enacted annual levels, with limited exceptions. The exceptions include cases in which full-year mandatory funds had not yet been provided for programs typically funded outside of the annual appropriations process (e.g., mandatory funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block Grant or the Community Health Center Fund). In such cases, the FY2021 President's budget generally uses estimated FY2020 funding levels based on annualized amounts provided in the most recent short-term funding extensions. Because some FY2020 amounts have not been finalized, this report generally refers to FY2020 funding levels as estimates , whereas amounts for earlier years are called actual or final .

Whereas all discretionary spending is controlled and provided through the annual appropriations process, all mandatory spending is controlled by the program's authorizing statute.

However, the budget authority for some mandatory programs (including Medicaid), while controlled by criteria in the authorizing statute, must still be provided through the annual appropriations process; such programs are commonly referred to as appropriated entitlements or appropriated mandatories .

Budgetary totals that account for these sorts of resources in the HHS estimates are often referred to as being at the program level .

When taking into account mandatory and discretionary budget authority (i.e., total budget authority), CMS accounts for the largest share of the request: nearly $1.3 trillion. The majority of the CMS budget request would go toward mandatory spending programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Spending on Medicare and Medicaid is expected to increase from FY2020 levels under the President's request, both in terms of proposed law and current law estimates. The request also includes a number of legislative proposals that would reduce spending on these programs (relative to current law, but not the prior year) if enacted. ", "When looking exclusively at discretionary budget authority (as illustrated in Figure 3 and detailed in Table 3 ), funding for CMS is comparatively smaller, accounting for $3.7 billion of the HHS discretionary request. Discretionary CMS funds primarily support program operations and federal administrative activities, though some funds also go toward efforts to reduce health care fraud and abuse.", "The largest share of the HHS discretionary request would go to the PHS agencies: roughly $64.8 billion in combined public health funding for FDA, HRSA, IHS, CDC, ATSDR, NIH, and SAMHSA (no funds would go to AHRQ under the request ). NIH would receive the largest amount of discretionary budget authority of any single HHS operating division: $37.7 billion. This represents a decrease of roughly $2.6 billion (-6%) from FY2020. All of the existing NIH institutes and centers would receive a decrease under the request. The majority of the proposed NIH budget would support biomedical research performed by hospitals, medical schools, universities, and other research institutions around the country.", "ACF would receive the second-largest discretionary funding level among the HHS operating divisions: $20.2 billion. This would represent a decrease of roughly $4.2 billion (-17%) from FY2020. The majority of the discretionary ACF request (more than 80%) would go to early childhood care and education programs, such as Head Start and the Child Care and Development Block Grant. As has been the case since FY2018, the budget proposes to eliminate several ACF programs, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG).", " Table 4 puts the FY2021 request for each HHS operating division and the Office of the Secretary into context, displaying it along with estimates of funding provided over the four prior fiscal years (FY2017-FY2019). These totals are inclusive of both mandatory and discretionary funding. ", "The amounts in this table are shown in terms of budget authority (BA) and outlays. BA is the authority provided by federal law to enter into contracts or other financial obligations that will result in immediate or future expenditures involving federal government funds. Outlays occur when funds are actually expended from the Treasury; they could be the result of either new budget authority enacted in the current fiscal year or unexpended budget authority that was enacted in previous fiscal years. As a consequence, the BA and outlays in this table represent two different ways of accounting for the funding that is provided to each HHS agency through the federal budget process. For example, Table 4 shows $0 in FY2021 BA for AHRQ because the President's budget proposes to eliminate this agency; however, the table shows an estimated $299 million in FY2021 AHRQ outlays, reflecting the expected expenditure of funds previously provided to the agency.
