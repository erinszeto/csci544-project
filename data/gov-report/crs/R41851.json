During the George W. Bush Administration, Congress provided unprecedented increases in global health resources, especially in support of multi-agency initiatives targeting infectious diseases, such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). As support for global health increased, the 110th and 111th Congresses began to emphasize better coordination of all global health programs and efforts to strengthen health systems in recipient countries. In 2009, the Obama Administration announced the Global Health Initiative (GHI), proposed as a six-year, $63 billion effort to integrate existing global health programs and provide a comprehensive U.S. global health strategy.", "Funding for FY2012 was signed into law on December 23, 2011 (P.L. 112-74). FY2012 appropriations for global health programs remained similar to FY2011, although these amounts were agreed to after prolonged debate over potential budget reductions. The 112th Congress is currently debating FY2013 funding for global health activities. The Administration's FY2013 budget request includes reduced funding for global health for the first time in over a decade. However, early debate and action on FY2013 appropriations by both the House and Senate suggests that Congress may not support these reductions.", "While some policymakers and health experts argue that reductions in global health may be possible due to newly identified efficiencies in programming that could yield important savings, others have raised concerns about the impact of potential cuts on current U.S. global health activities and stated targets. Some groups contend that lower levels of U.S. assistance could", "limit U.S. agencies' ability to integrate their activities and implement innovative approaches to global health, as emphasized by GHI; threaten advances in eradicating diseases like polio and guinea worm and reverse progress made in preventing and treating diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; compel recipient countries to decrease spending on health issues that disproportionately affect the poor, like neglected tropical diseases and limit access to basic health services such as midwifery care, nutritional support, and vaccinations; and weaken U.S. efforts to encourage greater country ownership through multi-year funding plans.", "This report provides a broad overview of U.S. global health assistance, including global health programs and global health initiatives, and analyzes some of the policy questions that the 112th Congress may consider as it oversees and debates funding for global health programs.

U.S. support for global health has been rooted in humanitarian concerns, but since the 1990s, it has been especially motivated by concern over emergent and reemerging infectious diseases and the threats they pose to international development, stability, and security. ", "Outbreaks of diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza, and HIV/AIDS have led a succession of Presidents to give global health a high priority and to launch several health initiatives in response. In 1996, for example, President Bill Clinton issued a presidential decision directive (PDD) that deemed infectious diseases a threat to U.S. national and international security and called for U.S. global health efforts to be coordinated with those aimed at counterterrorism. Following the release of the directive, President Clinton requested $100 million in 1999 to fund the Leadership and Investment in Fighting an Epidemic (LIFE) Initiative to expand U.S. global HIV/AIDS efforts. President George W. Bush recognized the impact of infectious diseases on global security as well in his 2002 and 2006 national security strategy papers. Along with these statements, President Bush created several global health initiatives, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), and the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Program.", "President Barack Obama also recognized the risk of infectious diseases and linked the capacity of developing countries to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks to U.S. national security. In 2009, President Obama announced the Global Health Initiative (GHI) to coordinate the health initiatives established during the Bush Administration as well as other United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bilateral health programs, increase investments in health areas that he deemed underfunded, and bolster the health systems of weak and impoverished states. Through the State Department's 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) and the 2010 National Security Strategy, the Obama Administration has emphasized the importance of coordinating defense, health, and development efforts and cited the strategic value of improving health around the world, particularly across the Middle East. The Administration sees the GHI as an integral part of a \"smart power\" approach to foreign policy, whereby diplomacy, development (including health), and defense are leveraged as mutually reinforcing tools.

In agreement with past administrations, Congress has aimed the majority of global health funding at HIV/AIDS. At the same time, since the launch of the Global Health Initiative, Congress has also supported calls by the Obama Administration to increase investments in health areas other than HIV/AIDS, particularly malaria, maternal and child health, and neglected tropical diseases. ", "Despite strong support by past Congresses for global health programs, some Members of the 112 th Congress have questioned levels of non-security foreign aid in general and have argued for the reduction or elimination of development and health assistance.

Under PEPFAR, the United States also supports multilateral efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, including through contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). ", "The Obama Administration's Global Health Initiative represents an effort to improve the alignment and coordination of these various programs, and to track the multiple lines of funding for these programs under a comprehensive global health budget. The Obama Administration named the State Department the head of this effort until September 2012, when leadership of GHI is supposed to transfer to USAID if certain benchmarks are achieved.", "Nearly 90% of U.S. global health programs are funded through the Global Health Programs (GHP) account (formerly called the Global Health and Child Survival (GHCS) account) in State-Foreign Operations appropriations.

Congress has historically supported an additional contribution to the Global Fund through Labor-HHS appropriations, although beginning in FY2012 the contribution has come from State-Foreign Operations appropriations alone. Defense appropriations fund HIV-prevention efforts conducted by DOD and provide resources to DOD to support global malaria research. ", "In addition to funds Congress provides specifically for global health, U.S. agencies and departments may use other portions of their budgets on global health programs. For example, CDC uses some of its funds to support global TB programming, although it does not receive a direct appropriation to do so. U.S. agencies and departments also transfer funds among each other. For instance, the Department of State transfers the majority of the funds it receives from Congress for global HIV/AIDS activities to implementing agencies such as USAID and CDC. Likewise, USAID may transfer funds to CDC for field research and evaluation of global health programs.", "U.S. agencies also receive funds to implement programs that simultaneously address development and health challenges. These efforts may include improving access to clean water, addressing the negative consequences of climate change and rapid urbanization, supporting the vulnerable in conflict or post-conflict environments, and responding to natural emergencies. ", "In light of these different funding streams and a lack of consensus on exactly which programs and activities constitute global health assistance, estimates of U.S. global health spending by U.S agencies, think tanks, and other observers vary. A number of advocacy groups, for example, consider water and sanitation activities as part of global health assistance. Similarly, the websites of some U.S. agencies and departments describe a broader view of global health aid than what is provided through congressional appropriations. For example, USAID cites its work related to health system strengthening and environmental health as global health activities.

In the same year, USAID released a new evaluation policy that supports increasing independent evaluation of ongoing projects with results being released within three months of completion. In February 2012, President Obama signed an executive order establishing the President's Global Development Council, to be administered by USAID.

This announcement came soon after the summer 2011 release of new findings from an HIV prevention trial, which indicated that early initiation of HIV treatment, called anti-retroviral therapy (ART), in discordant couples reduced HIV transmission by 96%, by lowering the viral loads of infected people and therefore reducing the possibility of transmission. The finding has been hailed by many as a \"game-changer\" in the fight against global HIV/AIDS and has increased calls for U.S. support of HIV treatment around the world.

Advocates argue that cuts to U.S. programs could squander the promise of newly available prevention and treatment tools and could directly or indirectly contribute to additional HIV/AIDS-related deaths.

UNAIDS estimates that 90% of HIV/AIDS spending in low-income countries is financed by external donors. The United States government provides more funding for global HIV/AIDS assistance than any other country. One report estimates, for example, that U.S. spending on global HIV/AIDS programs amounted to 54.2% of all government donor spending in 2010. Some groups, particularly the Global Fund, have come to depend upon U.S. government contributions both to finance their programs and to attract additional funding. In November 2011, the Global Fund announced that it would be canceling the 11 th round of funding due to inadequate financial resources. The announcement has led advocates to express concern over sustaining progress made in the fight against global HIV/AIDS and has highlighted the importance of the United States' role as a donor. ", "Some analysts are especially concerned about U.S. capacity to maintain life-long HIV/AIDS treatment programs. This issue is particularly sensitive since taking people off of medicine would inevitably have fatal consequences. Critics question whether the United States should seek to augment the number of patients receiving treatment in view of the fact that HIV-positive people need to be treated for a lifetime and the U.S. HIV/AIDS budget is not expected to increase. Likewise, while many of the costs associated with HIV treatment have declined over time, a growing proportion of patients may require more expensive second- and third-line treatments following the failure of first-line treatments. Finally, the recent findings about ART's preventative benefits raise new questions related to the appropriate distribution of limited\u2014or decreasing\u2014funding for global HIV/AIDS, including how funds should be divided between ART as treatment, ART as prevention, and other non-treatment-based forms of prevention. Congress might consider the following questions: ", "Given decreasing funding for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs, how will the United States meet its goals related to HIV treatment? If HIV/AIDS spending decreases, will U.S. support for other HIV interventions like care and prevention be diverted for treatment? How long should U.S. investments in HIV/AIDS be expected, and when might the recipient governments assume ownership over PEFPAR programs since PEPFAR budgets typically exceed the entire health budgets of recipient countries?

For example, if recipient countries are unable or unwilling to fill funding gaps due to declining U.S. support for global health programs, some argue that HIV infection and mortality rates could climb. Furthermore, some health experts are concerned that if HIV/AIDS infection and mortality rates begin to rise, other bilateral health efforts might become less effective as vulnerable populations succumb more quickly to diseases like malaria or TB; and advancements in other sectors, like agriculture, could be threatened as people become too weak to engage in income-generating activities. In addition, countries might employ a variety of strategies to cope with stagnant or decreased global health spending levels, such as reducing spending on other health problems, particularly those that disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, like neglected tropical diseases. Observes have also questioned the ability of many resource-poor countries to assume increased logistical, or technical control over global health programs.

Congress has exercised growing involvement in shaping global health programs through funding distribution guidelines, spending directives and limitations, and priority-area recommendations. Global health analysts have debated whether Congress's elevated role has helped or hindered the efficacy of global health programs. For example, some argue that congressional spending directives have limited the ability of country teams to tailor programs to in-country needs. Others argue that congressional mandates and recommendations serve to protect critical areas in need of support and can facilitate the implementation of a cohesive global health strategy across agencies.
