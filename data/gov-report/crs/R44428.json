Over the 10-year window, the proposed budget would decrease the deficit from an estimated 3.3% of GDP in FY2016 to 2.8% of GDP in FY2026, averaging 2.6% of GDP over the next decade.", "The President's budget proposes a small decrease in the FY2017 cap on nondefense discretionary budget authority, followed by larger increases in the defense and nondefense discretionary caps for FY2018 through FY2021.

It is important to understand the assumptions and components included in budget baselines. In some cases, slight changes in the underlying models or assumptions can lead to large effects on projected deficits, receipts, or expenditures. ", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) computes current-law baseline projections using assumptions set out in budget enforcement legislation. Since Congress and the President have resolved certain questions related to expiring tax policy and have enacted specific policies set to control discretionary spending over the next decade, there are fewer policy uncertainties affecting the baseline levels under current law. On the revenue side of the budget, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ; see additional discussion below) permanently set into law many individual tax rates and tax policy provisions. On the spending side, baseline discretionary spending levels are largely constrained by the caps and automatic spending reductions enacted as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) and further modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015; P.L. 114-74 ). ", "The CBO baseline also incorporates policy provisions in current law that have historically been revised before the subsequent policy changes actually took effect. Specifically, the CBO baseline assumes that discretionary budget authority from FY2018 through FY2021 will be restricted by the caps as created by the BCA, and that certain expiring tax provisions will not be extended. This leads to baseline projections of lower spending and higher revenue levels relative to what some consider likely based on previous policy actions.", "In addition to these elements of current law, macroeconomic assumptions, specifically of GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates, will also affect the baseline estimates and projections. Minor changes in the economic or technical assumptions that are used to project the baseline also could result in significant changes in the outyear deficit levels.", "Current baseline projections show rising budget deficits over the next several years. Such a trend represents a reversal from the significant declines in inflation-adjusted deficits experienced in the past few fiscal years. Those declines were primarily due to continued increases in employment (which increased revenues collected from income and payroll taxes) and reductions in discretionary spending. While the baseline projections include continued declines in discretionary outlays, those reductions are more than offset by increases in mandatory spending, which are largely due to the rising cost of Social Security and Medicare programs.", "Baseline projections also include increases in debt held by the public throughout the 10-year budget window. Debt held by the public finances budget deficits and federal loan activity, and is a function of three things: (1) the size of existing debt, (2) economic growth, and (3) interest rates. Debt held by the public declined in FY2015 for the first time since FY2007, which was largely attributable to interest rates that were well below their historical averages. However, the baseline projections include a rise in interest rates, which causes debt held by the public to increase. Debt held by the public was 73.6% of GDP at the end of FY2015, and is projected to be 86.1% of GDP at the end of FY2026.", "CBO also provides projections based on alternative policy assumptions, which illustrate the levels of spending and revenue if current policies continue, rather than expire as scheduled under current law. If discretionary spending caps established by the BCA are lifted and expiring tax provisions are extended, CBO projects an increase in the budget deficit of more than $1.0 trillion relative to the current-law baseline, inclusive of debt servicing costs, over the FY2017 to FY2026 period. Beyond the 10-year forecast window, federal deficits are expected to grow unless major policy changes are made.

Between FY2009 and FY2012, spending and revenue deviated significantly from historical averages, primarily as a result of the economic downturn and policies enacted in response to financial turmoil.

Mandatory spending levels during the FY2009-FY2012 period were elevated mainly because of increases in outlays for income security programs as a result of the recession. The continuing economic recovery has resulted in lower mandatory spending on certain programs. However, mandatory spending is projected to continue its upward trend towards the end of the budget window due to growth in certain entitlement programs.

First, OMB projected a Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA) baseline as required by statute. The BBEDCA baseline assumes that discretionary spending remains constant in real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) terms and revenue and mandatory (or direct) spending continue as under current law. Under this scenario, the FY2017 deficit is projected to total $636 billion.", "The Obama Administration also projected an adjusted baseline, which in its view provides a more transparent and realistic reflection of the federal government's current fiscal situation. This methodology is used to provide a basis for understanding how new policy choices would affect the fiscal outlook, essentially replacing the current BBEDCA baseline. The Administration's adjusted baseline assumes that discretionary spending will be limited by the discretionary caps put in place as part of the Budget Control Act as modified, and that emergency and disaster costs will be greater than BBEDCA baseline levels. The deficit under this scenario is projected to reach $612 billion in FY2017.", "The final deficit projection, the proposed budget, illustrates the impact on the budget outlook if all of the policies proposed in the budget are implemented. In FY2017, the Administration projects that the deficit will reach $503 billion. For FY2016, the budget deficit is estimated to be 2.6% of GDP, which is roughly the same level as the budget projects over the next decade. Under the Proposed Budget, the deficit would remain relatively flat throughout the budget window, averaging 2.6% of GDP over the period. (It rises in dollar terms.)", "The proposals in the President's budget are projected to result in deficit reductions of $3,640 billion over the next decade relative to the Administration-calculated adjusted baseline. The deficit levels in the proposed budget scenario are projected to be lower than both the CBO baseline and the adjusted baseline figures in each year of the budget window. Figure 5 below illustrates how the levels in the President's proposed budget compare to current law (CBO baseline) and the Administration's adjusted baseline (current policy) over the next decade."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Do These Baselines Reflect?", "paragraphs": ["As stated above, the adjusted baseline assumes that certain policies due to expire will be continued. The President's budget views the adjusted baseline as the most realistic projection of the budget deficit, and it is used as a benchmark to measure the impact of budget proposals. The proposed budget, however, is the one that illustrates the resulting budget outlook if all of the policies proposed by the President were implemented. Whether or not a certain policy proposal increases or decreases the deficit depends on which baseline is used as the starting point. Ultimately, the question of whether or not the amount of deficit reduction is sufficient can only be measured by actual budget outcomes (i.e., whether the budget deficit is higher or lower in the future relative to today) and whether or not the budget is on a sustainable path.", "There are no real limits on what assumptions can be used to construct the adjusted baseline as opposed to the BBEDCA baseline, whose parameters were set by legislation. The adjusted and BBEDCA baselines in the FY2017 budget assume, for example, that OCO funding will continue at current year levels, adjusted for inflation. However, in the proposed budget, the Administration assumes a reduction in OCO funding. As a result, the proposed budget allocates a reduction in the deficit of $636 billion over the FY2017-FY2026 period for reduced OCO costs relative to the adjusted baseline and BBEDCA baseline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The FY2017 Congressional Budget Resolution", "paragraphs": ["The Budget Committees in the House and Senate each work to develop a budget resolution as they receive information and testimony from various sources, such as the Administration, CBO, and congressional committees with jurisdiction over spending and revenues.

Deficit spending can allow governments to smooth outlays and revenues to shield taxpayers and program beneficiaries from abrupt economic shocks in the short term, while also temporarily boosting GDP when the economy is underperforming. Persistent deficits, however, lead to growing levels of federal debt that may lead to higher interest payments and may also have adverse macroeconomic consequences in the long term, including slowing investment and lowering economic growth. Since the debt cannot grow faster than GDP indefinitely, large deficits will eventually need to be reduced through increases in taxes, reductions in spending, or both.", "The federal government faces long-term budget challenges. Some measures of fiscal solvency in the long term indicate that, under current policy, the United State faces major future imbalance, specifically as it relates to rising health care costs and the likely impact on government-financed health care spending. Even as Congress and the President worked to enact deficit reduction legislation (i.e., the BCA), these laws were not seen to have made significant changes to the part of the budget that is projected to grow. Therefore, many budget analysts believe that additional deficit reduction is required to put the budget on a sustainable path over the long term. Further, over the last two years, many of those deficit reduction provisions have been softened. Under the current-law baseline, deficits continue to be projected over the budget window.", "CBO, GAO, and the Administration agree that the current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable in the long term. The nation's aging population, combined with rising health care costs per beneficiary, may keep federal health costs rising faster than per capita GDP. CBO projected in June 2015 that under current policy, federal spending on health programs (including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and exchange subsidies) would grow from 5.2% of GDP in FY2015 to 8.0% of GDP in FY2040. The 2014 Economic Report of the President also projected that future federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid would rise significantly under current-law projections. Though these forecasts are highly uncertain, it seems probable that spending on these programs will rise as a share of GDP over time.", "In addition, growing debt and rising interest rates are projected to cause interest payments to consume a greater share of future federal spending. CBO projects that under current law, spending to service the federal debt (net interest payments) will grow rapidly, from 1.3% of GDP in FY2015 to 4.3% of GDP in FY2040. GAO's recent long-term fiscal simulations, under an alternative policy scenario, projected that debt held by the public as a share of GDP would exceed the post-World War II historical high in the next 15 to 25 years.", "Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP, or approximately at its historical average, and leaving fiscal policies unchanged, according to CBO projections, would require drastic reductions in all spending other than that for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, or reining in the costs of these programs. Under CBO's extended baseline, maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio at today's level (74%) in FY2040 would require an immediate and permanent cut in non-interest spending, increase in revenues, or some combination of the two in the amount of 1.1% of GDP (or about $210 billion in FY2016 alone) in each year. Maintaining this debt-to-GDP ratio beyond FY2040 would require additional deficit reduction. If policymakers wanted to lower future debt levels relative to today, the annual spending reductions or revenue increases would have to be larger. For example, in order to bring debt as a percentage of GDP in FY2040 down to its historical average over the past 40 years (38% of GDP), spending reductions or revenue increases or some combination of the two would need to generate net savings of roughly 2.6% of GDP (or $480 billion in FY2016 alone) in each year.", "Debt requires interest payments that can strain budgets if debt levels and interest rates are high. High debt levels could limit the government's flexibility in meeting its obligations or in responding to emerging needs of its citizens.
