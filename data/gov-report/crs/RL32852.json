However, the reductions in costs and time frames resulting from DOE's planned acceleration of cleanup are merely estimates. Actual costs and time frames could differ depending on numerous factors, such as the regulatory approval of actions that DOE wishes to take in the future and the adequacy of these actions to protect human health and the environment over the long term.", "Questions have been raised as to how DOE would accomplish its goals of faster and less costly cleanup without weakening environmental protection. Some have contended that more contamination may be left on site rather than removed. Because of the substantial amount of time required for certain types of radioactivity to decay, arguments have been raised that contamination left in place may migrate in unexpected ways over the long term, and result in pathways of exposure that could not have been predicted when the remedy was originally selected. Others counter that completely removing radioactive contamination from all sites to permit unrestricted future land use, and eliminate all future pathways of exposure, would not be economically feasible, and in some cases would be beyond the capabilities of current cleanup technologies.", "The conferees noted their continued interest in DOE's cleanup acceleration efforts, specifically whether DOE is meeting its cleanup goals at sites scheduled for completion by 2006, 2012, and 2035, respectively. The conferees requested that DOE submit a \"milestone\" report twice a year to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees by March 1 and September 1 of each year. Milestones typically are individual cleanup actions to be completed by a specific date, which DOE, EPA, and the states have agreed would fulfill applicable regulatory requirements. As described by the conferees, this new report would track accelerated cleanup milestones at individual sites, indicate whether milestones are being met, and include estimates of annual funding needs and total \"life-cycle\" costs to complete cleanup. The House Appropriations Committee had requested a similar milestone report in its report on H.R. 2419 . The Senate Appropriations Committee did not request such a report but commented that DOE has \"succeeded in making significant progress\" in accelerating cleanup and encouraged DOE \"to continue [to] keep the remaining sites on track.\"", "In addition to language in committee reports on the FY2006 appropriations bills, Members also expressed concern about cleanup progress at a hearing held by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on November 15, 2005. Although Members complimented DOE for its efforts to accelerate cleanup at certain sites, such as Rocky Flats, they also commented that improvements could be made in increasing the pace of cleanup and lowering costs at other sites, such as Hanford."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disposal of Tank Wastes", "paragraphs": ["One of the more controversial issues regarding DOE's cleanup acceleration initiative has been how to dispose of radioactive and chemical wastes stored in underground tanks at the Hanford site, the Savannah River site, and the Idaho National Laboratory. For FY2005, DOE requested $350 million for a \"High-Level Waste Proposal\" account to prepare for the classification and treatment of some of the tank wastes as \"incidental to reprocessing\" and to eventually dispose of it as low-level waste or transuranic waste. Of the $350 million request, $249 million would have been for \"operating expenses\" mostly associated with removal of the liquid tank waste. The remaining $101 million would have been for the construction of three facilities to treat the liquid waste that would be removed from the storage tanks and to process it to separate out the high-level waste for permanent storage.", "The most contentious element of DOE's proposal was to leave some of the waste in the tanks, and to dispose of it as low-level waste by mixing and immobilizing it with a cement-like \"grout\" to seal it in place. Some Members of Congress, states, environmental organizations, and communities opposed DOE's proposal, arguing that none of the tank wastes should be allowed to remain in place. Among the chief concerns was the possibility that the grout might not mix thoroughly with the residual waste to contain it safely and prevent leaks. However, others asserted that there would be limited environmental and public health risk benefit to be gained by removing all of the waste from the tanks. There also were concerns that removal of all of the waste would be technically difficult, pose a significant health and safety risk to the workers, and be very costly.", "After considerable debate, the 108 th Congress included authority in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 ( P.L. 108-375 ) for DOE to classify some of the tank wastes at the Savannah River site and the Idaho National Laboratory as other than high-level waste, and to dispose of some of the tank waste by grouting it in place if certain conditions are met. However, the authority was not extended to Washington State, where most of the tank waste is located at the Hanford site. (For further discussion, see CRS Report RS21988, Radioactive Tank Waste from the Past Production of Nuclear Weapons: Background and Issues for Congress , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].)", "Congress did not create a separate account for DOE's High-Level Waste Proposal in FY2005. However, with the above authority, Congress appropriated $292 million out of the former Defense Site Acceleration Completion account for activities needed to reclassify and treat tank wastes at the Savannah River site and the Idaho National Laboratory in preparation of grouting the residual wastes in place. Congress did not allocate any of this funding for tank waste reclassification at Hanford, as the above authority was not extended to Washington State. Instead, other funds were allocated for ongoing tank waste activities at Hanford.", "The Administration's FY2006 request did not include a line-item for a High-Level Waste Proposal account, as it did for FY2005. Although DOE planned to close one tank at the Idaho National Laboratory in FY2006 with the new waste reclassification authority, the Administration's request did not specify the amount of funding for the closure of this tank. It also did not specify the amount of waste in the tank that may be reclassified and grouted in place. The conference agreement did not specify the amount of funding for the closure of this tank either.", "The FY2006 request did specify nearly $84 million for the construction of three waste treatment facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory and the Savannah River site, which were included in DOE's original request for the High-Level Waste Proposal account in FY2005. These facilities would be necessary for DOE to process the waste removed from the tanks prior to grouting any residual waste that may remain upon closure. The conference agreement provides $45 million for these three construction projects, including", "$9.2 million for project engineering and design for the Sodium Bearing Waste Treatment Facility at the Idaho National Laboratory, the same as the Administration requested; $35.3 million for project engineering and design for the Salt Waste Processing Facility at the Savannah River site, $31 million more than the Administration's request of $4.3 million; and $500,000 for construction of the Salt Waste Processing Facility at the Savannah River Site, $69.5 million less than the Administration's request of $70 million.

Of the FY2006 appropriation, $45 million is allocated to former defense sites and related activities, and nearly $34 million is allocated to nondefense sites. Congress provided the funding for DOE to establish this office in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for FY2004 ( P.L. 108-137 ). The primary functions of the Office of Legacy Management are to monitor and maintain remedial actions over the long-term once cleanup is complete, to ensure protection of human health and the environment, and to manage the pensions and benefits of former contractor personnel who performed the cleanup.

The PMAs sell power to these entities \"at the lowest possible rates\" consistent with what they describe as \"sound business practice.\" The PMAs are responsible for covering their expenses and for repaying debt and the federal investment in the generating facilities. Their rates are the focus of considerable discussion, and the FY2006 Administration request included a recommendation that Congress raise PMA rates to \"market rates.\" The House rejected this proposal in its Energy and Water appropriations bill. It is not mentioned in the conference report, and no related legislation has been introduced in the 109 th Congress.

Net appropriations for Southeastern, budgeted at roughly $5.2 million in FY2005, would be eliminated altogether.
