Although Congress provides funds for some of CDC's global health efforts through the above-mentioned budget lines, CDC does not, in practice, treat its domestic and global programs separately. Instead, the same experts are mostly used in domestic and global responses to health issues. As such, CDC often leverages its resources in response to global requests for technical assistance in a number of areas that also have domestic components, such as outbreak response; prevention and control of injuries and chronic diseases; emergency assistance and disaster response; environmental health; reproductive health; and safe water, hygiene, and sanitation.", "CDC also partners in programs for which it does not have specific appropriations, such as efforts to address international tuberculosis (TB) and respond to pandemic influenza globally. Congress does, however, appropriate funds to CDC to address these diseases domestically.

Several experts, including at the CDC, assert that expanding vaccine coverage is one of the most cost-effective ways to improve global health. Use of basic vaccines, including polio, measles, and DPT, prevents an estimated 2.5 million deaths per year among children younger than five. CDC has increasingly supported efforts to prevent the transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly polio and measles. CDC global immunization activities primarily focus on children younger than age five who are at the highest risk of contracting polio, measles, and other VPDs. Appropriations in support of these efforts have grown from $3.1 million in FY1991 to $150.8 million in FY2011. Nearly all of the funds that Congress provides CDC for global immunizations are earmarked for polio and measles interventions. CDC leverages funds from other sources to prevent other VPDs, strengthen routine immunization practices, and respond to global requests for technical assistance on immunization-related epidemiologic and laboratory science. For example, CDC has played an important role in introducing newer vaccines globally, including the Hib (which prevents meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottitis, and other serious infections caused by an influenza virus) and meningococcal and rotavirus vaccines (which can prevent severe diarrhea and vomitting).", "CDC implements immunization programs bilaterally and through international partnerships with groups such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), the World Bank, the American Red Cross, and Rotary International. CDC staff are detailed to these organizations and offer technical and operational support in improving vaccine-preventable disease surveillance and properly using immunizations. In addition, CDC officials serve on the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI Alliance) and act as implementing partners in a number of initiatives, including GAVI's Hib and Accelerated Vaccine Introduction Initiatives and the Meningitis Vaccine Project, all of which seek to accelerate introduction of new or underutilized vaccines in developing countries that can reduce child mortality.

The GIVS initiative has evolved into the \"Decade of Vaccines\" initiative, a collaborative effort spearheaded by WHO, UNICEF, the National Institutes of Health, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed at increasing coordination across the international vaccine community and create a Global Vaccine Action Plan. The Decade of Vaccines aims to sustain the gains made over the past decades in eradicating polio and eliminating measles (see below) by helping to ensure universal application of routine immunizations and using those efforts to strengthen health systems.

Those who survive severe measles infection may become blind or suffer from encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain), diarrhea and related dehydration, ear infections, or respiratory infections such as pneumonia.

During this period, about 576 million children who live in high risk countries were vaccinated against the disease. As a result, measles-related deaths decreased globally by 74% during that time. The greatest improvements in measles death rates occurred in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, where measles deaths declined by about 90% by 2006, some four years earlier than the 2010 target date.
