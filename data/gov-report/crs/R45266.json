While some request asylum at U.S. ports of entry, others do so after entering the United States \"without inspection\" (i.e., illegally) between U.S. ports of entry. On May 7, 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) implemented a \"zero tolerance\" policy toward illegal border crossing both to discourage illegal migration into the United States and to reduce the burden of processing asylum claims that Administration officials contend are often fraudulent.", "Under the zero tolerance policy, DOJ prosecuted all adult aliens apprehended crossing the border illegally, with no exception for asylum seekers or those with minor children. DOJ's policy represented a change in the level of enforcement of an existing statute rather than a change in statute or regulation. Prior Administrations prosecuted illegal border crossings relatively infrequently.", "Criminally prosecuting adults for illegal border crossing requires detaining them in federal criminal facilities where children are not permitted. While DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have broad statutory authority to detain adult aliens, children must be detained according to guidelines established in the Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA), the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. A 2015 judicial ruling held that children remain in family immigration detention for no more than 20 days. If parents cannot be released with them, children are treated as unaccompanied alien children and transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) for care and custody.", "The widely publicized family separations were a consequence of the Trump Administration's zero tolerance policy, not the result of an explicit family separation policy. Since the zero tolerance policy was implemented, up to 3,000 children may have been separated from their parents. In addition, thousands more were separated prior to the public announcement of the policy change.", "Following mostly critical public reaction, President Trump issued an executive order on June 20, 2018, mandating that DHS maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any criminal trial or immigration proceedings. DHS Customs and Border Protection (CBP) subsequently stopped referring most illegal border crossers to DOJ for criminal prosecution. A federal judge then mandated that all separated children be promptly reunited with their families. Another rejected DOJ's request to modify the FSA to extend the 20-day child detention guideline. DHS has since reverted to some prior immigration enforcement policies, and family separations continue to occur based upon DHS enforcement protocols in place prior to the 2018 zero tolerance policy.", "Administration officials and immigration enforcement advocates argue that measures like the zero tolerance policy are necessary to discourage migrants from coming to the United States and submitting fraudulent asylum requests. They maintain that alien family separation resulting from the prosecution of illegal border crossers mirrors that which occurs regularly under the U.S. criminal justice system policy where adults with custody of minor children are charged with a crime and may be held in jail, effectively separating them from their children.", "Immigrant advocates contend that migrant families are fleeing legitimate threats from countries with exceptionally high rates of gang violence, and that family separations resulting from the zero tolerance policy are cruel and violate fundamental human rights\u2014such as the ability to request asylum. They maintain that the zero tolerance policy was hastily implemented and lacked planning for family reunification following criminal prosecutions. Some observers question the Trump Administration's capacity to marshal sufficient resources to prosecute all illegal border crossers without additional resources. Others criticize the family separation policy in light of less expensive alternatives to detention.", "In prior years, most individuals apprehended were single adult males. Family unit apprehensions, which increased from just over 11,000 in FY2012 to 99,901 in the first four months of FY2019, and apprehensions of unaccompanied alien children are occurring within the context of otherwise relatively low historical levels of total alien apprehensions.

", "DOJ's \"100% prosecution\" policy represented a change in the level of enforcement of an existing statute rather than a change in statute or regulation. The recent Bush and Obama Administrations prosecuted illegal border crossings relatively infrequently, in part to avoid having DOJ resources committed to prosecuting sizeable numbers of misdemeanors. At different times during those Administrations, illegal entrants would be criminally prosecuted in an attempt to reduce illegal migration, but exceptions were generally made for families and asylum seekers.", "Illegal border crossers who are prosecuted by DOJ are detained in federal criminal facilities. Because children are not permitted in criminal detention facilities with adults, detaining adults who crossed illegally requires that any minor children under age 18 accompanying them be treated as unaccompanied alien children (UAC) and transferred to the care and custody of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

This policy became more prevalent after 2015 when a federal judge ruled that children could not be kept in immigration detention for more than 20 days.", "DHS officials justified the \"catch and release\" approach in the past because of the lack of detention bed space and the considerable cost of detaining large numbers of unauthorized aliens and family units for the lengthy periods, often stretching to years, between apprehension by CBP and removal hearings before an EOIR judge.

The EO instructs DOD to provide and/or construct additional shelter facilities, upon request by ORR, and it instructs other executive branch agencies to assist with housing as appropriate to implement the EO. The EO mandates that the Attorney General prioritize the adjudication of detained family cases, and it requires the Attorney General to ask the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, which oversees the Flores Settlement Agreement, to modify the agreement to permit detained families to remain together.

According to a White House announcement, the zero tolerance policy may be reinstituted once additional family detention bed space becomes available. Also on June 25, 2018, DOD announced plans to permit four of its military bases to be used by other federal agencies to shelter up to 20,000 UAC and family units. DOD subsequently announced that 12,000 persons would be housed on its facilities, before another report appeared suggesting the number was 32,000 UAC and family units.

The judge ruled that children under age 5 must be reunited with their parents within 14 days, all children must have phone contact with their parents within 10 days, children could be separated at the border only if accompanying adults presented an immediate danger to them, and parents were not to be removed unless they had been reunited with their separated children.", "In response to the June 26 injunction, the Trump Administration reportedly instructed DHS to provide all parents with final orders of removal and whose children were separated from them with two options. The first was to return to their countries of origin with their children. This option fulfilled the mandate from the June 26 court order to reunite families but also forced parents and children to abandon any claims for asylum. The second option was for parents to return alone to their country of origin. This option would leave the children in the United States to apply for asylum on their own. Parental decisions were to be recorded on a new ICE form. ", "On July 9, 2018, Judge Dolly Gee of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, which oversees the Flores Settlement Agreement, ruled against a DOJ request to modify the agreement to permit children to remain with their parents in family detention. Judge Gee held that no basis existed for amending the court's original decision requiring the federal government to release alien minors in immigration detention after 20 days, regardless of any unlawful entry prosecution of the parents. ", "On July 10, ICE officials reportedly indicated that parents reunited with their children would be enrolled in an alternative detention program, such as the use of ankle bracelets that permit electronic monitoring, and then released into the U.S. interior, essentially reverting to the prior policy that has been labeled by some as \"catch and release.\" DOJ continued to maintain that its zero tolerance policy was in effect.", "On July 11, 2018, in response to the requirements of the ACLU lawsuit, ORR certified a list of 2,654 children that the agency stated were in its custody at the time of the June 26 injunction that it believed had been separated from their parents and whose parents met the lawsuit's class definition. According to a subsequent HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) report, one or more data sources showed that an additional 946 children may have been separated from family members at the time of apprehension, but their family members did not meet the criteria needed for inclusion in the lawsuit.", "On July 16, 2018, in response to concerns expressed by the ACLU about potential abrupt deportations following family reunification, Judge Sabraw temporarily halted, for one week, the deportations of parents who had been reunited with their children.

ORR was undertaking intensive background checks to ensure that separated children were reunited with their actual parents and did not face personal security risks such as child abuse. According to White, 1,609 parents of separated children remained in ICE custody. White noted that ICE was also conducting its own security checks and at that point had cleared 918 parents, failed 51 parents, and had 348 parents with pending clearances. As of July 16, 2018, ICE had approved about 300 children for release to be reunited with their parents. ", "On July 18, 2018, HHS submitted a \"Tri-Department Plan\" in coordination with DHS and DOJ explaining actions the agencies were taking to reunify Ms. L v. ICE class members with their children. These steps include conducting and reviewing background checks of parents, confirming parentage, assessing child safety, interviewing parents, and reuniting families.", "As of July 19, 2018, the Administration had reportedly reunified 364 of the 2,551 children ages 5 to 17. Apart from the parents of those children, 1,607 parents were eligible to be reunited with their children, 719 of whom had final orders of deportation. Another 908 parents were not expected to be eligible for reunification because they possessed criminal backgrounds or required \"further evaluation.\"", "On September 6, 2018, DHS and HHS proposed new regulations that would effectively terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement and replace it with formal regulations governing the \"apprehension, processing, care, custody, and release\" of minor children. The primary provision in these proposed regulations would be the authority to hold migrant children and their parents until their cases have been adjudicated. Whether federal courts will impose injunctions on or rule against the regulations based on their inconsistency with the Flores Settlement Agreement is not yet known.", "In October 2018, it was widely reported that the Administration was considering alternative immigration enforcement policies involving family separation to reduce the persistent and relatively high level of unauthorized migrants seeking asylum at the Southwest border. One of these approaches, a \"binary choice\" policy, would give detained parents the option of keeping their children with them in immigration detention during the pendency of their immigration cases or being separated from their children, who would be referred to ORR shelters, including possible foster care. This option gained traction as a large and expanding migrant group originating from Honduras, referred to as the migrant \"caravan,\" garnered extensive media attention as it made its way through Central America and Mexico. As of this writing, DHS has not taken any action with regard to this proposed policy.", "Apart from the number of separated children who have been included in the Ms. L. v. ICE lawsuit, other figures emerged on the total number of family separations that have occurred more generally. For example, on October 12, 2018, Amnesty International (AI) published a report citing statistics provided to the organization by CBP indicating that 6,022 \"family units\" had been separated between April 19, 2018, and August 15, 2018.

This total excludes an unknown number of family separations occurring between March 1 and April 18, 2018. According to AI, it also may exclude an unknown number of families that were separated after requesting asylum at U.S. ports of entry.", "In January 2019, HHS's OIG issued a report on ORR's challenges identifying all separated children, ultimately concluding that \"the total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities is unknown.\" The report cited limitations with both its information technology system for tracking such children as well as the complexity of determining which children should be classified as separated. According to this report, ORR's review of new information acquired between July and December 2018 indicated that an additional 162 children had met the criteria to be included in the Ms. L. v. ICE lawsuit, and that 79 previously included children had not actually been separated from a parent, changing the total from 2,654 to 2,737 children in the lawsuit.", "On February 7, 2019, a representative from HHS's OIG testified before Congress that DHS was continuing to separate children from their parents, although at a lower rate than during the zero tolerance policy of May-June 2018. The testimony noted that while DHS routinely separates families if parents have a criminal history, DHS had not provided HHS with sufficient information to facilitate appropriate placement within the ORR shelter system. The testimony also noted that \"thousands more\" children were likely separated prior to June 26, 2018, but, lacking any formal system for tracking such separations, the witness could not provide more precise figures.", "On February 21, 2019, the Joint Status Report filed on the status of a revised total of 2,816 children (2,709 ages 5 and above and 107 under age 5) included in the Ms. L. v. ICE lawsuit indicated that 2,735 had been reunited with their parents. The statuses of the remaining children are described in the report largely as follows: being determined upon further review to have not been separated from their parents; not reunited because of potential safety issues with the parent; and not being reunited because deported parents confirmed they wanted to allow the child to remain in the United States. In addition, the report also indicated that up to 249 additional children not part of the Ms. L. v. ICE lawsuit had been separated between June 27, 2018 (the day after the lawsuit was filed), and January 31, 2019. According to ICE, the basis for separation was largely \"parent criminality, prosecution, gang affiliation, or other law enforcement purpose.\" ", "On February 21, 2019, Texas Civil Rights Project released a report describing the findings from interviews with 272 adults who had experienced family separation subsequent to the President's executive order. The interviewees, a subset of almost 10,000 screened immigrants who were prosecuted for immigration violations at the Southwest border, had indicated to screeners that they had been separated from their children. The data, the first on family separation collected on a large scale by an organization outside the federal government, indicated that since the zero tolerance policy was terminated, a considerable number of family separations had occurred between minor children and relatives other than parents and legal guardians. As noted above, the INA defines an unaccompanied child as an unauthorized minor under age 18 who is not in the care and custody of a parent or legal guardian. According to DHS, minor children apprehended at the border who are accompanied by older siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and other relatives who are not parents or legal guardians must be treated as unaccompanied alien children, separated from their accompanying relatives, and turned over to the custody of ORR.

", "DHS maintains that it has a long-standing policy of separating children from adults when children are at risk because of threats from human trafficking or because the familial relationship is suspect. DHS also maintains that it does not have a formal policy of separating parents from children for deterrence purposes, and it follows a standard policy of keeping families together \"as long as operationally possible.\" According to DHS, the agency has \"a legal obligation to protect the best interests of the child whether that is from human smugglings, drug traffickers, or nefarious actors who knowingly break [U.S.] immigration laws and put minor children at risk.\" Accordingly, DHS considers it appropriate to treat children of apprehended parents as UAC. ", "DHS posits that while family separation is an unfortunate outcome of stricter enforcement of immigration laws and criminal prosecution of illegal entry and reentry, it is no different than the family separation that occurs in the U.S. criminal justice system when parents of minor children commit a crime and are taken into criminal custody. Attorney General Sessions has stated that parents who do not want to be separated from their children should simply not attempt to cross the U.S. border illegally.", "DHS Secretary Nielsen justified the zero tolerance policy with statistics showing a 223% increase in illegal border crossings and inadmissible cases along the Southwest border between April 2017 and April 2018. Similar increases in monthly apprehensions between years were cited for family units and unaccompanied alien children. Secretary Nielsen also stated that while the apprehension figures \"are at times higher or lower than in years past, it makes little difference,\" characterizing them as unacceptable either way. DHS officials cite results of policies imposed at the Border Patrol's El Paso sector (covering West Texas and New Mexico) for part of 2017, where a similar family separation policy reduced the number of illegal family border crossings by 64%.", "DHS notes that its policy reflects President Trump's January 2017 Executive Order 13767 on border security directing executive branch departments and agencies to \"deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation's Southwest border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.\" DHS further contends that parents who attempt to cross illegally into the United States with their children not only put their children at grave risk but also enrich transnational criminal organizations to whom they pay smuggling fees. DHS argues that some parents, aware of the limited amount of family detention space, intentionally use their children as shields from detention and anticipate that they will be viewed, as they had been in prior years, as low security risks. DHS points to unpublished intelligence reports describing cases where unrelated adults have used or trafficked children in order to avoid immigration detention. DHS and other observers also note that asylum requests have increased considerably, a trend that raises concerns about possible fraudulent asylum claims and the misuse of asylum claims to enter and remain in the United States.", "DHS notes that ICE and ORR both play a role in family reunification and characterizes the process as \"well-coordinated.\" DHS maintains that it has procedures in place to connect separated family members and ensure that parents know the location of minors and can regularly communicate with them. Mechanisms to facilitate such communication include posted information notices in ICE detention facilities, an HHS Adult Hotline and email inquiry address, and an ICE call center and email inquiry address. DHS and ORR are using DNA testing to confirm familial ties between parents and children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Immigrant Advocacy Perspectives", "paragraphs": ["Immigrant advocacy organizations argue that migrant families are fleeing a well-documented epidemic of gang violence from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. They have criticized the practice of family separation because it seemingly punishes people for fleeing dangerous circumstances and seeking asylum in the United States. They posit that requesting asylum is not an illegal act, Congress created laws that require DHS to process and evaluate claims for humanitarian protection, DHS must honor congressional intent by humanely processing and evaluating such claims, and many who request asylum have valid claims and compelling circumstances that merit consideration. ", "Immigrant advocates have also criticized the Administration for creating what they consider to be a debacle of its own making, characterized by frequently changing policies and justifications, what some describe as an uncoordinated implementation process, and the absence of an effective plan to reunify separated families. In some cases, records linking parents to children reportedly may have disappeared or been destroyed, hampering efforts to establish relationships between family members. Media reports have described obstacles to reuniting families after separation, including a lack of communication between federal agencies, the absence of information about accompanying children collected by CBP at the time of apprehension, the inability of ICE detainees to receive phone calls without special arrangements, and a cumbersome vetting process to ensure children's safe placement with parents. Similar observations have since been made by government agencies. In addition, while DOJ typically detains and prosecutes parents for illegal entry at federal detention centers and courthouses near the U.S.-Mexico border, ORR houses their children at shelters geographically dispersed in 17 states, in some cases thousands of miles away from the parents.", "Child welfare professionals assert that family separation has the potential to cause lasting psychological harm for adults and especially for children. Some point to the findings of a DHS advisory panel as well as those of other organizations that discourage family detention as neither appropriate nor necessary for families and as not being in children's best interests.", "Some immigration observers question the Administration's ability to marshal resources required to prosecute all illegal border crossers given that Congress has not appropriated additional funding to support the zero tolerance policy. One news report, for example, noted that 3,769 foreign nationals were convicted of illegal entry in criminal courts during March 2018, a month in which 37,383 foreign nationals were apprehended for illegal entry. Given the relative size of the task they face, observers question how DOJ and DHS can channel fiscal resources to meet this objective without compromising their other missions. They contend that the policy is counterproductive because it prevents CBP from using risk-based strategies to pursue the most egregious crimes, thereby making the Southwest border region less safe and more prone to criminal activity. Some have suggested that the zero tolerance policy is diverting resources from, and thereby hindering, other DHS operations.", "Some in Congress have criticized the family separation policy because of its cost in light of alternative options, such as community-based detention programs. They cite, for example, the Family Case Management Program (FCMP), which monitored families seeking asylum and demonstrated reportedly high compliance rate with immigration requirements such as court hearings and immigration appointments. The FCMP, which began in January 2016, was terminated by the Trump Administration in April 2017. According to DHS, the FCMP average daily cost of $36 reportedly exceeded that of \"intensive supervision\" programs ($5-$7 daily), although both programs are considerably lower than the average daily cost of family detention ($319).", "More broadly, immigration advocates contend that the Administration is engaged in a concerted effort to restrict access to asylum and reduce the number of asylum claims. They caution that prosecuting persons who cross into the United States in order to present themselves before a CBP officer and request asylum raises concerns about whether the United States is abiding by human rights and refugee-related international protocols. They note a considerable current backlog of pending defensive asylum cases, which numbered almost 325,000 (45%) of the roughly 720,000 total pending immigration cases in EOIR's docket as of June 11, 2018. They also cite Attorney General Sessions's recent decision to substantially limit the extent to which immigration judges can consider gang or domestic violence as sufficient grounds for asylum.

However, beginning in FY2012, foreign nationals from countries other than Mexico made up a growing percentage of total apprehensions and for most years after FY2013, they made up the majority.

However, in the first four months of FY2019, family units and unaccompanied children comprised roughly 60% of all apprehended aliens.

Since then, family unit apprehensions have increased considerably, reaching a peak of 107,212 in FY2018. In the first four months of FY2019, CBP apprehended 99,901 family units, which, if extrapolated to the remainder of FY2019, yields a projected estimate of almost 300,000 family unit apprehensions, exceeding the annual levels of all prior fiscal years.
