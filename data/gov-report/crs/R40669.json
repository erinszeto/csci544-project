These species are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the California Endangered Species Act. OCAP allowed increased pumping from the Delta, which some believe has further imperiled fish species listed as threatened or endangered under ESA long before the increased pumping plan went into effect. Others note that other factors such as invasive species, pollution, and non-federal withdrawals of water from the Delta have contributed to fishery declines. Critically low numbers of Delta Smelt resulted in a court-imposed limit on pumping at certain times and more recently, a new review of project operations and impacts on the economy and species.

As warheads are dismantled, pits may be stored, but for permanent disposition PDCF would convert the plutonium in pits to plutonium oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), where it would become fuel for commercial light-water nuclear reactors. In FY2008, MFFF was transferred from NNSA to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. WDD includes a Waste Solidification Building (WSB) to convert liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for disposal off-site.

Cleanup includes disposal of large amounts of radioactive and other hazardous wastes, management and disposal of surplus nuclear materials, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and decontamination and decommissioning of excess buildings and facilities. Cleanup of sites where the federal government conducted civilian nuclear energy research is also carried out by the Office of Environmental Management.", "Over 100 federal facilities across the United States were involved in the production of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy research. The total land area of these facilities encompasses over 2 million acres. Although cleanup is complete at over 80 of these facilities, DOE expects cleanup to continue at some facilities for many years, even decades at the larger and more complex facilities where large volumes of wastes are stored and contamination is more severe. DOE estimates that total outstanding costs to complete cleanup at all of the remaining facilities could range between $205 billion and $260 billion. DOE expects that additional funds will be needed at many facilities to operate, maintain, and monitor cleanup remedies over the long term. At sites where the cleanup remedy involves the permanent containment of radioactive wastes, such long-term activities may need to be continued indefinitely because of the lengthy periods of time required for radioactivity to decay to acceptable levels.", "Some of the facilities historically administered under the Office of Environmental Management have been transferred to other offices within DOE and to the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1997, Congress directed the Office of Environmental Management to transfer responsibility for the cleanup of smaller, less contaminated facilities under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) to the Corps. (See Title I.) Once cleanup of a FUSRAP site is complete, the Corps is responsible for activities that may be needed only for the first two years after the initial cleanup work is completed. After that time, jurisdiction over the site is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management.

In addition to these \"regular\" appropriations, the Office of Environmental Management received a total of $6.0 billion in supplemental appropriations for FY2009 in the ARRA ( P.L. 111-5 ). Per the law, DOE is to obligate the funds by the end of FY2010 (September 30, 2010). Of the $6 billion in supplemental appropriations, $5.13 billion was allocated to Defense Environmental Cleanup, $483 million to Non-Defense Cleanup, and $390 million to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund account.", "In its FY2010 budget justification, DOE stated that it was not going to use the FY2009 supplemental funding to accelerate the scheduled cleanup of larger sites. Instead, the funds would be directed to what the Office of Environmental Management calls \"footprint reduction\" and finishing up projects that are nearing completion. DOE asserts that such activity has the potential to reduce maintenance costs and yield significant cleanup progress. DOE also stated that its approach in allocating the funding \"will allow thousands of blue-collar workers to be hired with limited training required,\" thus addressing the economic stimulus goals of the ARRA.", "In its report on H.R. 3183 , the House Appropriations Committee directed DOE to update certain elements of the Department's most recent report on its cleanup progress to reflect the impacts of the additional resources provided in the ARRA and appropriations anticipated for FY2010. DOE released its last report in January 2009, presenting funds spent on cleanup through FY2007, estimating the remaining costs from FY2008 through the completion of cleanup, and identifying cleanup \"milestones.\" These milestones are binding deadlines for the completion of cleanup actions to which DOE has agreed with federal and state regulators in formalized agreements at each site. In recent years, the adequacy of funding for DOE to achieve these milestones has been an issue. The committee drew attention to the significant increase in funding for FY2009 provided in the ARRA, and indicated its expectation that these additional resources should allow scheduled milestones to be met in FY2009. The committee directed DOE to update its cleanup progress report by April 1, 2010.", "The pace of cleanup has been of particular concern at the largest sites that present the greatest environmental risks, including Hanford in the State of Washington, the Savannah River site in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory. These sites present some of the most complex cleanup challenges resulting from decades of nuclear weapons production, and therefore receive the greatest portions of funding for the Office of Environmental Management. For Hanford, the conference report would provide $2.09 billion in FY2010. The House has proposed $1.95 billion, and the Senate had proposed $2.12 billion. The President had requested $2.00 billion. The conference report would provide $1.21 billion in FY2010 for the Savannah River site, the same as the President requested. The House had proposed $1.19 billion, and the Senate had proposed $1.24 billion. For the Idaho National Laboratory, the conference report would provide $464.2 million in FY2010. The House had proposed $475.0 million, and the Senate had proposed $470.2 million. The President had requested $406.2 million.", "Funding needs at these sites are expected to continue for decades. DOE estimates that cleanup may not be complete at Hanford until as late as 2062, at the Savannah River site until 2040, and at the Idaho National Laboratory until 2037. These lengthy horizons in part are due to the time that will be needed to treat and dispose of substantial volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored at each of these sites. According to DOE's most recent estimate, there are a total of 54 million gallons of high-level wastes stored in 177 tanks at Hanford, 33 million gallons in 49 tanks at Savannah River, and nearly 1 million gallons in 4 tanks at the Idaho National Laboratory.", "These high-level wastes are intended to be permanently disposed of in a geologic repository, but the removal and treatment of the wastes to prepare them for disposal presents many technical difficulties. The lack of availability of a geologic repository presents other challenges. Delays in the construction of facilities needed to treat the wastes have raised concern about environmental risks from the potential release of untreated wastes still stored in the tanks. Some of the tanks at Hanford are known or suspected to have leaked wastes into groundwater that discharges into the Columbia River. DOE routinely monitors water quality in the Columbia River to determine whether contaminant levels are within federal and state standards. There has been similar concern about the possible contamination of the Snake River from the tank wastes at the Idaho National Laboratory, and the Savannah River itself from the tank wastes at DOE's Savannah River site. ", "There also has been rising interest in the source of funding for the cleanup of three uranium enrichment facilities administered by the Office of Environmental Management. These facilities are located at Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 ) established the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to pay for the cleanup of these facilities. To support this fund, P.L. 102-486 authorized the collection of assessments from nuclear utilities, and payments by the federal government from appropriations out of the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, as both nuclear utilities and the United States benefitted from the production of enriched uranium. The authority to collect the utility assessments, and the authorization of appropriations for the federal payment, expired on October 24, 2007. Congress has continued federal payments to the fund through the annual appropriations process without enacting reauthorizing legislation.", "Whether to reauthorize the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund has been an issue, as its remaining balance does not appear sufficient to pay the estimated costs to complete the cleanup of the federal enrichment facilities. As of the end of FY2008, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reported that $4.5 billion remained available in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for appropriation by Congress, far less than DOE's estimated range of $15 billion to $29 billion that may be needed to meet all outstanding cleanup needs over the long-term. If the fund is insufficient to pay for the cleanup, P.L. 102-486 states that DOE is responsible for the costs, subject to appropriations by Congress.", "To help offset the federal payment and to increase overall resources to meet projected long-term funding needs, the President proposed to reinstate the utility assessments, and included $200 million in estimated collections in his FY2010 budget request. Neither the conference report on H.R. 3183 , nor the original House and Senate bills, included the $200 million in offsetting collections in FY2010. Reauthorizing legislation first must be enacted before the assessments could be collected and made available for appropriation. So far in the 111 th Congress, at least two bills have been introduced to reauthorize the utility assessments, H.R. 2471 and S. 1061 . Although the utility assessments have not been reauthorized to date, the conference report on H.R. 3183 did include $463 million within the Defense Environmental Cleanup account to continue the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2010, the same as the House and Senate had proposed, and the President had requested.", "On another matter related to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund account, the conferees on H.R. 3183 highlighted DOE's recent plan to expand cleanup work at the Portsmouth uranium enrichment plant. The conferees observed that the President had not included any funding in his budget request to finance this more recently planned work. The conferees noted the Department's intent to finance this work instead with an \"off-budget barter strategy for federal uranium assets.\" The conferees raised questions about the financial viability of this strategy, and directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to evaluate DOE's management of federal uranium assets and the Department's \"success or failure\" in meeting federal budgetary objectives through the sale of these materials.
