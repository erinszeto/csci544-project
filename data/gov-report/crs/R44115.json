In FY2016, approximately 7.7 million people participated in WIC each month. WIC is authorized by the Child Nutrition Act, as is the related WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (WIC FMNP). WIC, WIC FMNP, school meals, and the other child nutrition programs are typically reauthorized together; these programs were last reauthorized in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-296).", "WIC's funding is discretionary, and the bulk of program funds are allocated via formula grant to state agencies for food costs and \"Nutrition Services and Administration.\" In FY2016, there were 90 state agencies (50 states, District of Columbia, 5 U.S. territories, and 34 Indian Tribal Organizations). These agencies operate the program through local WIC agencies and clinics. The program obligated over $7 billion in federal funds in FY2014.", "WIC has a number of federal and state eligibility rules, including categorical, financial, and nutritional risk. Participants must fall into one of WIC's participant categories: pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women; infants; or children (under five years of age). Financial eligibility is met if (1) a household has income at or below 185% of the federal poverty level, or (2) applicants receive benefits through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, or certain state programs. Households also must meet nutritional risk criteria and reside in the state of application.", "WIC provides participants with monthly benefits redeemable for specified foods to supplement their diets, as well as related nutrition and health services. WIC-eligible foods are laid out in federal regulation, and state agencies develop their own approved food lists within this framework. At the WIC clinic, participants are provided the benefits to redeem specific foods (food package) for the participant's category and individual nutritional needs. Major changes to the federal WIC food package regulations have been made in recent years; for some participant categories, the food package now includes a cash-value voucher redeemable for fruits and vegetables. One way that state agencies control WIC costs is through their approved foods lists. These lists usually include one brand of infant formula, as state agencies are required to control infant formula costs through competitive bidding for infant formula rebate contracts. In addition to providing food benefits, states are required to ensure that nutrition education, including breastfeeding promotion and drug abuse education, is available to all pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding participants in the program. Agencies also work to refer WIC participants to health services and other public programs, particularly Medicaid.", "Nearly all states administer their programs through a retail food delivery system, in which participants purchase foods at authorized retailers (vendors). Accordingly, many WIC policies at the federal and state levels pertain to vendor authorization and oversight as well as benefit redemption. Currently, most states distribute checks or vouchers for participants to purchase WIC foods at vendors; however, state agencies are increasingly transitioning to electronic benefit transfer (EBT), in part because the 2010 reauthorization law requires this transition by October 1, 2020. States authorize vendors for the program, considering factors like a vendor's inventory and capacity and geographic distribution of vendors.

Due to the availability of WIC's appropriated funds, obligated funds may include not only the current year's appropriation but carryover and contingency spending as well.", "As Table 2 shows, the bulk of WIC funding is provided as two types of grants for states: food grants, and Nutrition Services and Administration (NSA) grants. Food grant funds may be used to pay retail grocery stores for foods purchased by program participants; to acquire, store, and provide supplemental foods to participants; and to purchase or rent breast pumps. NSA grant funds may be used for participant certification costs, nutrition education activities, breastfeeding promotion and support activities, and salaries and administrative costs to provide these services. In general, money for food costs and NSA expenses must be kept separate; however, grantees may, under federal guidelines, convert food funding to support NSA costs. The WIC appropriation also includes federal funds for specified WIC purposes (e.g., Management Information Systems, Breastfeeding Peer Counselors) that may only be used to carry out approved projects or certain activities.", "Because WIC's funding is tied to the cost of food items, the program has come to include a number of cost containment measures.

Revisions of WIC Food Packages, 2003-Present", "2009 Changes to the WIC Food Packages", "Effective October 1, 2009, USDA significantly revised the WIC food packages. These changes were made to reflect updates and revisions in nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns. The revised packages provide participants with a wider variety of foods, including whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; increase incentives for breastfeeding; and allow states greater flexibility in accommodating cultural preferences of participants. Before USDA embarked on this process to update the food packages, there had not been a major revision since the 1970s.", "In 2003, USDA-FNS contracted with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to independently review the WIC food packages, in order to align them more closely with updated nutrition science. IOM released its final report in 2005, recommending significant, though cost-neutral, changes to the food packages. IOM's major recommendations included the addition of whole-wheat bread and infant foods including fruits, vegetables, and meats; revised food quantities and food package categories; additional foods for breastfeeding women and breastfed infants; providing new optional food-substitutions (such as soy milk and tofu); and the introduction of a cash-value voucher (CVV) redeemable for a specified dollar amount of fruits and vegetables.", "In December 2007, USDA-FNS published an interim final rule to update the WIC food packages. This interim rule largely included the IOM's recommendations, and state agencies were required to implement the changes in their state lists by October 1, 2009. While the interim final rule was in effect, USDA-FNS collected comments on its implementation, receiving over 7,500 letters. The agency published a final rule in March 2014.", "About the White Potato Policy Changes", "The description of the WIC food packages in the \" Supplemental Food Package \" section of this report largely reflects the March 2014 final rule. Both the interim and final rules restricted the purchase of white potatoes, but a 2015 legislative change now allows their purchase. ", "One of the changes in the updated food packages was the inclusion of the CVV. Based on the 2005 IOM recommendations, these interim and final regulations did not allow participants to purchase white potatoes with the CVV. IOM cited the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for starchy vegetable consumption as well as food intake data showing that white potatoes, unlike many other vegetables, were already widely consumed. ", "This policy proved to be controversial in Congress and related proposals were included in the 112 th and 113 th Congress. In December 2014, Congress enacted a FY2015 appropriations law that included a policy rider (Section 753 of P.L. 113-235 ) to change WIC's exclusion of white potatoes. The law barred USDA from excluding any vegetable (without added sugar, salt, or fat) from the WIC food packages, therefore allowing white potatoes. The provision also required USDA to conduct another review of the WIC food packages, and, based on the results of that review, white potatoes (or other vegetables) would either continue to be included or would return to being excluded. In response to the appropriations law, on December 30, 2014, FNS issued policy guidance to states for implementing the inclusion of white potatoes. States were required to submit implementation plans to FNS by January 30, 2015. FNS's memo states that \"state agencies are expected to complete all implementation actions as soon as possible, but no later than July 1, 2015.\"", "IOM/HMD's WIC Food Package Review: 2015-Present", "Note: In 2016, the IOM was renamed the Health and Medicine Division (HMD) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) .", "Since the 2014 final rule, USDA-FNS engaged HMD for further review and assessment of the WIC food package studies. HMD convened an expert committee and has since produced three reports, the third and final of which is expected to form the basis for FNS's next revision of the WIC food packages.", "The first, published in February 2015, was a \"letter report\" regarding the inclusion of the white potatoes issue (this was the review required by P.L. 113-235 ). The committee evaluated the 2009 regulation and, along with recommendations on data collection and study topics, recommended that USDA allow white potatoes as a WIC-eligible vegetable for purchase with the cash value voucher so long as this was consistent with the (forthcoming at that time) 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. ", "The second, published in November 2015, established a framework by which the HMD committee would subsequently evaluate the current WIC food packages and make findings in the final report.", "The third and final report of the series was published in January 2017; it is the HMD committee's final analysis of the current WIC food packages and includes recommendations for changes. In general, the committee recommends increasing the amounts of the cash value voucher, servings of whole grains, and seafood, while decreasing juice, milk, legumes, peanut butter, infant vegetables, fruits, and meats. For all food packages for women and children, the committee recommends", "increasing the dollar amount of cash value vouchers; adding fish; increasing the amount of whole grains from 16 ounces to 24 ounces; and reducing the amounts of juice, dairy, legumes, and peanut butter.", "HMD also recommended policy changes to encourage partial breastfeeding over the exclusively formula-feeding package. Additional recommendations and the committee's rationale for its recommendations are included in the final report.", "As of the date of this CRS report, USDA has not published any rules to amend the WIC food package regulations. As discussed earlier, USDA-FNS regulations based upon scientific recommendations, not the scientific recommendations themselves, govern the program's eligible foods and related issuance policies. ", "Appendix C. WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (WIC FMNP)", "The WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (WIC-FMNP) was first established in 1992. WIC-FMNP provides grants to participating states to offer vouchers/coupons/EBT to WIC participants that may be used in farmers' markets, roadside stands, and other approved venues to purchase fresh produce. ", "Not all states participate in WIC-FMNP; in FY2015, 38 states, the District of Columbia, 3 U.S. territories, and 6 Indian Tribal Organizations received WIC-FMNP grants. Federal funds primarily cover the program's food costs and 70% of the administrative costs for each participating state. Participating state agencies must provide program income or state, local, or private funds for the program in an amount that is equal to at least 30% of its administrative cost, with some exceptions for tribal agencies. ", "In FY2015, the program covered an estimated 1.7 million recipients, and about 17,900 farmers, 3,400 farmers' markets, and 2,900 roadside stands. Participants received an average benefit of $23. In FY2015, total WIC-FMNP grant funding was approximately $20 million. FY2016 appropriations ( P.L. 114-113 ) provided $18.5 million for WIC FMNP. These are discretionary funds, but while WIC funding is appropriated to the WIC account, WIC-FNMP funds are included in the Commodity Assistance Program account."], "subsections": []}]}}
