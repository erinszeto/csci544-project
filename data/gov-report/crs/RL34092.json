Instead, most of the funding was to come from redirecting funds from other NASA activities. Moreover, subsequent NASA funding has been less than was projected at the time of the Vision announcement. The funding requirements of the Vision thus constrain other NASA programs. NASA officials stress, however, that their strategy is to \"go as we can afford to pay,\" with the pace of the exploration program set, in part, by the available funding.", "In the Science, Aeronautics, and Exploration (SA&E) account, funding for Constellation Systems, the program responsible for developing the Orion spacecraft and Ares I launch vehicle to return humans to the moon, would have increased from $2.550 billion in FY2007 to $3.068 billion in the FY2008 request.

In late 2006, responding to concern in Congress and the scientific community about NASA support for earth science, the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) created a separate Earth Science Division. The FY2008 request included increased funding for earth science and projected further increases in FY2009 and FY2010 relative to previous plans, although most of the requested increases were to cover cost increases and schedule delays in existing missions. In SMD's Astrophysics Division, the request deferred the Space Interferometer mission (SIM) beyond FY2012 but reinstated funding for the SOFIA airborne infrared telescope.

This was an 11% increase above the FY2007 appropriation. Most of the requested increase was an expected consequence of the space station construction schedule. In addition, the request included $150 million for two new Tracking and Data Relay System (TDRS) satellites, which are required for ground communications with near-earth spacecraft. The increase for these satellites was approximately offset by reductions in planned reserves for the shuttle and the station. A key issue for Congress is the expected gap between the end of shuttle flights in 2010 and the planned initial availability of Orion and Ares\u00a0I in 2015. Retaining NASA's skilled workforce during the transition period will be a major challenge, especially if development of the new vehicles takes longer than planned and the gap lengthens. Some analysts worry that placing a fixed termination date on the shuttle will create schedule pressure, which was identified as a contributing factor in the 2003 Columbia disaster. Some also are uncomfortable with the fact that Russian spacecraft will be the only way to launch U.S. astronauts to the space station during the gap period. The House bill would have provided $6.692 billion for Exploration Capabilities, or $100 million less than the request. The bulk of the House reduction was from the TDRS procurement request.

The LSC has been controversial since its incorporation in the early 1970s and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980. There have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake. In annual appropriations bills, Congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of LSC-funded grantees, such as prohibiting any lobbying activities or prohibiting representation in certain types of cases. Current LSC funding remains below the LSC's highest funding level of $400 million in FY1994 and FY1995.", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ) includes $350.5 million for the LSC for FY2008.

The FY2008 appropriation for the LSC includes $332.4 million for basic field programs and required independent audits; $12.5 million for management and administration; $2.1 million for client self-help and information technology; $3.0 million for the Office of the Inspector General; and $0.5 million for loan repayment assistance.", "For FY2008, the Bush Administration requested $310.9 million for the LSC.

During the Senate debate on the bill, an amendment by Senator Jeff Bingaman was passed that would have permitted LSC-funded legal services programs to provide legal assistance to \"H2B\" workers\u2014temporary foreign workers employed in the forestry industry\u2014in matters directly related to their employment. LSC-funded programs are currently prohibited from serving H2B workers.
