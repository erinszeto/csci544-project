The head of each executive agency is required to establish a policy under which employees (with some exceptions) would be authorized to telework. The policy on telework must be established within 180 days after enactment of the new Chapter 65 of Title 5 United States Code and ensure that telework does not diminish employee performance or agency operations. Executive agency employees not eligible for telework generally include those whose official duties require the daily (every work day), direct handling of secure materials determined to be inappropriate for telework by the agency head, or on-site activity that cannot be handled remotely or at an alternate worksite. Employees are required to enter into written agreements with their agencies before participating in telework. Each executive agency must appoint a Telework Managing Officer, who is responsible for implementing the telework policies, and provide training to managers, supervisors, and employees participating in telework. The telework policy must be incorporated as part of an executive agency's continuity of operations plans (COOP) in the event of an emergency. When an executive agency is operating under a COOP plan, that plan must supersede any telework policy. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is directed to submit annual reports on telework to Congress, and the Comptroller General (CG) is directed to review the OPM report and then annually report to Congress on the progress of executive agencies in implementing telework. The CG also will annually submit a report to Congress on telework at the Government Accountability Office. The agency chief human capital officers (CHCOs) will annually report to the chair and vice-chair of the CHCO Council on telework in their organizations. Test programs for telework travel expenses are authorized. Such programs are authorized for seven years and no more than 10 programs may be conducted simultaneously.", "As executive agencies implement the law on telework, Congress may wish to examine several issues, including the policies and guidance that the Office of Management and Budget and OPM, respectively, will be prescribing on the security of information and systems during telework, and the operation of executive agency telework programs.

In recent years, telework also has increasingly been viewed as an important tool for ensuring continuity of essential government services in emergencies.", "The goal of this legislation is to ensure that Federal agencies more effectively integrate telework into their management plans and agency cultures. The recent snow emergency in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area during the first half of February 2010 vividly underscored the importance of every agency having a telework policy in place and a culture that values and is prepared for telework.... The Committee has concluded that telework is an essential tool that agencies should deploy as part of their overall strategies for human capital management and continuity of operations, and that legislation is needed to help agencies overcome resistance to telework arising from inertia and fear of the unknown.", "These issues, as well as the development of the Telework Managing Officer's role; the establishment of training programs for managers and supervisors and the employees under their direction who telework; the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluations of the law's implementation; the operation of the test program on travel expenses; and the documentation of measureable outcomes resulting from telework are among those that the House and Senate may focus on in exercising oversight of the law's implementation.
