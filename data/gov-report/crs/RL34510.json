The cash wage employers of 'tipped employees' must pay, last updated in 1996, is $2.13 per hour. In 1989, the 'small business exemption' was restructured to exempt from minimum wage requirements qualifying firms with an income of under $500,000; but, as administered, exemptions have only been available for employees not involved in interstate commerce. In 2001, the Clinton Administration proposed restructuring of the 'companionship exemption' under the FLSA; in 2002, the measure was withdrawn. The issue has recently been the subject of a Supreme Court ruling (2007) and of proposed legislation (H.R. 3582 and S. 2061). Through nearly a century, some economists (and, later, some Members of Congress) have proposed, in various formats, indexation of the federal minimum wage\u2014an issue that still sometimes arises. In 1986, Section 14(c) of the act was amended to remove any specific minimum wage floor for handicapped workers, replacing it with a negotiated wage 'commensurate' with the worker's productivity. It has been contested through the years. In 2003, a proposal was issued dealing with overtime pay for persons classified as 'executive, administrative, or professional' employees under Section 13(a)(1) of the act. At that time, the issue was extremely contentious. How has it worked out in practice? Industry has threatened to leave American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands were the full FLSA to be made applicable there, as it would be under P.L. 110-28. What will be the impact upon those islands? Increasingly, the states (now 34 in number) have moved to provide minimum wage rates higher than the federal rate.

Part one covered \"a cumulative total of 90 days\" at the sub-minimum wage with no conditions beyond those imposed by the employer and a youth's willingness to accept the work. Part two was more complex. It involved an additional 90-day period and included a training wage component. At the close of 180 days, a regular minimum wage (or more, at the employer's discretion) would be required for the employee.

Significant numbers of workers were exempt (or not covered) by its provisions: for example, agricultural, retail and service workers (including public employees) and those who would be defined as not being engaged in interstate commerce. In this manner, among other things, a substantial number of workers employed by small businesses were excluded from the act.", "Still, there were numerous small business people who (rightly, as it turned out) anticipated that the act would gradually be expanded through the years to include progressively greater numbers of employers and workers. Some of the concerns expressed by the small business community were generic, having to do with federal regulation of industry by government. Other concerns were rooted in the particular features of the wage/hour legislation then before Congress. But the question some raised (and still raise) was: Should small businesses, if profitable, be allowed an exemption and be permitted to pay their workers less than the otherwise standard federal minimum wage based solely upon their size? Conversely, should profitability be a consideration in wage/hour applicability?", "Much of the early argument against the minimum wage was framed in terms of small business. Some argued that \"the tremendous amount and prohibitive cost of the bookkeeping and records involved\" would make payment of the minimum wage inequitable for small business and involve such businesses in processes \"with which they are unfamiliar.\" As was frequently true, the case for small business was argued not in terms of the owners (i.e., a personal loss of profit) but, rather, as a defense of employees of a small firm who would surely be hurt if profits for their employers were affected. \"It is the little fellow for whom I am talking,\" observed one Member. \"It is the little industries in my district that are giving employment to those few people situated way up on the mountains and out in the country that cannot pay this wage. Those people,\" he suggested, \"will be out of employment.\"", "While some expressed concern that adoption of a minimum wage would have a negative impact upon the economy, others expressed a sense that employers, under the profit motive, were opposing such legislation in order to enhance their personal or corporate gain. One Senator proposed that firms \"employing 10 or fewer than 10 persons\" be automatically excluded from wage/hour coverage. Yet another argued: \"...I do not care whether the manufacturing unit is a small one or a large one; the American people are opposed to the exploitation and oppression of workers in plants of any size.\" A Member from Texas affirmed: \"I think that we can all agree that any industry that serves a useful economic purpose should be able to pay this wage [the projected minimum] and operate on this workweek.\" While a Member from Pennsylvania responded: \"No industry can be but of negative value to society if its existence is predicated upon paying of wages lower than that required to support the American family up to established standards in America.\"", "Others were, perhaps, less dramatic. \"I look upon a minimum wage such as will afford a decent living as part of a sound national policy,\" affirmed Senator William Borah (R-ID). \"I am unable to get away from that theory.

On some occasions, Congress designed an exemption to meet a particular industry and it wrote into the statute very specialized language. On other occasions, exemptions were more generic: that is, employers earning less than a given amount would not be covered. The various modes of exemption came to exist side-by-side. In 1977, a general small business exemption was set at $362,500, but with other options included for particular industries. The result seems to have caused confusion among employers\u2014and possibly among workers.", "With the 1989 amendments to the FLSA, there was some effort at consolidation.

As a result, employers will need \"to categorize each employee ... to determine which ones engage in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\" Thus, there would now seem to be two tests for the small business exemption: a general test at $500,000 but, also, an individual test based upon the work performed by each employee.", "During the next several months, bills were introduced that proposed to correct what some Members viewed as a miscalculation by drafters of the 1989 legislation but what others saw as a clear statement of policy.
