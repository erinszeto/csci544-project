Congress weighed several NSL amendments during the 113th Congress. The House passed one, H.R. 3361. The Senate failed to provide the three-fifths vote necessary for cloture on another, S. 2685.

For example, it directed the Department of Justice's Inspector General to conduct an audit of NSL authority from 2001 to 2006, and instructed the Attorney General to report to Congress annually on the extent of NSL use. Several proposals in the 113th Congress would have supplemented the existing mechanisms. S. 1215, S. 1551, and S. 1599 would have called for greater detail in the Attorney General's annual reports.

The 111 th and 112 th Congresses as well as the 113 th Congress saw a number of proposals to amend NSL authority. None were enacted. In the 112 th Congress, they were closely associated with the scheduled expiration of various provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). In the 113 th Congress, they were often grouped with legislation that addressed the exercise of FISA authority. The House passed such a bill, H.R. 3361 , and many of its features were included in S. 2685 . S. 2685 , however, failed to secure the three-fifths vote necessary for cloture.

When customer identity, length of service, and toll records were sought, the letters had to certify (1) that the information was relevant to a foreign counterintelligence investigation and (2) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe the information pertained to a foreign power or its agents. When only customer identity and length of service records (but not toll records) were sought, the letters had to certify (1) again that the information was relevant to a foreign counterintelligence investigation, but (2) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the customer information pertained to use of the provider's facilities to communicate with foreign powers, their agents, or those engaged in international terrorism or criminal clandestine intelligence activities.", "In like manner a second statute, Section 1114(a)(5) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, obligated financial institutions to provide the FBI with customers' financial records upon written certification of the FBI Director or his designee (1) that the records were sought for foreign counterintelligence purposes and (2) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the records were those of a foreign power or its agents.", "And so it was with a third, Section 626 of the Fair Credit Report Act, which obligated consumer credit reporting agencies to provide customer identification, and the names and addresses of financial institutions at which a designated consumer maintained accounts. Here too, the obligation was triggered by written certification of the FBI Director or his designee (1) that the information was necessary for a foreign counterintelligence investigation, and (2) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the consumer was either a foreign power, a foreign official, or the agent of a foreign power and was engaged in international terrorism or criminal clandestine intelligence activities.", "The fourth, Section 802 of the National Security Act, was a bit different. It reached a wider range of potential recipients at the demand of a large group of federal officials, but for a more limited purpose. It rested the obligation to provide consumer reports, together with financial information and records, upon consumer reporting agencies, financial agencies, and financial institutions, or holding companies. The requirement was triggered by the certification of senior officials of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, but confined to information pertaining to federal employees with access to classified information and being sought for clearance purposes and inquiries into past or potential security leaks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USA PATRIOT Act", "paragraphs": ["Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act altered the FBI's NSL authority under Section 2709 (communications information), the Right to Financial Privacy Act (financial information), and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (consumer credit information) in several ways:", "it expanded issuing authority to include the heads of FBI field offices (special agents in charge (SACs)); it eliminated the requirement of specific and articulable facts demonstrating a nexus to a foreign power or its agents; it required instead that the information was sought for or relevant to various national security investigations; and It directed that no NSL related investigation of a \"U.S. person\" (American citizen or foreign resident alien) be predicated exclusively on First Amendment protected activities.", "The National Security Act NSL section remained unchanged, but Section 358(g) of the USA PATRIOT Act added a new Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL Section 627, 15 U.S.C. 1681v.

The NSL statutes were not among them, but Congress amended the NSL statutes in the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006 nonetheless. The NSL amendments were driven both by sensitivity to an Administration desire for more explicit enforcement authority and by judicial developments which had raised questions as to the statutes' constitutional vitality as then written. The early statutes came with open-ended nondisclosure provisions which barred recipients from disclosing the fact or content of the NSL\u2014to anyone, ever. Yet, they featured neither a penalty provision should the confidential requirement be breached or in most cases an enforcement mechanism should an NSL obligation be ignored (the original Fair Credit Report Act statute alone had an explicit judicial enforcement component).", "The amendments", "created a judicial enforcement mechanism and a judicial review procedure for both the requests and accompanying nondisclosure requirements; established specific penalties for failure to comply with the nondisclosure requirements; made it clear that the nondisclosure requirements did not preclude a recipient from consulting an attorney; provided a process to ease the nondisclosure requirement; expanded congressional oversight; and called for Inspector General's audits of use of NSL authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IG Reports", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The First IG Report", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Justice Inspector General reports, one released in March of 2007, the second in March of 2008, and the third in January of 2010, were less than totally favorable.

During the three years under review, the percentage of NSLs used to investigate Americans (\"U.S. persons\") increased from 39% in 2003 to 53% in 2005. A substantial majority of the requests involved records relating to telephone or e-mail communications.", "The report and the subsequent report a year later provided a glimpse at how the individual NSL statutes were used and why they were considered valuable. In case of the 18 U.S.C. 2709, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) NSL statute, the reports explained that", "Through national security letters, an FBI field office obtained telephone toll billing records and subscriber information about an investigative subject in a counterterrorism case. The information obtained identified the various telephone numbers with which the subject had frequent contact. Analysis of the telephone records enabled the FBI to identify a group of individuals residing in the same vicinity as the subject. The FBI initiated investigations on these individuals to determine if there was a terrorist cell operating in the city.", "Headquarters and field personnel told us that the principal objective of the most frequently used type of NSL\u2014ECPA NSLs seeking telephone toll billing records, electronic communication transactional records, or subscriber information (telephone and e-mail)\u2014is to develop evidence to support applications for FISA orders.", "The Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) NSL statute, 12 U.S.C. 3414(a)(5), also affords authorities access to a wide range of information (bank transaction records v. telephone transaction records) as demonstrated by the instances where it proved useful:", "The FBI conducted a multi-jurisdictional counterterrorism investigation of convenience store owners in the United States who allegedly sent funds to known Hawaladars (persons who use the Hawala money transfer system in lieu of or parallel to traditional banks) in the Middle East. The funds were transferred to suspected Al Qaeda affiliates. The possible violations committed by the subjects of these cases included money laundering, sale of untaxed cigarettes, check cashing fraud, illegal sale of pseudoephedrine (the precursor ingredient used to manufacture methamphetamine), unemployment insurance fraud, welfare fraud, immigration fraud, income tax violations, and sale of counterfeit merchandise.", "The FBI issued national security letters for the convenience store owners' bank account records. The records showed that two persons received millions of dollars from the subjects and that another subject had forwarded large sums of money to one of these individuals.

In addition, we found that the FBI circumvented the requirements of the ECPA NSL statute when it issued at least 739 \"exigent letters\" to obtain telephone toll billing records and subscriber information from three telephone companies without first issuing NSLs. Moreover, in a few other instances, the FBI sought or obtained telephone toll billing records in the absence of a national security investigation, when it sought and obtained consumer full credit reports in a counterintelligence investigation, and when it sought and obtained financial records and telephone toll billing records without first issuing NSLs.", "More specifically, the report found that", "a \"significant number of NSL-related possible violations were not being identified or reported\" as required; the only FBI data collection system produced \"inaccurate\" results; the FBI issued over 700 exigent letters acquiring information in a manner that \"circumvented the ECPA NSL statute and violated the Attorney General's Guidelines ... and internal FBI policy\"; the FBI's Counterterrorism Division initiated over 300 NSLs in a manner that precluded effective review prior to approval; 60% of the individual files examined showed violations of FBI internal control policies; the FBI did not retain signed copies of the NSLs it issued; the FBI had not provided clear guidance on the application of the Attorney General's least-intrusive-feasible-investigative-technique standard in the case of NSLs; the precise interpretation of toll billing information as it appears in the ECPA NSL statute is unclear; SAC supervision of the attorneys responsible for review of the legal adequacy of proposed NSLs made some of the attorneys reluctant to question the adequacy of the underlying investigation previously approved by the SAC; there was no indication that the FBI's misuse of NSL authority constituted criminal conduct; personnel both at FBI headquarters and in the field considered NSL use indispensable; and information generated by NSLs was fed into a number of FBI systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exigent Letters", "paragraphs": ["Prior to enactment of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the Supreme Court held that customers had no Fourth Amendment protected privacy rights in the records the telephone company maintained relating to their telephone use.

For example, the Fourth Amendment requirement that officers must knock and announce their purpose before forcibly entering a building to execute a warrant can be eased in the presence of certain exigent circumstances such as the threat of the destruction of evidence or danger to the officers. Satisfying Fourth Amendment requirements, however, does not necessarily satisfy statutory prohibitions.", "The ECPA prohibits communications service providers from supplying information concerning customer records unless one of the statutory exceptions applies.

Thus, the FBI might request that a service provider invoke that exception to the record disclosure bar \"if the provider reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person justifies disclosure of the information.\" Moreover, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel subsequently advised the FBI in a classified memorandum that \"under certain circumstances the ECPA does not prohibit electronic communications service providers from disclosing certain call detail records to the FBI on a voluntary basis without legal process or a qualifying emergency under Section 2702.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Second IG Report", "paragraphs": ["The second IG Report reviewed the FBI's use of national security letter authority during calendar year 2006 and the corrective measures taken following the issuance of the IG's first report.

Section 3511 permits recipients to petition and authorizes the court to grant an order modifying or setting aside an NSL, if the court finds that compliance would be unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise unlawful. The \"unreasonable or oppressive\" standard is used for grand jury and other subpoenas issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Rules afford protection against undue burdens and protect privileged communications. Compliance with a particular NSL might be unduly burdensome in some situations, but the circumstances under which NSLs are used suggest few federally recognized privileges. The Rules also impose a relevancy requirement, but in the context of a grand jury investigation a motion to quash will be denied unless it can be shown that \"there is no reasonable possibility that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce information relevant\" to the investigation. The authority to modify or set aside an NSL that is \"unlawful\" affords the court an opportunity to determine whether the NSL in question complies with the statutory provisions under which it was issued. Section 3511 also vests the court with authority to enforce the NSL against a recalcitrant recipient. Failure to comply with the court's order thereafter is punishable as contempt of court.

A FBI counterintelligence investigation involved examining a linear connection between a foreign intelligence officer (about whom much was known) and his contacts (potential spies). The information known about the intelligence officer was specific in nature, and could be readily used to meet the NSL legal standards.... Unlike the traditional linear counterintelligence case, in which the foreign agent tried to recruit the domestic spy using infrequent and highly secure forms of communication, many counterterrorism cases involved complex networks generating a much larger volume of communication and financial transactions. In counter-terrorism cases, the starting point was often not a clearly identifiable agent of a foreign power (as in counterintelligence); indeed, the relevant \"foreign power\" was itself an imperfectly understood terrorist organization that might defy precise definition. As a consequence, counter-terrorism investigators often had a far more difficult time meeting the \"specific and articulable facts\" standard.", "On the other hand, a later hearing witness argued that relaxation of the specific-and-articulable-facts standard eliminates an individualized suspicion requirement with the result that information is gathered about individuals who have a remote connection to a suspected foreign agent, at best. ", "S. 1551 (Wyden) would have reestablished the specific-and-articulable-facts standard in the three basic NSL statutes, and would have described three categories of individuals whose records an NSL may reach (A) foreign powers or their agents; (B) the activities of a suspected foreign agent who is the target of the investigation; or (C) \"an individual in contact with, or known to, a suspected foreign agent.\" ", "Taking a somewhat similar approach, S. 1599 (Leahy) would have amended the three NSL statutes to include specific references to the three categories of individuals cited in S. 1551 whose records may be captured.

It would have left unchanged, however, the risks of adverse consequences upon which an official might base the decision to include a confidentiality requirement and upon which a court might approve one: danger to national security; interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation; interference with diplomatic relations; or individual safety. Otherwise, the bill would have required notice to recipient of the right to appeal a nondisclosure order and imposed the obligation to proceed within 30 days upon the government. Unlike S. 1599 and S. 2685 , however, under S. 1215 the court would have been required to give \"substantial weight\" to the government's certification of the risk of adverse consequences of a failure to uphold the secrecy requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reports and Audits", "paragraphs": ["Two sections of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act called for NSL-related reports and audits. Some of the NSL statutes provide for periodic reports to various congressional committees. Section 118(a) of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act added the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to the list of required recipients of such reports. Section 118(c) directed the Attorney General to prepare, in unclassified form, an annual report to Congress on the number of NSLs issued in the previous year. Section 119 directed the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to audit and report on the use of NSL authority for calendar years 2002 through 2006. A number of bills in the 113 th Congress would have expanded one or both of the report and the audit requirements.", "S. 1215 (Leahy) and S. 1599 (Leahy) each contemplated more detailed reports in both classified and unclassified forms. The bills would have required the Attorney General to submit each report to the House and Senate judiciary, intelligence, and banking committees twice a year on the number of NSL requests submitted during the reporting period that relate to each of several categories: U.S. persons; non-U.S. persons; subjects of an investigation; those who were linked to the subject of an investigation; and those not themselves the subject of an investigation. The bills would have eliminated the current exclusion of requests for communications subscriber information.", "S. 1551 (Wyden) would have required a breakdown of reported totals according to U.S persons; non-U.S. persons; those who are the subject to the national security investigation; and those who are not the subject of such investigations. ", "S. 2685 (Leahy) would have insisted upon good faith estimates of the number of U.S. persons and the number of those who are not U.S. persons, concerning whom information was disclosed in response to NSLs.", "Several bills would have permitted public reporting by the recipients of NSLs and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders. Thus, S. 2685 (Leahy) and H.R. 3361 (House-passed) would have allowed any recipient of NSLs to publicly disclose information relating to the number of requests it received in a sixth month period. H.R. 3035 (Lofgren), S. 1551 (Wyden), and S. 1599 (Leahy) each would have allowed recipients to issue periodic reports on the number of NSL requests they received, organized according to the NSL statute under which the requests were received or by categories of the authorizing statutes. They would also have immunized providers from civil and criminal liability for any good faith exercise of the authority the bills would have provided.", "Section 119 called an NSL audit by the Department of Justice Inspector General for the time period covering 2002 through 2006. S. 1215 (Leahy) and S. 1599 (Leahy) would have called for a similar audit covering 2010 through 2013. The bills would have called for audits by the intelligence community Inspectors General as well. In the case of S. 1215 , these intelligence assessments would have been required of the Inspectors General of the various agencies of the intelligence community. In the case of S. 1599 , the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community would have performed the assessment. In either case, the audit would have covered the period from 2010 to 2013 and would have included (a) an assessment of the importance of NSL information; (b) inquiry into the manner of NSL information collection, retention, analysis, and dissemination; (c) point out any noteworthy acts (including in the case of S. 1599 , and any improper or illegal practices); and (d) looked into the use of NSLs (or in the case of S. 1215 , examined the minimization procedures used).

It offers the most extensive array of information (all information pertaining to a consumer held by a consumer credit reporting agency) to the widest range of requesters (any federal agency \"authorized to conduct investigations of, or intelligence or counterintelligence activities or analysis relating to, international terrorism\"). ", "Several bills would have repealed it. Its repeal might be seen to facilitate oversight, since it would centralize authority to issue NSLs in the FBI (other than in the case of employee security investigations under the National Security Act). Moreover, the Justice Department IG reported that both the FBI and consumer reporting agencies had experienced difficulty distinguishing between authority under 1681u and 1681v.", "Congress has not previously made either the NSL statutes or their USA PATROT Act amendments temporary. S. 1215 (Leahy) and S. 1599 (Leahy) would have changed that. Effective June 1, 2015, the bills would have returned NSL statutes to their pre-USA PATRIOT Act form. They would have established a transition provision under which the law prior to May 31, 2015, would have continued to apply with respect to investigations or offenses begun prior to June 1, 2015. ", "The USA PATRIOT Act expanded existing authority under 18 U.S.C. 2709, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It did not expand the reach of the National Security Act NSL statute. A return to the state of the law prior to enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act would have the effect of eliminating the amendments it made in the pre-existing NSL statutes.", "In general terms for the three pre-existing NSL statutes that the USA PATRIOT Act amended, the act", "expanded issuing authority to include the heads of FBI field offices (special agents in charge (SACs)); eliminated the requirement of specific and articulable facts demonstrating a nexus to a foreign power or its agents; required instead that the information was sought for or relevant to various national security investigations; and directed that no NSL-related investigation of a \"U.S. person\" (American citizen or foreign resident alien) be predicated exclusively on First Amendment protected activities.", "This meant that", "NSLs were more readily available to FBI field agents at a lower level of supervisory control; NSLs could be used to obtain information pertaining to individuals two, three, or more steps removed from the foreign power or agent of a foreign power that is the focus of the investigation; and NSL-related investigations could not be predicated solely on the basis of activities protected by the First Amendment.", "A return to the state of the law prior to the effective date of the USA PATRIOT Act would have meant that NSLs would need to be approved by the FBI Director or a senior FBI headquarters official, and they would have to be based on specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the information sought pertains to a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. ", "The language precluding NSL-related investigations grounded exclusively on the exercise of First Amendment rights would also have disappeared. It is at best unclear, however, that the First Amendment unaided does not embody a comparable prohibition.", "Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, the NSL statutes strictly prohibited recipients from disclosing the request to anyone, ever. Yet, they afforded recipients no explicit means to challenge or seek limited release from the nondisclosure requirement, even for such narrow purposes as consulting their attorneys for advice on their obligations to comply. On the other hand, they provided the FBI with no explicit remedy should recipients violate the nondisclosure requirement. ", "In the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act, Congress addressed the issue in three ways. First, it amended the federal obstruction of justice statute to outlaw unjustified disclosures. Second, it amended the NSL statutes to make it clear that a recipient remained free to seek the advice of counsel before complying. These amendments, unlike the obstruction of justice amendment, would disappear should the NSL statutes return to their earlier versions. Congress's third response, however, would mitigate impact of the disappearance. Third, Congress created a permanent statutory section for review of NSLs, 18 U.S.C. 3511. ", "By and large, Section 3511 governs judicial review of NSL nondisclosure requirements. When implemented as required by the Second Circuit's decision in John Doe, Inc. v. Mukasey , 549 F.3d 861 (2d Cir. 2008), and at the election of the recipient, the government has the burden of persuading the court of the validity of the gag order under the same standards as found in the expired portions of the NSL statutes. S. 1215 and S. 1599 's amendments to the judicial review provisions in Section 3511, designed to accommodate the concerns raised in John Doe, Inc ., would remain in effect after sunset. ", "The National Security Act NSL statute, left unamended by the USA PATRIOT Act, is arguably the least intrusive. It reaches only information pertaining to federal employees who have consented to their disclosure.", "When the Senate Judiciary Committee approved comparable provisions in the 112 th Congress, it explained that", "[S]unset was added not as an expression of desire for the authority to expire, but to guarantee that Congress [would] carefully review how NSLs are issued. After the standard for issuing an NSL was lowered in 2001, the use of NSLs spiked. Fewer than 10,000 NSLs were issued in 2001, but nearly 50,0000 were issued in 2006. Seeing the growth, Congress included Inspector General audits of NSLs in the 2005 USA PATIROT Act Reauthorization bill. The audits showed vast over-collection of information and abuse of the NSL authority. ", "The Minority Views in the Senate Judiciary Committee report objected to a return of the NSL statutes to their earlier versions:", "S. 193 rescinds these valuable tools by, starting in 2013, requiring the government to follow the cumbersome pre-PATRIOT Act NSL standard. Prior to the PATRIOT Act, not only did the requested records have to be relevant to an investigation, but the FBI also had to have specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the information requested pertained to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, such as a terrorist or spy. This pre-PATRIOT Act requirement kept the FBI from using NSLs to develop evidence at the early stages of an investigation, which is precisely when they are the most useful, and often prevented investigators from acquiring records that were relevant to an ongoing international terrorism or espionage investigation.", "It makes little sense to roll back the sensible NSL reforms that were made as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. Criminal investigators have long been able to use administrative or grand jury subpoenas to obtain records, so long as they are relevant to their investigation.
