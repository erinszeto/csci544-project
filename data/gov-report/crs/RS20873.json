In recognition of the often negative, long-term consequences associated with teenage pregnancy, Congress has provided funding for the prevention of teenage and out-of-wedlock pregnancies. This report discusses three programs that exclusively attempt to reduce teenage pregnancy. The Adolescent Family Life (AFL) demonstration program was enacted in 1981 as Title XX of the Public Health Service Act, and the Abstinence Education program was enacted in 1996 as part of the welfare reform legislation. Also, since FY2001, additional funding for community-based abstinence education programs has been included in annual Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) appropriations.", "P.L. 111-117, the Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010 (enacted December 16, 2009), includes a new discretionary Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program, identical to the one proposed in the President's FY2010 budget, which would provide grants and contracts on a competitive basis to public and private entities to fund \"medically accurate and age appropriate\" programs that reduce teen pregnancy (much of the money would be used to replicate programs that were proven effective through rigorous evaluation, and some of the money would be used to develop, refine, and test additional models and innovative strategies). The new TPP program is funded at $110 million for FY2010.", "Although no abstinence-only education funding was appropriated in P.L. 111-117 (the Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010; enacted December 16, 2009), P.L. 111-148 (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA); enacted March 23, 2010) restored funding to the Title V Abstinence Education formula block grant to states at the previous annual level of $50 million for each of FY2010-FY2014 ($250 million over five years).", "In addition, P.L. 111-148 established a new state formula grant program and appropriated $75 million annually for each of FY2010\u2013FY2014 to enable states to operate a new Personal Responsibility Education program ($375 million over five years). The new Personal Responsibility Education program is a comprehensive approach to teen pregnancy prevention that educates adolescents on both abstinence and contraception to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, and it also provides youth with information about several adulthood preparation subjects (i.e., healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, parent-child communication, educational and career success, and healthy life skills).", "(For information on the Obama Administration's and Congress' new approach to teen pregnancy prevention, see CRS Report R40618, Teen Pregnancy Prevention: Background and Proposals in the 111th Congress.)"], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Since 1991, U.S. teen pregnancy, abortion, and birth rates have fallen considerably.

However, in 2008, the teen birth rate reversed the two-year increase trend and dropped to 41.5 births per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19. The teen pregnancy rate increased from 69.5 per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19 in 2005 to 71.5 in 2006. The 2005 teen pregnancy rate was the lowest recorded teen pregnancy rate since 1972, when this series was initiated. Although the pregnancy rate for teenagers increased in 2006 (latest available data), it is still down 38% from the 1991 level of 115.3. Even so, it still is higher than the teen pregnancy rates of most industrialized nations. According to a recent report on children and youth, in 2009, 32% of 9 th graders reported having experienced sexual intercourse. The corresponding statistics for older teens were 41% for 10 th graders, 53% for 11 th graders, and 62% for 12 th graders. About 20% of female teens who have had sexual intercourse become pregnant each year.", "For many years, there have been divergent views with regard to sex and young people. Many argue that sexual activity in and of itself is wrong if the persons are not married. Others agree that it is better for teenagers to abstain from sex but are primarily concerned about the negative consequences of sexual activity, namely unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). These two viewpoints are reflected in two pregnancy prevention approaches. The Adolescent Family Life (AFL) program encompasses both views and provides funding for both prevention programs and programs that provide medical and social services to pregnant or parenting teens. The Abstinence Education program centers on the abstinence-only message and only funds programs that adhere solely to bolstering that message.

Any public or private nonprofit organization or agency is eligible to apply for a demonstration grant. AFL projects can be funded for up to five years.

Since 1997, all AFL prevention projects that have been funded have been abstinence-only projects that were required to conform to the definition of abstinence education as defined in P.L. 104-193 .

The AFL program also authorizes funding of research grants dealing with various aspects of adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting. Research projects have examined factors that influence teenage sexual, contraceptive and fertility behaviors, the nature and effectiveness of care services for pregnant and parenting teens and why adoption is a little-used alternative among pregnant teenagers.

To receive federal funds, a state must match every $4 in federal funds with $3 in state funds. This means that full funding for abstinence education would total at least $87.5 million annually. Although the Title V abstinence-only education block grant has not yet been reauthorized, the latest extension, contained in P.L. 110-275 ( H.R. 6331 ), continued funding for the abstinence-only block grant through June 30, 2009.

We must stress that abstinence isn't just about saying no to sex; it's about saying yes to a happier, healthier future.\" The proposal he supported during his presidential campaign would have provided at least as much funding for abstinence education as was provided for teen contraception services under the Medicaid, family planning (Title X), and AFL programs, namely about $135 million annually. As many as 27 other federal programs have a teen contraception component, but expenditures solely for this component could not be isolated.

They contend that youth can and should be empowered to say no to sex. They argue that supporting both abstinence and birth control is hypocritical and undermines the strength of an abstinence-only message. They cite research that indicates that teens who take virginity pledges to refrain from sex until marriage appear to delay having sex longer than those teens who do not make such a commitment. (The study found that teens who publicly promise to postpone sex until marriage refrain from intercourse for about a year and a half longer than teens who did not make such a pledge.) They also refer to a recent scientifically based study of a program that provided an abstinence-only intervention to African-American students in the 6 th and 7 th grades. The study found that only about 34% of the student participants in the abstinence-only intervention said that they had engaged in sexual intercourse (when they were interviewed two years after the intervention), whereas about 49% of the students in the control group reported (during the two-year follow-up interview) that they had engaged in sexual intercourse. Advocates of the abstinence-only approach argue that abstinence is the most effective means of preventing unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV/AIDS).", "Advocates of the more comprehensive approach to sex education argue that today's youth need information and decision-making skills to make realistic, practical decisions about whether to engage in sexual activities. They contend that such an approach allows young people to make informed decisions regarding abstinence, gives them the information they need to set relationship limits and to resist peer pressure, and also provides them with information on the use of contraceptives and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. They maintain that abstinence-only messages provide no protection against the risks of pregnancy and disease for those who are sexually active. They point out that teens who break their virginity pledges were less likely to use contraception the first time than teens who had never made such a promise.", "The April 2007 Mathematica evaluation of the Title V Abstinence Education program found that program participants had just as many sexual partners as nonparticipants, had sex at the same median age as nonparticipants, and were just as likely to use contraception as nonparticipants. Supporters of the abstinence-only approach say that the evaluation only examined four programs and is thereby inconclusive. A recent compilation of experimentally designed evaluations of comprehensive sexual education programs found that some comprehensive programs that included contraception information, decision-making skills, and peer pressure strategies were successful in delaying sexual activity, improving contraceptive use, or preventing teen pregnancy.", "The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget (April 2009) did not provide any funding in FY2010 for the Title V Abstinence Education Block Grant to states (which was a mandatory program) or the Community-Based Abstinence Education (CBAE) program (a discretionary program); nor did it continue to provide funding in FY2010 for abstinence-only demonstration grants through the Adolescent Family Life (AFL) program.
