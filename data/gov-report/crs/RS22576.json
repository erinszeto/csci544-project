Congress has provided specific funding for pandemic flu preparedness since FY2004, including $6.1 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2006. These funds bolster related activities to prepare for public health threats, and to control seasonal flu. This report discusses appropriations for pandemic flu, primarily to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and will be updated as needed."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1997, a new avian (bird) flu virus (H5N1) emerged in Asia and killed six people. It has since spread to Europe and Africa. The virus has infected more than 330 people, killing more than half of them. Health officials are concerned that it could change sufficiently to cause a global human pandemic. Beginning in FY2004, Congress has provided funding specifically for pandemic flu preparedness, through both regular and emergency supplemental appropriations. This report describes federal funding for pandemic flu, primarily to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Federal funding to control the disease in birds is generally provided to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for activities involving commercial poultry, and to the Department of the Interior for activities involving wildlife. The Departments of Homeland Security, Defense, State, and Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), have also received funds for global avian flu control.", "It is difficult to track federal funding for flu preparedness, for several reasons. First, funds designated specifically for pandemic flu do not reflect the sum of all relevant activities. For example, programs to improve health surveillance in general, or to streamline federal disaster response, are important for pandemic preparedness. Also, the President has called on all federal agencies to develop continuity plans for a flu pandemic, activities that are typically funded through general administrative accounts. Second, certain activities (e.g., the expansion of vaccine production capacity) address preparedness for both seasonal and pandemic flu, and may not be designated as pandemic spending, despite their relevance. Finally, federal agencies may not prepare budget information, such as the presentation of base funding or annual increases, in a consistent fashion.", "This report provides information on appropriations, primarily to HHS, that the Congress has specifically designated for pandemic flu preparedness. Appropriated amounts are presented in Tables 1 and 2 . Pandemic flu funding for HHS has generally been provided in the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF), an account intended for one-time or short-term activities.

In October 2004, while Congress was considering FY2005 appropriations, there was a production failure at a plant supplying half of the nation's supply of injectable seasonal flu vaccine. This resulted in a nationwide shortage, and focused attention on the frailty of the vaccine production system. At the same time, H5N1 avian flu was spreading through Asia. In December 2004, Congress passed P.L. 108-447 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, providing HHS with the requested $100 million to bolster flu vaccine production capacity, including the purchase of flu vaccine."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2005\u2014Supplemental Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["In May 2005, Congress passed P.L. 109-13 , the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005, providing $25 million to USAID for programs to control the global spread of avian flu, and stipulating that $15 million of it be transferred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In December 2005, Congress provided funding for pandemic flu in FY2006 emergency supplemental appropriations (discussed below), using this vehicle, rather than regular appropriations, to provide the bulk of pandemic funding for FY2006. Also in December 2005, Congress passed regular FY2006 appropriations for HHS in P.L. 109-149 , the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006, providing $63.6 million to HHS for general public health preparedness activities, including efforts to bolster domestic flu vaccine production capacity and to stockpile vaccine."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2006\u2014Supplemental Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["As Congress weighed regular appropriations for FY2006, H5N1 avian flu spread to Europe, and Hurricane Katrina raised concerns about the nation's general level of disaster readiness.

The distribution of these funds to various federal departments and agencies is presented in Table 2 . Most of the difference between the $7.1 billion request and the $3.8 billion appropriation resulted because Congress did not fund the \"out years\" of the Administration's HHS request, i.e., the amounts for FY2007 and FY2008. In report language ( H.Rept. 109-359 ), conferees directed the Secretary of HHS to report to the appropriations committees on a semi-annual basis regarding the use of the $3.3 billion provided.
