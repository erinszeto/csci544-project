For a given type of ship, procurement cost tends to be broadly proportional to ship size. Reducing ship size can thus reduce procurement cost. The Navy can be viewed as using this strategy for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), which is to be considerably smaller than existing major Navy surface combatants, but the strategy can be applied more widely. Shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion. This is a strategy that can be considered for the Navy's submarines and aircraft carriers, whose current designs are nuclear-powered. Equipping a Navy ship with a conventional (i.e., fossil-fuel) propulsion plant rather than a nuclear propulsion plant can reduce the ship's procurement cost by several hundred million dollars. Shifting from a hull built to military survivability standards to a hull built to commercial-ship survivability standards. A hull built to military survivability standards has more armoring and internal compartmentalization than a hull built to commercial-ship standards, making it more expensive to build than a commercial-like hull. The Navy is considering building ships for its planned Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future), or MPF(F), squadron, with commercial-like hulls, but the strategy can be applied more widely. Using a common hull design for multiple ship classes. Using a common hull design for multiple ship classes avoids the cost of designing a new hull for each new class of ship, and permits ship classes sharing a common hull to benefit from\u00a0improved production economies of scale regarding their hulls. The Navy plans to use the hull design for its planned DDG-1000 (formerly DD(X)) destroyer as the hull for its planned CG(X) cruiser, but the strategy can be applied more widely. The OFT report proposes building four large surface ships\u2014an aircraft carrier, a missile-and-rocket ship, an amphibious assault ship, and a small-craft \"mother\" ship\u2014using a common merchant-like hull.

One factor contributing to this effect relates to propulsion: As ship size increases, the amount of horsepower needed to move a ton of the ship's weight through the water at a certain speed tends to decrease. As a result, as ship size increases, the size of the propulsion plant increases less than proportionately, leaving proportionately more room for payload.", "Consequently, for example, as the size of an aircraft carrier is reduced, the total weight of the aircraft that can be embarked on the carrier can decline even more quickly.

If total fleet payload is held constant, in other words, then reducing unit procurement costs by shifting to smaller ships can lead to a fleet design with a higher total procurement cost. In addition, if crew size and fuel consumption does not go down proportionately with ship size, then a similar effect could occur with regard to total fleet operation and support (O&S) costs.", "The OFT report counters some of these points by arguing that using new technologies would permit the payload fraction of its recommended 1,000- and 100-ton surface combatants to be greater than what would have been possible in the past. Another counter-argument is that improvements in precision-guidance technology for weapons is permitting weapon size to be reduced because a smaller warhead that lands precisely on a target can do the same amount of damage to the target as a larger warhead that lands less precisely. As a result, it could be argued, payload related to weapons and weapon launchers can be reduced without reducing the ship's capability.

The committee believes that stable ship requirements, increased funding in the shipbuilding budget, and increased flexibility for funding large capital ships are critical elements of any strategy to reverse this trend....", "Elsewhere in this report, the committee has expressed concern with cost growth on the CVN-77 program, and has urged the Navy and the shipbuilder to identify opportunities to improve affordability of future aircraft carriers. Procurement delays, excess inflation, and material escalation have been reported as significant contributors to CVN-77 cost growth. The shipbuilder has proposed to achieve significant CVN-21 class program savings through a stable procurement plan, and through procurement of economic order quantity material for CVN-79 and CVN-80 in conjunction with CVN-78 procurement.", "In view of the potential for significant program savings, the committee recommends an increase of $50.0 million in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement, and directs the Secretary of the Navy to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class. The Secretary is to submit a report to the congressional defense committees with the fiscal year 2008 budget request, outlining the advance procurement requirements to potentially optimize economic order quantity savings and escalation avoidance (to include offsetting factors) for the first three vessels of the CVN-21 class. Of the amount authorized to be appropriated for advance procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80, none of the funds are available for obligation prior to 30 days following receipt of the Secretary's report.

The fiscal year 2007 budget request included $348.4 million for CVN-77 cost growth, with the balance of additional funding to be included in future budget requests. The committee is aware that the Navy has taken a series of management actions to contain cost on CVN-77, including deferral of upgrades that are not required for safe system operation or certification; minimization of contract change orders; implementation of a joint Navy-shipbuilder Lean Six-Sigma program; and a schedule revision to enable a more efficient completion of CVN-77. The committee is concerned, however, that despite these management actions, the Navy is projecting CVN-77 cost to grow to the contract ceiling, in excess of 30 percent above the baseline cost cap.", "The committee notes that the Secretary's report to Congress on the long-range plan for construction of naval vessels establishes cost estimates for future ship construction, which target improved performance based on a series of management actions similar to ongoing efforts to control CVN-77 cost. Visibility into cost performance while completing CVN-77 is necessary in order to assess the effectiveness of these management actions, and will assist in determining further actions necessary to improve affordability of the future force. Improved visibility into completion cost performance will also afford greater opportunity to deliver CVN-77 below the contract ceiling. Accordingly, the Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit a quarterly report to the congressional defense committees, beginning December 1, 2006, providing the following information regarding the CVN-77 ship construction contract:", "(1) contract target cost;", "(2) Program Manager's Estimate at Completion;", "(3) contractor's Estimate at Completion;", "(4) contract ceiling price;", "(5) end of period actual costs; and", "(6) percent progress.

The emphasis on cost control would dictate that the Navy pursue competition, commonality, and the results of learning curves to the extent practical in the procurement of this 55 ship class.", "The committee views LCS as an important component of the Navy's strategy for conducting the global war on terror, and has supported the Navy's approach to rapidly field this capability. The design and construction of LCS in parallel with development of the mission modules requires heightened management of program risk to ensure affordable, full mission capability of the LCS program. However, the committee is concerned that the affordability appeal of the LCS program is being overtaken by apparent cost growth, and that the rapid\u00a0ramp up in LCS procurement will compound the issue. The stated emphasis on affordability is obscured by the absence of a clear acquisition strategy to guide strategic program decisions.", "Additionally, it is unclear that the Navy has assessed the added cost for training, maintenance, configuration management, planning and engineering, and supply support for the two flight 0 ship classes. Further, by virtue of budgeting the costs for procuring the flight 0 LCS vessels in three different appropriations, total costs for the program's start are difficult to discern. In view of these concerns, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on the LCS program, no later than December 1, 2006 to the congressional defense committees. The report shall outline the Navy's acquisition strategy for the program, including the competition plan, the flight strategy, and the cost containment strategy for the program; contain a clear representation of all R&D and procurement costs for the total program; and assess the added life cycle costs associated with operation and support for two dissimilar flight 0 LCS designs.

Navy leadership agrees that cost control is essential, but the Navy has produced no plan or initiatives to meet the cost targets assumed in the long range shipbuilding plan. Furthermore, the recent history of ongoing shipbuilding programs indicates the trend in cost growth may be getting worse, and not better. The Committee encourages the Navy to set firm cost targets in its future shipbuilding programs, to develop specific initiatives addressing cost control, and to sign contracts that reduce the likelihood of cost growth. (Page 139)", "The report recommended reducing by $141.4 million the Navy's request for FY2007 procurement funding to cover cost growth on ships procured in prior years. The report stated:", "The Committee remains concerned over the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs. In last year's report, the Committee noted the rising cost growth in ongoing ship construction contracts, and required the Navy to submit a plan on resolving these issues. That report was submitted two months late, and was little more than a summary of cost overruns in shipbuilding over the past two decades. The Committee is concerned about the gap between the Navy's public statements about the need for firm cost controls, and the programmatic and contractual actions needed to accomplish that objective. Navy briefings this year document a litany of programs, including the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and certain attack submarines of the Virginia class, that continue to defy attempts to control costs. The Navy estimates an overrun of $867,900,000 over the next 3 years alone in the CVN-77 production effort. These funds cannot be obligated without Congressional legislation to raise the current cost cap on the program\u2014a cap that was put in place several years ago to control costs. The fiscal year 2007 budget requests $136,000,000 for further cost growth in the U.S.S. Texas (SSN-775), and cost performance on the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) is seriously below Navy expectations. In fact, current cost performance on the Virginia class jeopardizes the ability of the Navy to meet the performance goals of the multiyear contract signed in 2004 as well as cost targets needed to increase the submarine production rate in future years. The Committee is unwilling to provide increased appropriations for cost overruns in the absence of compelling justification or a realistic and detailed plan for cost control. The Committee recommendation provides $436,449,000 for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs, a reduction of $141,400,000 from the request. The reduction should be allocated against the following programs: CVN-77 (-$30,000,000); SSN-777 (-$48,000,000); SSN-776 (-$10,000,000); SSN-775 (-$10,000,000); and the LPD-17 class (-$43,400,000). (Page 140)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Other Options for Responding to Rising Ship Costs", "paragraphs": ["Aside from reducing planned ship procurement rates or shifting or shifting to lower-cost ship designs, one option for responding to rising Navy ship procurement costs would be to increase annual ship-procurement funding. The Navy's proposed FY2007 budget and the FY2007-FY2011 shipbuilding plan propose increasing annual funding for ship construction to an average of roughly $14.4 billion per year in constant FY2007 dollars. Increasing annual ship-procurement funding substantially from current levels, however, may not be easy. In a situation of finite defense funding, increasing funding for Navy ship procurement could require reducing funding for other Navy or DOD priorities. The Navy has worked in recent years to operate more efficiently on a day-to-day basis so that the resulting savings could be applied to Navy procurement programs. In practice, however, savings from these efficiencies have been offset by rising Navy costs in other areas, such as personnel-related costs.", "A second option would be to modify the way in which new Navy ships are funded in the budget. Possible changes that have been suggested include making greater use of incremental funding or starting to use advance appropriations. This option, which is examined in CRS Report RL32776, might marginally increase the number of ships that could be procured for a given total amount of money. As discussed in that report, however, it could also pose potentially significant issues relating to Congress's power of the purse and Congress's responsibility for conducting effective oversight of DOD activities.", "A third option would be to make greater use in Navy ship-procurement programs of a contracting method known as multiyear procurement (MYP). This option, like the previous one, might marginally increase the number of ships that could be procured for a given total amount of money. Not all Navy ship-procurement programs, however, would meet the legal requirements for MYP, and making greater use of MYP could reduce DOD's and Congress's flexibility to adjust ship-procurement plans in future years to respond to changing strategic and budgetary circumstances.", "A fourth option would be to change the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships. For example, the Navy estimated in 2005 that changing from a strategy of dividing DDG-1000 destroyers evenly between two yards to a strategy of having all DDG-1000s built by a single yard could reduce the cost for building 10 DDG-1000s by a total of $3 billion, or an average of $300 million per ship. Shifting to a single-yard acquisition strategy, however, could cause the second yard to permanently exit the business of building that kind of ship. That could leave the Navy with a single source for building that kind of ship, which could prevent the Navy in the future from using competition or benchmarking to spur design innovation, constrain costs, maintain production quality, and ensure adherence to scheduled delivery dates.", "Another potential change in acquisition strategy would be to make greater use of competition in Navy ship acquisition. Competition is used today in Navy ship acquisition primarily in the early stages of ship-acquisition programs, to determine who will design and build the lead ship in each new class. Making greater use of competition in Navy ship acquisition could involve using competition between shipyards in awarding contracts for building follow-on ships in each class. This step, if taken, would represent a return to Navy practices in the 1980s. Employing competition in the awarding of contracts for building follow-on ships, however, requires either an annual procurement rate for the class of ship in question that is high enough so that the government can contemplate giving ships to one yard or another without endangering the financial health of either yard, or a willingness on the part of the government to have contract award lead to a decision by the losing yard to permanently withdraw from the business of building that kind of ship, or Navy ships generally. In the latter case, the Navy's contract-award decision could leave the Navy with a single source for that kind of ship in the future.", "A fifth option would be to take steps to reduce the amount of shipyard fixed overhead costs that are incorporated into the procurement costs of Navy ships. This could be accomplished by eliminating any excess capacity among the yards building Navy ships, which would eliminate the fixed overhead costs associated with maintaining that capacity, or by increasing other kinds of work done by those yards, so that this other work could absorb a greater portion of the yards' fixed overhead costs. Potential other forms of work include construction of ships for other U.S. government agencies, such as the Coast Guard or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), construction of commercial ships, overhaul and repair of Navy or other U.S. government ships, and overhaul and repair of commercial ships.", "A sixth option would be to improve the operating efficiency of yards building Navy ships by incorporating more advanced design and production processes and equipment. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) is one effort aimed at this goal. A May 2005 DOD report compares the operating efficiency of the yards that build the Navy's major ships relative to that of foreign shipyards that are considered to be among the world's most efficient, and makes recommendations for how to improve the operating efficiency of the U.S. yards.", "A seventh option would be to build Navy ships without some of their planned equipment (or with less expensive substitute equipment). Building a ship without some of its planned equipment (or with less expensive substitute equipment) would likely reduce its capabilities. Equipment not installed during the original construction process could be added back later, after the ship had entered service. This would restore the ship's lost capability but add back the cost of this equipment, in which case the ship's procurement cost, instead of being reduced, would have been partially deferred into the future. Installing this equipment on an in-service ship, moreover, may be more expensive than building it into the ship during its original construction process. As a consequence, this strategy over the long run could increase the procurement total cost of the ship\u00a0above what it would have been if the ship had been built from the beginning with all its planned equipment.", "An eighth option would be to build Navy ships in foreign shipyards where construction costs may be lower to due lower wages and material prices or other factors. Regarding this option, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07309 states that \"no vessel to be constructed for any of the armed forces, and no major component of the hull or superstructure of any such vessel, may be constructed in a foreign shipyard.\" The provision permits the President to authorize exceptions when the President determines that it is in the national security interest. In such cases, the President is to notify Congress of the determination, and no contract may be made until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the notice is received. The provision also exempts inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats. In addition to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07309, the annual DOD appropriations act contains a provision in the section entitled \"Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy,\" stating that funds for Navy shipbuilding are made available for the fiscal year in question provided, among other things, \"That none of the funds provided under this heading for the construction or conversion of any naval vessel to be constructed in shipyards in the United States shall be expended in foreign facilities for the construction of major components of such vessel: Provided further, that none of the funds provided under this heading shall be used for the construction of any naval vessel in foreign shipyards.\"", "A recent report from the RAND Corporation provides additional discussion of why Navy ships\u00a0cost much more today than they did decades ago, and of options for reducing the cost of Navy ships."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
