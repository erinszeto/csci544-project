France, Germany, and other EUmembers claim that the embargo hinders the development of a \"strategic partnership\" with China. The Bush Administration and Members of Congress strongly oppose an end to the EU's armsembargo and urge stronger arms export controls. The United States contends that engagement withChina need not send the wrong signals on China's human rights record and military buildup thatthreatens a peaceful resolution of Taiwan and other Asian issues.", "The EU argues that the arms embargo -- which is not legally binding -- is weak and largelysymbolic. Indeed, some EU members reportedly have allowed defense-related exports to Chinaunder the arms embargo. While such sales have raised questions about the effectiveness of the EU'sarms embargo on China, they also point to the potential for future sales of military equipment ortechnology to China, particularly without the political restraint of the embargo. EU governments,led by the United Kingdom, stress that if and when the embargo is overturned, its end would beaccompanied by a stronger EU arms export control regime -- including an enhanced EU Code ofConduct on Arms Exports -- that will improve accountability and better control arms sales to Chinaand elsewhere. U.S. critics, however, remain skeptical that even a tighter EU Code will containsufficient enforcement and transparency mechanisms to dissuade EU countries from exportingadvanced defense technologies that could enhance China's military buildup and ultimately threatencommon U.S., European, and Asian interests in peace and stability.", "All 25 EU member states must agree before the embargo can be overturned. Although manyobservers had expected that the EU would lift the embargo in the spring of 2005, some membersgrew hesitant amid vocal and high-level U.S. opposition, especially since early 2005. Those arguingagainst lifting the embargo have cited persistent human rights problems in China, including a refusalto reexamine the Tiananmen Crackdown, and China's adoption in March 2005 of its \"Anti-SecessionLaw\" warning of a possible use of force against Taiwan. At present, ending the arms embargo onChina does not appear to be high on the EU's agenda. Still, the EU is politically committed tooverturning the embargo, and many observers believe that its end is ultimately only a matter of time. In the meantime, U.S. diplomacy could be effective, and the disagreement presents a chance forcloser coordination of U.S.-European policies, including those dealing with arms export controls anda rising China.", "Overall, there are two sets of questions for Congress in examining U.S. policy toward the fateof the EU's arms embargo on China. What are the implications for U.S. interests in trans-Atlanticrelations and China?

If U.S. interests are adverselyaffected, what are some options for Congress to discourage the EU from lifting its arms embargo onChina and, if it is lifted, to protect U.S. national security interests? The purpose of this CRS Reportis to discuss U.S. concerns and implications for U.S. interests, as the EU considers the future of thearms embargo, as well as options for U.S. policy.", "Given strenuous U.S. objections, there are concerns that a decision made by the EU to expandengagement with China by lifting the arms embargo would negatively impact the trans-Atlanticalliance (if there is a division in U.S. and European approaches toward China) and defensecooperation (if the United States responds by restricting technology transfers to Europe or defenseprocurement from Europe). At the same time, the current disagreement presents an opportunity forcloser coordination of U.S.-European policies, including controls over military-related exports andstrategy towards China. The United States has important interests in maintaining strong allianceswith common approaches toward a rising China.", "Like Europe, Washington increasingly has engaged Beijing on the economic, political, andmilitary fronts. A fundamental issue, then, has been how engagement is pursued and whether itcontributes to a more responsible China in domestic and international affairs or aggravatesdevelopments in China with adverse implications. For decades, U.S.-PRC relations have expandedwith trade and cooperation on international issues. There remain Western concerns, however, aboutrestrictions on human rights and democracy in China, and about the impact of China's weaponsproliferation practices and military buildup on peace and stability in Asia and other regions aroundthe world.", "Because some European companies have transferred defense-related systems to China underthe arms embargo that is not legally binding, the United States has called for the EU to maintain theembargo and strengthen export controls. There are fears that any acceleration of China's militarymodernization with European defense technology would result in instability in the Taiwan Strait,which could involve U.S. military intervention. This concern stems from one dilemma for U.S.policy: adherence to the \"one China\" policy since the Nixon Administration started secret talks withthe PRC in 1971 while maintaining diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (commonlycalled Taiwan) until 1979 and unofficial relations since then.", "Taiwan remains the major U.S.-PRC issue that could bring the countries into conflict. The1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), P.L. 96-8 , governs U.S. policy toward Taiwan, including offeringarms to assist its self-defense. The TRA did not commit the President and Congress to determineany decision to intervene in the event of threats to Taiwan, other than to consider any non-peacefulefforts to determine Taiwan's future \"of grave concern to the United States.\" Nonetheless, amongthe stipulations of U.S. policy, the TRA declared that it is U.S. policy \"to maintain the capacity ofthe United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize thesecurity, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.\" (2) Thus, in addition to issuesabout arms sales to Taiwan and the extent of any U.S. commitment to help defend Taiwan, onequestion is whether the U.S. forces have the capability to deter or defeat the PLA, not only in theevent of a use of force but also coercion against Taiwan. Maintenance of cross-strait stability hasrequired a careful balance of ties with both the PRC and Taiwan. There have been periodicallyheightened tensions between the PRC and Taiwan since the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-1996,sensitive assertions of a separate national identity in Taiwan since 1999, and President Bush'sarticulation of stronger U.S. support for Taiwan's self-defense in 2001, later qualified by criticismof Taiwan's president in 2003 for perceived attempts to change the cross-strait status quo."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Congress exercises oversight of the effectiveness of the Bush Administration's diplomacytoward Europe.

Moreover, Congress has expressed increasing concerns about the PLA'smodernization, particularly following the military exercises and missile launches targeted againstTaiwan in 1995-1996. Because many EU member states have narrowly interpreted the armsembargo as banning only lethal weapons, some EU countries have sold defense-related technologyto China. There is concern that without the arms embargo, EU countries might sell additionaldual-use technology and/or weapons systems to China. The PLA could then employ Europeantechnology and weapons against U.S. forces and friends, in the event of a conflict with China.

The declaration condemns the \"brutal repression\" taking place inChina, requests that the Chinese authorities cease executions and respect human rights, and containsmeasures agreed by the member states.

Accordingto the EU, the embargo does not cover a large proportion of \"sensitive items,\" which are covered byother EU legal mechanisms.

(18) France and Germany were key drivers of this review process.", "The EU-China summit on December 8, 2004, came three days before crucial elections inTaiwan, for which its president campaigned (unsuccessfully) to win a majority for his coalition inthe legislature that some feared would lead to constitutional changes considered by Beijing toprovocatively push for de jure independence. The EU decided to maintain the embargo at thatsensitive time, although it asserted its \"political intention to continue to work towards lifting theembargo.\" China welcomed this \"positive signal\" for development of the \"comprehensive strategicpartnership\" with the EU. (19) ", "The decision to end the EU arms embargo rests with the member states of the Union andrequires unanimity. In other words, all member states of the now-25 member EU must agree beforethe arms embargo can be lifted. At the December 16-17, 2004 meeting of EU heads of state andgovernment in Brussels, EU leaders \"reaffirmed the political will to continue to work toward liftingthe arms embargo.\" (20) The EU did not state a firm date for ending the embargo, but statements by EU officials stronglysuggested that the embargo would be lifted in the spring of 2005.", "France and Germany, under the previous leadership of German Chancellor GerhardSchroeder, have been key proponents of ending the EU arms embargo on China. Other memberstates have been more hesitant. The United Kingdom (U.K.) and the Netherlands have shared U.S.concerns about the strategic implications of an end to the embargo, while some of the Scandinaviancountries and other smaller states with strong human rights advocacy policies have also been lessenthusiastic. But by early 2005, sufficient consensus appeared to have been built up among EUmembers to lift the embargo in May or June 2005. The willingness of the U.K. and others tooverturn the embargo appeared based on their view that the embargo itself was largely ineffectiveand that it would only be lifted if a stronger EU export control regime was put in place at the sametime. Some observers also suggest that London was eager to burnish its European credentials andkeen to avoid another fight with Paris and Berlin so soon after their rift over the war in Iraq.", "However, the EU did not move ahead with lifting the embargo in the spring of 2005. EUofficials attribute the delay largely to the PRC's \"Anti-Secession Law,\" warning of the use of forceagainst perceived efforts at establishing Taiwan's independence. On March 14, 2005, China adoptedits \"Anti-Secession Law,\" declaring in Article 8 that:", "If the separatist forces of \"Taiwan independence\" useany name or any means to cause the fact of Taiwan's separation from China, or a major incidentoccurs that would lead to Taiwan's separation from China, or the possibilities of peaceful unificationare completely exhausted, the country may adopt non-peaceful means and other necessary measuresto safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

A high-level EU delegation to Washington in mid-March 2005 failed to convince U.S. officials andMembers of Congress that existing EU plans for tighter export controls would sufficiently constrainarms sales to China. Strong U.S. opposition and lingering human rights concerns about China alsocaused some EU members to consider postponing the decision on the arms embargo. (24) ", "As a result, ending the arms embargo on China does not appear to be high on the EU's agendafor the near to medium term. The new German government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, whichassumed office in November 2005, is perceived as being much less enthusiastic about lifting theembargo, especially without U.S. consent, than the previous Schroeder government. The UnitedStates and the EU have also begun a \"strategic dialogue\" on China and other Asian security issues. However, many analysts point out that the EU remains politically committed to lifting the embargo,and believe that its end may ultimately be only a matter of time. China continues to maintain thatthe EU's arms ban is outdated and should be lifted. EU officials stress that if and when the embargois lifted, its end would be accompanied by the simultaneous introduction of a package of measures,including an enhanced EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, to curtail more effectively Europeanarms sales to China (and elsewhere), and to address U.S. concerns.

The first argument is that China's human rights violations that formed the basisfor the embargo still exist. The second is that any expanded EU defense sales to China woulddamage U.S. security interests. The U.S. national interests threatened by a lifting of the armsembargo deal with security and value-projection -- especially human rights and democracy. Whetherthe EU's arms embargo is significant or symbolic, lifting it would reduce the leverage of the UnitedStates and Europe on China to improve its human rights situation. From the viewpoint of U.S.concerns, a relaxation would send a signal to China that it can continue to violate internationalstandards of human rights and that the United States, rather than China, is increasingly isolated inits views. The pressure would also lessen on the rulers in Beijing to reexamine the TiananmenCrackdown. Since the late 1990s, the United States has urged China to \"ratify and adhere to theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\" (26) On the eve of the EU-China summit in December 2004, Chinaacknowledged that it was still studying how to ratify the covenant. (27) ", "On January 28, 2004, a State Department spokesman acknowledged that the United Stateshad held \"senior-level\" discussions with France and other EU countries about the issue of whetherto lift the embargo on arms sales to China. He said, \"certainly for the United States, our statutes andregulations prohibit sales of defense items to China. We believe that others should maintain theircurrent arms embargoes as well. We believe that the U.S. and European prohibitions on arms salesare complementary, were imposed for the same reasons, specifically serious human rights abuses,and that those reasons remain valid today.\" (28) The Bush Administration reportedly also lodged diplomaticprotests with EU members. (29) ", "At a hearing of the House International Relations Committee in February 2004,Representative Steve Chabot asked Secretary of State Colin Powell about the EU's reconsiderationof the arms embargo against China, as supported by France. Powell responded that he raised thisissue with the foreign ministers of France, Ireland, United Kingdom, and Germany, and expressedopposition to a change in the EU's policy at that time in light of the PLA's missiles arrayed againstTaiwan, the referendums on sensitive political issues then planned in Taiwan, and China's humanrights conditions. (30) ", "A State Department spokesman argued on January 25, 2005, that the United States wouldcontinue to champion human rights in countries whether they are small or big, and that China'shuman rights situation not only has not improved, but has suffered \"some negativedevelopments.\" (31) OnFebruary 28, 2005, the State Department issued its report on human rights in 2004. It reported thatChina's human rights record \"remained poor,\" and the Government continued to commit \"numerousand serious abuses,\" although it amended the constitution to mention human rights for the first time. Moreover, \"authorities were quick to suppress religious, political, and social groups that theyperceived as threatening to government authority or national stability, especially before sensitivedates such as the 15th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and other significant political andreligious occasions.\" The PRC government also used the international war on terrorism \"as a pretextfor cracking down harshly on suspected Uighur separatists expressing peaceful political dissent andon independent Muslim religious leaders.\" (32) ", "However, there is an apparent inconsistency in the Administration's claim that the EU is nottaking into adequate consideration China's human rights conditions. On March 17, 2005, Chinareleased a Uighur woman named Rebiya Kadeer whom China arrested in 1999 in Xinjiang, and onthe same day, the State Department announced that the Administration decided not to introduce aresolution on China's human rights abuses at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, citing \"somesignificant steps\" on human rights. The State Department acknowledged that Kadeer's impendingrelease was \"a factor\" in the decision. The decision raised a question about whether it underminedthe U.S. position that the EU should not end the arms embargo because of human rights concerns. The State Department responded that the embargo was imposed because of the TiananmenCrackdown, \"and there are hundreds of demonstrators that remain imprisoned and there is a completeunwillingness to revisit or examine that incident in a critical light. So with regard to the conditionsleading to the embargo, those have not changed at all, period.\" (33) ", "Regarding this U.S. argument, China's government remains unmoved in its position that itwas justified in using military force in the Tiananmen Crackdown. The State Department's reporton human rights noted that the PRC government \"outlawed public commemoration of the 1989Tiananmen massacre.\" Zhao Ziyang, the PRC premier at the time of the Tiananmen Crackdown whowas put under house arrest afterwards for not supporting the use of force, died on January 17, 2005. PRC rulers allowed his family to hold only a simple funeral on January 29, kept victims in housearrest, and deployed internal security forces to suppress voices of dissent calling for a reassessmentof the brutal repression. (34) On March 22, 2005, hundreds of the former leaders of the 1989pro-democracy movement, relatives of victims of the crackdown, and other activists wrote a letterto Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union and the President of the EuropeanCommission contending that \"the human rights situation in China has not undergone anyfundamental change since 1989.\" Moreover, they warned that \"doing away with this sanctionwithout corresponding improvements in human rights would send the wrong signal to the Chinesepeople, including especially those of us who lost loved ones, who are persecuted, and for all Chinesewho continue to struggle for the ideal that inspired the 1989 movement.\" (35) ", "In early February 2005, newly-appointed Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visitedBrussels and expressed opposition to lifting the arms embargo on China and optimism that \"theEuropeans are listening to our concerns.\" She cited concerns about human rights and the militarybalance with China in Asia, namely, \"the transfer of technology that might endanger in some waythe very delicate military balance,\" while there are still American forces in the region. (36) Later that month, theAdministration carried out diplomacy at the highest level with European allies. President Bushvisited Brussels and cautioned that European defense-related transfers \"would change the balanceof relations between China and Taiwan.\" (37) ", "During Rice's first visit to Asia in March 2005 since becoming Secretary of State, shepublicly warned that because the U.S. maintains a military presence in the Pacific region to supporta stable environment for economic growth and democratic development, \"anything that would appearto try and alter that balance would be of concern to us.\" She expressed concerns about the rise ofChina's military spending and potential military power with its \"increasing sophistication.\" Ricestated that \"the European Union should do nothing to contribute to a circumstance in which Chinesemilitary modernization draws on European technology or even the political decision to suggest thatit could draw on European technology when, in fact, it is the United States -- not Europe -- that hasdefended the Pacific.\" (38) ", "Nonetheless, there are questions about the effectiveness of U.S. leverage and diplomacy, inpart because of perceived mixed messages in the policy of engagement toward China, including thedecision not to introduce a resolution at the Human Rights Commission. Also, while the UnitedStates has provided support to Taiwan's self-defense, it has adhered to the \"one China\" policy ofworking with the PRC on a range of international issues (with North Korean nuclear weaponsfrequently cited as a common problem). The United States also pursues Permanent Normal TradeRelations and significant trade with China, now ranked as the third largest U.S. trading partner (butwith a 2005 U.S. trade deficit of $203 billion in China's favor). (39) There are questions aboutwhether U.S. policy actually has promoted cross-strait stability, democracy, and human rights inChina.

Rather, China is likely to seektechnology-transfers and co-development and co-production. In particular, the article pointed toChina's need for French missile technology, German submarine technology, British enginetechnology, advanced electronics and information technology, precision-guidance for missiles,sensors, lasers, radars, Galileo satellite navigational system, and stealth technology.

For example, the head of the U.K.'s BAE Systems, MikeTurner, has stressed that his company would not jeopardize its lucrative business with the U.S.Defense Department because of possible sales in China. (63) While EADS might be interested in defense sales to China,Co-president Rainer Hertrich said that the company would not jeopardize its business in the UnitedStates by selling military equipment to China, conceding that \"we have to take the United States intoaccount in matters regarding China and Taiwan.\" (64) As China develops its defense or dual-use industries, there areadditional concerns that it would copy Western technology and be a competitor in the long run.

These measures, they claim,exert considerable peer pressure on the member states to abide by the Code. For example, under thedenial notification procedure, member states are required to transmit through diplomatic channelsinformation on licenses refused and reasons for the denial. Before a member state authorizes alicense for the same transaction that has already been refused by another member state, it must firstconsult the member state that rejected the license. If a member state decides to issue the license, itmust inform the state that refused to grant authorization.", "Nevertheless, numerous analysts have criticized the Code for containing several weaknessesand loopholes that militate against the Code being a strong regime in its current form. For example,some point out that although the Code sets up a denial notification procedure, there is no requirementfor notification of licenses granted. Many also say that the Code's general reporting requirementsdo not provide sufficient transparency or accountability. The Code calls on each member state toprepare a confidential annual report, which is to be circulated by each member to the other EU states,on its defense exports and implementation of the Code. A consolidated public report is subsequentlyproduced based on the submissions of individual EU members. However, the complete details ofactual arms exports made by EU states are not set out in this public document, although it doesprovide values of arms export licenses issued and values of deliveries made, if available, by theexporting country. A supplier list is also provided, giving a total of sales denials made, but not whatspecific weapon sale was denied, nor to whom. Consequently, some analysts say that the Code'sreporting requirements do not provide a full or clear picture of all EU arms exports; this, in turn,fuels suspicions that some EU member states may be understating the extent of defense deals alreadytaking place with China.", "Furthermore, critics argue that individual states have different arms trade licensing, datacollecting and reporting practices, so there is often a lack of uniformity in reporting across themembership of the EU. For example, the EU's 2003 public report on the Code's implementationbreaks down the export data by EU Common Military List category. For those states whoselicensing systems categorize their arms export licenses in detail, it is possible to get a sense of whatgeneral types of military equipment are being licensed. However, the U.K. provides no detailedbreakdown of its licenses because the way its standard export licenses are valued in its nationallicensing system currently preclude this. The same is true for Italy and the Czech Republic. Franceand Germany are able to break down the categories of their licenses for purposes of the EUreport. (82) ", "Another complaint that some U.S. critics level against the Code is that it is neither legallybinding nor enforceable. They are skeptical of EU arguments that the Code represents an effectivepolitically binding commitment or that its reporting requirements dissuade member states fromfinancially profitable arms exports. As evidence, they point to the increase in EU arms sales licensesto China over the last few years. EU officials maintain that although the Code is not legally binding,it is not voluntary either; all member states have agreed and are expected to implement the commonforeign policy goals and moral imperative embodied in the Code.", "Some analysts suggest that the Code should be transformed into an EU Common Positionin the context of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. The Treaty on European Union (theMaastricht Treaty) states that \"member states shall ensure that their national policies conform to thecommon positions.\" (83) They believe this would lend added credibility to the Code and would effectively require itsenforcement in national legislation. Others point out that enforcement would still be up to thecompetent authorities in the EU's member states, which could leave some differences in terms ofimplementation across the Union. More importantly, the decision to grant or deny any arms exportwould likely remain at the national discretion of each member, as the current Code states. For theforeseeable future, no member state would be willing to cede sovereignty over its national exportcontrol policies to the Union, or to agree to a sanctions scheme if one or more members were foundnon-compliant with the Code. In other situations in which EU members have agreed to enactpenalties on their partners if they do not live up to their commitments -- as with the financialrequirements set out in the EU's Stability and Growth Pact for the EU's single currency -- memberstates have been reluctant to actually impose such penalties for political reasons.

Although the United States couldgenerally find domestic sources for defense components currently received from EU member states,this would require delays in production of given weapons systems and would increase costs untilviable alternate U.S. domestic sources were identified and qualified, manufacturing facilities werecreated and placed under contract, and production to existing quality standards wasinitiated.", "In addition, if the EU were to end its arms ban on China, most observers believe that neitherthe Bush Administration nor Congress would be likely to support exempting the U.K. or other EUmember states from existing U.S. arms export controls. For several years efforts have beenunderway to exempt, in particular, the United Kingdom from the requirements of Section 38(j) ofthe U.S. Arms Export Control Act (AECA). This has generally been referred to as seeking a waiverfrom the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). (95) Under such an exemption,unclassified defense items (equipment and intellectual materials) could be exported without the needfor a U.S. export license. The rationale for such an exemption has been that certain allied countrieswith proven records of strict arms export controls, and common concerns about weaponsproliferation, should be permitted to obtain U.S. defense articles and services with a minimum ofregulatory review. Prior to the recent controversy over the EU embargo on China, the U.K. had notyet fully overcome Congressional concerns about the nature of U.K. export controls, includingconcerns about re-transfer controls. In October 2004, Congress passed a provision in the Ronald W.Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 ( P.L. 108-375 ) that directs expeditedprocessing of U.K. requests for the purchase of U.S. defense articles or services, but does not providefor waiver of their review under U.S. law and regulations. (See the Legislation section below fordetails.)", "Some speculate that European frustration with existing U.S. export controls on sensitiveweapons technologies may play a role in the EU decision to lift or maintain the embargo. Theysuggest that some European defense policymakers are doubtful that they would ever obtain ITARwaivers. As a result, such European officials might feel that they have little to lose in this regard byagreeing to lift the EU arms embargo on China. (96) ", "Supporters of a strong transatlantic partnership caution that both the United States and its European allies must not allow the EU arms embargo issue to drive a wedge in the U.S.-Europeanrelationship. Some say this would fulfill what many China-watchers believe to be a PRC goal, i.e.,to separate the United States from its traditional allies and increase U.S. isolation. Atlanticists arguethat the United States and Europe stand a much better chance of addressing the challenges posed byChina's rise if they work together rather than at cross purposes. Many suggest that despite thetensions surrounding the arms embargo issue, it has created an opportunity to establish aU.S.-European dialogue on security challenges in East Asia and their implications for U.S. and alliedinterests. On the other hand, they believe that if the United States sanctions European companiesor restricts U.S.-European defense industrial cooperation in response to an end to the EU armsembargo on China, this would severely sour transatlantic relations. A significant transatlantic riftover the EU arms embargo on China could also hinder Washington's ability to gain allied supportand cooperation on other global concerns ranging from countering terrorism to promoting peace inthe Middle East to making the world trading system more open and efficient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Policy Toward China", "paragraphs": ["If the EU ended its arms embargo on China, particularly without a correspondingimprovement in the U.S.-European dialogue, one implication might be a reduction in coordinatedWestern leverage on China to improve its human rights practices. Moreover, there might be lesspressure on China's rulers to reexamine the Tiananmen Crackdown, a reexamination that wouldundermine China's justification for a possible military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstratorsin the future. U.S. policy-makers might also review the priority placed on improving human rightsconditions in China in the broader approach towards China.", "On the security side, since the Nixon Administration in the early 1970s, the United States haspromoted a policy of peaceful engagement with China, including vast economic ties, but remainedvigilant to destabilizing moves by China. In the current Bush Administration, the U.S. NationalSecurity Strategy stated that \"we welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperousChina.\" At the same time, there are concerns. The same strategy also warned that \"in pursuingadvanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China isfollowing an outdated path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness.\" (98) ", "Despite the engagement policy, there are concerns about China's rising economic, political,and military power, because of what some perceive as conflicting U.S.-China strategic interests formaintenance of global peace and stability. The Bush Administration's Quadrennial Defense Review(QDR) of 2001 declared that one U.S. security objective is to preclude hostile domination of criticalareas, particularly Europe, Northeast Asia, the East Asian littoral, and the Middle East and SouthwestAsia. Issued after the EP-3 aircraft collision crisis with China in April 2001, (99) the QDR cautioned that\"although the United States will not face a peer competitor in the near future, the potential exists forregional powers to develop sufficient capabilities to threaten stability in regions critical to U.S.interests. In particular, Asia is gradually emerging as a region susceptible to large-scale militarycompetition.\" While China is not named explicitly, the report points out that \"the possibility existsthat a military competitor with a formidable resource base will emerge in the region.\" Moreover, thereport noted one particular area of concern: the \"East Asia littoral\" is defined as the region stretchingfrom south of Japan through Australia and into the Bay of Bengal. (100) ", "Security implications would not be confined to the Asian region or the United States. TheEU also has recognized that weapons nonproliferation is an issue with China. At the EU-Chinasummit on December 8, 2004, they issued a \"Joint Declaration on Nonproliferation and ArmsControl.\" There is concern that foreign cooperation with PRC defense-industrial corporations benefitand subsidize some that have engaged in weapons proliferation, including to unstable areas such asthe Middle East. Moreover, as China obtains more advanced technology, it can sell its olderequipment to poorer countries or those with problematic human rights records.", "The United States has imposed sanctions on PRC entities, including some in the defenseindustries, with multiple sanctions imposed in certain cases on the same \"serial proliferators.\" European companies have cooperated with some PRC organizations of concern for weaponsproliferation. For example, Eurocopter signed an agreement with the Hafei Aviation IndustryCompany and China Aero-Technology Import-Export Corporation (CATIC) to assemble HC120helicopters. (101) TheState Department imposed sanctions for weapons proliferation on CATIC in May 2002 andDecember 2004. Italy's Iveco company has cooperated with North China Industries Corporation(NORINCO) to produce an anti-tank weapon. A defense-industrial organization, NORINCO hasbeen a subject of U.S. sanctions on six occasions. U.S. sanctions also have been imposed on PRCentities in the shipbuilding and space launch industries. Alcatel's sale of the Chinasat-9communication satellite undercuts U.S. sanctions for PRC weapons proliferation, which haveprohibited the export of U.S. satellites to China. (102) ", "Furthermore, the EU's consideration of an end to its arms embargo on China has raised U.S.concerns about the EU's support for U.S. efforts to discourage an aggressive PRC posture in theTaiwan Strait and elsewhere in Asia. U.S. efforts to uphold Asian stability has fostered conditionsbenefitting U.S., European, Asian, and other economies. In particular, U.S. efforts have intensifiedsince the summer of 2004 to focus on a resumption of cross-strait dialogue. Washington worriesthat, in ending the arms embargo, the EU could inadvertently send a different message from that ofU.S. policy, which denies Beijing's claim to any justification to use force against Taiwan. Accordingto this view, such a move would also undermine the EU's stated policy of supporting a peacefulresolution of the Taiwan question.", "The attention on the EU's arms embargo could also lead to a review of whether U.S. armssanctions on China should be maintained, eased, or tightened. A periodic issue concerns whetherto issue further waivers of the sanctions imposed for the Tiananmen Crackdown, including forsatellite exports (as discussed above in U.S. Sanctions on Arms Sales to China ). In 2002, the StateDepartment considered Boeing's request to export Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to China. (103) China's organizers andAmerican exporters could urge transfers of U.S. equipment related to security surrounding theOlympics to be held in Beijing in 2008, equipment that also could be used for internal security.", "There is increasing concern in the U.S. government that China's military modernization isaccelerated, offensive, and destabilizing, threatening U.S. forces and allies. Among U.S. allies,Japan, in particular, has increased concerns about the PLA's buildup. Japanese officials publiclyhave expressed opposition to the EU lifting its arms embargo, particularly after incidents that raisedtensions. On November 10, 2004, a PLA Han-class submarine intruded into Japanese territorialwaters, and Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force deployed anti-submarine aircraft and destroyersto track the submarine. On January 22, 2005, Japan's Maritime Self-defense Forces tracked the PLANavy's two Sovremenny-class destroyers in waters under Japanese surveillance. (104) Japanese ForeignMinister Nobutaka Machimura told the EU's top foreign policy official, Javier Solana, on February8 that Japan opposes the lifting of the arms embargo, because that would have \"a negative effect onsecurity not only in Japan, but also in East Asia.\" (105) The United States and Japan issued a Joint Statement onFebruary 19, 2005, which explicitly declared that they seek the common strategic objectives ofencouraging China to \"play a responsible and constructive role regionally as well as globally\" andencouraging \"the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through dialogue.\" (106) In September 2005,the PLA Navy deployed five ships, including a Sovremenny destroyer, to disputed waters betweenChina and Japan with conflicting claims to gas and oil drilling rights. Thus, the impact of U.S.diplomacy with the EU would affect U.S. security interests as well as those of allies, such as Japan(especially given the new level of U.S.-Japan allied coordination on security concerns).", "Attention on the EU's arms embargo also raises questions about broader concerns over therange of arms suppliers to the PLA, including Russia, Europe, and Israel.
