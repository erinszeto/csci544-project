It also notes related policy issues of potential interest to Congress.", "For military planners, the control of information is critical to military success, and communications networks and computers are of vital operational importance. The use of technology to both control and disrupt the flow of information has been generally referred to by several names: information warfare, electronic warfare, cyberwar, netwar, and Information Operations (IO). Currently, IO activities are grouped by the Department of Defense (DOD) into five core capabilities: (1) Psychological Operations, (2) Military Deception, (3) Operational Security, (4) Computer Network Operations, and (5) Electronic Warfare.", "Current U.S. military doctrine for IO now places increased emphasis on Psychological Operations, Computer Network Operations, and Electronic Warfare, which includes use of non-kinetic electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons, and non-lethal weapons for crowd control. However, as high technology is increasingly incorporated into military functions, the boundaries between all five IO core capabilities are becoming blurred. DOD also acknowledges the existence of a cyber domain, which is similar to air, land, and sea. This new domain is the realm where military functions occur that involve manipulation of the electromagnetic spectrum. Control of the spectrum is essential to military success across all other domains. Definitions and examples of the overlapping categories of IO activity are contained in the appendixes.", "This report will be updated to accommodate significant changes."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Control of information has always been part of military operations, and the U.S. Strategic Command views information operations as a core military competency, with new emphasis on (1) use of electromagnetic energy, (2) cyber operations, and (3) use of psychological operations to manipulate an adversary's perceptions. Department of Defense (DOD) officials now consider cyberspace to be a domain for warfare, similar to air, space, land, and sea. A recent memo issued by the Secretary of Defense defines cyberspace as: \"a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"", "This definition is consistent with the one presented in the 2008 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), which is the overall guidance for all the services. A September 29, 2008, memo signed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense defines cyberspace operations as: \"The employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace. Such operations include computer network operations and activities to operate and defend the Global Information Grid.\"", "Cyberspace operations are a component of Information Operations (IO), which also includes Electronic Warfare (EW). Each service has organizations with IO and EW responsibilities: (1) the Naval Network Warfare Command (NETWARCOM) is the Navy's central operational authority for space, information technology requirements, network and information operations in support of naval forces afloat and ashore; (2) the Army Reserve Information Operations Command has responsibility for conducting information operations, the U.S. Army IO Proponent is responsible for developing requirements for IO doctrine and training, and the Army Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Directorate provides testing services for Electronic Warfare; and finally, (3) the Air Force has created what was to have been a major Cyber Command, but will now be a Numbered Air Force (NAF), the 24 th Air Force to the Air Force Space Command, with responsibility for its portion of cyberwarfare, electronic warfare, and protection of U.S. critical infrastructure networks that support telecommunications systems, utilities, and transportation.", "The DOD views information itself as both a weapon and a target in warfare. In particular, Psychological Operations (PSYOP) provides DOD with the ability to rapidly disseminate persuasive information to directly influence the decision making of diverse audiences, and is seen as a means for deterring aggression, and important for undermining the leadership and popular support for terrorist organizations.", "However, a 2006 report by the RAND Corporation describes how IO can also affect audiences outside of the intended target, stating,", "... in contingencies involving an opponent, information operations planning and execution should include noncombatant considerations that may have nothing to do with affecting the enemy's activities or defending friendly force capabilities. In today's conflict environment the impact of information operations is seldom limited to two opposing sides. Second and higher-order effects will most likely influence all parties in opposition, impact various and varied noncombatant groups, and be interpreted in different ways by members of the media and audiences worldwide.", "Thus, new technologies for military IO also create new national security policy issues, including (1) consideration of psychological operations used to affect friendly nations or domestic audiences; and (2) possible accusations against the U.S. of war crimes if offensive military computer operations or electronic warfare tools severely disrupt critical civilian computer systems, or the systems of non-combatant nations.", "Because of the new communications technologies and the growth of the Internet, EW and IO have taken on new importance. Insurgents use cell phones, garage door openers, and other remotely controlled electronic devices to detonate roadside bombs, and afterwards transmit video images of successful attacks against U.S. troops for broadcast on the local news or the Internet to influence public opinion about the future outcome of the war. In some cases, populations may have these video broadcasts or local TV news stories in their native language as their only source of information. DOD is seeking methods to counter these actions where violence may be seen as secondary to the use and manipulation of information.", "This report describes current adversary threats in the information environment and DOD capabilities for conducting military information operations, gives the current state of federal cybersecurity efforts, and provides an overview of related policy issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Information Operations by Adversaries", "paragraphs": ["The electromagnetic spectrum is the arena in which information operations take place.

Reportedly, only a small portion of the Iraqi populace watch and listen to the current government run television and radio news broadcasts, with the majority preferring instead to support the foreign satellite news stations such as Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya. Observers say that most Arabs believe that U.S. sponsored news broadcasts are managed too closely by the coalition powers and do not objectively present the news. When the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) prohibited Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya from covering all IGC events during a short period in early 2004, this action reportedly gave many Iraqi people the impression that the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was manipulating their information.", "Some observers have also stated that terrorist groups, through use of the Internet, are now challenging the monopoly over mass communications that both state-owned and commercial media have long exercised. A strategy of the terrorists is to propagate their messages quickly and repeat them until they have saturated cyberspace. Internet messages by terrorist groups have become increasingly sophisticated through use of a cadre of Internet specialists who operate computer servers worldwide.

Cyber-based threats against U.S. information infrastructures are now a growing area of concern for national security. The US CERT recently revealed that attacks on US government systems increased by 40% in 2008. Assaults on these systems have been sustained for nearly a decade.", "In 1999, a series of attacks with the US codename \"Moonlight Maze\"were aimed at DOD's unclassified Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet), the network which is used to exchange information internally. These attacks may have compromised massive amounts of sensitive military data, and appeared to originate from a mainframe in Russia. In 2003, a series of cyberattacks designed to copy sensitive data files was launched against DOD systems, and the computers belonging to DOD contractors. The cyberespionage attack apparently went undetected for many months. This series of cyberattacks was labeled \"Titan Rain,\" and was suspected by DOD investigators to have originated in China. The attacks were directed against the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), the U.S. Redstone Arsenal, the Army Space and Strategic Defense Installation, and several computer systems critical to military logistics. Although no classified systems reportedly were breached, many files were copied containing information that is sensitive and subject to U.S. export-control laws.", "In 2006, an extended cyberattack against the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, prompted officials to disconnect the entire campus from the Internet. A similar attack against the Pentagon in 2007 led officials to temporarily disconnect part of the unclassified network from the Internet. DOD officials acknowledge that the Global Information Grid, which is the main network for the U.S. military, experiences more than three million daily scans by unknown potential intruders. ", "Lt. General Charles Croom (JTF-Global Net Operations) has stated that cyber attackers \"are not denying, disrupting, or destroying [American military] operations \u2013 yet. But that doesn't mean they don't have the capability.\" \u00a0Potential adversaries, such as China, Russia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and several non-state terrorist groups are reportedly developing capabilities to attack or degrade U.S. civilian and military networks. \"Titan Rain\" is an example of successful attacks against non-classified military systems which DOD officials claim were directed by other governments. Maj. Gen. William Lord (Air Force) stated publicly in 2007 that \"China has downloaded 10 to 20 terabytes of data from the NIPRNet already.\"", "According to the Defense Department's annual report to Congress on China's military prowess, the Chinese military is enhancing its information operations capabilities.

The move stirred emotions, inciting rioting by ethnic Russians, and the blockading of the Estonian Embassy in Moscow. The event also marked the beginning of a series of large and sustained Distributed Denial-Of-Service (DDOS) attacks launched against several Estonian national websites, including government ministries and the prime minister's Reform Party. DDOS attacks occur when remote computers, often vast networks of \"zombies\" infected with malicious code, are instructed to target particular websites with requests, overwhelming the sites with traffic so that they become unavailable. Estonia's infrastructure relies heavily on information technology, and the country is described as being the most \"wired\" in Europe. Because availability of basic services to Estonian citizens was disrupted, the attacks were considered crippling.", "Initially, the Russian government was blamed by Estonian officials for the cyberattacks, but it is unclear whether the attacks are sanctioned or initiated by the Russian government. NATO sent computer security experts to Estonia to help protect government systems against continued attacks, and to help recover from the attacks.", "However, some analysts later concluded that the cyber attacks targeting Estonia were not a concerted attack, but instead were the product spontaneous anger from a loose federation of separate attackers. Technical data showed that sources of the attack were worldwide rather than concentrated in a few locations. The computer code that caused the DDOS attack was posted and shared in many Russian language chat rooms, where the moving of the statue was a very emotional topic for discussion. These analysts state that although various Estonian government agencies were taken offline, there was no apparent attempt to target national critical infrastructure other than internet resources, and no extortion demands were made. Their analysis concluded that there was no Russian government connection to the attacks against Estonia.", "Ocurring simultaneously with a kinetic attack by Russian forces on Georgia's separatist regions, the country's major internet service providers were targeted with coordinated, sustained cyber attacks, knocking the some of the government's websites offline while defacing others. Investigations later determined that the attacks began with online Russian hacking forums, who distributed lists of Georgian internet sites as targets. Unlike the DDOS attacks on Estonia, the Georgian sites were taken down by exploiting a vulnerability in widely used software to manage Web databases. Rather than involving botnets comprised of thousands, attacks of this nature can be conducted with a single computer. In its effort to mitigate the attacks, the Georgian government blocked all internet traffic originating from Russian users. However, blogs quickly appeared with detailed instructions on how to bypass the block by re-routing the traffic through internet addresses in other countries.", "Although there is no evidence linking the Russian government directly, there is much to suggest that the attacks were at least tolerated and perhaps even encouraged by Russian officials.", "In anothern example of the growing popularity of cyber attacks as an intimidation tactic, Kyrgystan's two main internet service providers\u2014which take up approximately 80% of the country's bandwith\u2014were systematically targeted with denial of service attacks, effectively taking the country offline. Again, there is no evidence of direct involvement with the Russian Government; these attacks instead appeared to have originated with a Russian \"cyber militia.\" Possible motives for the network assault include Russia's displeasure with a U.S. air base located in Kyrgystan, and with the Kyrzyg government's opposition party, which relies on the internet as its media outlet.", "A persistent problem after a computer network attack is accurate and timely identification of the attacker.

If cyberspace is a new battlefield on which war may be waged, then the international community will be challenged to come together to determine its conduct. The attack on Estonia, a member of NATO, raised questions of whether the actions taken could be defined as an \"armed attack\" under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. Internationally, Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations is the guidance for response. For now, NATO and other states consider network protection to be a national responsibility. However, questions of sovereignty, attribution, and response thresholds remain.", "It has been presumed that the rules of engagement for information operations will follow the law of Armed Conflict, meaning a response taken after receiving an electronic or cyber attack will be scaled in proportion to the attack received, and distinctions will be maintained between combatants and civilians. However, protection against attack through cyberspace is a new task for the military, and the offensive tools and other capabilities used by DOD to stage retaliatory strikes against enemy systems are highly classified. Experience has shown that a reactive defense is not very effective against increasingly powerful and rapid malicious cyber attacks, or against other malicious activity using the electromagnetic spectrum. A more effective defense against these attacks is to incorporate predictive, active, and pre-emptive measures that allow DOD defenders to prevent, deflect, or minimize the efforts of the attacker.", "Accurate attribution is important when considering whether to retaliate using military force or police action. Some DOD officials have indicated that the majority of cyber attacks against DOD and U.S. civilian agency systems are suspected to originate in China, and these attacks are consistently more numerous and sophisticated than cyberattacks from other malicious actors. The motives appear to be primarily cyberespionage against civilian agencies, DOD contractors, and DOD systems. The espionage involves unauthorized access to files containing sensitive industrial technology, and unauthorized research into DOD operations.

Thus, it is possible that if a computer facility were deliberately attacked for political purposes, all three methods described above (physical attack, EA, and cyberattack) might contribute to, or be labeled as \"cyberterrorism.\" ", "CRS is unaware of any reported acts of cyberterrorism, to date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cybercrime", "paragraphs": ["Cybercrime is crime that is enabled by, or that targets computers. Some argue there is no agreed-upon definition for \"cybercrime\" because \"cyberspace\" is just a new specific instrument used to help commit crimes that are not new at all. Cybercrime can involve theft of intellectual property, a violation of patent, trade secret, or copyright laws. However, cybercrime also includes attacks against computers to deliberately disrupt processing, or may include espionage to make unauthorized copies of classified data. If a terrorist group were to launch a cyberattack to cause harm, such an act also fits within the definition of a cybercrime. The primary difference between a cyberattack to commit a crime or to commit terror is found in the intent of the attacker, and it is possible for actions under both labels to overlap.", "One of the most prevalent forms of cybercrime is identity theft. Botnets and other examples of malicious code can operate to assist cybercriminals with identity theft, a crime generally motivated by financial gain. Current FBI estimates are that identity theft costs American businesses and consumers $50 billion a year. Individual users are often lured into clicking on tempting links that are found in email or when visiting websites. Clicking on titles such as \"Buy Rolex watches cheap,\" or \"Check out my new Photos,\" can take advantage of web browser vulnerabilities to place malicious software onto a users system which allows a cybercriminal to gather personal information from the user's computer.", "Malicious code can scan a victim's computer for sensitive information, such as name, address, place and date of birth, social security number, mother's maiden name, and telephone number. Full identities obtained this way are bought and sold in online markets. False identity documents can then be created from this information using home equipment such as a digital camera, color printer, and laminating device, to make official-looking driver's licences, birth certificates, reference letters, and bank statements.", "Identity theft involving thousands of victims is also enabled by inadequate computer security practices within organizations. MasterCard International reported that in 2005 more than 40 million credit card numbers belonging to U.S. consumers were accessed by computer hackers. Some of these account numbers were reportedly being sold on a Russian website, and some consumers have reported fraudulent charges on their statements. Officials at the UFJ bank in Japan reportedly stated that some of that bank's customers may also have become victims of fraud related to theft of the MasterCard information. In June 2006, officials from the U.S. Department of Energy acknowledged that names and personal information belonging to more than 1,500 employees of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) had been stolen in a network intrusion that apparently took place starting in 2004. The NNSA did not discover the security breach until one year after it had occurred.", "Some sources report that stolen credit card numbers and bank account information are traded online in a highly structured arrangement, involving buyers, sellers, intermediaries, and service industries. Services include offering to conveniently change the billing address of a theft victim, through manipulation of stolen PINs or passwords. Observers estimated that in 2005 such services for each stolen MasterCard number cost between $42 and $72. Other news articles report that, in 2007, a stolen credit card number sells online for only $1, and a complete identity, including a U.S. bank account number, credit-card number, date of birth, and a government-issued ID number now sells for just $14 to $18.", "As of January 2007, 35 states have enacted data security laws requiring businesses that have experienced an intrusion involving possible identity theft to notify persons affected, and to improve security for protection of restricted data. However, existing federal and state laws that impose obligations on information owners, may require harmonization to provide protections that are more uniform.", "Identity theft continues to plague government systems. The U.S. government's online recruiting website, monster.com, suffered an intrusion in August 2007 that affected the confidential information of nearly 1.3 million users. The company admitted to waiting several days before notifying the public of the breach. The website was attacked again in February 2009, resulting in the theft of personal data for millions of users worldwide. In February 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a letter exposing a data breach that affected more that 45,000 employees. There have been many criticisms of the FAA's handling of the situation, particularly for its failure to publish pertinent information on its website. Some argue that FISMA's requirements have agencies focused on meeting deadlines rather than expending resources on added security measures. ", "Also in February 2009, the Air Force shut down all internet access at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. The measure was in response to an intrusion that may have affected the security of all Air Force systems, but also to stress the importance of information assurance to individual components. Air Force Chief of Staff General Shwartz stated that the disconnect was ordered because personnel \" hadn't demonstrated \u2014 in our view at the headquarters \u2014 their capacity to manage their network in a way that didn't make everyone else vulnerable.

In fact, industrial cyberespionage may now be considered a necessary part of global economic competition, and secretly monitoring the computerized functions and capabilities of potential adversary countries may also be considered essential for national defense.", "U.S. counterintelligence officials reportedly have stated that about 140 different foreign intelligence organizations regularly attempt to hack into the computer systems of U.S. government agencies and U.S. companies. Cyberespionage, which enables the extraction of massive amounts of information electronically, has now transformed the nature of counterintelligence, by enabling a reduced reliance on conventional spying operations. The Internet, including satellite links and wireless local networks, now offers new, low cost and low risk opportunities for espionage. In 2001, a Special Committee of Inquiry established by the European Parliament accused the United States of using its Echelon electronic spy network to engage in industrial espionage against European businesses. Echelon was reportedly set up in 1971 as an electronic monitoring system during the Cold War. European Union member Britain operates the system, which includes listening posts in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Echelon is described as a global spy system reportedly capable of intercepting wireless phone calls, e-mail, and fax messages made from almost any location around the world.", "Former director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, James Woolsey, has reportedly justified the possibility of industrial espionage by the United States on the basis of the use of bribery by European companies. Officials of the European parliament reportedly expressed outrage about the justification, while not denying that bribery is sometimes used to make sales.", "Some government officials warn that criminals now sell or rent malicious code tools for cyberespionage, and the risk for damage to U.S. national security due to cyberespionage conducted by other countries is great. One industry official, arguing for stronger government agency computer security practices, stated that, \"If gangs of foreigners broke into the State or Commerce Departments and carried off dozens of file cabinets, there would be a crisis. When the same thing happens in cyberspace, we shrug it off as another of those annoying computer glitches we must live with.\"", "Security experts warn that all U.S. federal agencies should now be aware that in cyberspace some malicious actors consider that no boundaries exist between military and civilian targets. According to an August 2005 computer security report by IBM, more than 237 million overall security attacks were reported globally during the first half of that year. Government agencies were targeted the most, reporting more than 54 million attacks, while manufacturing ranked second with 36 million attacks, financial services ranked third with approximately 34 million, and healthcare received more than 17 million attacks. The most frequent targets for these attacks, all occurring in the first half of 2005, were government agencies and industries in the United States (12 million), followed by New Zealand (1.2 million), and China (1 million).

Another 72 stolen credit cards were used to register over 180 Internet web domains at 95 different web hosting companies. The group also laundered money charged to more than 130 stolen credit cards through online gambling websites. In all, the trio made fraudulent charges totaling more than $3.5 million from a database containing 37,000 stolen credit card numbers, including account holders' names and addresses, dates of birth, credit balances, and credit limits.", "Cybercriminals have made alliances with drug traffickers in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and elsewhere where illegal drug funds or other profitable activities such as credit card theft, are used to support terrorist groups. Drug traffickers are reportedly among the most widespread users of encryption for Internet messaging, and are able to hire high-level computer specialists to help evade law enforcement, coordinate shipments of drugs, and launder money. Regions with major narcotics markets, such as Western Europe and North America, also possess optimal technology infrastructure and open commercial nodes that increasingly serve the transnational trafficking needs of both criminal and terrorist groups. Officials of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), reported in 2003 that 14 of the 36 groups found on the U.S. State Department's list of foreign terrorist organizations were also involved in drug trafficking. A 2002 report by the Federal Research Division at the Library of Congress, revealed a \"growing involvement of Islamic terrorist and extremists groups in drug trafficking,\" and limited evidence of cooperation between different terrorist groups involving both drug trafficking and trafficking in arms.

These capabilities are interdependent, and increasingly are integrated to achieve desired effects.", "Psychological Operations (PSYOP)", "DOD defines PSYOP as planned operations to convey selected information to targeted foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. For example, during the Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), broadcast messages were sent from Air Force EC-130E aircraft, and from Navy ships operating in the Persian Gulf, along with a barrage of e-mail, faxes, and cell phone calls to numerous Iraqi leaders encouraging them to abandon support for Saddam Hussein.", "The civilian Al Jazeera news network, based in Qatar, beams its messages to well over 35 million viewers in the Middle East, and is considered by many to be a \"market competitor\" for U.S. PSYOP. Terrorist groups can also use the Internet to quickly place their own messages before an international audience. Some observers have stated that the U.S. will continue to lose ground in the global media wars until it develops a coordinated strategic communications strategy to counter competitive civilian news media, such as Al Jazeera.", "Partly in response to this observation, DOD now emphasizes that PSYOP must be improved and focused against potential adversary decision making, sometimes well in advance of times of conflict. Products created for PSYOP must be based on in-depth knowledge of the audience's decision-making processes. Using this knowledge, the PSYOPS products then must be produced rapidly, and disseminated directly to targeted audiences throughout the area of operations.", "Following the Smith-Mundt Act, DOD policy prohibits the use of PSYOP for targeting American audiences. However, while military PSYOP products are intended for foreign targeted audiences, DOD also acknowledges that the global media may pick up some of these targeted messages, and replay them back to the U.S. domestic audience. Therefore, a sharp distinction between foreign and domestic audiences cannot be maintained.", "Military Deception (MILDEC)", "Deception guides an enemy into making mistakes by presenting false information, images, or statements. MILDEC is defined as actions executed to deliberately mislead adversary military decision makers with regard to friendly military capabilities, thereby causing the adversary to take (or fail to take) specific actions that will contribute to the success of the friendly military operation.", "As an example of deception during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the U.S. Navy deployed the Tactical Air Launched Decoy system to divert Iraqi air defenses away from real combat aircraft.", "Operational Security (OPSEC)", "OPSEC is defined as a process of identifying information that is critical to friendly operations and which could enable adversaries to attack operational vulnerabilities. For example, during OIF, U.S. forces were warned to remove certain information from DOD public websites, so that Iraqi forces could not exploit sensitive but unclassified information.", "Computer Network Operations (CNO)", "CNO includes the capability to: (1) attack and disrupt enemy computer networks; (2) defend our own military information systems; and (3) exploit enemy computer networks through intelligence collection, usually done through use of computer code and computer applications. The Joint Information Operations Warfare Command (JIOWC) and the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCCNW) are responsible for the evolving mission of Computer Network Attack. The exact capabilities of the JIOWC and JFCCNW are highly classified, and DOD officials have reportedly never admitted to launching a cyber attack against an enemy, however many computer security officials believe the organization can destroy networks and penetrate enemy computers to steal or manipulate data, and take down enemy command-and-control systems. They also believe that the organization consists of personnel from the CIA, National Security Agency, FBI, the four military branches, and civilians and military representatives from allied nations. The Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO), currently residing within the Defense Information Security Agency (DISA), is an operational arm of the services. A recent decision to move the JTF-GNO under the auspices of the National Security Agency will put defensive and operational capabilities within the same organization."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Computer Network Defense (CND)", "paragraphs": ["CND is defined as defensive measures to protect information, computers, and networks from disruption or destruction. CND includes actions taken to monitor, detect, and respond to unauthorized computer activity. Responses to IO attack against U.S. forces may include use of passive information assurance tools, such as firewalls or data encryption, or may include more intrusive actions, such as monitoring adversary computers to determine their capabilities before they can attempt an IO attack against U.S. forces.", "Some DOD officials believes that CND may lack sufficient policy and legal analysis for guiding appropriate responses to intrusions or attacks on DOD networks. Therefore, DOD has recommended that a legal review be conducted to determine what level of intrusion or data manipulation constitutes an attack. The distinction is necessary in order to clarify whether an action should be called an attack or an intelligence collection operation, and which aggressive actions can be appropriately taken in self-defense. This legal review should also determine if appropriate authorities permit U.S. forces to retaliate through manipulation of unwitting third party computer hosts. And finally, DOD has recommended structuring a legal regime that applies separately to domestic and to foreign sources of computer attack against DOD or the U.S. critical. infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Computer Network Exploitation (CNE)", "paragraphs": ["CNE is an area of IO that is not yet clearly defined within DOD. Before a crisis develops, DOD seeks to prepare the IO battlespace through intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and through extensive planning activities. This involves intelligence collection, that in the case of IO, is usually performed through network tools that penetrate adversary systems to gain information about system vulnerabilities, or to make unauthorized copies of important files. Tools used for CNE are similar to those used for computer attack, but configured for intelligence collection rather than system disruption. Although CNE is an activity designed for data exfiltration, it is unknown whether the methods used to penetrate networks could also be used for an attack by an adversary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Computer Network Attack (CNA)", "paragraphs": ["CNA is defined as effects intended to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks. As a distinguishing feature, CNA normally relies on a data stream used as a weapon to execute an attack. For example, sending a digital signal stream through a network to instruct a controller to shut off the power flow is CNA, while sending a high voltage surge through the electrical power cable to short out the power supply is considered Electronic Warfare (However, a digital stream of computer code or a pulse of electromagnetic power can both be used to also create false images in adversary computers).", "During Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. and coalition forces reportedly did not execute any computer network attacks against Iraqi systems. Even though comprehensive IO plans were prepared in advance, DOD officials stated that top-level approval for several CNA missions was not granted until it was too late to carry them out to achieve war objectives. U.S. officials may have rejected launching a planned cyber attack against Iraqi financial computers because Iraq's banking network is connected to a financial communications network also located in Europe. Consequently, according to Pentagon sources, an information operations attack directed at Iraq might also have brought down banks and ATM machines located in parts of Europe as well. Such global network interconnections, plus close network links between Iraqi military computer systems and the civilian infrastructure, reportedly frustrated attempts by U.S. forces to design a cyber attack that would be limited to military targets only in Iraq.", "In a meeting held in January 2003, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, White House officials sought input from experts outside government on guidelines for use of cyber-warfare. Officials have stated they are proceeding cautiously, since a cyberattack could have serious cascading effects, perhaps causing major disruption to networked civilian systems. In February 2003, the Bush Administration announced national-level guidance for determining when and how the United States would launch computer network attacks against foreign adversary computer systems. The classified guidance, known as National Security Presidential Directive 16, is intended to clarify circumstances under which a disabling computer attack would be justified, and who has authority to launch such an attack.", "Electronic Warfare (EW)", "EW is defined by DOD as any military action involving the direction or control of electromagnetic spectrum energy to deceive or attack the enemy. High power electromagnetic energy can be used as a tool to overload or disrupt the electrical circuitry of almost any equipment that uses transistors, micro-circuits, or metal wiring. Directed energy weapons amplify, or disrupt, the power of an electromagnetic field by projecting enough energy to overheat and permanently damage circuitry, or jam, overpower, and misdirect the processing in computerized systems. The Electronic Warfare Division of the Army Asymmetric Warfare Office has responsibility for creating electronic warfare policy, and for supporting development of new electromagnetic spectrum concepts that can be translated into equipment and weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Domination of the Electromagnetic Spectrum", "paragraphs": ["DOD now emphasizes maximum control of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, including the capability to disrupt all current and future communication systems, sensors, and weapons systems. This may include (1) navigation warfare, including methods for offensive space operations where global positioning satellites may be disrupted; or, (2) methods to control adversary radio systems; and, (3) methods to place false images onto radar systems, block directed energy weapons, and misdirect unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or robots operated by adversaries.", "For example, military IO testing examined the capability to secretly enter an enemy computer network and monitor what their radar systems could detect. Further experiments tested the capability to take over enemy computers and manipulate their radar to show false images."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Weapons", "paragraphs": ["Non-kinetic weapons emit directed electromagnetic energy that, in short pulses, may permanently disable enemy computer circuitry. For example, an electromagnetic non-kinetic weapon mounted in an aircraft, or on the ground, might disable an approaching enemy missile by directing a High Power Microwave (HPM) beam that burns out the circuitry, or that sends a false telemetry signal to misdirect the targeting computer. Also, at reduced power, electromagnetic non-kinetic weapons can also be used as a non-lethal method for crowd control.", "The Active Denial System (ADS), developed by the Air Force, is a vehicle-mounted nonlethal, counter-personnel directed energy weapon. Currently, most non-lethal weapons for crowd control, such as bean-bag rounds, utilize kinetic energy. However, the ADS projects a focused beam of millimeter energy waves to induce an intolerable burning sensation on an adversary's skin, repelling the individual without causing injury. Proponents say the ADS is safe and effective at ranges between 50 and 1,600 feet. The nonlethal capabilities of the ADS are designed to protect the innocent, minimize fatalities, and limit collateral damage. Approximately $40 million has been spent on this technology over the past ten years.", "Military officials requested that ADS devices be deployed to Iraq to assist Marines in guarding posts, countering insurgent snipers and protecting convoys. In July 2005, it was reported that the Active Denial System would be deployed to Iraq before the end of the year. Under an initiative called Project Sheriff, troops would receive a total of 15 vehicles. Concerns of political fallout have delayed these plans; as of early 2007, initial deployment was slated no sooner than 2010.
