In response, HHS expressed concerns over the legal authority for entering into such competitions and GAO suggested that Congress may wish to \"clarify\" these authorities. Subsequently, the idea of limiting grantee designation periods to five years and requiring \"low performing\" grantees to re-compete was raised at congressional hearings and in various draft reauthorization bills throughout the 109 th and 110 th Congresses.

This plan must be implemented within six months of the DRS determination. Not more than six months after the implementation of the quality improvement plan, HHS is to re-evaluate the performance of the grantee. If the grantee is still not delivering a high-quality and comprehensive program, then HHS is to hold a competition for the area served by the grantee. In general, a non-AIAN Head Start or Early Head Start agency is not eligible to win such a competition unless there is no AIAN Head Start or Early Head Start agency available.

(New grantees are subject to a full review immediately upon completion of their first program year, but while data from first-year reviews are used for general program oversight, they are exempt from consideration as part of the DRS.) Monitoring reviews are used to determine whether or not grantees are meeting applicable standards for program, administrative, financial management, and other requirements. The law requires follow-up visits for any agency determined, based on findings from a monitoring review, to have one or more deficiencies or significant areas of noncompliance. The law allows for unannounced site inspections of Head Start centers, as appropriate.", "In this context, a deficiency represents (1) a systemic or substantial material failure on the part of a grantee to meet Head Start program performance standards (as specified in law and regulation), (2) a systemic or material failure of the governing body of an agency to fully exercise its legal and fiduciary responsibilities, or (3) an unresolved area of noncompliance. In practice, this may mean that a grantee has, for instance, misused its federal Head Start funds or failed to minimize threats to the health, safety, or civil rights of children or staff. (See Table 3 for more specifics.) The law requires HHS to notify grantees in writing when a deficiency has been identified and to indicate whether the deficiency is to be corrected immediately or pursuant to a Quality Improvement Plan. Failure to correct a deficiency in a timely manner (to be not more than one year) constitutes a material failure by a grantee to comply with the terms and conditions of its funding award.

Funding opportunities made available as part of the DRS are generally opened only to applicants looking to serve families within the same service areas currently served by grantees who triggered re-competition. Federal regulations define a service area as the \"geographic area identified in an approved grant application within which a grantee may provide Head Start services.\" As a rule, service areas are unique to individual grantees (i.e., there is no overlap), meaning that HHS must hold individual competitions for each grantee's slot to ensure coverage for each service area affected by the DRS. In some cases, DRS competitions may result in larger service areas being broken into smaller service areas based on the interest and capacity of applicants (and the quality of applications).
