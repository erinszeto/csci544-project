Earlier in the year, GAO testified that the currentimport processes handled by ACS are \"paper-intensive, error-prone, and transaction based, and out of step withjust-in-time inventory practices of the tradecommunity.\" (32) Since 1994, Congress appropriatedlarge infusions of funding for Customs to upgrade ACS and continue development of its replacement, theAutomated Commercial Environment (ACE), but Customs has struggled with the upkeep of ACS and thedevelopment of ACE. In the FY2000 conference report,Congress directed Customs to provide a revised blueprint, schedule, and budget for ACE. This report was deliveredto the Appropriations committees, but late inthe fiscal year. ", "For FY2001, the Administration's request included a new Customs budget account for automation modernization, for which the administration requested $338million. To offset the ACE developmental costs, the Administration requested authorization for a new user fee thatwas similar to a fee proposal rejected byCongress in the FY2000 appropriations cycle. Of this amount, $123 million was requested for the continuedoperation and maintenance of ACS, $5 million forthe International Trade Data System (ITDS), and $210 million for the development of ACE. Once again, Congressrejected the fee proposal. Instead, Congressprovided over $258 million in a direct appropriation, which includes $5 million to continue the development of theITDS and at least $130 million to continue thedevelopment of ACE. It was reported in Government Executive magazine that the development,operation, and maintenance of ACE over 7 years will costbetween $1.4 and $1.8 billion, and that Customs would begin taking bids to develop the new system in FY2001. (33)", "GAO has also testified that Customs had taken deliberate steps to implement recommendations made in previous audits by reducing duplication of effort,developing an enterprise systems architecture, and improving acquisition and investment management. GAOcautioned, however, that the development of ACE isa complex and high-risk endeavor that supports the agency's ability to collect billions of dollars in revenue generatedby imports.", "In addition to appropriated funding, Customs generates offsetting receipts from two user fee programs. The first fee program consists of seven conveyance- andpassenger-related user fees established by the 1985 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)and the user fee for processing bulk cargo fromMexico and Canada established by the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The second fee program consists of thecommerce-related merchandise processing fee (MPF)established by the 1986 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA). Customs generally has no control over theallocation of MPF fee receipts. COBRA feereceipts, on the other hand, are not appropriated for obligation by Congress, and they account for a substantialportion of funding available to Customs forexpenditure each year. From FY1992 to FY2000, COBRA fee receipts have increased from about $176,000,000to $299,000,000.", "There are codified limitations on the use of COBRA fee receipts, and initially they were used principally to pay overtime costs for inspectors and canineenforcement officers. Surplus revenues could be and were carried over from one year to the next. Such carryovercould be, and is, used to fund recurring costs inpositions and equipment from previous years. As a result, COBRA fee receipts have funded an increasing shareof permanent inspector positions and informationtechnology costs. In recent months, however, there have been reports of a drop-off in air passenger processing feereceipts. Consequently, the growing reliance onCOBRA fee receipts to fund base positions in conjunction with a drop-off in receipts may prove problematic in thecoming year, as Customs may not haveallocated enough to pay overtime for Customs officers. It is also notable that the authorization for the COBRA feesexpires at the end of FY2003.", "Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The FY2001 request for IRS was $8,986,084,000.
