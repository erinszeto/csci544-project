The WPR is computed to determine compliance with TANF federal work standards. It is the percentage of families receiving assistance in the state who are considered engaged in work during a fiscal year. A state with a WPR that fails to meet the numerical goal specified by the federal work standard is at risk of a financial penalty (reduced block grant amount).", "Before FY2006, TANF paid a bonus to states that received scores indicating high performance toward achieving the block grant's statutory goals. A state's performance for the purposes of this bonus was partially determined by a set of employment outcome measures for TANF-assistance adults: job entry, job retention, and earnings gain. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 ) eliminated the performance bonus. However, the TANF statute requires HHS to rank state welfare-to-work outcomes. HHS continues to collect the employment outcome measures that were used for the performance bonus to conduct that ranking.

T he retention percentage , defined as the number of families receiving assistance from a state program who left the program, and have an adult in unsubsidized employment during the fourth quarter after the exit quarter, divided by the number of families receiving assistance under that same program in the same quarter that the aforementioned families left the program. 3.

The criteria of economic need are (1) a three-month average state unemployment rate of at least 6.5% and at least 10% higher than in the corresponding three months of either of the prior two years; or (2) a state's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) caseload is at least 10% higher than it was in FY1994 or FY1995. Additionally, states have to spend more from their own funds than they spent in FY1994 on TANF-related programs in order to access the fund.", "The number of households receiving SNAP increased through the 2000s, even before the onset of the 2007-2009 recession, with additional increases during the recession. Though SNAP caseloads have begun to decline, for almost all states they remain elevated well above their FY1994 or FY1995 levels. Thus, almost all states qualify as economically needy for the purposes of the contingency fund. ", "In FY2016, 19 states met both the criteria as economically needy, spent sufficient state funds, and drew down TANF contingency grants. The available FY2016 funding was exhausted in April 2016. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated in March 2016 that all contingency fund dollars will be spent in each of the next 10 years\u2014regardless of the projected economic growth forecast for that period. Thus, the TANF contingency fund is not expected to serve a countercyclical function of providing extra grants when the economy experiences a downturn. It does, however, provide extra TANF grants to states that qualify for contingency funds.
