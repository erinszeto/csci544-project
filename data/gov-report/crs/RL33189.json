Opponents of a split also suggest that efforts to divide the circuit represent an attack on judicial independence, a claim supporters of a split deny.", "In November 2005, the House of Representatives passed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( H.R. 4241 ), which, among many other provisions, contained language splitting the current Ninth Circuit into a new Ninth Circuit and a Twelfth Circuit.

Seven bills proposing to split the Ninth Circuit ( H.R. 211 , H.R. 212 , H.R. 3125 , H.R. 4093 , S. 1296 , S. 1301 , and S. 1845 ) remained under consideration. Most recently in the House, on February 8, 2006, H.R. 4093 was reported by the Judiciary Committee and placed on the Union Calendar.

Splitting the Ninth Circuit would have different effects in each of these six areas.", "Caseload is particularly prominent in the debate over splitting the Ninth Circuit. Proponents of a split suggest that reduced caseloads would improve judicial administration. Opponents suggest that if a split occurred, judges in a new Ninth Circuit would have higher caseloads than their counterparts in proposed Twelfth or Thirteenth Circuits. Analysis of the most recently available estimates from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts suggests that if the current Ninth Circuit had been reorganized in 2005, five of seven bills introduced in the 109 th Congress splitting the circuit would have yielded somewhat higher caseloads (based on authorized judgeships) in a new Ninth Circuit than in the current Ninth Circuit during the same time period. Six of the bills would have yielded higher caseloads in a new Ninth Circuit than in proposed Twelfth or Thirteenth Circuits. By contrast, one bill ( H.R. 3125 ) would have yielded a higher caseload in a Twelfth Circuit than a new Ninth Circuit. Caseload estimates can vary by source and methodology.

The circuit courts remain the last avenue of judicial review for all but the relatively few cases the Supreme Court considers. Establishing the appeals courts organized federal judicial business into geographic divisions (circuits). Today, there are 11 numbered circuit courts, covering federal judicial districts housed in the 50 states and U.S. territories. In addition, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has jurisdiction over appeals for the District of Columbia, including many agency appeals. Finally, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has national jurisdiction over specialized issues such as patents and trademarks. The Ninth Circuit, located in the western United States, is the nation's largest circuit court in geography, population, and appeals filings.

Proponents of splitting the Ninth Circuit argue that the court is too big and covers too many people to operate effectively. Opponents of a split generally respond that although the Ninth Circuit is big, it still delivers effective justice and provides legal continuity for the western United States.

The total number of judgeships authorized for the district or circuit reverts back to the number of permanently authorized judgeships at a future point specified by statute, in this case, when the next two vacancies among authorized Ninth Circuit judges occur at least 10 years after two temporary judges are appointed (see the Appendix ). Senior judges are those who have taken \"senior status,\" a specialized form of judicial retirement.

Opponents of a split say that the Ninth Circuit's backlog of cases has been temporarily increased by the large number of administrative petitions from Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) cases, slowing the court's overall work. According to the AO, as of October 2005, 41% of Ninth Circuit filings were BIA appeals, and 88% of those were filed in California. In 2005, Ninth Circuit Judge Sidney R.

On April 3, 2006, the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on immigration litigation reform, which briefly addressed a proposed Ninth Circuit split. In response to a question from Senator Jeff Sessions, Ninth Circuit district judge John M. Roll stated his opinion that centralizing immigration appeals outside the regional circuits would not, on its own, alleviate the need to split the Ninth Circuit. Writing in The National Law Journal before the hearing, Judge Roll called for centralizing immigration appeals and splitting the Ninth Circuit to reduce the circuit's caseload. According to Judge Roll, if S. 1845 or H.R. 4093 were adopted, and all BIA appeals were transferred to the Federal Circuit, \"the new 9 th Circuit would keep 60% of the current 9 th Circuit caseload and have 61% of the judges allotted to the new 9 th and 12 th circuits.

Opponents of a split argue that the current Ninth Circuit functions well given its heavy caseload, and that its judges and large, experienced staff are essential in doing so. Potential mitigating factors, such as the type or complexity of cases filed, or the contention by many Ninth Circuit judges that the court reaches decisions quickly once judges hear cases, could also affect caseload considerations. Writing jointly in the March 2006 edition of Engage (a journal published by the Federalist Society), more than 30 Ninth Circuit judges argued that, although backlogs delay consideration of cases in the Ninth Circuit, \"once the cases are submitted to the judges, we are the second- fastest among the circuits in disposing of them.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost of Splitting the Circuit", "paragraphs": ["Opponents of a split say that administrative costs associated with splitting the Ninth Circuit and establishing new headquarters, staff support, and related administrative expenses in the proposed Twelfth Circuit (or Twelfth and Thirteenth Circuits) are unnecessary and would strain limited financial resources.

En banc hearings in other circuits typically involve all a court's active judges, and are normally reserved for cases in which the full court wishes to reconsider the opinion of a three-judge appellate panel. Unlike other circuits, though, the Ninth Circuit employs a \"limited en banc \" procedure, which, until January 2006, allowed 11 judges (rather than the entire court) to serve as a full en banc panel. Proponents of a split contend the Ninth Circuit's reliance on limited en banc procedures allows a minority of judges to speak for the entire court. According to Ninth Circuit judge Andrew Kleinfeld (testifying in October 2005), who supports a split, \"When the full court purports to speak, it doesn't.... A majority of an en banc panel\u00e2\u0080\u0094six judges\u00e2\u0080\u0094is not even one-fourth of the full court when fully staffed.\" Although noting that the limited en banc procedure \"has a number of virtues,\" Ninth Circuit Judge Pamela Ann Rymer wrote in March 2006 that \"[T]here is a systematic flaw in the limited en banc concept that is not without consequence. The limited en banc is premised at least in part on the notion that some number of judges smaller than the whole can represent the entire court. However, the premise is in inapposite to the judiciary.\" Some supporting a split also contend that limited en banc \u00c2\u00a0decisions might have changed if different judges had been assigned to en banc panels, therefore potentially producing inconsistent circuit rulings.", "Ninth Circuit Chief Judge Mary M. Schroeder announced on October 1, 2005, that beginning on January 1, 2006, the circuit would increase the size of en banc panels from 11 to 15 judges. According to Chief Judge Schroeder, although she has been satisfied with the 11-judge panels, the decision to increase panel size was \"intended to respond to criticism that we should have a majority of our judges sit on each en banc [panel].\" According to a court staff member, the first enlarged en banc panels began hearing cases in March 2006.", "Opponents of a split contend that the en banc issue is not a major concern because so few of the court's cases are appealed for rehearing en banc . According to Judge Sidney R. Thomas, who serves as the Ninth Circuit's en banc coordinator and opposes a split, \"Out of 5,783 cases decided in the Ninth Circuit between September 2003 and September 2004, only 13 (or .2%) were reheard en banc. This experience is consistent with the practices of other circuits.\" Judge Thomas challenged claims that the views of en banc panels are unrepresentative of the entire circuit, saying that \"very few decisions made by the en banc panels involved close votes,\" and that the circuit's Evaluation Committee has been satisfied that en banc opinions are representative of the entire circuit. Judge Thomas also stated that, although en banc panels currently do not include the entire court, voting on whether a matter should be granted an en banc hearing is still open to all active judges on the circuit, and that any active or senior judge may request an en banc hearing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Circuit's Rulings", "paragraphs": ["Some of the Ninth Circuit's rulings have, on occasion, been controversial.

Some proponents of a split also say that some Ninth Circuit rulings do not represent the conservative political culture of much of the western United States, reflecting what some observers perceive as a division between California and much of the rest of the circuit.", "Proponents of splitting the Ninth Circuit also contend that the Supreme Court reverses the Ninth Circuit, often unanimously, more frequently than any other circuit court.

Opponents of a split respond that only a small fraction of the circuit's rulings are granted review by the Supreme Court, and that Ninth Circuit reversals are not dramatically different than reversal rates for other circuits in recent years. Similarly, some opposed to splitting the Ninth Circuit also suggest that efforts to divide the circuit threaten judicial independence. Supporters of splitting the circuit deny that position.

According to Ninth Circuit Chief Judge Mary Schroeder, in April 2004, Ninth Circuit judges held a retreat to discuss splitting the circuit, followed by \"a mail ballot\" to the judges on the court. Judges were asked to select from three options: \"(1) oppose a division of the Ninth Circuit; or (2) favor a division of the Ninth Circuit; or (3) abstain from voting.\" In a May 5, 2004, letter to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Schroeder reported the results:", "The Court currently has a total of 47 judges serving on the court, 26 active judges and 21 senior judges, plus two vacancies.

According to an Arizona Republic \u00c2\u00a0columnist who wrote in October 2006 that Judge Bea contacted him about the split, the judge was concerned \"that Arizona would no longer have any Latino judges on its new court. All six Latinos on the current court would probably end up in the reconfigured 9 th Circuit.\" If the President chose to do so, factors such as race, ethnicity, or gender could be used in filling the additional five seats most bills propose for a new Ninth Circuit, or for future Twelfth Circuit appointments.", "Those against a split say that opposition from the majority of the circuit's judges is one of the most compelling arguments in favor of keeping the circuit intact. In addition, several state and local bar associations housed in the Ninth Circuit reportedly oppose a split. The same is true for a group of more than 350 law professors, a coalition of environmental organizations, coordinated by Earthjustice, and other groups. (By contrast, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is supporting S. 1845 , which would split the circuit.) In October 2005, the U.S. Judicial Conference \"agreed not to take a position\" on bills proposing to split the Ninth, but also stated that \"consideration of splitting the Ninth Circuit should be independently based on the circuit split issue alone and not driven by possible linkage of that issue to a judgeship bill,\" an apparent reference to the judgeship provisions contained in H.R. 4093 .", "Some who support a split suggest that district judges within the Ninth Circuit would not necessarily oppose a split.
