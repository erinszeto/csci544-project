This report highlights and discusses important changes in financial and personnel contributions from foreign governments to Iraq since 2003.", "To date, foreign donors have pledged an estimated $16.4 billion in grants and loans for Iraq reconstruction, with most major pledges originating at a major donors' conference in Madrid, Spain, in October 2003. However, only a small part of the pledges have been committed or disbursed to the World Bank and United Nations Development Group Trust Funds for Iraq. The largest non-U.S. pledges of grants have come from Japan, the European Commission, the United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Japan, and Saudi Arabia have pledged the most loans and export credits.", "Currently, 33 countries including the United States have some level of troops on the ground in Iraq or supporting Iraq operations from nearby locations. Those forces are working under the rubric of one of several organizations\u2014the Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), the NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I); or the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). Currently, the largest troop contributors, in addition to the United States, are the United Kingdom, Georgia, Australia, South Korea, and Poland. Some of these key contributors have announced their intention to reduce or withdraw their forces from Iraq during 2008. The total number of non-U.S. coalition troop contributions has declined since the early stabilization efforts, as other countries have withdrawn their contingents or substantially reduced their size.", "Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003, a number of coalition, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other countries have contributed personnel, equipment, and/or facilities to the training of Iraqi security forces. Supporting the establishment of effective Iraqi security forces is a core element of the Administration's current strategy for Iraq, \"the New Way Forward,\" and several of the congressionally mandated benchmarks for Iraq refer to these efforts. Planned U.S.-Iraqi negotiation aimed at achieving a \"strategic framework agreement\" to replace the current United Nations mandate for U.S. military operations in Iraq may have implications for the future participation of coalition members in stabilization and training efforts.", "This report will be updated to reflect important developments.

Resolution 1511 authorized a multinational force under unified (interpreted as U.S.) command to assist Iraqis in securing their country and in training their security forces. Security Council Resolution 1546 of June 8, 2004 reaffirmed this authorization and established the current U.N. mandate under which the U.S.-led multinational force is responsible for \"[contributing] to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq.\" That mandate has since been extended for twelve month periods by Resolution 1637 (November 11, 2005), Resolution 1723 (November 28, 2006), and Resolution 1790 (December 18, 2007).", "On November 26, 2007, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and President Bush signed a \"Declaration of Principles,\" expressing the decisions of both governments to work, by July 2008, to codify a long-term bilateral \"strategic framework agreement\" intended to replace the current U.N. mandate. The roles of U.S. and coalition forces in combat operations and the training of Iraqi security forces are likely to be key topics in the strategic framework negotiations. In particular, most observers agree that training is one of the activities most likely to be continued under any continuing U.S. or coalition presence in Iraq. The outcome of the U.S.-Iraqi negotiations is likely to shape the size, structure, and focus of the U.S. military presence in Iraq. Any changes to the U.S. mission, and any new Iraqi government positions concerning the roles of coalition forces, could easily affect both the need for and the perceived legitimacy of, foreign contributions to stabilization operations and training efforts.", "This report characterizes foreign contributions to Iraq in terms of personnel and resources, including trends over time, based on best-available information. The first section addresses financial contributions, including pledged grants and loans, and related debt relief. The second section describes troop contributions to the Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I). The third section addresses contributions to the Iraqi security forces training effort.

At that event, members of the international community, excluding the United States, pledged approximately $13.5 billion for reconstruction assistance to Iraq, including roughly $10 billion in loan pledges. As of October 2007, roughly $2.9 billion in additional pledges had been made, bringing the pledge total to approximately $16.4 billion. Loan pledges represent $10.8 billion of this total, and Iraq has accepted $2.2 billion in pledged loan assistance to date. Of the $5.6 billion pledged for grants, Iraq has received $4.8 billion.", "According to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, $1.766 billion of the pledged assistance has been channeled to the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund and UNDG Iraq Trust Fund. The UNDG Fund had committed close to $800 million for planned projects by the end of October 2007. To date, the United States Congress has appropriated nearly $43 billion for reconstruction programs in Iraq.", "Many observers credit persistent security problems and Iraqi government capacity deficiencies for the slow rate at which pledged international assistance has been committed and disbursed. Iraq's Ministry of Planning has established a Donor Assistance Database \"to record donor assistance, analyze donor activities, and monitor the implementation of donor-funded projects.\" Iraq also has pursued debt relief through negotiations with members of the Paris Club as well as in the context of the International Compact with Iraq (ICI), which was launched at a summit in Sharm al-Sheikh, Egypt, on May 3, 2007.

Georgia will hold early presidential elections in January 2008, in a heated domestic political climate, and the results are likely to have a major impact on the future of the Georgian deployment. In November 2007, Australians elected a new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who had campaigned on plans to withdraw Australia's roughly 500-person \"combat force\" from Iraq by mid-2008. Some reports suggest that an Australian withdrawal decision, when made, may not affect approximately 1,000 Australian personnel involved with training, logistics and headquarters staffing in Iraq, and with maritime security operations in the northern Persian Gulf. In late October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun announced a government decision to extend the deployment mandate for another year but to draw down the force from 1,200 to 600; South Korea holds presidential elections on December 19, 2007 and the Iraq deployment has been a key issue in the debates.
