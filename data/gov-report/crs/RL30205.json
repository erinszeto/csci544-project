The conference agreement on the defense authorization bill does not approve a new round ofmilitary base closures. It provides somewhat larger increases in pay and benefits than theAdministration had requested, including a 4.8% pay raise in 2000 and increased retirement benefits,though it does not include a Senate-passed provision to expand Montgomery GI Bill benefits. Although Congress approved supplemental FY1999 appropriations for Kosovo operations, theAdministration's policy remains controversial. The House removed a provision from the defenseauthorization bill prohibiting funds to be used for future operations in Kosovo, but only after theAdministration agreed to seek supplemental appropriations to cover costs of a peacekeeping missionin FY2000.

The $112 billion addition, they say, includes all that the chiefs requested forpersonnel and readiness and about half of the amounts requested for weaponsacquisition and facilities. ", "Financing the Administration Plan. The overarching budget issue for FY2000 has been how tocope with rather stringent limits on total discretionary spending while permitting anincrease of some magnitude in defense expenditures. Under the Budget EnforcementAct of 1997 (part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, P.L. 105-33 ), total budgetauthority for discretionary programs was limited to $537 billion in FY2000,according to CBO's initial estimates this year. This amount is substantially belowthe FY1999 level, though how much below depends on how the FY1999 baseline isdefined. (3) Any increase in the defense budget willfurther reduce funds available fornon-defense discretionary spending. ", "The Administration, however, wanted to increase both defense and non-defense discretionary spending while technically adhering to the budget limits. TheAdministration's answer was (1) to propose total discretionary budget authority andoutlays considerably above the caps established in the 1997 budget agreement byapplying savings in mandatory programs and increased revenues as offsets toincreases in the discretionary part of the budget and (2) to use various accountingmeasures within the FY2000 defense budget to offset increases.

The key issueis whether estimated increases in purchasing power are accurate. Defense officialshave said that almost all of the projected savings are due to lower inflation in 1998,which established a lower base for price trends in the future -- \"out-year\" inflationprojections are only about 1/10th of 1 percent lower than last year. A perennialquestion is whether decision-makers will agree to add money to the defense budgetin the future if inflation accelerates.", "\"Split funding\" for FY2000 military construction projects : The Defense Department's FY2000 military construction/family housing budget planincluded $8.5 billion worth of projects, but the Administration requested only $5.4billion in appropriations. The remaining $3.1 billion was requested as advanceappropriations to be scored as new budget authority in FY2001. The request toprovide \"split funding\" for FY2000 projects was not a change in policy, but aone-time exercise done only because of budget rules -- the intent was to reducerequested budget authority in FY2000, when caps on discretionary funding wouldremain in place, and restore the funding in FY2001, when, presumably, the caps willbe adjusted upward.", "Rescissions of prior year funds : The Administration proposed applying $1.65 billion of rescissions of prior year defense funds to offset the FY2000total. While it is quite common for the appropriations committees to make suchrescissions, the amount is relatively large. Moreover, congressional committeesusually identify such savings toward the end of the budget process and use them tooffset unexpected costs or to pay for congressional initiatives. The Administrationdid not identify specific rescissions, but this has been common practice in recentyears -- rather than propose cuts that might aggravate some legislators, the ClintonAdministration has preferred to negotiate rescissions with congressionalcommittees.", "Congressional Action on the Defense Budget. In Congress, the debate over the level of defense spendingwas intertwined with the broader debate about the overall federal budget. Membersof the congressional defense committees, with considerable support from otherlegislators, called for substantial increases to the military budget in addition to theincreases the Administration proposed. They were also, however, critical of theaccounting mechanisms that the Administration employed to squeeze additionaldefense spending under the discretionary spending caps. Meanwhile, Congressrejected an increase in the discretionary caps and dismissed out of hand the offsetsto increased discretionary spending that the Administration proposed. Concurrently,there was a debate about the use of emergency supplemental appropriations forKosovo as a mechanism to increase funding for defense readiness. ", "The result was a rather complicated series of steps in which funds apparently added to the defense budget in one stage of the congressional process were erodedin following stages, only to be restored in the final appropriations. Moreover, at theend of the process, appropriators took a number of steps to reduce projected outlaysin FY2000 in order to help meet overall spending targets. Here is a brief overviewof the process:", "The congressional budget resolution for FY2000, H.Con.Res. 68 , approved by both chambers on April 15, provided $8.0billion more in budget authority and $2.5 billion more in outlays for national defensein FY2000 than the Administration's request (using Administration, not CBO,scoring of the request).

(4) Two points stand out -- first,projected increases in defense spending in the later years of the five-year period arenot as large as in FY2000, and, second, there appears to be a substantial mismatchin all years between increases in budget authority and projected increases in defenseoutlays -- the mismatch is especially severe according to CBOestimates.", "None of the congressional defense committees agreed to the proposed $3.1 billion in split funding for military construction, and neither SASC northe Senate nor the House Appropriations Committees accepted the proposed $1.65billion in offsetting rescissions. The final military construction appropriations billdoes not agree to the split funding, and most of the rescissions in the finalappropriations bill were of amounts earlier provided in the Kosovo supplemental. At least $3.1 billion of the $8 billion increase in defense funding, therefore, wentsimply to restore funds for financing mechanisms that Congressrejected.", " Table 5: Congressional Budget Resolution Compared to Administration National Defense Budget Plan (current year dollars in billions)", "Sources: House and Senate Budget Committees; Conference Report on the FY2000 Concurrent Budget Resolution, H.Rept. 106-91 ; Department of Defense.", "Congress found its own ways of adding money to defense in spite of the FY2000 discretionary spending caps, first, by providing extra funds in theemergency supplemental appropriations bill for Kosovo, H.R. 1141 , and,second, by using projected revenues from auctioning parts of the electromagneticspectrum as an offset for defense increases. In all, the Kosovo funding bill provided$14.9 billion in supplemental appropriations and made $2.0 billion in offsettingrescissions. Of the supplemental funding, about $11 billion was for the Departmentof Defense (including funds for Central America disaster assistance and disasterrepairs at U.S. facilities), which is $5.3 billion more than the Administrationrequested. Much of the added money was for programs that normally would befinanced in regular FY2000 defense and military construction appropriations bills,including $1.838 billion for increased pay and benefits and $3.1 billion for militaryreadiness-related accounts and for munitions purchases. Most of the added amountswere in \"fast-spending\" accounts -- i.e., accounts in which almost all new budgetauthority is actually expended as outlays in the first year available. As a result, theadded funds in H.R. 1141 helped to ease the apparent mismatch betweenbudget authority and outlays in the budget resolution. The House, Senate andconference versions of the defense appropriations bill all included $2.6 billion inassumed revenues from electromagnetic spectrum sales as a defenseoffset.", "Some of the extra $5 billion for defense in the Kosovo bill, however, was tapped in the FY2000 appropriations process as an offset to defensefunding increases. The Senate-passed version of the FY2000 defense appropriationsbill, S. 1122 , included increases in various defense programs consistentwith the budget resolution and the defense authorization bills but then used $1.838billion provided in the Kosovo bill for personnel and $3.1 billion in the Kosovo billfor readiness and munitions as offsets for the increases (see Table 2 , above). The neteffect was that the Senate used added emergency defense appropriations provided inthe Kosovo bill to provide most of the increase in FY2000 defense spending withoutcounting against the caps on FY2000 discretionary spending, thus freeing up moremoney for non-defense discretionary programs. On June 8, the House leadershipannounced plans to take a similar approach, and the allocation of funds to the defensesubcommittee was subsequently reduced -- the initial allocation, approved in May,provided $270.3 billion, and the bill as reported by the full committee on July 16provides $266.1 billion, $4.2 billion lower. Part of the difference, however, wasmade up by counting anticipated receipts from radio spectrum sales of $2.6 billionas an offset to defense appropriations, so the amount available to DOD and otheragencies in the House bill totaled $268.7 billion.

These steps include (1) instructing CBO to useOMB scoring in estimating the outlay impact of defense appropriations, which willreduce estimated outlays in FY2000 by about $10.5 billion; (2) declaring $7.2 billionof budget authority, with an outlay impact of about $5.5 billion according to CBO,as emergency appropriations, which will raise caps on total discretionary spendingby those amounts; and (3) requiring DOD to delay progress payments to contractors,which will reduce FY2000 outlays by an estimated $1.2 billion.

In the past, military pay raises, like pay raises forcivilian federal personnel, have been pegged to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd% below the Employment CostIndex (ECI), a measure of overall compensation trends in the economy. As a result,military pay is now about 13% below the level it would have reached if pay raisessince 1982 had equaled the ECI. Some refer to this as the military \"pay gap,\" thoughit is simply a measure of trends since 1982 -- independent comparisons of militarypay scales with the civilian economy generally have not confirmed a shortfall of thatmagnitude. The Administration's proposed pay raises are 0.1% above the ECI inFY2000 and at the projected ECI in the future. ", "On February 24, the Senate passed S. 4 , a bill entitled the \"Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Right Act of 1999,\" that wouldhave provided a substantially larger pay and benefits package than the Administrationhas proposed. The bill would implement the Administration proposals and inaddition (1) provide a 4.8% pay raise in FY2000 and peg raises to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd% above ECIthereafter, (2) allow personnel to choose a $30,000 bonus instead of shifting out ofthe Redux retirement plan, (3) provide a subsistence allowance of $180 per monthto personnel eligible for food stamps, (4) make uniformed personnel eligible for theThrift Savings Plan now available to civilian federal employees, and (4) significantlyincrease Montgomery G.I. Bill educational benefits. According to CongressionalBudget Office estimates, S. 4 would cost about $9 billion more over theFY2000-2005 period than the Administration plan. (5) While the Senate votedoverwhelmingly for S. 4 , the House did not act on a military pay andbenefits bill as a freestanding measure, and instead pay and benefits improvementswere considered as part of the FY2000 defense authorization bill. ", "Authorization and appropriations action: House and Senate versions of the defense authorization bill both included larger pay and benefits increases thanthe Administration requested. The SASC version of the bill included all of theprovisions of S. 4 except for GI Bill benefits. In action on thefloor, the Senate approved an amendment by Senator Cleland to approve theexpansion of GI Bill benefits, as provided in S. 4 . Pay and benefitprovisions in the HASC version of the authorization were identical to those inthe SASC bill with some exceptions: (1) HASC provided for future raises equalto the ECI rather than \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd% higher and (2) HASC did not approve providing theThrift Savings Plan to uniformed personnel but instead required a DOD studyof the proposal; and (3) HASC did not include the $180 per month subsistenceallowance. On the floor, however, the House approved an amendment by Rep.Buyer, the chair of the HASC military personnel subcommittee, to provide thesame Thrift Savings Plan benefits as the Senate. The conference agreement onthe authorization bill reflects a compromise between the House and the Senate. As in the Senate proposal, it provides for higher than ECI pay raises in thefuture, but it does not expand GI Bill benefits, and it does not provide a highersubsistence allowance. Pay and benefits increases are legislative matters to beconsidered in the defense authorization bill, not in appropriations measures,though the amount of money provided for military personnel in theappropriations bill is directly affected by any changes. The Kosovosupplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 1141 , provided $1.838billion for FY2000 pay and benefits increases, enough to cover theAdministration estimate of the costs of the Administration's 4.4% pay raise, paytable reform, and retirement reform. Later, the conference agreement on theregular FY2000 defense appropriations bill provided sufficient funding for the larger congressional pay and benefits packages.

In announcing these decisions onJanuary 20, Secretary of Defense Cohen acknowledged that the threat of long-rangemissile attack on U.S. territory appeared to be materializing sooner than earlierintelligence assessments had estimated. In particular, Secretary Cohen cited NorthKorea's test last year of a multistage missile as evidence of the danger, and heendorsed the findings of the Rumsfeld Commission, which reported in August 1998,that rogue states could threaten the United States directly with long-range missileswithin the next five years and without much advanced warning.", "The change in the Administration's threat assessment was ultimately reflected in its decision not to oppose an amended version of S. 257 , a billsponsored by Senators Cochran and Inouye that calls for deploying a nationwidemissile defense as soon as technologically possible. Last year, the Administrationopposed an essentially identical bill, and the Senate twice narrowly rejected cloturemotions to bring it to a vote. This year, the Administration relented afteramendments were added, including a statement that the United States seekscontinued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces and a provision that theSecretary of Defense must determine that the system will be operationally effective. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 97-3 on March 17. On March 18, by a voteof 317-105, the House passed H.R. 4 , a bill stating simply that it is U.S.policy to deploy a nationwide defense. On May 18, the Senate took up H.R. 4 and substituted the text of S. 257 . On May 20, bya vote of 345-17 the House approved the Senate version.

Officials had said that deployment could begin as early as three years after a decisionis made to go ahead -- i.e., by 2003 -- but it now appears more likely thatdeployment could begin in 2005 at the earliest. Moreover, the Administration stillargues that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty remains critically importantto U.S. security. Senior officials have said that they will endeavor to negotiatechanges in the Treaty with Russia to permit deployment of a nationwide defense. Many Members of Congress, however, oppose continued adherence to the ABMTreaty. There also continues to be some debate in Congress about missile defensetechnology. Some legislators support a Heritage Foundation proposal to deploy asea-based nationwide defense. Defense officials have said that such a system wouldbe too costly. Also, a sea-based system would clearly be incompatible withcontinued adherence even to an amended version of the ABM Treaty. ", "Authorization and appropriations action: Though National Missile Defense remains a matter of some contention, Theater Missile Defense (TMD) programswere the main focus of debate in action on FY2000 defense funding bills. TheSenate-passed authorization bill included a legislative provision that rejected theAdministration plan to combine the Navy Theater Wide and THAAD programsin the future, requiring, instead, that the programs remain separately funded. The authorization conference agreement accepts the Senate language. Theauthorization conference agreement also adds funds for Patriot PAC-3procurement and R&D, as in the Senate version of the bill. The Senateauthorization also added funds for the related Space-Based InfraredSystem-High (SBIRS-High), while the House bill transferred most funding forSBIRS-High from the Air Force to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. These steps reflected congressional displeasure with Air Force plans to slow theSBIRS development program. The authorization conference agreement addsfunds for SBIRS-High but does not end Air Force management. Theappropriations conference agreement provides the same amount for SBIRS butmoves SBIRS-Low funding from the Demonstration and Validation account toEngineering and Manufacturing Development. The Senate authorization alsomandated specific tests of the Airborne Laser system, a sign of the SASC'scontinued doubts about the program. The authorization conference agreementincludes the Senate provisions. A key issue in the appropriations conferenceconcerned funding for the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS),which is a cooperative program with European allies to develop a follow-on tothe Patriot for defense of forward-deployed forces.
