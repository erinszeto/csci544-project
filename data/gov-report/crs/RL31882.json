Still other individuals enter teaching through post-baccalaureate certificate programs or master's programs offered by higher education institutions. Finally, alternative routes to teaching that target, for example, individuals changing careers, may also involve higher education institutions.", "The quality of higher education programs preparing K-12 teachers has been sharply called into question over the past several years. Teacher preparation programs have been criticized for providing prospective teachers with inadequate time to learn subject matter and pedagogy; for teaching a superficial curriculum; for being unduly fragmented, with courses not linked to practice teaching and with education faculty isolated from their arts and sciences faculty colleagues; for uninspired teaching; and for failing to prepare teachers to function in restructured or technologically equipped classrooms.", "Most recently, critics have pointed to high rates of failure of recent graduates on initial licensing or certification exams. One of the most publically reported instances of high failure rates was in 1998 when 59% of prospective teachers in Massachusetts failed that state's new certification exam. The results were reported by institution, prompting questions about the quality of the preparation and training prospective teachers had received from those institutions with low pass rates.

These may or may not involve the various criteria in the reports required from institutions and states, such as the pass rates of graduates on initial licensure exams. Federal consequences for an institution identified as low-performing flow only if its state takes specified action. To date, relatively few institutions have been identified as low-performing under the Title II provisions. Congress may consider whether to modify this framework. Proposals may be considered to bring the federal government more directly into the process through such steps as setting the low-performance standards or imposing federal penalties independent of any state action against the teacher preparation program. Alternatively, given how recently the current framework was initiated, some may want to maintain it without significant change and see what impact it has over time. Still others may argue for scrapping this federal effort since the standards are inconsistent across states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness of Accountability Based on Pass Rates", "paragraphs": ["Congress may consider whether the emphasis in the Title II accountability process on licensing exam pass rates should be constrained or expanded. The utility of the current pass rate-based system from a national perspective may be limited because the selection of certification exams and the setting of passing scores are state specific and do not easily allow for interstate comparisons. Further, recent research concludes that many current licensing exams are not rigorous, measuring essentially basic skills. Increased institutional pass rates on such exams may say relatively little about whether teacher preparation programs are graduating students who will be good teachers. Nevertheless, the premise that teacher preparation programs should graduate students who can pass initial credentialing exams does not appear to be at issue. Indeed, there is some evidence that higher education institutions may respond to low pass rates with, what one set of researchers described as, \"innovative strategies to enhance the content knowledge of prospective teachers as well as their writing and reading skills.\"", "For some policymakers, the limitations of the present system may suggest that the current federal involvement is but an initial step in a multi-step process necessary to improve teacher preparation program quality. For example, consideration may be given to establishing a single, nationwide standard, although such a proposal is likely to prove politically controversial. For others, the reporting burden and difficulty in making cross-state comparisons may suggest a refocusing of these provisions, perhaps to measures of state support for teacher preparation or the alignment of state certification exams with state standards for teacher preparation program approval."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Pass Rates", "paragraphs": ["One of the more specific issues that the Congress may debate during the reauthorization process is the calculation of pass rates. This debate is likely to focus particularly on the 100% pass rates reported by some states and many institutions. As described earlier, such rates resulted in part from decisions made by ED regarding the definition of a graduate and in part from institutional and state policies. To the extent that increasing numbers of institutions report 100% pass rates the utility of these rates as an accountability measure is undercut. Congress may consider various alternatives to address this issue. For example, institutions might be required to report the extent to which graduates passed certification exams the first time they took them, regardless of how the institutions define a graduate. Alternative measures to gauge the teaching effectiveness of graduates of a program might be considered, such as changes in the academic performance of a teacher's students or expressions of school administrator satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a program's graduates."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
