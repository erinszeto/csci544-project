Their influence is reflected in the issues on the trade agenda of the 110th Congress: the possible renewal of fast track trade authority/Trade Promotion Authority; implementing legislation for free trade agreements; re-authorization of trade adjustment assistance (TAA) for workers and firms; review and possible re-authorization of Generalized System of Preferences and other trade preference programs; and oversight of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) round negotiations in the WTO.", "The growth of developing countries' economies and foreign trade presents the United States with opportunities and challenges. The imports from many developing economies provide U.S. consumers with an ever widening range of choices of products at lower prices, raising real incomes and contributing to a higher U.S. standard of living. A number of the developing countries have also become robust markets for U.S. exports because of rapid economic growth and trade liberalization.", "At the same time, many U.S. workers are competing with an expanding pool of lower-wage labor from India, China, and other developing countries. Such competition induces U.S.-based firms to reduce costs by using labor-saving technology, moving production offshore, or shutting down, forcing workers to adjust. Even workers in the high-end services sector are feeling the pressures of competition from some developing countries.", "Trade with developing countries also raises a set of virtually unique issues regarding labor rights, environment protection, intellectual property rights, among others, that have become fixtures on the U.S. trade agenda. At the same time, developing countries are challenging U.S. policies on trade remedies, high tariffs on wearing apparel and other import-sensitive products, pricing of medicines, and the temporary entry of foreign workers.", "If current trade trends hold, developing countries can be expected to account for increasing shares of U.S. exports and imports and for world trade. As a result, these opportunities and challenges will likely continue, if not expand.", "The analysis of U.S. trade trends also exposes a significant divide among groups of developing countries. Some countries, such as China, South Korea, Mexico and Chile, have made great strides and, are expanding their role in U.S. and world trade. Others including most of Africa, many in South Asia, and some in Latin America, lag behind or are losing shares of U.S. and world trade. These differences suggest that effective U.S. trade policy may need to differentiate among the various groups of developing countries.

They are re-shaping the international trading system, asserting greater influence at bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations, and challenging the United States and other developed countries to reappraise long-held policies. At the same time, developing countries' advancement on the international trade stage has forced them to confront the challenges of international competition and the responsibilities that come with membership in the international trade community: Developed countries are demanding that developing countries jettison economic policies that protect domestic markets for local producers and workers.", "The growing role of some developing countries in U.S. and world trade raises sensitive policy issues for Members of Congress as they consider legislation to implement trade agreements, to monitor Administration enforcement of agreements and of trade laws, and to develop policies. Many of the U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) in place or that are under negotiation are with developing countries. Furthermore, the United States has been engaged with the other 149 members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) round of negotiations. The vast majority of the WTO members are developing countries who are using the strength of their large numbers to influence the agenda and the pace of the negotiations.

The four East Asian NIEs are largely credited with launching these efforts in the 1970s,which resulted in their economies taking off in the 1980s and continuing to grow in the 1990s, albeit with some bumps along the way. Other East Asian countries have followed; for example, Thailand and Malaysia. China is the most recent and largest example of an economy that has moved to become more integrated in the world economy. Such cases are not confined to East Asia. Chile and Mexico have emerged as a successful export-oriented economies. India has also recently undertaken economic reforms to become more integrated with the rest of the world. Among the less successful developing countries are ones that have followed import substitution economic development strategies of discouraging imports by imposing high tariffs and other trade barriers, and trying to develop domestic production of all goods. These policies have proved to be highly costly and have inhibited economic growth.", "Analysts have also concluded that the most successful developing economies are those that have built successful manufacturing sectors, while a number of the less successful countries are highly dependent on the production of primary goods such as food, agricultural products, and natural resources. The 50 LDCs are dependent on average on just three primary commodities for 70% of their total exports. Some LDCs are dependent on a single commodity for their exports. This is a matter of concern because commodity markets tend to be very volatile. In addition, commodities account for decreasing shares of world trade, making it more difficult for commodity-dependent countries to gain a foothold in world trade.", "Furthermore, many of the least developed countries do not have the sufficient infrastructure\u2014customs offices and procedures, transportation facilities, communications infrastructure\u2014to conduct large amounts of trade.

The program was partially in response to developing countries' criticism that high tariffs on their products prevented their producers from competing on world markets. Originally considered a temporary, 10-year program, U.S. GSP has been renewed on eight occasions, most recently through December 31, 2008, in section 8802 of P.L. 109-432 .

U.S. producers of IP products argue that they not only lose revenues because of the sale of pirated products but also lose control over the quality of the product that bears their brand name or trademark. Developing countries argue that they do not have the infrastructure to combat piracy, and that legally produced goods would be prohibitively expensive for their residents to produce or sell.", "Each year the Office of the United States Trade Representative issues a Special 301 report that identifies trading partners that fail to protect U.S.-origin IPR.

The pharmaceutical companies respond that the high costs are required for the companies to recoup the research and development costs they have incurred. Some pharmaceutical companies have made their drugs available to developing countries that face health emergencies but have done so largely on an ad hoc basis.", "In December 2005, WTO members adopted, as an amendment to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, a provision allowing the use of compulsory licenses for the production of generic pharmaceuticals for certain infectious diseases where the developing country lacks the domestic capacity to manufacture those medicines. In essence, it allows a developing country facing a health crisis to issue a compulsory license for the production of a generic drug in a third country that has the production capacity and then to import that medicine. The provision allows for compensation for the patent holder and restricts the use of the medicine for domestic use and for a limited period of time.

One study points out that 62.7% of the value of apparel imports from developing countries face \"peak\" U.S. tariffs (tariffs of 10% or greater). Wearing apparel production is largely labor-intensive and therefore advantageous for many developing countries with an abundance of low-wage labor to produce and export. Developing countries have raised this issue during bilateral negotiations on free trade agreements.", "Developing countries frequently complain about high U.S. tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and subsidies on some agricultural products. U.S. quotas and high out-of-quota tariffs on sugar have been an issue in U.S. FTA negotiations with sugar-producing developing countries. One study has estimated that tariffs, quotas, and subsidies provide U.S. agricultural producers with the protection equivalent to an average tariff of 19.9%. The study also notes that the United States is by no means the most protectionist in this category, as the tariff equivalents for other industrialized countries, are much higher: Canada 52.3%; European Union 46.4%; and Japan 82.1%.", "At the same time, the United States asserts that developing countries maintain high tariffs and non-tariff barriers on some agricultural products and manufactured goods and barriers to trade in services, such as banking, insurance, and professional services.

Developing countries have also raised the issue with the United States as part of FTA negotiations, pressing for special treatment under the FTAs.

Developing countries also argue that benefits of tariff preference programs are eroding because the United States and other developed countries have been entering into free trade agreements that eliminate tariffs among FTA partners.

As a result, these opportunities and challenges will likely continue, if not expand.", "The analysis of U.S. trade trends also exposes a significant divide among groups of developing countries. Some countries, such as those in East Asia, Mexico, and Chile, have made great strides, and are expanding their role in U.S. and world trade. Others including most of Africa, many countries in South Asia, and some in Latin America, lag behind or are losing shares of U.S. and world trade. These differences suggest that an effective U.S. trade policy needs to differentiate among the various groups of developing countries.
