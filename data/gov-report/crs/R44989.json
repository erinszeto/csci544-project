However, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-173 ) required that, beginning in 2007, higher-income Part B enrollees pay higher premiums. Similarly, when the Part D program began in 2006, all enrollees in the same Part D plan paid the same premiums. The ACA subsequently imposed high-income premiums on Part D prescription drug benefit enrollees, beginning in 2011. The Social Security Administration notes that fewer than 5% of Medicare beneficiaries pay these higher premiums.", "For Part B, standard premiums (i.e., premiums paid by enrollees who are not considered high income) are set at 25% of average annual per capita Part B program expenditures, and the remaining 75% of costs are subsidized by the federal government. Similarly, under Part D, base premiums are set at 25.5% of average annual per capita costs for standard Part D coverage, and the remaining 74.5% is subsidized by the federal government. Adjustments are made to the Parts B and D premiums for higher-income beneficiaries, with the percentage of per capita expenditures paid by these beneficiaries increasing with income. (In other words, the federal subsidy declines as income levels increase.) This percentage currently ranges from 35% to 80% of average per capita expenditures for both Parts B and D. The income thresholds for couples who file joint tax returns are 200% of the individual income threshold at each level. In 2017, individuals whose annual income exceeds $85,000 ($170,000 for a couple) are subject to higher premium amounts. (See Table 2 .)
