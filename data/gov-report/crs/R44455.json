Each report must include disaggregated percentage data from each element of the IC on all employees during the previous fiscal year in reference to (1) racial and ethnic minorities; (2) women; and (3) individuals with disabilities. The IAA for FY2004 ( P.L. 108-177 , Section 319) focuses on improving IC EEO outreach efforts. It required a pilot project designed to promote EEO \"using innovative methodologies.\" One such outreach initiative has been the creation of IC Centers of Academic Excellence (IC CAE). The IC CAE Program's aim is to \"increase the pool of eligible applicants in core skills areas, specifically targeting women and racial/ethnic minorities with varied cultural backgrounds, regional and geographical expertise, skills, language proficiency, and related competencies.\" It does this primarily through a grant program open to all accredited four-year colleges and universities in the United States. Information on this program is available in its Program Plan. The IAA for FY2010 ( P.L. 111-259 , Section 338) requires a report on the plans of each such IC element to increase diversity including specific plans associated with equal employment opportunity and diversity; recruiting and hiring of diverse candidates; retention of diverse Federal employees at the junior, midgrade, senior, and management levels; diversity awareness training and education programs for senior officials and managers of each such element; and performance metrics. The IAA for FY2011 ( P.L. 112-18 , Section 403) requires the IC Inspector General (IG) to submit a report on \"the degree to which racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are employed in professional positions in the intelligence community and barriers to the recruitment and retention of additional racial and ethnic minorities in such positions.\" The IG Report and reports on specific numbers associated with the IC workforce are classified. The IAA for FY2016 ( P.L. 114-113 , Division M, Section 712) allows the DNI to provide grants to historically black colleges and universities, predominantly Black institutions, Hispanic-serving institutions, and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions. The grants are to provide programs of study in the following educational disciplines: (1) Intermediate and advanced foreign languages deemed in the immediate interest of the intelligence community, including Farsi, Pashto, Middle Eastern, African, and South Asian dialects; and (2) Study abroad programs and cultural immersion programs.", "Efforts to promote diversity emphasize the need to identify, attract, hire and retain targeted individuals. Anecdotal evidence suggests that although the IC is identifying and attracting well-qualified candidates, it loses many candidates through its lengthy and cumbersome hiring process. A number of government-wide, long-standing problems are associated with the personnel hiring process such as:", "Fragmented governance and uncoordinated leadership that hinders the ability to meet federal workforce needs; Complicated processes and rules; Disconnects between front-line hiring managers and government HR specialists.", "Despite widespread and long-standing recognition of hiring problems; they persist. The most common complaints appear to be the length of time required and the lack of feedback during the waiting period. The \"application timeline\" available on the intelligence careers website warns potential applicants to expect a wait of as many as 28 weeks for a job at DIA, NSA, NGA or the ODNI. The security and testing portion make take up to 15 of the 28 weeks, depending on the agency in question. Many talented individuals will accept other job opportunities during a waiting period that may extend 8 months.

Based on a search of websites associated with IC hiring, there appears to be progress toward a portal for all IC agencies\u2014where those interested in a career in the IC can find out how, when, where and why to apply. The intelligence.careers.gov website identifies all 17 components of the IC, but only DIA, NGA, NSA and the ODNI are \"participating agencies\" on that site. It may be that a common application form\u2014used as a first step for all IC agencies\u2014is possible and is being developed.

Both Alexis and Snowden were investigated, adjudicated and credentialed through the traditional security clearance process. One DOD investigation of the Navy Yard shooting recommended CE, based in part, on its finding that: ", "[p]otentially useful security-related information often goes unnoticed during the long periods between reinvestigations of cleared individuals . For example, over a month before the Navy Yard shooting, Alexis displayed psychotic behavior to active duty police force members at Naval Station Newport, to civilian police officers in the town adjacent to the base, and to coworkers. Even earlier, Alexis did not sufficiently self-report his contact with law enforcement during his service in the Navy. These incidents affecting his continued eligibility were not investigated or were missed altogether.", "Any individual who has been deemed eligible to hold a security clearance may be subject to CE.

It is related to security clearances but treated separately in this report because polygraph examinations are not necessary to the security clearance process. For example, no one in the legislative branch is subject to polygraph examinations. Concerns are repeatedly raised about alleged privacy violations, \"out-of-scope\" reporting of criminal activities, \"false-positives\" and other polygraph inaccuracies, examiner and agency inconsistencies, and over-zealous and inconsistent examiners. Defenders of the polygraph praise its effectiveness in detecting lies and eliciting admissions of guilt regarding past security violations. They also praise the polygraph's deterrent effect\u2014e.g., its ability to deter future security violations and to deter employment applications from potentially poor security risks.", "The polygraph machine, first constructed in the early 1900s, does not detect lies. Rather, it is an instrument that charts changes in an individual's respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, and sweat gland activity in response to a series of yes-or-no questions. Polygraph examiners determine whether a person's physiological reaction is stronger in responding to certain questions when contrasted with recorded reactions to a series of comparison or \"control\" questions. It is believed that stronger reactions indicate deception on the part of the individual being tested. It is these physiological responses which are at the heart of the ongoing debate over the validity of polygraph testing.", "The polygraph examination attempts to serve two purposes: to detect deception and to reveal truth. The test itself represents an attempt to capture accurate psychophysiological indicators of deception. The \"polygraph examination,\" however, includes both the test and the interrogation surrounding it, and is intended to be a tool for revealing truth. ", "On balance, the IC maintains that the pros of polygraphing outweigh the cons; polygraph examinations are therefore required throughout the IC. The successful completion of any number of examinations over an individual's period of employment is required to first obtain and then retain a security clearance. IC Policy Guidance (ICPG) 704.6 provides guidance on the \"Conduct of Polygraph Examinations for Personnel Security Vetting.\" There are three types of polygraph examinations: Counterintelligence Scope Polygraph (CSP) examinations, Expanded Scope Polygraph (ESP) examinations, and Specific Issue Polygraph (SIP) examinations. According to ICPG 704.6:", "\"CSP examinations shall cover the topics of espionage, sabotage, terrorism, unauthorized disclosure, or removal of classified information (including to the media), or unauthorized or unreported foreign contacts, and deliberate damage to or malicious misuse of U.S. Government information systems or defense systems. ESP examinations cover CSP topics plus topics of criminal conduct, drug involvement and falsification of security questionnaires and forms. The ESP examination has also been referred to as a Full Scope Polygraph (FSP) or Expanded Scope Screening (ESS) examination in some IC organizations. SIP examinations may be conducted to resolve an individual issue of adjudicative concern such as espionage, sabotage, unauthorized disclosure of classified information, or criminal conduct or to aid in CI investigations. The SIP examination may be used in conjunction with CSP or ESP examinations.\" ", "The type of examination required varies within agencies and between agencies. Generally speaking, most IC agencies rely on the CSP examination. However, the CIA, FBI, NSA, U.S. Secret Service, and Naval Criminal Investigative Service may require the ESP examination due to the especially sensitive nature of certain information derived from human sources. Polygraphs are required randomly and periodically (generally every five to seven years), although some individuals may go years without one due the large backlog of cases. ", "While many federal agencies use them, their utility has been called into question. Polygraphs are known to occasionally yield \"false-positive\" results for a variety of reasons. For example, individuals known as \"guilt grabbers\" by some polygraph examiners, \"feel guilty at the mere thought of having done something wrong.\" The Supreme Court has determined that \"There is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable\u2026. To this day, the scientific community remains extremely polarized about the reliability of polygraph techniques\u2026. Doubts and uncertainties plague even the best polygraph exams.\" A 2003 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report questions the scientific basis for the accuracy of polygraph testing, particularly when used to 'screen' employees. ", "A decade of reform efforts encouraged by legislation such as the IRTPA of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) and reports such as the one by the NAS, have yielded mixed results. According to a year-long study of the DOD's polygraph programs commissioned by the Principle Deputy, USD(I): \"The polygraph has and continues to be a valuable tool in supporting and advancing DoD personnel security and counterintelligence matters, criminal investigation resolution, and mitigating the insider threat.\" The study found the DOD in full compliance with its own polygraph requirements, to include the appeals process. However, a report published as recently as March 2014 by the NRO IG found \"significant shortcomings in the administration and execution\" of the NRO's polygraph program. The IG \"identified material inconsistencies in examiner approaches including examiners improperly raising issues not within the scope of the test.\" These contradictory findings suggest the need for frequent, independent assessments of the polygraph program across the IC.

Florini notes those calling for increased transparency, even those who are in top government positions, \"find themselves up against powerful forces: entrenched habits, protection of privilege, and fear of how newly released information might be used, or misused.\" She points out that there are excellent arguments for and against sharing secrets. For example, she writes: \"No country wants its adversaries to have access to details about the design and potential weaknesses of weapons\u2014but soldiers whole lives may be threatened by those weaknesses would benefit greatly from having those weapons subjected to public scrutiny before they are needed.\" ", "General Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA notes the dangers associated with those who want \"absolute transparency at all costs.\" He points to the widespread public expectation of access to government documents particularly among the 'millennial generation'\u2014people born after 1980 and before 2000.' He describes the problems associated with recruiting from \"Edward Snowden's generation\" this way: ", "The problem is that this is a generation of people whose views on secrecy, privacy, transparency, and government accountability are a bit different from the folks supervising them, and certainly different from my generation. We nonetheless need to recruit from this group because they have the skills that \u2026 NSA and CIA require to fulfil their lawful mandates. So the challenge is how to recruit this talent while also protecting ourselves from the very small fraction of that population that has this romantic attachment to absolute transparency at all costs.", "Responding to the demands for greater transparency from the millennial generation and others, President Obama announced in 2009 that his Administration was committed to an unprecedented level of openness in Government. President Obama stated:", "Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
