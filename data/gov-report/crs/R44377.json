{"id": "R44377", "title": "Disposal of Unneeded Federal Buildings: Legislative Proposals in the 114th Congress", "released_date": "2016-07-13T00:00:00", "summary": ["Real property disposal is the process by which federal agencies identify and then transfer, donate, or sell real property they no longer need. Disposition is an important asset management function because the costs of maintaining unneeded properties can be substantial, consuming financial resources that might be applied to long-standing real property needs, such as repairing existing facilities, or other pressing policy issues, such as reducing the national debt.", "Despite the expense, federal agencies hold thousands of unneeded and underutilized properties. Agencies have argued that they are unable to dispose of these properties for several reasons. First, there are statutorily prescribed steps in the disposal process that can take months to complete. Second, properties may not be appealing to potential buyers or lessees if they require major repairs or environmental remediation\u2014steps for which agencies lack funding to complete before bringing a property to market. Third, key stakeholders in the disposal process\u2014including local governments, non-profit organizations, and businesses\u2014are often at odds over how to dispose of properties.", "In addition, Congress may be limited in its capacity to conduct oversight of the disposal process because it currently lacks access to reliable, comprehensive real property data. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains a database with information on most federal buildings, but those data are provided to Congress on a limited basis. Moreover, the quality of the information in the database has been questioned, in part because of inconsistent reporting of key data elements, such as how much space within a given building is unneeded.", "Five bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress that would enact broad reforms in the real property disposal process\u2014the Civilian Property Realignment Act (CPRA, S. 1750); the Federal Asset Sale and Transfer Act (FAST Act, S. 2375); the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act (H.R. 4465); the Federal Property Management Reform Act of 2016 (Property Reform Act, S. 2509); and the Public Buildings Reform and Savings Act of 2016 (Public Buildings Act, H.R. 4487).", "Under CPRA, agencies would develop a list of disposal recommendations, which could include the sale, transfer, conveyance, consolidation, or outlease of any unneeded space, among other options. These recommendations would be vetted by a newly established Civilian Property Realignment Commission, and then submitted to the President. If the President approved the recommendations, then they would be sent to Congress for review. If Congress passed a joint resolution of disapproval, then the recommendations would not be implemented; if a joint resolution of disapproval was not passed, then implementation would proceed. In many cases, disposal would be expedited by exempting properties on the recommendation list from certain statutory requirements, such as screening for public benefit.", "Under the FAST Act, agency recommendations would be sent to a newly established real property board for vetting, and then submitted to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget for approval or disapproval. The FAST Act does not provide Congress with an opportunity to vote for or against the list of recommendations.", "The Property Reform Act seeks to improve the management of federal real property by establishing additional disposal guidance, allowing agencies to retain the proceeds from the disposal of their properties, and requiring the U.S. Postal Service to increase the amount of underutilized space it leases to other federal agencies.", "The Public Buildings Act would establish a streamlined leasing pilot program, mandate lactation rooms in many public buildings, require GSA to notify Congress of cost overruns, and require real property prospectuses to include a comparison of costs between leasing and renting space."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal executive branch agencies hold an extensive real property portfolio that includes approximately 295,000 buildings. These assets have been acquired over a period of decades to help agencies fulfill their diverse missions. Agencies hold buildings with a range of uses, including offices, health clinics, warehouses, and laboratories. As agencies' missions change over time, so, too, do their real property needs, thereby rendering some assets less useful or unneeded altogether. Health care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has shifted in recent decades from predominately hospital-based inpatient care to a greater reliance on clinics and outpatient care, with a resulting change in space needs. Similarly, the Department of Defense (DOD) reduced its force by 36% after the Cold War ended, and has engaged in several rounds of base realignments and installation closures.", "Agencies are required to dispose of real property that they no longer need, but many continue to hold onto unneeded building space. In FY2010\u2014the last year in which cost data were reported\u2014the government spent $1.67 billion operating and maintaining unutilized and underutilized buildings. Federal agencies have indicated that their disposal efforts are often hampered by legal and budgetary disincentives, and competing stakeholder interests. ", "This report begins with an explanation of the real property disposal process and then discusses some of the factors that have made disposition relatively inefficient and costly.

These properties not only incur costs to the government to operate and maintain, but could, in some instances, be utilized by nonfederal entities\u2014state and local governments, nonprofits, private sector businesses\u2014to accomplish a range of public purposes, such as providing services to the homeless, or facilitating economic development. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports have consistently noted that efforts to dispose of unneeded and underutilized properties are hindered by statutory disposal requirements, the cost of preparing properties for disposal, conflicts with stakeholders, and a lack of accurate data. Each of these issues is discussed here."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Identifying Unneeded Space", "paragraphs": ["Agencies are required to continuously survey property under their control to identify any property that they no longer need to carry out their missions\u2014excess property\u2014and to \"promptly\" report that property as excess to the General Services Administration (GSA). Agencies are then required to follow the regulations prescribed by GSA when disposing of unneeded property or to follow independent or delegated statutory authority. GSA's regulations, in turn, implement statutory disposal requirements, discussed below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutory Disposal Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The steps in the real property disposal process are set by statute. Agencies must first offer to transfer properties they do not need (excess properties) to other federal agencies, who generally pay market value for excess properties they wish to acquire. Unneeded properties that are not acquired by federal agencies (surplus properties) must then be offered to state and local governments, and qualified nonprofits, for use in accomplishing public purposes specified in statute, such as use as public parks or for providing services to the homeless. Agencies may convey surplus properties to state and local governments, and qualified nonprofits, for public benefit at less than fair market value\u2014even at no cost. Surplus properties not conveyed for public benefit are then available for sale at fair market value or are demolished if the property could not be sold due to the condition or location of the property.", "Agencies have consistently argued that these statutory requirements slow down the disposition process, compelling agencies to incur operating costs for months\u2014sometimes years\u2014while the properties are being screened. Real property officials have said the McKinney-Vento Act ( P.L. 100-77 )\u2014which mandates that all surplus property be screened for homeless use\u2014can extend the time it takes to dispose of certain properties by months or years. Because public benefit conveyance requirements are set in law, agencies do not have the authority to skip screening, even for surplus properties that could not be conveyed anyway. Real property experts with the Army, for example, told auditors that they had properties that they felt could be disposed of only by demolition, due to their condition or location, but that still had to go through the screening process, thereby adding as much as 6 months to the disposal process and forcing the Army to pay maintenance costs that could have been avoided.", "Statutes pertaining to environmental remediation or historic preservation also add time to the process. It may take agencies years of study to assess the potential environmental consequences of a proposed disposal and to develop and implement an abatement plan, as required by law. Similarly, the National Historic Preservation Act requires agencies to plan their disposal actions so as to minimize the harm they cause to historic properties, which may include additional procedures, such as consulting with historic preservation groups at the state, local, and federal level. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disposal Costs", "paragraphs": ["Unneeded buildings are often among the older properties in an agency's portfolio. As a consequence, agencies sometimes find expensive repairs and renovations may be needed before the properties are fully functioning, meet health and safety standards, and comply with historic preservation requirements. It has been estimated, for example, that VA would need to spend about $3 billion to repair the buildings in its portfolio that it rated in \"poor\" or \"critical\" condition\u201456% of which were vacant or underutilized, and therefore might be candidates for disposal. The poor condition of these properties, however, may deter potential buyers or lessees, particularly if they must cover the cost of required improvements as a condition of acquiring the properties. Similarly, agencies that wish to demolish vacant buildings face deconstruction and cleanup costs that, at times, exceed the cost of maintaining the property\u2014at least in the short run\u2014which may encourage real property managers to retain a property rather than dispose of it. Federal agencies frequently cite the cost of complying with environmental regulations as a major disincentive to disposal. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholder Conflict", "paragraphs": ["Some agencies have found their disposal efforts complicated by the involvement of stakeholders with competing agendas. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has said that it can be stymied by the competing concerns of local and state governments, historic preservation offices, and political factors, when attempting to dispose of some of its unneeded real property. Similarly, VA has found that communities sometimes oppose disposals that would result in new development, and veterans groups have opposed disposing of building space if that space would be used for purposes unrelated to the needs of veterans. The Department of State (DOS) has had difficulty in disposing of surplus real property overseas due to disputes with host governments that restrict property sales. These conflicts can result in delay, or even cancellation of proposed disposals, which, in turn, prevent agencies from reducing their inventories of unneeded properties. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Real Property Management and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the obstacles mentioned above, data about agency real property portfolios\u2014which might be useful for congressional oversight\u2014appear to be inaccurate, and government-wide data are accessible only to the agency that manages the database, the GSA. Moreover, agencies regularly enter into leases rather than seek funding for new construction when acquiring space, even when the leased space is more expensive over time. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Availability and Quality of Real Property Data24", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) is the government's most comprehensive source of information about real property under the control of executive branch agencies. GSA manages the FRPP and collects real property data from 24 of the largest landholding agencies each year. Other agencies are encouraged, but not required, to report data to GSA. The data elements that participating agencies collect and report are determined by the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC), an interagency taskforce that is funded and chaired by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The other members of the FRPC are agency senior real property officers (SRPOs) and GSA.", "The FRPP contains data that could enhance congressional oversight of federal real property activities, such as the number of excess and surplus properties held by major landholding agencies, the annual costs of maintaining those properties, and agency disposition actions. GSA, however, does not permit direct access to the FRPP by Congress on the grounds that the data are proprietary. GSA does respond to requests for real property data from congressional offices, but GSA staff query the database and provide the results to the requestor.", "Some FRPP data are made public through an annual summary report posted on GSA's website, but the summary reports are of limited use for congressional oversight for several reasons. Most of the data are highly aggregated (e.g., the number of assets disposed of, government-wide, through public benefit conveyance), and very limited information is provided on an agency-by-agency basis. It is not possible, therefore, for Congress to monitor the performance of individual agencies through the summary reports. Basic questions, such as how many excess and surplus properties each agency holds or has disposed of in a given fiscal year, cannot be answered. Nor is it possible to compare the performance of agencies, which limits the ability of Congress to study the policies and practices at the most successful agencies and hold poorly performing agencies accountable. ", "The quality of the FRPP data has also been questioned. GAO audits have found, for example, that real property data were unreliable in key areas, such as annual operating costs, and often were not reported correctly by agencies. Another GAO report re-examined weaknesses in FRPP data collection practices, noting that key data elements\u2014such as buildings' maintenance needs and utilization rates\u2014are not consistently and accurately captured in the database. The GAO report found that problems with FRPP data collection result in agencies \"making real property decisions using unreliable data.\"", "There may be problems associated with changing definitions, as well. The FRPC stopped reporting data on underutilized and not utilized buildings in its FY2011 real property report. It began reporting the data again in FY2013, but with different definitions than those used in FY2010. The old definitions were based on the amount of space occupied in a building, while the new definitions are based on the frequency with which space was in use. Under the new definitions, the FRPC reported 5,532 underutilized and not utilized buildings in FY2013, down from 77,700 in FY2010\u2014a 93% decrease in three years. By FY2014, the number of underutilized and not utilized buildings reported decreased to 4,971, a 94% decline from FY2010. Inconsistencies like this have led GAO to conclude that the FRPC's data on underutilized and not utilized federal real property are not reliable.", "The annual summary reports also omit data that might enhance congressional oversight. The FRPP contains, for example, the number of excess and surplus properties held by each agency and the annual operating costs of those properties\u2014issues about which Congress has expressed ongoing interest\u2014but the summary report only provides the number and annual operating costs of disposed assets, thereby providing the \"good news\" of future costs avoided through disposition while omitting the \"bad news\" of the ongoing operating costs associated with excess and surplus properties the government maintained. In addition, agencies estimate a dollar amount for the repair needs of their buildings and structures as part of their FRPP reporting, but the estimate is then folded into a formula for calculating the condition of each building. Given that repair needs are an obstacle to disposing of some properties, Congress may find it useful to have the repair estimates reported separately to help inform funding decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overreliance on Leasing", "paragraphs": ["In a 2015 report, GAO wrote that it considers the government's \"overreliance on costly leased space\" to be one of the primary reasons federal real property continues to be designated as a \"high risk\" issue. The percentage of square feet leased by GSA\u2014which leases property for itself and on behalf of many agencies\u2014now exceeds the percentage of square feet it owns. According to GAO, leasing space is typically more expensive than owning space over the same time period. GAO cited, for example, a long-term operating lease that cost an estimated $40.3 million more than if the agency had purchased the same building. Similarly, in FY2014, the annual operating cost for a square foot of space in a building owned by the government was $5.77, but for leased space it was $24.04.", "GAO wrote that while the decision to lease rather than purchase space may be driven by operational requirements\u2014such as the United States Postal Service (USPS) leasing space in areas that it believes will optimize the efficiency of mail delivery\u2014agencies often choose to lease rather than purchase space because of budget scoring rules, even if the decision to lease is not the most cost-effective option. Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, an agency must have budget authority up-front for the government's total legal commitment before acquiring space. Thus, if an agency were to construct or purchase a building, it would need up-front funding for the entire cost of the construction or acquisition, while leased space only requires the annual lease payment plus the cost of terminating the lease agreement.", "In addition to the budget scoring issue, some agencies have been granted independent leasing authority, which means they do not have to work with GSA to acquire leased space. Some agencies with independent leasing authority, such as the USPS and VA, have established in-house real property expertise, while other agencies with independent authority have not. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, entered into a $557 million, 10-year lease for 900,000 square feet, which the SEC's inspector general (IG) called \"another in a long history of missteps and misguided leasing decisions made by the SEC since it was granted independent leasing authority.\" The IG found that \"inexperienced senior management\" at the SEC made poor decisions that led to acquiring three times the space needed\u2014the original estimate provided to Congress was for 300,000 square feet\u2014and bypassing other locations that were closer and less expensive."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Civilian Property Realignment Act (S. 1750)", "paragraphs": ["CPRA was introduced on July 13, 2015, and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.
