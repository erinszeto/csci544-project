This can be an obstacle for them in developing independent living skills and building supports that might ease their transition to adulthood. Older foster youth who return to their parents or guardians may continue to experience poor family dynamics or lack supports, and studies have shown that recently emancipated foster youth fare poorly relative to their counterparts in the general population on measures such as education and employment.", "The federal government recognizes that older youth in foster care and those who have been emancipated, or aged out, are vulnerable to negative outcomes and may ultimately return to the care of the state as adults through the public welfare, criminal justice, or other systems. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the primary federal programs that are targeted to these youth. These include the federal foster care program and the John H. Chafee Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood program (\"Chafee program\"), both of which are authorized under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.", "Foster care is a temporary living arrangement intended to ensure a child's safety and well-being until a permanent home can be re-established or newly established. Under the Title IV-E foster care program, a public child welfare agency must work to ensure that each child who enters foster care is safely returned to his/her parents, or, if this is determined not to be possible or appropriate (by a court), to find a new permanent home for the child. Jurisdictions (states, territories, and tribes) may seek reimbursement for youth to remain in care up to age 21. Approximately half of all states extend care to that age. In addition, the foster care program has certain protections for older youth. For example, jurisdictions must annually obtain the credit report of each youth in care who is age 14 and older. They must also assist youth with developing a transition plan that is in place 90 days before aging out. The law requires that a youth's caseworker\u2014and as appropriate, other representative(s) of the youth\u2014assist and support him/her in developing the plan. The law requires that the plan be guided by the youth, and should include specific options on housing, health insurance, education, local opportunities for mentors, and other supports.", "The Chafee program provides supports and services to youth ages 14 to 21 who are or were in foster care (with some exceptions). Youth in states that extend foster care to age 21 can be served under the program until age 23. The program authorizes funds to be used for providing assistance in obtaining a high school diploma, career exploration, training in daily living skills, training in budgeting and financial management skills, and preventive health activities, among other purposes. States must meet certain requirements, including that not more than 30% of Chafee funds are used for room and board expenses. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher (ETV) provides funding for Chafee-eligible youth to attend institutions of higher education. Youth can receive up to $5,000 annually for up to five years (consecutive or nonconsecutive) until they reach age 26. The Chafee law directs HHS to collect outcome and other information for current and former foster youth, and HHS established the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) for this purpose.", "Along with the foster care and Chafee programs, other federal programs are intended to help youth currently and formerly in foster care make the transition to adulthood. Federal law authorizes funding for states and local jurisdictions to provide workforce support and housing to older foster youth and youth emancipating from care. Further, beginning on January 1, 2014, eligible young people who were in foster care at age 18 are covered under a mandatory Medicaid pathway until age 26.

The law permits states to restrict eligibility based on the youth's income or resources, and whether or not the youth had received Title IV-E funding.", "As of late 2012, more than half (30) of all states had extended the Chafee option to eligible youth. Of these states, five reported requiring youth to have income less than a certain level of poverty (180% to 400%). Four states permitted youth who were in foster care at age 18 in another state to be eligible under the pathway. States also reported whether the youth is involved in the process for enrolling under the Chafee option. In 15 states, youth are not directly involved in the enrollment process. For example, some states automatically enroll youth. In the other 15 states, youth are involved in enrollment with assistance from their caseworker or they enroll on their own. Most states that have implemented the Chafee option require an annual review to verify that youth continue to be eligible for Medicaid. States generally have a hierarchy to determine under which pathway youth qualify. For example, in most states, youth who qualify for the Chafee option and receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) would be eligible for Medicaid under the SSI Medicaid pathway.

Amendments to the program in 2000 under P.L. 106-377 made youth ages 18 to 21 eligible for the vouchers for up to 18 months if they are homeless or are at risk of becoming homeless at age 16 or older. ", "The Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act ( P.L. 114-201 ), enacted in July 2016, extended the upper age of eligibility for FUP vouchers, from 21 to 24, for youth who emancipated from foster care. It also extended assistance under the program for these youth from 18 to 36 months and allows the voucher assistance to begin 90 days prior to a youth leaving care because they are aging out. It also requires HUD, after consulting with other appropriate federal agencies, to issue guidance to improve coordination between public housing agencies, which administer the vouchers, and child welfare agencies. The guidance must address certain topics, including identifying eligible recipients for FUP vouchers and identifying child welfare resources and supportive families for families and youth (including the Chafee program). As of the date of this report, HUD has not issued such guidance. In correspondence with CRS, HUD explained that it has requested funding for this work, and until those funds can be secured, HUD and HHS staff are studying how youth and families are served by FUP.

Each award included five years of funding per voucher and the voucher's use was restricted to voucher-eligible families for those five years. At the end of those five years, public housing authorities (PHAs) were eligible to convert FUP vouchers to regular Section 8 housing vouchers for low-income families. While the five-year use restrictions have expired for all family unification vouchers, some PHAs may have continued to use their original family unification vouchers for FUP-eligible families and some may have chosen to use some regular-purpose vouchers for FUP families (but the extent to which this happened is unknown). Congress appropriated $20 million for new FUP vouchers in each of FY2008 and FY2009; $15 million in FY2010, $10 million in FY2017, and $20 million in FY2018 and FY2019. Congress has specified that amounts made available under Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance and used for the FUP vouchers are to remain available for the program.", "A 2014 report on the FUP program examined the use of FUP vouchers for foster youth. The study was based on a survey of PHAs, a survey of child welfare agencies that partnered with PHAs that served youth, and site visits to four areas that use FUP to serve youth. The survey of PHAs showed that slightly less than half of PHAs operating FUP had awarded vouchers to former foster youth in the 18 months prior to the survey. PHAs reported that youth were able to obtain a lease within the allotted time, and many kept their leases for the full 18-month period they were eligible for the vouchers. In addition, 14% of total FUP program participants qualified because of their foster care status. According to the study, this relatively small share was due to the fact that less than half of PHAs were serving youth, and these PHAs tended to allocate less than one-third of their vouchers to youth, among other findings.", "Other Support", "Older current and former foster youth may be eligible for housing services and related supports through the Runaway and Homeless Youth program, administered by HHS.
