DHS describes its approach to asset-based risk as follows:", "The asset-based approach uses strategic threat estimates from the Intelligence Community of an adversary's intent and capability to attack different types of assets (such as chemical plants, stadiums, and commercial airports) using different attack methods. DHS analyzes the vulnerability of each asset type relative to each attack method to determine the form of attack most likely to be successful.", "Additionally, DHS estimates the consequences that successful attacks would have on each asset type, including human health, economic, strategic mission, and psychological impacts.

First, DHS evaluates reported threats, law enforcement activity (using Federal Bureau of Investigation and Immigration and Customs Enforcement terrorism case data), and suspicious incidents reported during the evaluation period. Next, DHS considers vulnerability factors for each geographic area, such as the area's proximity to international borders.", "Lastly, DHS estimates the potential consequences of an attack on that area, including human health (e.g., population, population density, transient populations), economy (e.g., percentage of Gross Domestic Product, total agriculture sales, international cargo value), strategic mission (e.g., defense industrial base), and psychological impacts.\"", " Table 2 below, presents state and urban area assets that DHS considered in the risk model for its grant allocation method.", "As can clearly be seen in Table 2 , all but two asset types\u00e2\u0080\u0094road interstate bridges and road interstate tunnels\u00e2\u0080\u0094apply both to states and to urban areas.", " Table 3 , below, presents what DHS calls the \"geographic attributes\" that the department uses in its geographically based risk analysis.", "In December 2003, President Bush issued HSPD-7, a directive on Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection which established a national policy for federal departments and agencies to identify and prioritize U.S. critical infrastructure and key resources and to protect them from terrorist attacks.

Examples of risk factors could include threats, homeland security capabilities, population, critical infrastructure assets, and transportation assets. In order to accurately assess the risk factors, one would need to evaluate the threats to the population, critical infrastructure, transportation, and the like, and determine the consequences of threats. Additionally, effectiveness factors such as the homeland security capabilities to prevent, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, and natural and technical disasters would need to be assessed.

Issue: How did DHS determine what asset types and geographic attributes to use, and how are these weighted in a state's or an urban area's risk assessment? Issue: What weight did DHS give to NADB assets, and what other sources did DHS use in determining asset risks?", "In considering risk and effectiveness factors, a question arises of what criteria to use when assessing potential risk-based formula variables. Risk factors include threats, the entity threatened, and the consequences of the threat to the specified entity. The agreement of potential risk and need factors is usually considered against the following criteria: ", "Validity\u00e2\u0080\u0094Do the factors serve as measures or indicators of threats, the vulnerability of the potential target, or potential consequence if catastrophe strikes the target? For example, does higher population density indicate greater vulnerability to an attack involving a weapon of mass destruction? What attributes associated with densely populated areas (e.g., numbers of law enforcement personnel on duty, the presence of sensors, cameras, and other technology) could reduce the validity of the factor? Relevance\u00e2\u0080\u0094What is the relationship between the factors and the identified items or characteristics? Is the relationship straightforward, or is it murky? For example, the total number of vehicles traveling through a mid-city tunnel would probably not be pertinent to a consideration of the risk of a hazardous material accident. The number of commercial trucks carrying hazardous material, however, would be more relevant. Reliability\u00e2\u0080\u0094The quality of the source of the information used in a risk assessment process is relevant. For example, population data from the U.S. Census Bureau are generally regarded as reliable and are used in a variety of formulas for allocating aid grants. Timeliness\u00e2\u0080\u0094The currency of the data affects the quality of the discussion on potential risks. For example, daily intelligence reports that provide information on current terrorist threats would be considered more timely than monthly or quarterly reports. Availability\u00e2\u0080\u0094If the validity of a risk factor is to be widely accepted, data used in a formula as a variable may need to be readily and publicly available. Intelligence information that has been classified by the federal government and not shared with state and local officials would fail to satisfy this criterion.", "Additionally, DHS requires states and urban areas to identify first responder and emergency management capability enhancement and sustainment needs in the Program and Capability Enhancement Plan . The plan is part of their HSGP applications. As noted earlier, states and urban areas are required to submit Investment Justifications that detail how federal assistance would address identified homeland security needs and how the assistance would address state and urban area counter-terrorism-related capabilities. The Investment Justifications are then evaluated through a peer review process (administered by Booz Allen Hamilton). The peer review process, the justifications, and the identified effectiveness are not publically available. Additionally, the effectiveness factors are not identified by DHS; instead states and urban areas are required to determine their individual needs and display how federal assistance would meet the needs. DHS also has to rely on information from other agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and may not be able validate or confirm the information used in their state and urban area risk assessments.", "Issue: How should the risk and effectiveness factors be evaluated? Issue: Is DHS able to validate and confirm the reliability of asset types and geographic attributes it receives from other federal entities?", "DHS has elected not to use a 100% risk-based formula for allocating the remainder of SHSGP and LETPP total appropriations, and not to use a 100% risk-based allocation for UASI. Instead, DHS has developed a two-part approach to determining state and urban area allocations. This approach consists of a DHS risk assessment and the state's and urban area's justification of need for funding.", "Critics may argue that by not allocating strictly on risk and by including a needs portion to the distribution method, DHS has not addressed criticisms, as from the 9/11 Commission, in its 2004 report, which advocate a purely risk-based allocation of homeland security funding. In this viewpoint, by coupling effectiveness with risk, DHS may be providing funding to states and urban areas that do not have a high risk of terrorism. Conversely, by allocating funding based on both risk and effectiveness, proponents could argue that DHS is addressing not only terrorism risks, but also a state's and an urban area's capability to address those terrorism risks.", "The issue of risk- and effectiveness-based funding is being raised in oversight of FY2006 state allocations.", "Issue: Has DHS compared a 100% risk-based methodology against a risk and effectiveness methodology? If, so how does it change state and urban area allocations?", "In the FY2006 DHS appropriations act ( P.L. 109-90 ), Congress mandated that GAO conduct an analysis of the threat and risk factors DHS used to allocate SHSGP, LETPP, and UASI grant funds, and report on the findings by November 17, 2005, which was prior to DHS's completion of its FY2006 HSGP guidance. GAO, using data and information available at the time, reviewed DHS allocation methodologies to determine (1) how DHS measured risk, (2) what risk factors were included in the methodologies and why, (3) how the risk factors were used for assessing risks for the purposes of allocating FY2006 HSGP funds, and (4) how DHS determined which risk factors had the greatest weight in the risk analysis portion of the methodologies.", "GAO determined that DHS's risk analysis focused on terrorism, and briefed congressional committees on the results of its analysis. GAO did not issue a public report, however, due to security classification of the data used in the analysis. GAO was not required to validate the methodologies, but to analyze them and report to Congress on its findings.", "In December 2004, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a \"Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review.\" The bulletin is applicable to all federal departments and agencies and establishes government-wide guidance on enhancing the practice of peer-review of government scientific information. OMB states that peer review can increase the quality and credibility of the scientific information developed by the federal government. \"Peer review\" is characterized as", "...one of the most important procedures used to ensure that the quality of published information meets the standards of scientific and technical community. It is a form of deliberation involving an exchange of judgements about the appropriateness of methods and the strength of the author's inferences. Peer review involves the review of a draft product for quality by specialists in the field who were not involved in producing the draft.", "The bulletin defines \"scientific information\" as factual inputs, data, models, analyses, technical information, or scientific assessments.", "OMB requires each federal agency to subject scientific information to peer review prior to dissemination. The bulletin provides broad discretion in determining what type of peer review is appropriate and what procedures should be employed to select appropriate reviewers.", "If DHS's FY2006 HSGP allocation methodologies were defined \"scientific assessments\" of terrorism risks, GAO's review of the methodologies could be considered an independent peer review. Conversely, GAO's review may not have been complete if GAO was not given access to all the information used in DHS's allocation methodology or if DHS had not completed the assessment methods.", "Issue: Should DHS arrange an independent peer review of its allocation methodologies prior to disseminating the grant application guidance and determining state and urban area allocations?"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
