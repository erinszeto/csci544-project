Fears that crude oil production was in decline also led to policies promoting alternative fuels and increased vehicle fuel efficiency. Since the summer 2008 peak in crude oil prices, however, the U.S. demand for refined petroleum products has declined, largely due to the economic recession, and the outlook for the petroleum refining industry in the United States has changed.", "In response to weak demand for gasoline and other refined products, refinery operators have begun cutting back capacity, idling, and, in a few cases, permanently closing their refineries. By current count, 115 refineries now produce fuel in addition to 13 refineries that produce lubricating oils and asphalt. Even as the number of refineries has decreased, operable refining capacity has actually increased over the past decade, from 16.5 million barrels/day to over 18 million barrels/day. Cyclical economic factors aside, U.S. refiners now face the potential of long-term decreased demand for their products. Legislative and regulatory efforts that originally intended to address the growing demand for petroleum products may now displace some of that demand. These efforts include such policies as increasing the volume of ethanol in the gasoline supply, improving vehicle fuel efficiency, and encouraging the purchase of vehicles powered by natural gas or electricity.", "The United States met roughly 39% of its crude oil demand in 2011 through domestic production, exclusive of the natural gas needed in various refining processes. Canada has become the United States' leading supplier of crude oil through its increasing production from oil sands providing roughly 15% of U.S. demand. In total, the United States meets 62% of its demand from crude oil produced in North America. Over the last few decades, imported crude oils have become heavier and higher in average sulfur content. Until quite recently, the diminishing supply of light sweet crude oil led U.S. refineries to make multi-million dollar investments in processing-upgrades to convert lower-priced heavier sour crude oils to high-value products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.", "Some key environmental and energy policies enacted over the past few decades directly or indirectly affect the operations of U.S. refineries and the market for petroleum products. These include requirements for the use of reformulated gasoline (RFG) in many areas of the country, mandates under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), increasingly stringent vehicle efficiency standards, and greenhouse gas limits under the Clean Air Act and state laws.", "Declining motor-fuel demand spurred by both market and regulatory forces has influenced some refinery operators to idle, consolidate, or permanently close refineries.

During this period, the demand for petroleum products, especially gasoline, increased rapidly both in the United States and world markets. Refiners found favorable price-spreads between heavy and light crude oils as well as between crude oil and refined products. The industry operated plants at nearly maximum capacity and posted record profit levels. Unexpected events such as hurricanes that shut down Gulf Coast refineries, concerns over \"peak oil\" production, and crude oil price speculation likely contributed to spikes in gasoline prices. During the period, many policy makers expressed the concern that U.S. refining capacity was not increasing rapidly enough to keep up with the expected growth in demand for petroleum products. The concern now may be that excess refining capacity has affected bottom-line refining profitability and the ability to meet consumer demand. ", "Current economic conditions have led to lower refinery utilization rates and recent closure of a few refineries. In a continuing trend, some vertically integrated oil companies (those engaged in all phases of production, refining and marketing) either have divested their refineries or spun them off as separate business units. The concentration of refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, an outcome of the region's significant petroleum resources and their history of development, influenced the current network of crude oil and product distribution pipelines. New sources of heavy crude oils from Canada and light crude oils from the mid-continent and mid-West are altering the logistics in supplying established refining centers. In the absence of pipeline capacity, existing rail lines are proving a viable alternative. Rail appears to offer an immediate solution to both crude supply and product delivery bottlenecks, as rail-delivered ethanol appears to demonstrate. No matter what the investment, refineries must adapt to changing crude streams to ensure lowest cost of operation, and the largest product/crude price spread. The greatest cost in refining is not capital investment, but crude costs. But, the growing availability of new unconventional oil resources in the mid-continent resources is changing refining economics and profitability on both the East and West Coasts, and perhaps challenging the Gulf Coast's refining center status.", "The U.S. refining industry faces a number of new policies that could force downward pressure on refinery numbers, capacity, or utilization:", "Tighter Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and vehicle greenhouse gas standards; the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS); natural gas as a transportation fuel; and EPA Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting.", "Further, the potential binding greenhouse gas limits in the future, either through a federal cap-and-trade or carbon tax program, or through regulation under the Environmental Protection Agency's \"tailoring rule,\" could provide further downward pressure on petroleum demand.", "This report reviews the current production capacity of the refineries operating in the United States, and the sources and changes in their crude oil supply.

An average crude oil contains about 84% carbon, 14% hydrogen, 1% to 3% sulfur, and less than 1% each nitrogen, oxygen, metals, and salts. The American Petroleum Institute (API) compares the \"lightness\" or \"heaviness\" of crude oils on an inverted scale in terms of degrees (\") API gravity. Figure 1 illustrates a range of crude oil gravities. Any crude above 10 \u00b0API will float on water. Light crude's API gravity is higher than 31.1 \"API, medium crude between 22.3 \u00b0API and 31.1 \u00b0API, and heavy crude below 22.3 \u00b0API. The benchmark for comparing crudes has been West Texas Intermediate (WTI), or Texas light sweet. Light crude has a low wax-content, and sweet crude has less than 0.5% sulfur. (Refer to Appendix A for further information on crude oil properties.)", "A hypothetical refinery distills crude oil into various products, according to their boiling point range. The most common products\u2014gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels\u2014are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons that include paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics (which give fuel its unique odor). ", "Refineries vary in complexity, but have several basic processing steps in common: distillation , cracking , treating and reforming . Distillation involves heating crude oil in a furnace then condensing it in an atmospheric distillation tower (or Crude unit)\u2014the tall, narrow columns that give a refinery its distinctive skyline. The Crude unit separates light hydrocarbon molecules from heavy hydrocarbons based on their boiling temperatures. The lightest materials, like propane and butane, vaporize and rise to the top of the atmospheric column. Medium weight materials, including gasoline, jet and diesel fuels, condense in the middle. Heavy materials, called gas oils, condense in the lower portion of the atmospheric column. Residuum (a heavy tar-like material) referred to as the \"bottom of the barrel,\" has a high boiling temperature that keeps it in the lower portion of the column. ", "In some cases, distillation columns operate at less than atmospheric pressure (vacuum) to lower the temperature at which a hydrocarbon mixture boils. Vacuum distillation reduces the chance of thermal decomposition (cracking) due to overheating. As the heavier oils move through the refinery, heat and catalysts \"crack\" them into lighter products through fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), hydrocracking, or thermal-cracking (coking). Fluid catalytic cracking uses high temperature and catalysts to convert heavy gas oil mostly into gasoline. Hydrocracking uses catalysts to react gas oil and hydrogen under high pressure and high temperature to make both jet fuel and gasoline. Coking converts low-value residuum (using thermal-cracking) to high-value light products, producing petroleum coke as a by-product. ", "While the cracking breaks most of the gas oil into gasoline and jet fuel, it also breaks off some smaller hydrocarbons that are lighter than gasoline. These lighter hydrocarbons recombine in alkylation units, in the presence of sulfuric acid catalyst, to reform into high-octane gasoline. The products from the crude unit and the feeds to other units contain some natural impurities, such as sulfur and nitrogen that contribute to air pollution when fuels combust. Hydrotreating (a milder version of hydrocracking) removes these impurities by converting the sulfur to hydrogen sulfide and then to elemental sulfur; and converting nitrogen into ammonia and then removing it by water-washing for recovery as ammonia for fertilizer. ", "The gasoline stream that comes out of the crude unit or cracking unit has a relatively low octane rating (a key measure of how gasoline performs in an automobile engine). To upgrade gasoline octane-rating, a reforming unit uses precious-metal catalysts (platinum and rhenium) to \"reform\" hydrocarbon molecules into high-octane gasoline components. The reforming process removes hydrogen from low-octane gasoline, which refinery reuses in various cracking (hydrocracking) and treating (hydrotreating) units.

By the Congressional Research Service's (CRS) most recent count, 115 refineries primarily process crude oil into fuels (of which four refineries are complexes made up of two or three formerly independent refineries joined by pipeline). Despite permanent closures, operable refining capacity has increased over the past decade from 16.5 million barrels/day to approximately 18 million barrels/day. By the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) definition, \"operable capacity\" includes both operating refineries and idle refineries which shut down temporarily for repair or \"turn around\" for seasonal adjustment in the product slate (for example, reformulating gasoline from winter to summer blends). EIA includes refineries that also produce lubricating oils, asphalts, and other products For this report, CRS reviewed petroleum refiners that primarily produce fuel and used the capacity that these refiners advertise on their corporate web pages to estimate an overall refinery capacity in excess of 18 million barrels/day. EIA had reported a U.S. operable crude oil distillation capacity of 17.73 million barrels/day and a gross crude oil input of 15.29 million barrels/day in 2011 yielding a refinery utilization capacity at slightly over 86%. As a refinery's year-to-year performance changes (for the reasons noted above) a better measure of capacity may be \"barrels/stream day\"\u2014the barrels of crude oil input a refinery reports over the number of days it annually operates also termed \"utilization.\" EIA also reported prime suppliers of refined products sold approximately 14.53 million barrels/day.

The West Coast (PADD 5) remains largely isolated from the rest of the United States, especially from the large refineries in PADD 3, as well as crude oil imports to the Gulf Coast. The Virginia and Colonial product pipelines, built during World War II, link up PADD 3 Gulf Coast refineries with PADD 1 northeast states. Regional differences in EPA mandated fuel gasoline specifications, however, limit the flexibility of distribution by pipeline. The isolation has resulted in a gasoline market that has exhibited higher prices and reduced availability under some market conditions. No crude oil pipelines link PADD 1 or PADD 5 with the rest of the country, but rail shipment offers a near-term alternative. Canada supplies PADD 2 refineries through the Alberta Clipper crude oil pipeline.

Because the U.S. dollar serves as the reference price currency for oil in the world market, some oil analysts link the peak in oil prices in mid-2008 to the dollar's weakness at the time. As a result, the oil price rise was much less pronounced when measured in other major currencies.", "Although crude oil represents the primary input and cost factor in refinery operations, the relationship between the price of crude oil and the profit margin in refining is neither simple nor direct. Rising crude oil prices increase primary refining costs and can tighten refining profit margins. However, if product prices rise proportionally to crude oil prices, as they did in 2008, refiners effectively pass cost increases on to consumers. Because of the short-term price insensitivity of demand when gasoline prices rise, the revenue derived from the sale of gasoline and other petroleum products is likely to increase in these market conditions, even as total costs are likely to decrease because the volume of oil passing through the refinery declines somewhat. These factors can permit refiners to maintain or even increase profits during periods of high crude oil prices. The situation differs if less oil is passing through the refinery due to weak product demand. In that event, product prices and profits may fall in tandem as capacity utilization declines.", "The multiplicity of oil prices, which reflect the quality of various crude oils, further complicates the linkage between oil prices and refining profitability. Generally, lighter crude oils command a price premium over heavier oils, as discussed earlier in this report. The size of the price premium tends to vary as relative supply availability changes and as refiners adapt refineries to use lower cost crude oil stocks.

Estimates of the short-run price elasticity of gasoline are in the range of -0.25 or less. This value implies that if the price of gasoline rises by 1.0% the result is likely to be only a \u00bc % decline in the quantity of gasoline demanded. Consumers may have difficulty reducing their demand for gasoline in the short-run, as commuting distance, automobile fuel-efficiency, and other commitments are fixed in the near term, making it hard to lower consumption quickly. They may respond to higher gasoline prices by reducing expenditures on other goods or increasing household debt levels. The demand for gasoline also depends on consumer's income growth, and perhaps, as well, on the fraction of consumer's disposable income accounted for by gasoline purchases. The average estimate of income elasticity for gasoline demand in the United States is about 1.0, meaning that a 1% increase in income is associated with a 1% increase in spending on gasoline.

This strategy puts refinery investment in competition with the companies' other capital projects, but offers the possibility of relatively large increases in supply.", "Second, an oil company can expand or reduce the capacity or capacity utilization-rate of existing refineries. Investment in expanded capacity can run parallel to investments made to keep existing refinery assets in compliance with environmental and other regulations affecting the industry. Expansions or contractions in capacity utilization can usually be brought on line faster than new refineries due to simplified permitting requirements, but have the disadvantage of augmenting or reducing capacity in smaller steps.", "Third, instead of investing in new refineries or expanding existing ones, an oil company might choose to meet changes in petroleum product demand by varying net imports of finished, or partially finished, products from other areas of the world. The advantage of this approach is twofold. The net imports can be introduced or reduced, relatively quickly, into the domestic market with no requirement for additional capital spending on refining capacity. The imports can be easily expanded, or contracted, should the need arise. Reliance on foreign sources for petroleum products as well as crude oil may add an additional dimension to concerns of energy dependence, even though prices of these products may tend to be the same in domestic and foreign markets.", "Cost is likely to determine an oil company's decision on which alternative to use to meet demand variations.

Total petroleum products imports made up about 17% of domestic consumption. The effects of the recession can be seen in the reduced level of imports in 2008 through 2011. Adjustments in imports to reflect reduced demand are likely to be accomplished with fewer losses in domestic employment and economic dislocations than refinery closures.

The latter cost should be at least as big as the cost of remaining idle. With a 5% price discount, the interest cost of carrying excess capacity or losing profits could offset the tax credit's value.

Average annual sulfur content in all gasoline dropped from about 300 ppm in 1997 to a maximum of 30 ppm for most refiners in 2006.", "Exhaust Emissions", "Diesel engines characteristically emit lower amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) than gasoline engines, but they emit higher amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). NOx is the primary cause of ground-level ozone pollution (smog) and presents a greater problem, technically, to reduce in diesel engines than PM. The CO, NOx, and PM emissions for gasoline and diesel engines are regulated by the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q). ", "Appendix E. Glossary", "Motor Gasoline (Finished). A complex mixture of relatively volatile hydrocarbons with or without small quantities of additives, blended to form a fuel suitable for use in spark-ignition engines. Motor gasoline (as defined in ASTM Specification D 4814 or Federal Specification VV-G-1690C) has a boiling range of 122\" to 158\" F at the 10% percent recovery point, and a 365\" to 374\" F boiling range at the 90% recovery point. \"Motor Gasoline\" includes conventional gasoline, all types of oxygenated gasoline (including gasohol), and reformulated gasoline, but excludes aviation gasoline. Volumetric data on blending components, such as oxygenates, are not counted in data on finished motor gasoline until the blending components are blended into the gasoline. Note: E85 is included only in volumetric data on finished motor gasoline production and other components of product supplied.", "Conventional Gasoline. Finished motor gasoline not included in the oxygenated or reformulated gasoline categories. Note: This category excludes reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) as well as other blendstock.", "Reformulated Gasoline . Finished gasoline formulated for use in motor vehicles, the composition and properties of which meet the requirements of the reformulated gasoline regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under Section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act. It includes gasoline produced to meet or exceed emissions performance and benzene content standards of federal-program reformulated gasoline even though the gasoline may not meet all of the composition requirements (e.g., oxygen content) of federal-program reformulated gasoline. Note: This category includes Oxygenated Fuels Program Reformulated Gasoline (OPRG). Reformulated gasoline excludes Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending (RBOB) and Gasoline Treated as Blendstock (GTAB).", "Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending (RBOB). Specially produced reformulated gasoline blendstock intended for blending with oxygenates downstream of the refinery where it was produced. Includes RBOB used to meet requirements of the federal reformulated gasoline program and other blendstock intended for blending with oxygenates to produce finished gasoline that meets or exceeds emissions performance requirements of Federal reformulated gasoline (e.g., California RBOB and Arizona RBOB). Excludes conventional gasoline blendstocks for oxygenate blending(CBOB).", "RBOB for Blending with Alcohol . Motor gasoline blending components intended to be blended with an alcohol component (e.g., fuel ethanol) at a terminal or refinery to raise the oxygen content.", "Fuel Ethanol (E10). Blends of up to 10% by volume anhydrous ethanol (200 proof) (commonly referred to as \"gasohol\"). "], "subsections": []}]}}
