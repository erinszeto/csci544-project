Although a few statutory changes have been implemented since its creation, many argue that the current state of the SES calls for more comprehensive reforms. The most recent change made to the SES was a revision of its pay system enacted in 2004. Advocates for additional changes to the SES argue that further changes would improve the efficiency and the management of government programs and the government workforce. Some of the changes they call for include improvement in recruiting efforts, more opportunities for onboard training and career development of senior executives, and further changes to the current pay structure.", "In the 112th Congress, two bills were introduced that would make significant and sweeping changes to the SES. The Senior Executive Service Reform Act, S. 2249, was introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka on March 28, 2012. If enacted, S. 2249 would make adjustments to the SES pay system, reduce the ratio of noncareer to career senior executives, establish an SES Resource Office in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and require agencies to enhance professional development opportunities for senior executives. Representative Jim Moran introduced H.R. 6042, also titled the Senior Executive Service Reform Act, on June 27, 2012. H.R. 6042 proposed similar changes to those proposed in the Senate bill, and would also require agencies to evaluate the skills and qualifications necessary for each SES position when it becomes vacant. In addition, H.R. 6042 would require agencies to establish an objective for holding executives accountable for addressing employee satisfaction.", "This report provides a history and background of the SES, examines the central features of the SES, and discusses some areas in which advocates for SES reform have called for change."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The Senior Executive Service (SES) was established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA; P.L. 95-454 , 92 Stat. 1111).

Supergrades were civil servants who held GS-16, GS-17, and GS-18 positions. Congress created the GS scale, including the supergrade positions, in 1949. At that time, the number of supergrade positions was limited to 400. Individuals in supergrade positions earned salaries almost equivalent to those of political executives and Members of Congress. They generally held specialized positions within agencies that were technically specific and did not require broad leadership skills or mobility. It was these individuals who were converted into the Senior Executive Service under the Civil Service Reform Act, along with individuals in managerial positions in Executive Levels IV and V. Converting those high-level positions into a more centralized cadre of managers was intended to make the management of government more flexible and efficient.", "Although the SES was created during President Jimmy Carter's Administration, President Carter was not the first President to propose changes to the executive levels of the civil service. Three decades earlier, for example, President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed a Senior Civil Service (which he later called the Career Executive Service). This proposal followed a series of recommendations made by the Second Hoover Commission, chaired by former President Herbert Hoover, which was created in part to identify needs of the U.S. federal personnel system. President John Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson also showed interest in reforming the higher civil service, tasking their administrations with reviewing the federal executive personnel system. Both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson introduced a new method for filling supergrade positions, but as some scholars have pointed out, reactions to and success of the programs were mixed. ", "Soon after entering the White House, President Richard Nixon asked the Civil Service Commission to study and make recommendations on the state of the federal executive personnel system. The study concluded that there were a number of issues with the executive personnel system that needed to be addressed. Some recommendations made by the commission included improving executive management capabilities; fostering and recruiting from a talent pool of motivated individuals; centralizing executive resources across agency lines; and providing training for executives. These recommendations were incorporated into a proposal by President Nixon to establish the Federal Executive Service in 1971. Scholars have identified the political landscape surrounding the Nixon presidency and a controversial provision which would have required executives to enter three-year \"employment agreements\" as the main reasons why Congress did not pass Nixon's FES bill."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Personnel Management Project", "paragraphs": ["One of the centerpieces of President Carter's campaign for the presidency in 1976 was his \"Washington outsider\" status, which he used as an asset to address what he considered to be problems in the federal government.

Led by the chair of the Civil Service Commission (now the Office of Personnel Management) and the associate director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Personnel Management Project was divided into nine task forces, one of which dealt directly with issues relating to the senior executives in government.

Neither the Congress nor the President has effective control over the total numbers of the executive cadre.", "2. The numbers of executives authorized have little relationship to current needs and the system cannot adapt rapidly to program changes.", "3. The multiplicity of hiring authorities with different requirements and provisions results in individuals with substantially similar responsibilities being employed and compensated under very different standards. It is susceptible to manipulation and fosters the use of questionable, albeit legal, maneuvers. ", "4. Individuals with little or no adequate managerial expertise can be placed in positions responsible for managing billion-dollar federal programs and for supervising thousands of employees.", "5. Career employees have little opportunity to undertake positions of the highest responsibility without relinquishing their career tenure. ", "6.

New initiatives are rare and even on-going programs operate in low gear.", "7. There are critically important executive positions classified as \"career\" which new administrations would like to fill with executives of their own choosing, but reassignments of incumbents are very difficult to make, principally because of the existing protection of 'rank' and system inflexibilities.

It is commonly observed by both career and noncareer executives that some career managers are functioning in less than an optimum manner, in some instances because they are in positions which make greater demands on them than they are capable of meeting, in other cases because they have no incentive to do their best. It is difficult to remove such managers. ", "9. Compensation of executives has been a serious problem in recent years with most senior executives frozen in pay for long periods, while their subordinates' pay, compensation for comparable positions in the private sector, and the cost of living have all risen dramatically.", "10. The present process for establishing and filling an executive position is time-consuming and inefficient.", "11.

As Alan \"Scotty\" Campbell, then chairman of the Civil Service Commission who had an integral role in establishing the SES, stated, \"we could see the dysfunctional effects of career/noncareer interface.\" The SES was intended to create a stronger and smoother link between political appointees and career civil servants, both during presidential transition periods and for the duration of administrations. As one former career executive reported, the pre-SES federal workforce often had poor relations between civil servants and political appointees because they had two different objectives: career employees were focused on technical programmatic details while political appointees were more focused on using executive and political skills to run the agency. This focus on different objectives sometimes led to a rift between the two groups. The SES was to be the solution, providing a shared resource to civil servants and political appointees alike and facilitating better relations between the two. ", "In addition to smoothing over the interface between civil servants and political leadership, the creation of the SES was intended to ease the transition period for new Presidents and their political appointees. Prior to the establishment of the SES, a centralized corps of senior leaders providing consistent leadership across administrations and across agencies did not exist. During a presidential transition, which could last for several months, the new administration might not provide direction for civil servants. The SES was intended, in part, to provide stronger senior leadership during presidential transitions so as to avoid this lull between administrations. The hope was that the SES would provide incoming presidents with a flexible, responsive set of managers tasked with ensuring agencies were running smoothly under the newly appointed leadership. This could help to ease the uncertainty that often accompanied presidential transitions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Creation of the SES", "paragraphs": ["The timing may have been an important element of President Carter's reformation of the civil service.

", "Upon the completion of the Personnel Management Project's exploration of the current civil service system, President Carter sent a message to Congress in March 1978 with a proposal to overhaul the civil service system. In the message, he stated that \"a critical factor in determining whether Federal programs succeed or fail is the ability of the senior managers who run them.\" Seven months later, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act and created a new Senior Executive Service, which matched very closely the reforms suggested by the Federal Personnel Management Project in December 1977 and then proposed by President Carter.

The Civil Service Reform Act created an incentive-based pay system for the SES that rewarded good performance with higher pay and monetary awards. In 2004, however, the pay system for senior executives was changed dramatically. There were two driving factors behind this change. The first was pay compression, and the second was the President's Management Agenda, which was instituted by the George W. Bush Administration. ", "The original SES pay system had six levels of basic pay, ES-1 through ES-6. The lowest rate was tied to the rate of the top level of the General Schedule (GS) scale, and the highest rate of pay was tied to the Executive Schedule (EX) scale. In other words, SES basic pay would fall between \"120 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-15\" and it could not exceed EX Level IV. Senior executives also received locality pay when appropriate. The combination of basic pay and locality pay, however, could not exceed the level of EX-III. Increases in pay would be determined by the President concurrent with annual adjustments to the GS pay scale. In addition, up to 50% of senior executives could be eligible for annual cash performance bonuses. The bonuses would be linked with the individuals' annual performance reviews, and they could be worth up to 20% of an employee's basic pay.", "Under the original pay system, however, salary compression became an increasing problem. Because the floor of the SES pay scale continued to climb gradually as GS-15 pay levels increased, SES pay increased over time. However, the top of the pay scale did not increase at the same rate as at the bottom of the scale. The result of increases in the minimum pay and the statutorily imposed caps was pay compression within the ranks of the SES. The differences between what SES members made at each pay level continually decreased, and in many cases, the top several pay levels actually received the same salary. Some possible results of pay compression may have included difficulties recruiting and retaining talented senior executives. ", "President George W. Bush introduced the President's Management Agenda in 2001 (PMA). The PMA revisited the managerial capabilities of the federal workforce, including the SES, with the aim of making government performance more results oriented. One concern for the PMA was that SES members were consistently rated at the highest level on their performance appraisals. On more than one occasion, the OPM Director reminded agency officials that these appraisals should be based on measurable results.

For agencies without a certified system, the cap on pay remained EX-I (currently $199,700 in 2012). ", "In his FY2004 budget request, President Bush proposed further changes to the pay structure. He proposed providing more financial incentives for senior executives by increasing the pay ceiling and eliminating the six-level pay structure, and encouraging agencies to determine pay for senior executives based upon their individual performance. In accordance with the President's budget request message on SES pay, Congress passed provisions in the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act that modified the SES pay system. These changes included (1) eliminating locality pay from the SES; (2) replacing the six pay levels with a single pay range; (3) increasing the cap on basic pay from EX-IV to EX-III; and (4) adding a higher cap on basic pay, EX-II, for agencies that have OPM-certified performance appraisals. ", "A central element of the pay-for-performance system encourages agencies to have an OPM-certified performance appraisal system. Under a certified appraisal system, the cap on basic pay is currently $179,700. Otherwise, the cap is $165,300. The purpose of this was to create stronger performance incentives. Many critics viewed the previous performance appraisal system for the SES as flawed, since most members of the SES received the highest possible rating. The new system encourages agencies to have meaningful distinctions among their performance ratings. ", " Table 2 presents the current basic pay levels for SES, based upon these statutory requirements, which are within the following ranges:", "The elimination of locality pay for senior executives was intended to foster greater performance incentives. Senior executives no longer receive an automatic increase in their basic pay based upon their geographic location; rather, they are encouraged to augment their pay through good performance. To provide these fiscal incentives, several types of pay increases and awards are available to senior executives. Automatic pay increases do not occur, but pay adjustments can occur on an annual basis to reward good performance or to maintain an individual's relative position within the SES pay range. Career executives with good performance ratings may be eligible for performance awards (one-time bonuses) that can range from 5% to 20% of their basic pay. All SES members, regardless of type of appointment, may be eligible for incentive awards for a suggestion, invention, or special act of service that improves the functioning of the federal government. ", "Additionally, a small group of career senior executives is awarded a Presidential Rank Award each year. Presidential Rank Awards have two categories: Distinguished Rank, which awards recipients 35% of their annual basic pay, and Meritorious Rank, which awards recipients 20% of their annual basic pay.

However, the changes created a system in which GS-14s and GS-15s, historically considered to be prime candidates for SES positions, may have little or no monetary incentive to move to the SES. As discussed above, the current basic pay for members of the SES starts at 120% of the GS-15 step 1 pay (currently $119,554). However, individuals at a GS-15 step 1 in the Washington, DC, area currently earn $123,758, including locality pay. Individuals who are at a GS-14 step 6 or higher also earn more than the minimum basic pay for SES members (a GS-14 step 6 base plus locality pay for Washington, DC, is $122,744). This could mean that senior executives in agencies may have employees serving under them who earn more money than the executives. ", "Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association, raised the point in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Management, Investigations, and Oversight in 2009 that most senior workers in the federal government are not primarily motivated by pay, and therefore some might argue that this pay overlap should not matter. However, as she states, along with the possibility of lower pay and lower retirement benefits, SES positions also have \"added responsibilities, added risk, and less time with families.\" Another possible disincentive for individuals to join the SES is that the SES performance bonuses do not count toward senior executives' retirement annuities. If performance awards could count toward an executive's \"high-three,\" she argued, the SES would become a more attractive career goal for federal workers.", "Another problem that senior executives have identified with the current pay system is a perceived disconnect between performance ratings and pay adjustments. According to a 2006 Senior Executives Association survey, many senior executives believed that changes in pay were based primarily on administrative decisions and budgetary constraints, not on their actual performance. In that same survey, 233 executives reported increased responsibilities since the new pay system was instituted in 2004, but 82% of those 233 executives received no salary increase to match their increased workload. ", "Critics have also suggested that SES pay is low compared to equivalent jobs in the private sector. The opportunity cost for members of the SES can be high if they have an opportunity to work in a senior management position in the private sector. Luring highly qualified candidates to serve in the public sector when they could be making a much higher salary in the private sector can be challenging, according to this view. In addition, the fact that the SES does not receive locality pay may also be a hindrance when it comes to attracting people to SES positions.

A recent report on the Senior Executive Service, for example, found that the government tends to be passive in its recruiting of senior executives.

Some say that agencies could benefit from actively developing and preparing their own GS-14s and GS-15s for SES positions so that when they choose to hire from within, the individuals would be more prepared for the SES. ", "Advocates for SES reform have argued that one way in which agencies could improve SES recruiting efforts would be to pay more attention to the talent pipeline within the government. By developing the skills of individuals who are likely to serve as future senior executives, agencies would be able to identify qualified individuals who they would like to bring on as senior executives. Federal agencies may have a Candidate Development Program (CDP; see section entitled \" Entering the SES: Career Appointments \" above). However, as some have pointed out, these programs have not developed as originally intended. As one scholar and former federal executive pointed out, a significant number of participants in the early years of the Federal CDP program were not selected for the SES. Technical experts were regularly selected over those who had undergone the CDP training, which reinforced a cultural bias within agencies toward individuals with specialized and technical expertise. ", "This bias toward technical expertise rather than leadership ability was also reinforced by the fact that when established, the SES consisted of \"supergrade\" individuals who already were specialists and did not necessarily have the leadership training and skills that the government requires for SES members. This was a result of the conversion of top-level GS positions into SES positions in 1979. As one scholar noted, \"the US civil service suddenly had several thousand senior executives who were specialists one day and, by definition, generalist executives the next.\" Due in part to the way in which the supergrade positions were converted into SES positions, the tendency toward specialists as executives has remained. ", "A related critique of the current hiring process is that agencies tend to focus on an applicant's technical skills, rather than leadership and management skills. Selecting a technical expert for an SES position may not fulfill the original vision of the SES. Although technical experts can provide specific knowledge of government programs, they may not have the vision or executive skills to \"move a program forward strategically,\" according to one report. Hiring technical experts over generalists with leadership skills might occur for several reasons: identifying technical skills is easier than identifying skills such as leadership capabilities; technical experts may serve agencies better in the short term; and failure to consider leadership capability during the hiring process.

Attrition of senior executives can cause several problems, including the loss of knowledge and/or skills; a deterioration in organizational loyalty among employees; and a vacancy in the agency that may take some time to fill. The SES has had some difficulty retaining talented individuals. In the first decade of its existence, it had a turnover rate of almost 10% annually. By March of 1983, over 40% of the senior executives who had converted in July 1979 left government service. Similar trends continued for the next three decades. ", "Although some sources have cited low pay as a reason that certain individuals may leave the SES, a recent study showed that few senior executives thought pay was a reason the government faced problems with retention of senior executives. Respondents noted that individuals who make a commitment to public service know what kind of salary they will be receiving. Those who would be likely to leave the SES because they are not getting the pay they want are unlikely to join in the first place. According to this argument, the bigger challenge with pay is for recruiting rather than retention. ", "According to several sources, \"onboard\" training for new senior executives is lacking, which might play a role in retention efforts. Ideally, successful onboard training would expedite the transition period for new senior executives, especially for those coming from outside government. A 2008 Partnership for Public Service and Booz Allen Hamilton report about onboarding argued that the private sector has shown that successful onboarding is crucial to improving retention, performance, engagement of employees, and shortens the length of time it takes for a new employee to become productive. The report suggested that the government could benefit from improving its onboarding programs, including those programs for executives.", "A successful onboarding program could also emphasize, for those individuals who are moving to an SES position from a GS-14 or GS-15, those skills which differentiate senior executives from the rest of the civil service. Such a program could encourage early development of the leadership skills in the potential senior executives that many critics have said are lacking. ", "Another area that critics have identified as needing improvement is career development and training, discussed more in the section below. Having greater development opportunities for senior executives could also help retention efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Career Development and Training", "paragraphs": ["The Civil Service Reform Act gave responsibility for the training of senior executives to OPM. OPM may delegate responsibility for training to agencies, but OPM is still responsible for establishing criteria, assisting with the implementation, and overseeing and enforcing adherence to the agency's criteria. ", "OPM offers a number of training opportunities for senior executives, including the Federal Executive Institute and three Management Development Centers that provide leadership training for government executives. OPM's training opportunities attempt to strengthen and reinforce the Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) that are required of all senior executives. In addition, OPM encourages agencies to establish training programs of their own and provides guidance on its website for agencies to do so. In March 2011, a representative from OPM testified before the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that OPM is working with the Federal Executive Institute to develop additional opportunities such as more frequent SES orientation programs and networking opportunities. ", "Although there are some training opportunities for senior executives through OPM, some critics say that OPM has largely delegated the responsibility to agencies, and that neither agencies nor OPM have prioritized training. As a result, senior executives are mostly responsible for finding their own training opportunities, and many feel that their professional development is not a priority in their agencies. This decentralized approach has led to variation in training opportunities among agencies. Providing training programs can be especially difficult for small agencies that may have small budgets. ", "A critique of the decentralized training structure is that it violates the spirit of the original SES vision. Government-wide training programs, in which executives could share experiences and learn from their colleagues in other agencies, have been inconsistent and infrequent since the SES was launched. Such training and development sessions would have been more aligned with the original intent of civil service reform, some critics have pointed out. Training opportunities tend to be agency-specific, reinforcing the SES's current agency-centric structure. ", "One study of the SES suggested that the government could take advantage of its own resources to provide additional training opportunities for SES members. For example, Presidential Rank Award recipients could be a training resource for development of potential or current senior executives. ", "Responses to a 2008 OPM survey of senior executives showed that many senior executives feel their own developmental opportunities could improve. Fifty-five percent of executives were satisfied with the developmental opportunities available to them. Over a third of the survey respondents (35%) felt that their developmental needs were not assessed. Only about 25% of agency executives said they had received some sort of formal executive coaching. These responses reinforce the suggestion of some that development of executives may not be a high priority for many agencies. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mobility of SES Members", "paragraphs": ["The SES was intended to be a government-wide, cohesive corps of individuals that encouraged mobility within and across government agencies. The thought was that SES members would gain experience and leadership skills from being mobile that they could apply across different government agencies and positions. Mobility would bring fresh perspective to agencies and would encourage the individuals to apply a broader skill set to an agency's needs, rather than allowing individuals to get too involved in technical details of agency programs. Moreover, senior executives would form cross-agency relationships that would enrich their skills that they could apply to their own position. ", "Mobility of senior executives, however, has never been fully realized. Few senior executives have worked outside their own agency. Various sources have cited several reasons for why senior executives are not mobile. Since the creation of the SES, job rotations seem to be widely perceived as punitive and a way for political leaders to get rid of unwanted personnel, rather than a tool for improving one's skill set. ", "Other barriers to mobility that have been cited include the way that OPM has delegated a great deal of responsibility over senior executives to individual agencies. The CSRA required OPM to serve as a centralized administrator for the new SES, and it was tasked with many responsibilities that it has largely delegated to agencies. Recruitment and assessment have largely been delegated to agencies, so OPM has more of a distant oversight role than a direct hand in managing the SES. However, to institute a successful job rotation system, a strong, centralized personnel structure must exist, some have argued.", "One scholar suggested that senior executives may be able to learn from the military model with regard to frequent job rotations. Through job rotations, senior leaders in the military are expected to yield a \"rich array of career development experiences.\" Job rotations have the potential to broaden understanding about what might make government more effective, because individuals would be exposed to and could learn from many different situations and contexts. Skills that could be obtained include adaptability, flexibility, leadership, planning, and a broader perspective on business functions.", "A recent report on the SES recommended that OPM, in collaboration with each agency, should review all existing SES positions and identify those that would truly benefit from a rotational component. Given existing challenges and the current government structure, they suggest that the idea of an entire SES corps that is mobile is no longer practical. There may be some SES positions within agencies that benefit from technical expertise, and agencies may prefer to keep those technical experts where they are. The report suggests separating those positions into \"Agency SES\" and \"National SES,\" while turning some SES positions into Senior Technical (ST) and Senior Level (SL) positions where appropriate. Members of the National Corps could establish mobility agreements with their agencies and institute developmental rotations administered by OPM. Those individuals designated as agency senior executives would not have the same rotational requirements. ", "A similar point was raised at a March 2009 hearing on the SES by Nancy Kichak, a hearing witness and Associate Director at OPM. She stated that some SES positions, such as Chief Information Officers and Chief Financial Officers, require technical agency expertise, and having mobile senior executives rotating in and out of those types of positions may not be appropriate.

The findings and statement of purpose of the Civil Service Reform Act asserted that the law would \"provide the people of the United States with a competent, honest, and productive Federal work force reflective of the Nation's diversity.\" However, the SES does not currently reflect the diversity of the United States, nor has it reached the level of diversity of the rest of the federal workforce. The current demographic profile of these three groups is presented in Table 3 .", "In a 2008 report on diversity in the SES, GAO stated that \"having a diverse SES corps, which generally represents the most experienced segment of the federal workforce, can be an organizational strength that can bring a wider variety of perspectives and approaches to bear on policy development and implementation, strategic planning, problem solving, and decision making.\" GAO showed that the diversity in the SES is similar to the diversity of GS-14s and GS-15s, which comprise what is often viewed as the SES development pool. The SES could benefit from an increase in diversity in the talent pool since a large number of senior executives are likely to retire in the next few years. According to GAO, this would improve the overall quality of the SES since \"racial, ethnic and gender diversity in the SES is an important component for the effective operation of the government.\"", "Some scholars of public bureaucracy have argued that having a diverse government workforce can increase the effectiveness of government, because individuals with diverse backgrounds might bring a different set of experiences and perspectives to their decisions in government. One scholar stated that an increasingly diverse public workforce can \"improve the way in which government operates and is perceived by the general citizenry.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM's Management of the SES", "paragraphs": ["Some scholars of public administration have suggested that a strong OPM is important to establishing and maintaining a successful SES. Two years after the initial implementation of the SES, Bernard Rosen, then a professor at American University and former executive director of the Civil Service Commission, wrote an article entitled \"Uncertainty in the Senior Executive Service.\" Rosen had been a career executive under five different administrations. He argued that OPM had a very important role to play in the SES, particularly in President Ronald Reagan's Administration, since it was the first new administration since the SES was instituted. He argued that the OPM director must serve as a \"catalyst\" between the President, his appointees, and the agencies. As established by the Civil Service Reform Act, OPM should be able to \"provide better guidance and monitoring without reverting to the tight controls exercised by the former Civil Service Commission. OPM can move from a very limited leadership role to a more active middle ground, and do so in healthy cooperation with the agencies\u2026. it would enhance the possibility for realizing the high promise of the SES\u2014significant improvement in government operations.\"", "Almost three decades later, the Partnership for Public Service and Booz Allen Hamilton issued a study arguing that the lack of OPM efforts to establish a mobile SES has resulted in a highly immobile SES. The Civil Service Reform Act created OPM and gave it many responsibilities, including the authority to grant sabbaticals to senior executives and encourage mobility; establish a qualifications review board to certify qualifications of candidates for SES positions; establish programs for the continual development of SES members or require agencies to establish such programs; and perform other general administrative functions. OPM has delegated a number of these responsibilities to agencies, including training and career development, performance evaluation, and recruiting efforts. Having a more centralized effort for many of these issues could increase the overall strength and effectiveness of the SES. However, some also may suggest that giving more control over senior executives to agencies allows agencies more flexibility in their own operations.

In the memo, leaders from OMB and OPM listed proposals to (1) improve SES professional development programs; (2) streamline burdensome administrative processes; (3) strengthen personnel performance management; and (4) expand and diversify executive talent pipelines.
