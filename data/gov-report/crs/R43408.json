While drought planning and preparedness are largely individual, business, local, and state responsibilities, some federal assistance is available to mitigate drought impacts. While much of the federal assistance is targeted at mitigating impacts on the agricultural economy, other federal programs are authorized to provide non-agricultural water assistance. Interest in these non-agricultural programs often increases as communities, households, and businesses experience shrinking and less reliable water supplies. Authorized federal assistance is spread across a variety of agencies, and each has limitations on what activities and entities are eligible and the funding that is available.", "Rural Utilities Service (RUS): The U.S. Department of Agriculture's RUS provides grants and loans for rural water systems in communities with less than 10,000 inhabitants; its programs are for domestic water service, not water for agricultural purposes. Some of the programs are tailored to emergency situations, while others may prioritize loans and grants for communities and households facing drought-related declines in water quantity or quality. As of mid-February 2014, around $1.3 billion in loans and $370 million in grants are available for rural community water and waste systems. While these funds are provided for assisting with rural water systems broadly, systems affected by drought may receive priority. Also for FY2014, the RUS Household Water Well System Grants had received $1 million in appropriations, and the Administration had reprogrammed to the RUS Emergency Community and Water Assistance Grants program $3 million for California's rural communities.", "Bureau of Reclamation: Reclamation's authorities to assist with emergency water supplies and conservation stem primarily from the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief (RSEDR) Program. RSEDR consists of various authorities, including direct Reclamation water assistance to reduce drought losses, water contract authority, technical assistance, drought planning grants, and actions to facilitate water purchases and transfers. Reclamation can provide much of this assistance to water users (including municipalities and water districts), private entities, tribes, and states. Most of the RSEDR program's authority is limited to the 17 western states and Hawaii. RSEDR emergency actions often are provided by Reclamation at 100% federal expense, although some nonfederal reimbursement is authorized. These emergency actions are available to communities and water providers, regardless of their size, but are prioritized by need and congressional direction. As of mid-February 2014, RSEDR funding was $0.5 million for FY2014.", "Army Corps of Engineers (USACE): The Corps has authority to assist emergency water supplies and their transport when state resources are exceeded and a public health threat is imminent.

The agency also has authority to contract for provision of limited quantities of water (if available) from its reservoirs for municipal and industrial purposes.", "Role of States and Other Federal Authorities. If a drought's effects overwhelm state or local resources, the President, at the request of a governor or tribal governing body, is authorized under the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) to issue major disaster or emergency declarations resulting in federal aid to affected parties.

Congress has created various programs to assist with non-agricultural water supplies for communities, households, and fish and wildlife habitat. These programs are spread across the jurisdictions of multiple agencies and congressional committees and vary widely in their use and funding.

A declaration of an agricultural disaster area by the Secretary of Agriculture triggers the availability of multiple agricultural assistance programs, most notably the programs of the Farm Services Agency (FSA), and may trigger availability of other federal programs, such as the Economic Injury Disaster Loans of the Small Business Administration (SBA). Most of these programs are focused on mitigating the economic impacts of drought on agriculture or water-dependent small businesses.

The infrequency of presidential domestic drought declarations increases the uncertainty about the circumstances under which such a declaration is likely to be made. Therefore, the emergency assistance typically available to mitigate and respond to the impacts of drought on non-agricultural water supplies is primarily through the USDA's Rural Utilities Service, the Bureau of Reclamation's Emergency Drought Relief Program, and in limited circumstances the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers emergency water authorities.

Federal dams, particularly in the West, were constructed in part to provide multi-year storage to help with variations in seasonal and annual precipitation. Sustained hydrological drought nonetheless affects operations of federally managed reservoirs, dams, locks, hydroelectric facilities, and other components of the nation's water infrastructure. The extent to which operational changes are authorized and can be implemented to reduce the water supply impacts of drought often is limited by the federal infrastructure's role in meeting multiple project purposes and satisfying legal requirements.", "Recent legislation has expanded Reclamation's authority for its drought-related operations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ) expanded the Secretary of the Interior's authority to participate in nonfederal groundwater banking in California, and waived certain reporting provisions for transfer of irrigation water among selected federal water contractors, while also directing Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife Service to expedite \"programmatic environmental compliance\" to facilitate Central Valley Project (CA) water transfers.

An outgrowth of that experience was the creation in November 2013 of the National Drought Resilience Partnership to align federal drought policies across the government and to facilitate access to drought assistance and information sharing across all levels of government.

Early actions may help avoid a non-agricultural water supply emergency resulting from drought. These actions can range from rehabilitating wells to improve their reliability, to reducing leaks in conveyance and distribution systems, implementing water rationing, and other water conservation measures. Consequently, a recurrent policy issue is how to effectively and efficiently mitigate drought's water supply impacts across the local, state, and federal agencies. How well current programs help to prevent drought conditions from becoming drought emergencies and drought disasters is one policy question.
