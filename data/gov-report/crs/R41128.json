Private health insurance provisions that take effect prior to full implementation in 2014 include ending lifetime and unreasonable annual limits on benefits, prohibiting rescissions of health insurance policies, requiring coverage of preventive services and immunizations, extending dependent coverage up to the age of 26, capping insurance companies' non-medical administrative expenditures, guaranteeing coverage for preexisting health conditions for enrollees under the age of 19, and providing assistance for those who are uninsured because of a preexisting condition. Many of the other provisions will be fully implemented in 2014, when most individuals, large employers, and health plans are to meet certain coverage requirements. ACA will restructure the private health insurance market, particularly for individuals purchasing coverage on their own (who may qualify for premium credits) and small businesses. The new law will also expand Medicaid coverage to families with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) up to 133% of the federal poverty level.", "To pay for expanded health insurance coverage, there are a number of health-related revenue provisions in ACA. These include taxes and fees on firms in the health care sector and other employers as well as additional taxes on upper-income individuals.

These revenues include excise taxes and limitations on employer deductions that would impact health insurers, health plan sponsors, and health plan administrators. As shown in Table 1 , these employer-related revenue provisions represent about 37% of total health-related revenues in ACA. Over half of these revenues (54%) will be paid by high income taxpayers through higher Medicare payroll taxes and additional taxes on unearned income.

Some non-profit insurers are exempt from federal income taxes. Also, under current law, employees are not taxed on the value of health insurance coverage provided by employers. Because the tax-exclusion on employer contributions to health insurance reduces the after-tax cost of insurance in ways that are not transparent, it may result in people with insurance obtaining more coverage than they would otherwise. Because the exclusion is not explicitly capped or limited, it does little to restrict the generosity of the insurance or any annual premium increases.", "To indirectly limit the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance coverage, ACA will impose a 40% excise tax on health insurers and health plan administrators for coverage that exceeds certain thresholds in 2018. The JCT and the CBO have included in their revenue projections an assumption that this tax will prompt employers to reduce the generosity of their health insurance coverage and thus health insurance premiums would increase taxable wages to compensate for reduction in health care benefits. They assume this will increase revenues by $32 billion between 2010 and 2019.", "Under this provision, effective in 2018, the thresholds will be $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, and will be indexed by growth in the CPI-U plus 1% in subsequent years. Coverage for individuals who are retired and ages 55 to 64, and workers engaged in high-risk professions, will be subject to higher thresholds ($11,850 single and $30,950 families). Also, employees in multi-employer (union) plans will only be subject to the family thresholds. Finally, there is also a provision to allow employers to adjust the cost of health insurance coverage (when compared with the thresholds) if the demographics of their workforce in terms of age and gender are different from that of a national risk pool.", "Health insurance coverage subject to the 40% excise tax in ACA will be broadly defined to include not only the employer and employee premium payments for health insurance coverage (including self-insured plans), but also premiums paid by the employee and the employer for dental and vision coverage (if this supplemental coverage is not part of a stand-alone package). In addition, tax-advantaged health-related accounts such as flexible spending accounts (FSAs), health savings accounts (HSAs), health reimbursement accounts (HRAs) and medical savings accounts (MSAs) are also specified as health insurance coverage and included in the threshold calculation. For these tax-advantaged accounts, the plan administrator (which is often the employer) will be subject to the excise tax. The excise tax will be levied on each of these components (i.e., health insurance, dental and vision, FSAs) based on their share of the total. This share will then be applied to the amount of the total contribution that exceeds the applicable threshold to determine the excise tax imposed on each component.", "These thresholds will be further adjusted based on premium growth of the standard health insurance option under the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP). If between 2010 and 2018 the cost of that plan rises more than 55% (or about 7% a year), the thresholds for the excise tax will be adjusted upward.", "It is difficult to determine how many insured individuals would be affected by the tax on high-cost plans because of uncertainty between 2010 and the effective date of 2018 regarding (1)\u00a0employers' response to health care reform implementation in 2014, (2) changes to plan designs, and (3) private sector premium growth relative to FEHBP premiums. Using 2008 data (adjusted to 2010 levels), less than 7% of insured individuals would have been affected by these provisions if they were implemented in 2008. In 2019 and 2020, the thresholds will be adjusted upward by an index for general inflation (the Consumer Price Index (CPI)) plus 1% and CPI after 2020. To the extent that health care inflation continues to significantly exceed general inflation in subsequent years, a increasing share of the insured population could be affected by this provision after 2020.", "ACA will also impose additional reporting requirements on employers providing health insurance coverage.

The share of net premiums written subject to the fee will vary by the size of net premiums of an insurer. For example, there will be no fee on the first $25 million of net premiums of covered entities. For net premiums greater than $25 million and less than $50 million, 50% will be taken into account, and 100% of net premiums written in excess of $50 million will be subject to the fee. The fee will not apply to self-insured plans and federal, state, or other government entities. There are also additional provisions for tax-exempt insurance providers.

Furthermore, proceeds from the sale of a principal residence are still subject to a partial exclusion from tax under current law.

There is also a special provision for the application of the tax to S-Corporations who sell their businesses.", "The share of individuals subject to this tax will depend on the percent of tax filers with modified adjusted gross income above the thresholds reported above. Initially, a small percentage of tax filers are expected to be affected by these thresholds. Although data on the income distribution of tax filers based on MAGI are not publicly available, data are available for adjusted gross income (AGI).

While IRS does not publish data specifically for this level, Table 3 does show that about 8% of married filers have AGI over $200,000. The share affected by the $250,000 limit would thus be lower than these percentages. Over time, however, since the thresholds are not indexed to inflation, a larger number of individuals are expected to be affected in the future.

Health FSAs are employer-established benefit plans that reimburse employees for specified health care expenses (e.g., deductibles, co-payments, and non-covered expenses) as they are incurred on a pre-tax basis. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) survey, 39% of all workers in 2010 had access to a health care flexible spending account. Each employer may set their limits on FSA contributions, with most employers setting the maximum contribution limit to $5,000. Beginning in 2013, ACA will limit the amount of annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per account and index for general inflation in subsequent years. Given that the average annual contribution was $1,426 in 2009, this provision will not likely affect the average contributor to FSAs. However, the maximum limitation will impact those who have high out-of-pocket expenses. According to JCT, this provision is projected to increase revenues by $13 billion over 10 years (see Table 1 ).", "HSAs are also tax-advantaged accounts that allow individuals to fund unreimbursed medical expenses (deductibles, copayments, and services not covered by insurance) on a pre-tax basis. Eligible individuals can establish and fund accounts when they have a qualifying high deductible health plan and no other health plan (with some exceptions). Unlike FSAs, HSAs may be rolled over and the funds accumulated over time. Distributions from an HSA that are used for qualified medical expenses are not included in taxable income. Distributions that are not used for qualified medical expenses are taxable as ordinary income and, under current law, an additional 10% penalty tax is imposed for those under the age of 65. ACA will raised this penalty on non-qualified distributions from 10% to 20% of the disbursed amount effective in 2011. ", "Data are not available on the share of individuals taking HSA distributions for non-qualified expenses. However, account balances overall do increase significantly with the length of time the HSA is held. For example, in 2010, HSA balances for accounts held more than five years were $2,231 compared with $962 for those held for six months to one year. This would mean that, on average, the withdrawal penalty for non-qualified distributions for someone who held the account for more than five years would increase from $223 to $446 under ACA. According to the JCT, this provision will raise $1.3 billion over 10 years (see Table 1 ). While this does not raise a significant amount of revenue, it may discourage individuals from using the funds for non-qualified medical expenses and instead accumulate the funds for use in the future.", "Effective in 2011, ACA also modifies the definition of qualified medical expenses. Under current law prior to ACA, qualified medical expenses for FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs could include over-the-counter medications. ACA restricts this practice and excludes over-the-counter medications (except those prescribed by a physician) as a qualified medical expense.

ACA will increase the threshold to 10% of AGI for taxpayers who are under the age of 65 beginning in 2013, this effectively further limits the amount of medical expenses that can be deducted. Taxpayers over the age of 65 will be temporarily excluded from this provision and still be subject to the 7.5% limit from 2013 through 2016.", "Since the share of tax filers using the expense varies widely by age and income, this provision will adversely impact older households and those with lower incomes. While about 7% of all tax filers in 2008 (the most recent year for which published data are available) reported a deduction for medical expenses, 21% of tax filers aged 65 and older took the medical expense deduction (see Table 4 ) and their deduction is 43% higher than the overall average for all tax filers.
