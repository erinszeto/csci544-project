The first off-shore jurisdiction to request exception from the FLSA was Puerto Rico, which, in 1940, along with the Virgin Islands, was given an exception under the act. Special industry committees were appointed to visit the Caribbean islands and to recommend minimum wage rates consistent with the insular economies.", "In the wake of World War II, new attention was focused upon the Pacific islands. American Samoa, basically, had no industry other than harvesting of copra, the dried meat of the coconut, and an economy very different from the mainland. In the early 1950s, the Department of the Interior contracted with the Van Camp Sea Food Company to move onto the island and develop a fish processing plant. However, the FLSA minimum wage was regarded as too high to be competitive and, in 1956, Van Camp appealed to Congress to extend the Puerto Rican special industry committee (SIC) model to American Samoa. Thereafter, the Secretary of Labor would review economic conditions and establish minimum rates.", "The SICs were admonished to reach \"as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment\" the American standard under the FLSA. While the rates established by the committees were lower than those prevailing on the mainland, the device was regarded as temporary. During the 1980s and 1990s, special treatment of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was phased out, and those islands came fully under the FLSA. Of the three jurisdictions, only American Samoa remained under the SIC structure.", "Fish processing has become Samoa's primary private-sector industry. In early 2007, the minimum wage for the industry was $3.26 per hour: the federal minimum wage was $5.15 per hour. However, in late May 2007, Congress adopted H.R. 2206 (P.L. 110-28) which, through a series of step increases over several years, would raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour. At the same time, the SIC for American Samoa was abolished and the insular minimum wage was raised (through a more prolonged series of step increases) until the federal minimum level, whatever that may ultimately become, might be reached.", "At least since the 1950s, the companies involved in fish processing have suggested that, were the minimum wage to be raised to the national rate, they might consider leaving the island and operating out of a country where wage rates were more favorable. Now, with the new wage rate for American Samoa in effect, what will be the reaction of the tuna canning companies? Will they improve technology to raise labor productivity, change the type of production done in Samoa, absorb the new rates\u2014or migrate? And, if they were to migrate, what alternative employment might be available for the people of American Samoa?", "This report will be updated as warranted."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Samoan archipelago, a series of sparsely populated islands in the south Pacific, is located about 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii.

The population of the American group, although rising rapidly, is estimated to be about 60,000.", "Contacts between the Samoan islands and the United States developed late in the 19 th century, but they were infrequent. A coaling station was opened at Pago Pago, but only in the wake of the Spanish-American War (1898) did the American presence become permanent. In 1900, President William McKinley \"directed the Navy to assume responsibility for Eastern (thereafter, American) Samoa.\" His directive remained in effect until 1951, when the naval station was closed and jurisdiction was transferred to the U.S. Department of the Interior. During the middle 1950s, an insular constitutional government was developed; in 1960, a constitution was formally approved.", "The islands are mountainous, the climate tropical. There is little land suitable for commercial agriculture. Fruits and vegetables, along with various root crops, are grown locally and consumed largely by the families of the growers. More diverse products are imported. The harbor at Pago Pago provided, during earlier periods, a naval base, but now it appears to be especially notable as a tuna port. Although some tourism has developed over the years, the relative isolation of American Samoa has rendered the islands a somewhat exotic destination.", "Fish processing is Samoa's single primary private-sector industry. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the insular minimum wage has been fixed by the Secretary of Labor through a Special Industry Committee (SIC). In early 2007, the rate for the tuna canneries was $3.26 per hour; the federal rate, $5.15 per hour. Then, in late May, Congress adopted a new minimum wage standard: to escalate to $7.25 per hour over several years. At the same time, the SIC system was abolished and the insular rate was raised, though in more extended steps, until it might coincide with the federal rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The FLSA and Insular Coverage", "paragraphs": ["In 1938, Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)\u2014a measure designed to provide minimum wages and overtime pay, to limit child labor, and to restrict industrial homework.

In response to industry complaints, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were exempted from the full force of the act (1940), being placed under a special industry committee (SIC) structure. Thus, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were set aside for special treatment under the FLSA\u2014a process that would continue, in part, for the next 50 years.", "Under Section 8 of the original enactment, the Department of Labor (DOL) was required, \"from time to time,\" to convene an industry committee for each industry covered under the act and, through the committee, to \"recommend\" a rate (or rates) of wages that might be higher than those established by the act.

It involved application of the FLSA to employees of American contractors building a military facility for the United States in Bermuda (part of Great Britain). In its decision, inter alia , the Court identified a \"possession\" covered under the act as including \"Puerto Rico, Guam, the guano islands, Samoa and the Virgin Islands.\" Even in dissent, Justice Jackson stated that a U.S. facility in Bermuda was of a character different from that of \"our possessions\" as specified by the Court's majority\u2014and, thus, covered by the act.", "In 1953, development of a tuna canning operation commenced in American Samoa, an industry which quickly became the island's primary private-sector employer.

It is on a trial basis,\" he suggested. \"In the first 12 months of our experiment, it has been found that the American Samoans are adaptable to catching, cleaning, and processing fish and seafood, but it takes 3 to 5 people to do and perform what one American laborer or worker in the States can do.\" If federal wage/hour standards continue to apply in Samoa, \"... there will be no incentive for American concerns to move in and build up the island.\"", "Further, Orme Lewis, Assistant Secretary of the Interior (DOI) wrote suggesting \"the need for special consideration\" for American Samoa. He explained to chairman Barden that Samoans \"have clung to their ancient ways of life and their traditional forms of economic and social organization.\" Thus, \"...any justification for protective labor legislation in American Samoa should be cast in entirely different terms.\" Lewis urged that the Secretary of Labor be allowed to \"establish minimum wages for workers in American Samoa\" as he may find that \"economic conditions warrant.\"", "C. S. Thomas, Secretary of the Navy, wrote to House Speaker Sam Rayburn to urge amendment of the FLSA to include a new provision for off-shore jurisdictions. Thomas reviewed the Vermilya-Brown decision and the likely impact if \"...wage payments on the part of contractors performing work for the Department of Defense [were] to be made at higher wage scales than those generally prevailing in the area.\" These wages, Thomas stated, \"would obviously distort the local economy and, in some instances, objections have been received from foreign governments.\" Thomas advised the Speaker: \"In addition, such payment would result in higher costs to the United States.\" But, Representative Barden decided not to act \"at this time.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 1956 FLSA Amendments in the House", "paragraphs": ["It was with Vermilya-Brown in mind that representatives of Van Camp Sea Foods appeared before the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, May 1956, seeking FLSA amendment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Industry's Perspective", "paragraphs": ["William Moore spoke for the company. In 1952, DOI had circulated an invitation to bid on an unused facility at Pago Pago. Moore went out to the islands and presented a \"discouraging\" report, noting that the supply of fish was not apparent and that the local refrigeration plant (government owned) was \"in rather poor repair.\" Further, Moore stated: \"We were aware, or soon learned during our survey, that the wage-and-hour laws applied to American Samoa and it was very unlikely, although we had not gotten into any operation at that time, whether or not our company could pay the minimum wages as required in the United States.\"", "Nonetheless, Van Camp bid on the operation and was awarded \"a 5-year lease with the provision that the first year would be an experimental period.\" Under the lease signed with the government of American Samoa, the firm agreed \"... to provide for improvement of the economy of American Samoa by developing the skills relating to fishing and fish processing among the Samoans, by providing local income through wages, and by insuring a local supply of raw, frozen, and processed fish.\"", "Moore explained that, though the company was operating at a loss, the loss was gradually diminishing and that the company was \"...the only industry that has come into the island from the outside.\"", "In 1956, the company had about 300 employees\u2014reportedly a mixture of British and American Samoan. Their productivity, it was explained, was somewhat less than cannery workers on the mainland. \"Climatic conditions are not particularly conducive to energy and activities.\" The temperature runs about 70 to 90 degrees throughout the year\u2014but there is high humidity: upward of 80%. In terms of turnover, Moore stated, \"... I am quite sure that the changeover in personnel there is less than it is stateside.\" He added: \"Most of our employees are women.\"", "Moore then turned to the wage/hour law, stating that the cannery paid \"from 27 cents an hour to $1 an hour, which is only paid 1 employee.\" Representative James Roosevelt (D-CA) then suggested: \"You come before this committee to establish the fact that you are having difficulty making any profit, and that this [payment of not less than the minimum wage] would seriously impair your profit picture or your chances of making a profit....\" The witness, Roosevelt stated, comes as something of \"a special pleader\" for his company. \"Therefore, it seems to me incumbent that you show us what effect it would have, in some relation to your cost of operation, or what it would do to you if you had to pay, let us say, 75 cents an hour, or $1 an hour, or whatever the wage law would require.\"", "Roosevelt then turned to another issue: What would happen to regular U.S. workers in canning factories on the West Coast were the wage/hour statute modified for American Samoa? Moore responded that, from January 1954 through January 1956, \"the total production was 3 \u00bd percent of the total production of Van Camp's stateside plants for the same period.\" Roosevelt was not entirely satisfied.", "Mr. ROOSEVELT. (...) What I am trying to get at is that I want to make awfully sure that I understand from you that this is not going to be a substantial part of your operation, the plans of your company and you and everybody else are such that they are not aimed at making this a substantial part of your production.", "Mr. MOORE. That is true, it is not going to be a substantial part of our operations.", "Moore stated: \"There may be some advantages gained on the one hand, but these advantages are definitely offset by additional expenses that we do not normally have stateside.\" Moore pointed to costs for the \"the transportation of cans and cartons, and oil, and salt, and labels, and everything that goes into the product, and everything has to be transported to Samoa.\" As for wages, Moore observed, \"we have a plan in effect now\"\u2014a 2 cent an hour raise annually\u2014\"that will increase those wages....\"", "Roosevelt further questioned Moore on his statement that closing the cannery would have a deleterious effect on the general economy of the island and would deter other firms from entering insular commerce. Might that be a threat, he reasoned? \"By implication,\" he suggested, \"that means to me that if you cannot get this relief that you would feel that it would be impossible for you to continue the operation....\" Representative Roosevelt stated:", "In other words, what you have in essence said is that this is important to the economy there, and which I believe it is, and on the other hand, I have to be shown that without this relief it would not be possible for you to operate. ... I for one, would want\u2014and I think the committee would want\u2014some information to back up the statement that you would not consider this possible of continuation unless the relief which you seek is granted.", "Moore queried: \"Are you asking that we give you a statement that says that unless we get this we will not continue?\" Roosevelt suggested that the interpretation had been correct, to which Moore answered:", "Mr. MOORE. It would put our costs out of line.", "Mr. ROOSEVELT.

The bill adds: \"The Secretary of Labor shall make the determinations required ... each year at least 60 days before the scheduled increase in the minimum wage\" and publish such determinations in the Federal Register .", "H.R. 5154 has been referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. No action has been reported."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Summary", "paragraphs": ["Throughout most of the United States, the minimum wage is a floor\u2014the lowest wage that can legally be paid to covered workers. In American Samoa, the minimum wage tends to represent both a floor and a ceiling\u2014though some rates do go up a few cents beyond the minimum. It appears that most fish processing workers in Samoa are paid at or near the minimum wage.", "Through now fifty years (1956-2007), American Samoa had been under the Special Industry Committee structure. During the early years, that option included Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. However, during the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands graduated to a full minimum wage leaving only American Samoa under the SIC umbrella. Where the two Caribbean territories have special characteristics that have allowed for the gradual elevation to a full minimum wage, American Samoa is in a somewhat different position. Samoa evidences no serious or sustained movement into an industrial world with a diversified economy.", "American Samoa is isolated: 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii. The population, though modest by mainland standards, has been expanding: perhaps, now, to about 60,000 or a little above. Distances render major tourism unlikely. There may be some market for handicrafts, but hardly enough to sustain even native/resident workers under current marketing arrangements. In spite of a relatively high level of Samoan unemployment (somewhere in the teens during recent years), workers often arrive from Western Samoa (a former British colony, now independent) to engage in fish canning and to replace those workers who migrate to the States. There would seem to be little interest in trade unionization and, it appears, the territory offers little reward for national labor federations.", "In the early 1950s, the Department of the Interior sought a tenant for a vacant fish processing plant at Pago Pago. The search seems to have been difficult\u2014but Van Camp Sea Foods took up the challenge. Soon, the firm was confronted with payment of a federal minimum wage. In order to sustain its insular existence, Van Camp sought two concessions from the Congress. First, the minimum wage for the island should be overturned, placing responsibility in the hands of a special industry committee under the Secretary of Labor (as had been done for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands). Second , it sought immunity from past underpayment of the minimum wage in Samoa. In each case, Congress concurred.", "Gradually, the tuna industry has come to dominate the island's private sector as the primary employer. For workers in the canneries, there would seem little option but to take jobs at whatever wages the companies chose to pay (assuming that the SIC and the Congress would agree). A second option, less desirable by insular standards, would have been to migrate to the States or elsewhere.", "With the first dispatch of a SIC to the islands in 1957, the native economy was assessed and a minimum wage was assigned\u2014to be updated every year or two. At first, cannery workers were to be paid 38 cents an hour. Petroleum workers earned 45 cents an hour; shipping, 40 cents; and miscellaneous workers, 35 cents. The upward movement was slow until, in 1986, SIC No. 17 determined that the federal minimum wage ($3.35 per hour) could be instituted without endangering employment. However, under pressure from the canneries and the insular government, the judgment of SIC No. 17 was overturned and Congress urged reestablishment of a lower rate.", "What some may have seen as a further setback occurred in 1990 when Congress enacted legislation reducing the level of evidence required in order for an employer to affirm his or her inability to meet a minimum wage payroll. Further, in 1992, legislation was introduced that would have increased the insular minimum, over time, to the full federal minimum rate. But, with industry in full opposition, the bill was not adopted. Since that time, little new has developed. In 2001, SIC No. 24 visited the islands and raised the wage for fish cannery workers from $3.20 to $3.26. No further increases in that category of work, it seems, have been instituted, though Committees were dispatched in 2003 and 2005 and would have met in 2007. Other rates of pay for insular workers have remained similarly low.", "In 1992, John R. Fraser of DOL explained that there is \"concern that the industry [tuna] might respond to a large increase [in the minimum wage] by shifting production to lower-cost areas\" and, for that reason, \"the department opposed\" legislation to provide equality with the general federal rate. Robert W. Hetzler of StarKist was more blunt. Were the tuna industry to disappear, \"the entire Samoan economy will collapse, resulting in massive social welfare costs to the government of American Samoa and the United States.\" There is, he stated, \"simply no replacement industry\" and \"...no way to recover the cost increases in the market-place.\"", "That rationale, however justified by insular economic conditions, may not satisfy the workers in tuna and in other industries. \"[M]y district,\" observed Delegate Faleomavaega during hearings in 1992, \"is the only jurisdiction where the American flag flies and Federal minimum wage law applies, yet our people ... are told they must be satisfied with the substandard wages set by the Department of Labor's industry committees.\"", "On May 15, 2007, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao announced appointment of a new Special Industry Committee to meet in Pago Pago in mid-June. But, the work of the committee was interrupted by congressional action. In late May 2007, Congress adopted (and the President signed) the \"U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act\" ( H.R. 2206 , P.L. 110-28 ). Under the act, the SIC system was abolished and a new insular minimum wage was mandated\u2014to be raised each year in fifty-cent increments until the new federal minimum rate, however specified, might be reached."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}]}}
