Regardless, specialized criminal networks smuggle items such as narcotics, counterfeit goods, stolen goods, and bulk cash, as well as humans, around the world and into the United States. They have hidden their contraband within the growing volume of legitimate global trade. Prior to the global recession, between 1995 and 2008 the volume of global containerized traffic tripled. Drug traffickers move large loads of cocaine, eventually destined for U.S. markets, from South America to Mexico via containerized shipping. International counterfeiters use containers to smuggle their fake goods into the United States.

Although it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine how deeply immersed organized criminals are in this activity, at least one study has suggested serious involvement. Further, in a recent speech before the International Intellectual Property Summit, Attorney General Holder reinforced the need for the international law enforcement community to combat \"the international networks of organized criminals now seeking to profit from IP [intellectual property] crimes.\" In areas such as film piracy, counterfeiting does not necessarily involve high entry costs or large legal penalties when compared to more conventional criminal activity such as drug trafficking. It is also potentially very lucrative. With little infrastructure\u2014a high-speed Internet connection, scanner, and copier and off-the-shelf software\u2014criminals around the globe can easily imitate the branding and packaging that accompanies products, let alone copy the products themselves. Counterfeiting and pirating goods involves the violation of intellectual property rights (IPR), essential to creative and high-tech industries particularly reliant on copyrights, trademarks, and patents to protect innovation. Counterfeiting and piracy potentially harm legitimate businesses and consumers, sapping profits and brand value and flooding markets with inferior and even dangerous products masquerading as legitimate goods. Aside from enforcement outlays, the activity also costs governments tax revenue and may slow economic growth by driving down incentives to innovate. ", "In FY2011, the domestic value of IPR-related law enforcement seizures of contraband in the United States was $178.9 million, a 5% drop from the previous year. Federal officials attributed the decline to \"a shift toward using international mail, express courier and consolidated shipping services to import counterfeit and pirated goods.\" Products originating in China\u2014both Mainland China and Hong Kong\u2014accounted for 80% of these IPR seizures.

Although international automobile theft has existed almost as long as cars have been around, the integration of worldwide markets and expansion of international shipping have greatly impacted it by facilitating international transport of stolen automobiles. Assessing the level of such activity is very difficult since few metrics for it exist. Regardless, today's international automobile theft rings benefit from the high levels of cargo container traffic ushered in by globalization. These groups profit by stealing vehicles in the United States and shipping them abroad, where they are sold. Such illicit operations react to global demand for luxury vehicles, and in some instances are extremely responsive to market forces. They trawl large U.S. metropolitan areas that have assortments of vehicles and rely on rail or port facilities to move stolen vehicles abroad. ", "In 2011, the Department of Justice (DOJ) brought a civil suit against a money laundering network with ties to Mexican drug traffickers and the terrorist group Hezbollah. The scheme reportedly involved used auto sales in the United States. The December 2011 suit targeted the Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) and two Lebanese exchange houses\u2014the Hassan Ayash Exchange Co. and Ellissa Holding\u2014regarding more than $300 million that was allegedly part of a money laundering operation. DOJ also asserts that the money laundering network's U.S. operations included about 30 U.S. automobile buyers and a shipping firm. In essence, the network reportedly comingled criminal proceeds held by LCB and the two exchange houses with other monies and transferred these funds to U.S. automobile buyers. The cash transfers supposedly paid for used car purchases in the United States. According to DOJ, the cars were then shipped to and sold in West Africa, and some of the profits returned to Hezbollah via LCB accounts and the exchange houses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Smuggling and Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["Criminal organizations are taking advantage of an unprecedented era of international migration, including illegal migration to the United States. However, since 2007 illegal immigration to the United States has declined. This may be attributable, in part, to dwindling job opportunities resulting from the global recession and increased immigration enforcement activity along the U.S. Southwest border. Nonetheless, criminal organizations continue to capitalize on the desire of unauthorized immigrants to enter the United States. Networks of human smugglers and others\u2014including Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) that have broadened their money-generating activities to include human and weapon smuggling, counterfeiting, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion\u2014bring unauthorized immigrants across the border and into the United States. In one well-known case, Cheng Chui Ping\u2014also known as \"Sister Ping\"\u2014sentenced in March 2006, had led an international human smuggling ring that was responsible for smuggling Chinese villagers to the United States between the early 1980s and April 2000. In a 2006 press release, DOJ described her as \"one of the first, and ultimately most successful, alien smugglers of all time.\" At the start, Ping's smuggling ring brought small numbers of villagers to the United States via aircraft, using fake immigration documents. She turned from exclusive reliance on air transit to include the use of maritime shipping as her operation matured. This way, Ping likely exploited increasing volumes of international seaborne cargo engendered by globalization to mask her illegal movement of human beings. She eventually developed the capability to smuggle hundreds of victims at a time via cargo ships, where the villagers could be stashed below the deck until they reached their U.S. destination and eventually paid her exorbitant smuggling fees. Criminals who smuggle individuals into the United States may also turn the smuggling into a trafficking situation by increasing the immigrants' debts owed once they have been smuggled to the United States. The smugglers/traffickers may then require their victims to work for a period of time to pay off the debts. ", "Organized crime exploits individuals through both labor and sex trafficking. In 2006, the FBI reported that human trafficking generates about $9.5 billion for organized crime annually. However, as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted, estimates regarding the global scale of human trafficking are questionable; as such, any estimates regarding the proceeds generated through these crimes may not be representative of their true scope. These criminal organizations target both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals who are drawn to visions of better lives in the United States. ", "International borders often play a central role in the dynamics involved in forced labor and sex trafficking. In many instances, victims likely perceive borders and border security regimens as insurmountable barriers via legitimate means, requiring them to turn to illicit methods of transit offered by traffickers. Organized criminals prey on victims' powerful desires to live or work in other countries. While the following two cases may not have been prosecuted by DOJ as traditional \"organized crime,\" the networks involved highlight some of the dynamics involved in labor and sex trafficking. In August 2010, federal law enforcement announced an indictment of six individuals for participation in an alleged conspiracy to exploit Thai nationals through forced labor in the United States. The defendants allegedly enticed workers to the United States by offering opportunities for lucrative jobs. Once in the United States, the approximately 400 Thai workers had their passports confiscated, were threatened with economic harm and deportation, and were forced to work on farms in Washington and Hawaii. In another case, four individuals from the United States, Mexico, and Guatemala were sentenced in April 2010 for involvement in a sex trafficking organization that targeted young Mexican women. They lured these women to the United States on the promise of better lives or legitimate employment. Once the women were brought to the United States, they were instead physically threatened, beaten, intimidated, and forced to engage in commercial sex. DOJ has also reported an uptick in Asian organized crime groups becoming involved as pimps or brokers in domestic human sex trafficking. Although the increase is noted for Asian organized crime groups, involvement in sex trafficking is certainly not limited by ethnic or geographic origin; these criminals collaborate with other, non-Asian groups to further their sex trafficking enterprises. In September 2012, the Obama Administration expanded its anti-trafficking efforts, including training and guidance to federal prosecutors, judges, and law enforcement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Drug Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["In the last decade, cocaine has become a truly global commodity reacting to illicit market fluctuations.

And some of the Mexican Gulf Cartel's smuggling activity involving European markets has used the United States as a transshipment point. ", "When it comes to the internationalization of cocaine markets, not all the news involves the growth of supply, however. Global demand for cocaine has partly impacted U.S. bound supplies of the drug. Cocaine availability levels in the United States have decreased since 2006. Diversion of cocaine to European and Latin American markets by Colombian and Mexican drug cartels has fueled this downturn in availability, as have coca eradication efforts, large seizures, law enforcement pressure on Mexican cartels, and violent inter-cartel rivalries.", "While the story of globalized drug smuggling impacting the United States often revolves around big Colombian and Mexican cartels specializing in drugs such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine, criminal groups trafficking narcotics come in all sizes and handle a variety of drugs. Also, partly because international communications, travel, and transportation networks are readily exploitable, large-scale Latin American drug trafficking organizations are not the only ones to have significant worldwide reach. ", "In November 2012, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced the extradition of a reputed criminal syndicate leader from Albania to the United States. According to ICE, Arif Kurti led an organization with hundreds of members that allegedly imported tens of thousands of kilograms of hydroponic marijuana into the United States from Canada and Mexico. The group also supposedly smuggled the drug ecstasy (MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine) into the United States from the Netherlands and Canada as well as cocaine from Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Peru. Additionally, ICE asserts that Arif's network diverted prescription pills, such as oxycodone. The group is said to have distributed the narcotics throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. In another case, Phuong Thi Tran pled guilty in February 2010 for her involvement in what has been described in press reports as an Asian drug trafficking ring that smuggled ecstasy pills and other drugs into the United States from Canada, where they were manufactured. Tran, who lived in Canada, is originally from Vietnam and served as the group's ringleader.

For many criminals, the movement of money\u2014either as bulk cash or digital transactions\u2014across international borders plays an integral role in this process. They use many techniques to launder money, often exploiting legitimate financial structures to mask the illegal origins of their profits. Money laundering includes three fundamental steps: (1) placement, the introduction of illicit funds into licit financial systems; (2) layering, the movement (often international) of illicit funds through a variety of business structures to obscure its origins; and (3) integration, the use of illicit funds that at this stage appear legitimate in lawful business transactions.

He purchased, trained, and raced horses, relying on front companies to conceal the origin of the money used to fuel these efforts.", "It is impossible to determine with any accuracy the amount of money that is laundered by organized criminals whose operations impact the United States. However, U.S. government estimates suggest that Mexican and Columbian drug trafficking organizations earn between $18 billion and $39 billion annually from sales in the United States. Annually, perhaps between $20 billion and $25 billion in bank notes is smuggled across the Southwest border into Mexico. How much of this is profit and then laundered is unclear. ", "Bulk cash smuggling is an important means by which criminals move illegal profits from the United States into Mexico, but drug traffickers have also turned to stored-value cards to secretly transport their illegal earnings. With these cards, criminals are able to avoid the reporting requirement under which they would have to declare any amount over $10,000 in cash crossing the border. Aside from bulk cash smuggling and stored-value cards, Mexican traffickers move and launder money by using digital currency accounts, e-businesses that facilitate money transfers via the Internet, online role-playing games or virtual worlds that enable the exchange of game-based currencies for real currency, and \"mobile payments through cell phones that provide traffickers with remote access to existing payment mechanisms such as bank and credit card accounts and prepaid cards.\"", "Organized criminals also use the globalized international financial system in the layering stage of money laundering. The United States is impacted by this from at least two directions. Criminals operating abroad can exploit U.S. structures to launder money while those operating domestically can wash their illicit profits abroad in an attempt to avoid U.S. law enforcement. Large financial markets such as New York, where criminal activity is potentially hidden within voluminous legitimate business, are used by criminals. Criminals use banks and businesses to launder money in offshore locations with strict privacy laws such as Panama, the Cayman Islands, or the Isle of Man. In these locales, law enforcement struggles to determine the true ownership of assets. ", "International or domestic shell companies can be used for money laundering. They are legal entities that have no independent operations or assets of their own and largely exist only on paper. Shell companies have legitimate purposes, for example, \"they may be formed to obtain financing prior to starting operations.\" Regardless, DOJ has identified U.S.-based shell companies as especially difficult to investigate because \"lax company formation laws [allow] criminals [to] form [them] quickly and cheaply and obtain virtual anonymity.\" One study has suggested that establishing a shell company is \"easier in the U.S. than in the rest of the world.\"", "Organized criminals likely rely on the veneer of legitimacy conferred by U.S.-based shell companies, which in many instances allow criminals to conceal their ownership. Most U.S. states do not require owner information when companies are formed or even on annual or biennial reports. Individuals can distance themselves from the actual formation of specific shell companies by using company formation agents (registered agents) to establish them. Shell companies enable criminals to move money around the globe through legitimate bank accounts without attracting law enforcement scrutiny. With relative ease, a criminal organization can open multiple shell companies worldwide and systematically distance ill-gotten gains from their criminal origins, leaving behind a hard-to-untangle web of accounts, legitimate corporations, and transactions.

Semisubmersibles can have their cargo \"unloaded in shallow waters or transported to shore by small boats.\" They have been interdicted in both the Eastern Pacific and the Caribbean. While their current use likely responds in part to interdiction pressures, it also reflects the global availability of expertise, designs, and materials. Vast illicit global cocaine markets have also made such endeavors possible, producing huge profits for traffickers that are then tilled into technology to circumvent law enforcement. But semisubmersibles, which according to figures provided by the U.S. Coast Guard in 2010, accounted for 27% of the maritime movement of cocaine toward the United States, themselves are not immune to capture.

In addition, this provision describes organized crime more in terms of the illegal activities committed by conspirators rather than in terms of the criminal organization. As such, these statutory provisions could encompass the activities of not only organized crime groups but of terrorist groups and corrupt businesses as well. Largely describing organized crime as a list of crimes may help in the effective prosecution of these groups, but it provides little aid in developing an understanding of the groups themselves.

There also appears to be a divergence between the RICO provisions and what federal law enforcement\u2014namely the FBI\u2014considers to be organized crime. For instance, patterns of racketeering activity specified under RICO indicate that criminal organizations may be engaged in a host of crimes including, but not limited to, an act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in a controlled substance, and other illegal activities. Although drug trafficking is included in RICO's predicate offenses, law enforcement does not necessarily consider drug trafficking or DTOs to be within the purview of organized crime investigations. One reason for this may be that federal law enforcement tends to segment investigations more on the basis of the criminal violation than on the basis of the criminal actor. While legislating a federal definition of organized crime may not necessarily solve this disconnect with law enforcement, it might lead to changes in the way law enforcement views and investigates organized crime.", "A second statutory issue that Congress may consider is that of organized crime in the U.S. Criminal Code. For instance, while there is a Chapter (113B) in Title 18 that deals specifically with terrorism and related crimes, there is no centralized section that speaks specifically to organized crime. Yet organized crime has been described as a leading threat to U.S. security. Though the lack of centralization of organized crime-related statutes may not impact law enforcement's abilities to investigate and prosecute organized crime, it is indicative of the approach by which the federal government views it.

Another example of such congressional attention is the series of Senate hearings on organized crime in 1958 and 1963 led by Senator McClellan. There was also the 1967 Commission on Crime in the United States led by Attorney General Katzenbach.

Consequently, some experts argue that there should be some form of incentive (as well as disincentive) to entice law enforcement to target more monetary and manpower resources toward investigating organized crime.", "One such form of incentive that Congress may consider is federal grants to state and local law enforcement for training and technical assistance to investigate and prosecute organized crime.

Specific agencies have had jurisdiction over an organized crime case based on the criminal violations involved. For instance, organized crime cases built around drug trafficking offenses have generally been investigated by the DEA, whereas those cases built around human trafficking cases are typically investigated by ICE. However, many organized crime cases may involve offenses that fall under the jurisdiction of multiple investigative agencies.

Such an organization would be responsible for \"analyzing the [organized crime] threat, sharing that information with \u2026 partners, and integrating all instruments of national power to ensure unity of effort\" against organized crime. On the prosecution end, DOJ has already consolidated the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section (OCRS), the Criminal Division's gang unit, and the National Gang Targeting, Enforcement, and Coordination Center (GangTECC) into a single Organized Crime and Gang Section. This harmonizes the prosecution of organized crime and gang cases, which DOJ has cited as being similar.", "One non-legislative option that Congress may consider regarding the coordination of federal law enforcement efforts to combat organized crime is enforcing its oversight over existing fusion centers. In June 2010, the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a review of EPIC. The OIG found that EPIC's users value its products, but that EPIC could benefit from improvement in fully developing the National Seizure System and coordinating the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program, consistently coordinating with intelligence organizations across the country, maintaining and analyzing current information from all available sources, and creating objective performance measures by which to evaluate its programs, among other things. Similarly, in November 2009 the OIG reviewed DOJ's anti-gang intelligence and coordination centers. As a result of the review, the OIG determined that the National Gang Intelligence Center had not created a gang information database, as had been directed by Congress."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
