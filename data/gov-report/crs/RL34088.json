So too are the California and New Jersey family leave insurance programs, which essentially extend the TDI programs of the two states to employees caring for family members.

The continuing interest of these governments in encouraging more women to participate in the labor force is partly motivated by concern about the impact of population aging on the future labor supply, and hence, the future rate of economic growth, in member nations. The economic rationale underlying paid family leave is that it will increase the amount of labor supplied by women with child care (and increasingly elder care) obligations and thereby mitigate the slowdown in overall labor force growth.", "In the United States, concern about an impending labor shortfall because of an aging population also contributes to interest in greater involvement of the federal government in the provision of paid family-related leave. So too does the end of years of escalating labor force participation by married mothers, especially mothers of infants.

Holidays also may be designated in state and municipal laws or regulations. Private sector employers may choose to follow the public sector's holiday practices and pay their employees for the time not worked. If businesses voluntarily close on holidays, firms can pay an employee they require to work the employee's usual hourly wage rate because the FLSA does not distinguish holidays from any other workday.", "The FLSA does require employees to be paid more than their regular hourly wage rate in another instance, namely, \"overtime work.\" It is in connection with overtime that the act has become part of the debate over worktime flexibility to accommodate the family responsibilities of employees. The FLSA was enacted in 1938 during a period of extraordinarily high unemployment. Payment at one-and-one-half times an employee's standard hourly rate for working more than 40 hours in a week thus was required of companies as a penalty for extending the workweek of current employees rather than hiring unemployed persons. About 50 years later, Congress allowed employers in one industry\u2014federal, state and local government\u2014to offer employees time off in lieu of the overtime pay they had earned. That is to say, a government can offer its workers the option of taking leave in the future rather than immediately compensating them for overtime worked. Those who want to extend \"comp-time\" to the private sector began in the 1990s to put the worktime arrangement in a family-friendly context by arguing that it would afford workers the opportunity to accumulate hours they could later take off for caregiving or any other reason \"if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Contractor Legislation", "paragraphs": ["In the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 and Service Contract Act of 1965, Congress required that certain\u00a0contractors pay at least prevailing wages and benefits to their workers employed on federal and federally assisted construction and service projects.

How this is accomplished varies among the jurisdictions depending in part on whether employers are allowed to substitute a private insurance plan for a state-operated plan. Most employees in the private sector are covered because the laws generally apply to businesses with one or more workers. Jurisdictions may cover their own government employees and the self-employed as well. The value of payments and their duration also differ by jurisdiction. In addition, the way in which TDI benefits are coordinated with employer-provided paid sick leave and other accrued leave benefits varies.", "The TDI laws do not require employers to retain individuals on their payrolls while receiving benefits.

The act further prohibits these employers from treating women who are limited in their ability to work because of pregnancy, childbirth, or related health conditions differently from other employees experiencing disabling medical conditions unrelated to work. If a firm has a policy permitting temporarily disabled employees to take sick leave, then it must allow a woman unable to perform her job due to pregnancy or childbirth to take leave on the same terms. Thus, a firm \"must hold open a job for a pregnancy-related absence the same length of time jobs are held open for employees on sick or disability leave.\"", "Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 do not require employers to provide leave to employees to attend to their own short-term illnesses. They also do not require employers to offer employees time off to care for sick family members. But, as in the case of a company with sick or disability leave benefits, a firm that has instituted a family leave policy is prohibited from administering it in a discriminatory manner. For example, men and women must be afforded the same opportunity to take the same amount of time off to care for their children under an employer's family leave plan.", "Taking action against \"family responsibilities discrimination\" may be difficult, however, because \"Congress has never prohibited discrimination based on caregiver status so such claims must be 'indirect' applications of existing prohibitions against sex bias, disability discrimination, and unequal pay.\" In May 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission released clarifying guidance that addresses unlawful disparate treatment founded on sex-based stereotyping of pregnant workers and of employees who are family caregivers, disparate treatment of employees caring for family members with disabilities, and harassment that creates a hostile work environment for employees providing family care.", "Relatedly, differences across states in leave benefit laws may make multistate companies susceptible to discrimination complaints for interfering with the rights of employees. For example, California's Family Sick Leave (Kin Care) law requires all employers in the state that offer paid sick leave to allow employees to use some of their time off to care for sick children, parents, spouses or domestic partners. But, in Minnesota, employers with at least 21 employees must permit them to use their personal sick leave to care for sick children.

In addition, they became entitled to wage replacement while absent from work to care for seriously ill children, parents, spouses, or domestic partners. Employers may require workers to use a maximum of two weeks of accrued vacation time before drawing payments from the insurance fund. Like the state's TDI program, employers must make deductions from the wages of employees to pay for PFL. The deductions are deposited in the state's disability fund.", "PFL must be taken concurrently with the maximum of 12 weeks of unpaid family-medical leave available to eligible employees of covered employers under the California Family Rights Act (CFRA). The act was passed in 1991 and amended in 1993 to conform to federal legislation discussed immediately below. The most noteworthy differences between CFRA and PFL/TDI are that the former provides workers at firms with at least 50 employees unpaid time off with the right to continued health benefit coverage and guaranteed reinstatement to the same or a comparable job; the latter provides almost all employees cash benefits during their short-term absence but not job protection.", "Two other states have since enacted paid family leave legislation, although only one program is operating at the present time. In 2008, New Jersey enacted family leave legislation that, starting July 1, 2009, enables almost all workers to take up to six weeks of paid time off to bond with a newborn or newly adopted child, and to care for a child, spouse, domestic partner, civil union partner, or parent. Employers may require workers to use a maximum of two weeks of any paid sick leave, vacation time, or other leave before being eligible to draw payments from the insurance fund. As in California, which also is a TDI state, the New Jersey family leave program is funded by employees through payroll deduction and the cash benefits must run concurrently with unpaid job-protected leave taken under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. In contrast, a family leave insurance program passed by Washington state in 2007, without a financing mechanism and with an effective date of October 1, 2009, is not currently in operation.. After a task force was unable to agree on a long-term financing mechanism for the program and in light of the state's budget shortfall, the legislature delayed implementation of the program until October 1, 2012.", "Many more states have mandated the unpaid job-protected approach to family-medical leave found in the California Family Rights Act than have adopted the insurance approach.

The reasons for leave under BAA-UC were much narrower than under the FMLA as well. Alternatively, the firm-size requirements of the FMLA did not apply to BAA-UC, which was guided by the much broader employer coverage of the UC program.", "DOL included model state legislation in an appendix to the BAA-UC regulations, which went into effect in mid-2000. The model Baby UI bill envisioned the availability of BAA-UC for a maximum of 12 weeks, and the time not worked would be counted toward the maximum duration of unemployment benefits. It also assumed that states would base the amount of BAA-UC benefits on the same criteria (earnings and employment histories) as their individual UC programs and would deduct other income (e.g., employer-provided paid sick or family leave and the value of employer contribution to disability insurance) from BAA-UC payments.", "In commentary attached to the regulation, DOL noted that it was not imposing solvency requirements on states before their enactment of BAA-UC. The department stated its expectation that states would not initiate BAA-UC without first examining the impact on the solvency of their UC trust funds.", "In late 2003, the Bush Administration rescinded BAA-UC as part of a review of all DOL regulations. The review was undertaken in the context of a recession having led to much reduced balances in state UC funds and a challenge in federal district court to the consistency of BAA-UC with federal UC law. The Bush Administration declared BAA-UC to be \"a misapplication of federal UC law relating to the A&A requirements,\" which state that a person must be able and available for suitable work to be eligible for unemployment benefits. It disagreed with the Clinton Administration's explanation of the BAA-UC rule as \"part of an evolving interpretation of the A&A requirements that recognizes practical and economic realities\" (e.g., not terminating or denying UC benefits to individuals while they are awaiting recall to the firms that temporarily laid them off). The Bush Administration declared that", "the intended recipients of BAA-UC generally do not meet this test as they have initiated their separation from the workforce and it is their personal situation, rather than the lack of available work, that has removed them from the labor market. Because the BAA-UC experiment is based on an assumption of increased future labor force attachment, the payment of BAA-UC will likely be made for periods where parents have completely suspended their labor force attachment. Indeed, in cases where the parent is on approved leave from a job, BAA-UC more closely resembles a paid-leave program than a UC program.", "It further stated that \"Congress intended the UC system to be subordinate to the main task of getting people back to work.... BAA-UC is not consistent with this goal since it encourages parents to refuse available work.\"", "Some 24 Baby-UI bills were introduced in 20 states in 2001, the year after the BAA-UC regulation became effective. But no state had passed legislation before the regulation was removed in November 2003.", "In light of the inaction of states while the BAA-UC regulation was in effect and the handful of states with TDI laws, they appear reluctant to require family-medical leave benefits by taking either an approach based on unemployment or disability insurance. The belief that higher taxes paid by companies located in states that adopt either approach\u2014arguably putting them at a competitive disadvantage with firms in non-adopting states\u2014might contribute to this reluctance on the part of individual states.

The study's author describes the low rate of access to paid leave among parents currently receiving welfare as \"troubling\" because", "These parents may be trying to move off public assistance. Without ample work supports, including job-protected leave, they may be unable to keep their ties to the labor market in the event of a family crisis, or even just a sick child.", "The data from the NSAF (household) survey accord with that from the NCS (employer) survey in terms of the relationship of benefit access to hours worked and firm size. Employees who work fewer hours are less likely to be offered time off with pay, and the incidence of paid leave is lower at smaller than larger employers.", "The availability of paid leave among working parents generally increases with job tenure. For poor working parents, however, access to any kind of paid leave is as likely for those with less than one year on the job as for those with two or more years of tenure. This might be the case if poor parents tend to work part-time, in service occupations (e.g., food preparers, building cleaners), or for small businesses\u2014each associated with low provision of paid leave benefits (see Table 1 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Detailed Look at Paid Sick Leave", "paragraphs": ["The Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS), co-sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Center for Health Statistics, asks a nationally representative sample of households in the civilian noninstitutional population about demographic characteristics, job characteristics, and access to paid sick leave. In the following analysis of the household component of MEPS data for 2007 undertaken by the Congressional Research Service, individuals are considered employed if they had a job when they were interviewed or had a job to return to on the date of the interview. Sick leave coverage is for the main job held on the interview date. Self-employed persons and individuals who did not respond to the sick leave question are excluded.", "About three in five workers (60.4%) reported that their employers provide paid sick leave. As also shown in Table 2 , relatively more employed women (62.0%) than men (58.8%) have sick leave in their compensation package\u2014a small but statistically significant difference. Married persons (67.2%) also are significantly more likely than never-married individuals (45.3%), a group that could include single parents, to have access to the leave benefit.", "Although more than 60% of employees age 25 and older receive paid sick leave, this is true for fewer than half as many younger workers. The high rate of part-time employment among young workers and the low incidence of sick leave among part-timers may partly account for this finding.", "Similarly, Hispanics are significantly less likely to receive paid sick leave than the non-Hispanic groups. The industry employment pattern among Hispanics may contribute to this outcome, because they work at well above-average rates in a few industry groups where access to paid sick leave is limited (i.e., construction, agriculture, leisure and hospitality). As shown in Table 3 , the fraction of workers with sick leave in these industry groups was well below the average of 60.4% in 2007; 34.9% of workers in construction, 24.8% in leisure and hospitality, and 27.3% in natural resources had paid sick leave. (Leisure and hospitality is an exception to the above-average incidence of paid sick leave in the service-producing sector noted in Table 1 , as is the \"other services\" industry group that includes automotive repair and maintenance shops, beauty salons, and religious organizations).", "MEPS data suggest a positive relationship between educational attainment and the incidence of paid sick leave. (See Table 4 .) Just 28.1% of employees with less than 12 years of schooling have paid sick leave, compared to 78.9% of those who completed four years of college. Occupational employment patterns may help explain this pattern because, as shown in Table 1 , employers generally require higher schooling levels for white-collar (e.g., professional) positions than for blue-collar (e.g., construction) jobs or service (e.g., hairdresser) jobs.", "The MEPS data in Table 5 provide more detailed information on receipt of sick leave benefits by occupation than the NCS data shown in Table 1 . Persons in all but one white-collar occupational group report above-average access to paid sick leave. Persons in blue-collar occupations (e.g., automotive service technicians and mechanics, carpenters) and service occupations (e.g., nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides; child care workers) report well below average receipt of sick leave.", "A positive relationship between employee earnings and the prevalence of paid sick leave appears in the MEPS data, which echoes the pattern found in the NCS shown in Table 1 . Just 15.6% of persons who earned $7.25 an hour or less in 2007 received sick leave according to the data in Table 6 . The share almost quadruples among those who earned between $7.26 and $23.00 per hour. The percentage of employees who had access to the benefit was still higher, over 80%, for those paid more than $23.00 an hour. Part of the reason low-wage workers are less frequently offered paid sick or other leave benefits may be that employers consider them more easily replaceable than higher-skilled workers in whom they tend to make greater investments (e.g., training)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cost to Employers", "paragraphs": ["Paid time off from work composes a considerable part of the employee benefit package. The cost to employers of offering leave with pay\u2014$2.07 per hour worked on average in nonfarm private industries and state and local government\u2014nonetheless comes in behind insurance ($2.50) and legally required benefits ($2.28). (See Table 7 .) If Congress were to pass either of two proposed paths to paid family-medical leave\u2014a mandate, or a TDI program funded in part through a payroll tax on employers\u2014one would expect the compensation costs of employers to increase. Because employees generally are no more valuable (i.e., productive) to businesses after imposition of a benefit, however, they have no economically sound reason to raise their workforce's total compensation as a result of either congressional action. Economists therefore theorize that firms will try to finance the added benefit cost by reducing or slowing the growth of other components of compensation.", "BLS computes benefit costs across all surveyed employers, whether or not they provide the benefit. Therefore, the cost per hour worked will be affected by the incidence of benefit provision. Not surprisingly, then, in light of the above-described frequency of provision by type of leave, the employer's average cost per hour worked is highest for vacations followed by holidays. The lower incidence of sick leave benefits is reflected in its average cost being about one-third that for vacations and one-half that for holidays.", "A good deal of variation exists between private firms and state and local government in labor costs for time not worked. The widest disparity between the two types of employers occurs in connection with paid sick leave: the time off allowed employees to care for illness or injury costs private firms 23 cents per hour worked on average; it costs state and local government 82 cents. Once again, this difference reflects the generally greater prevalence of sick leave among government workers.", "Within the private sector, the cost of leave benefits per hour worked usually is less on average at smaller than larger companies because relatively few small businesses offer paid leave. (See Table 8 .) For example, the provision of paid sick leave at workplaces with 99 or fewer employees averages 14 cents per hour worked; at workplaces with 100 or more employees, 33 cents per hour worked. There is little variability in the average cost of sick leave provision between firms with 1 to 49 employees versus 50 to 99 employees. However, the average cost of offering employees sick leave almost doubles between firms with 100 to 499 employees and 500 or more employees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "paragraphs": ["Access to the paid time off from work that employers voluntarily provide is not evenly distributed across employees. This unevenness appears to exacerbate wage inequality, with leave benefits more often available to higher- than lower-paid workers, to more- rather than less-educated workers, to white-collar compared to blue-collar or service workers, to persons working full- rather than part-time, and to employees of larger in contrast to smaller firms.", "The U.S. government has a comparatively limited role in mandating or regulating leave benefits. The sole leave entitlement Congress passed\u2014unpaid time off under the FMLA\u2014has a long, hotly debated history. State governments have been more active in this policy area than the federal government. Nonetheless, very few states appear interested in enacting individually a family-medical leave statute that provides both cash benefits and job security. Businesses for their part have been loosening the link between employment and benefit provision in the last several years (e.g., the shift from traditional pensions to 401k retirement plans and ceasing to extend employee health insurance to retirees)."], "subsections": []}]}}
