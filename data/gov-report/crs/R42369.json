Autism spectrum disorders include autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified. These conditions have overlapping symptoms that differ in terms of onset, severity, and nature. ASDs are referred to as \"spectrum disorders\" because they encompass a range of behaviorally defined conditions. The complex nature of these conditions creates diagnostic challenges; there are no consistent genetic or biologic markers to facilitate diagnosis.", "Autism has been linked to abnormal biology and chemistry in the brain; however, the cause or causes of these abnormalities remain unknown. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as many as 1 in 110 eight-year-olds currently have an autism spectrum disorder, with boys affected more than four times as often as girls. This represents an increase from past autism rates, and has generated public interest in the causes of autism. The increased prevalence has also focused attention on the demand for effective treatment and support services for individuals with these conditions. In addition, some have questioned whether the current rates of ASD reflect increased awareness and diagnosis, a true increase in the incidence of ASD, or a combination of these factors.", "For many, autism is a lifelong illness whose symptoms often manifest before age three. Autistic children and adults generally display a unique set of symptoms, but common traits associated with autism include difficulty talking, repeated behaviors, and aversion to loud noises. ASD impedes an individual's communication skills, making it difficult to learn or to integrate socially. There are no medical treatments for autism itself; however, medications and behavioral therapy can help mitigate certain symptoms. While there is currently no known cause or cure for autism, research to determine the cause or causes may identify risk factors, some of which may be modifiable. Other studies may determine optimal methods of screening and diagnosis, identify the most effective mental and behavioral health therapies, and find the best medical treatments for individuals with ASD.", "The federal government has a role in the financing (through Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs) and delivery (through funding of developmental disabilities programming in schools, Title V Maternal and Child Health funding, and other sources) of treatment for ASD. The number of cases and their appropriate diagnosis and treatment affect federal and state expenditures. As such, Congress has shown interest in financing research on ASD prevalence, causes, and optimal treatment for individuals with ASD. This interest in ASD surveillance and research has been demonstrated through inclusion of autism research provisions in the Children's Health Act (CHA, P.L. 106-310 ) in 2000, enactment of the Combating Autism Act in 2006 (CAA, P.L. 109-416 ), and the recent enactment of the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act (CARA, P.L. 112-32 ) by the 112 th Congress.
