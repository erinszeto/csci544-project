Approximately 4,380 retail facilities in rural, suburban, and urban areas could have been closed. In May 2012, the agency apparently changed course. The USPS issued a plan to \"preserve\" rural post offices; rather than closing these facilities, the USPS would reduce their operating hours. The agency did not, however, state whether it would continue to shutter post offices in non-rural areas, nor did it provide an estimate of how many post offices it needs to serve the public. Thus, how many post offices may be closed in the coming years remains unclear. At the end of FY2012, the USPS had 34,784 retail postal facilities\u20141,281 fewer than it had in FY2008.", "At the time of the publication of this report, three bills in the 113th Congress carry provisions that address post offices and the public's access to retail postal services, including H.R. 630, H.R. 1016, and S. 316.", "Colloquially, the term \"post office\" often is employed to refer to any place where stamps are sold and postal services are provided by USPS employees. However, the USPS differentiates among several categories of postal facilities, including post offices, post office branches and stations, community post offices, and contract postal units.", "Congress long has permitted the USPS considerable discretion to decide how many post offices to erect and where to place them. Congress also requires the USPS to provide the public with access to retail postal services (e.g., sales of postage, parcel acceptance, etc.).", "Both federal law and the USPS's rules prescribe a post office closure process, which takes at least 120 days. The USPS must notify the affected public and hold a 60-day comment period prior to closing a post office. Should the USPS decide to close a post office, the public has 30 days to appeal the decision to the Postal Regulatory Commission.

Additionally, the USPS has disaggregated post office branches from post office stations only since FY2004.

This uncertainty is the product of shifting USPS plans in recent years. The agency also has not stated how many post offices it needs to serve the public.", "(1) In May 2009, the USPS announced it planned to shutter up to 3,105 retail facilities. How many of these post office stations and branches ultimately were closed as part of this initiative is unknown. ", "(2) In July 2011, the USPS declared that it might close 3,652 post offices, which would have amounted to approximately 10.2% of its then 35,633 retail facilities. The agency reported that that these included", "2,825 post offices, each of which earned less than $27,500 in revenue annually; 384 post office stations and branches, each of which earned FY2010 revenue of less than $600,000; 178 \"retail annexes,\" each of which earned FY2010 revenues of less than $1,000,000; and 265 post offices, stations, and branches that were undergoing discontinuance review already. ", "The USPS claimed that closing all these facilities could save more than $200 million per year. ", "At the time, the USPS said that some of these retail facilities could be closed or replaced by \"village post offices.\" A village post office is a term coined by the USPS to refer to an arrangement substantially similar to a contract postal unit. Staffed by a non-USPS employee and located within a private retail outlet, a village post office would provide the following services: mail collection boxes, post offices boxes, stamp sales, and prepaid Priority Mail flat rate boxes and envelope sales and receipt. As proposed, a village post office would not provide other services, such as passport registration, money orders, and non-uniform parcel shipping. The provision of USPS products and services by private vendors is not unusual. Currently, the USPS has more than 64,000 third-party postal retail locations. The USPS views village post offices and other contractual arrangements as less expensive than operating a post office. However, in December 2011 the USPS announced that it had suspended its post office closures until May 15, 2012 \"in response to a request made by multiple U.S. Senators.\"", "(3) On May 9, 2012, the USPS announced that it would attempt to preserve small rural post offices by reducing the hours they are kept open and shrinking their cohort of postmasters. Some 13,000 post offices' hours of service would be reviewed and possibly reduced under the agency's \"Post Office Structure Plan\" (POStPlan). The PRC issued an advisory opinion on this latest initiative, finding it not contrary to law and preferable to the agency's previous proposal for post office closures. The American Postal Workers Union, which represents some of the USPS employees who may be affected by the POStPlan, has criticized it as violating its collective bargaining agreement with the USPS. The APWU and USPS are reportedly arbitrating this matter. The USPS has stated that the POStPlan will be fully implemented by September 2014. The USPS's communications on the POStPlan did not clarify whether it had discontinued the 2009 and 2011 retail closure initiatives. Nor did the agency state which of the postal facilities on the 2009 and 2011 lists have been shuttered or might be shut down.

Previously, postal services had been provided by the U.S. Post Office Department (USPOD), a government agency that received annual appropriations from Congress. Members were involved in many aspects of the USPOD's operations, including the selection of managers (e.g., postmasters) and the pricing of postal services. Under this configuration, the Post Office had operational difficulties and developed a reputation for incompetence and corruption.", "The PRA abolished USPOD and replaced it with the U.S. Postal Service, an \"independent establishment of the executive branch\" (39 U.S.C. 201). The USPS is a marketized government agency that has far greater freedom to run its operations than the former Post Office Department. It does not rely on appropriations for its operating revenue.", "Congress assigned the USPS the \"general duty\" to \"maintain an efficient system of collection, sorting, and delivery of the mail nationwide\" (39 U.S.C. 403(b)). In order to carry out this obligation, the law gives the USPS the \"specific powers\" to ", "\"provide for the collection, handling, transportation, delivery, forwarding, returning, and holding of mail, and for the disposition of undeliverable mail\" (39 U.S.C. 404(a)(1)); and \"determine the need for post offices, postal and training facilities and equipment, and ... provide such offices, facilities, and equipment as it determines are needed\" (39 U.S.C. 404(a)(13)).", "While Congress designed the USPS to be a self-supporting entity, the nation's legislature also requires the USPS to serve the public as a whole.

It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and shall render postal services to all communities\" (39 U.S.C. 101(a)); and \"The Postal Service shall provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining. No small post office shall be closed solely for operating at a deficit, it being the specific intent of the Congress that effective postal services be insured to residents of both urban and rural communities\" (39 U.S.C. 101(b)).", "Congress also assigned the USPS the general duties to", "\"receive, transmit, and deliver throughout the United States, its territories and possessions ... written and printed matter, parcels, and like materials and provide such other services incidental thereto as it finds appropriate to its functions and in the public interest...

The USPS must wait at least 60 more days before proceeding with the closure, and any person served by the post office slated for closure may appeal the closure to the PRC, which has up to 120 days to consider the appeal. The USPS is not required to wait for the PRC to issue its opinion. It may close a retail facility 60 days after it makes its closure announcement.

The PRC may require the USPS to reconsider its decision, but the ultimate authority to close a post office rests with the USPS.", "The USPS long has had a separate \"emergency suspension\" process that it may employ to immediately cease service at a retail facility without following the aforementioned closure process. The USPS has been criticized for using it in situations that were foreseeable and perhaps not emergencies, and for failing to re-open these facilities. Under the most recently adopted post office closure rules, the USPS may close a post office immediately \"due to cancellation of a lease or rental agreement when no suitable alternate quarters are available in the community, a fire or natural disaster, irreparable damage when no suitable alternate quarters are available in the community, challenge to the sanctity of the mail, or similar reasons.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is the Role of the Postal Regulatory Commission in Post Office Closures?", "paragraphs": ["As noted in the previous section of this report, a member of the public may appeal a post office closure to the PRC. The current USPS's post office closure regulations continue the USPS's long-standing position that it will participate in appeals only if the facility closed is a post office (as opposed to a post office branch or station). The PRC may fault the USPS's decision to close a post office only if the PRC finds the decision to be \"(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law; (B) without observance of procedure required by law; or (C) unsupported by substantial evidence on the record\" (39 U.S.C. 404(d)(5)).
