Prevailing norms of general decency served as the chief determinants of proper legislative conduct.\" During that time, Congress chose \"to deal, on a case-by-case basis, only with the most obvious acts of wrongdoing, those clearly 'inconsistent with the trust and duty of a member.'\"", "Perceptions of wrongdoing or conflicts of interest by Members of Congress have changed over time. What might be viewed today as blatant impropriety could have been an accepted norm or simply ignored years ago. For example, when Daniel Webster was chair of the Senate Finance Committee (1833-1837), he was also on the payroll of the Bank of the United States. Very few colleagues, however, criticized him for being a bank official or for his practice of going from the Senate to the Supreme Court, which was then housed in the Capitol, to argue cases in which he had a legislative or financial interest. According to Dr. Baker, Webster made no effort to keep his business ties a secret. ", "Not until the 1940s were concerns raised over the lack of specific standards of conduct and requirements for financial disclosure for government officials, and about the potential impact outside income might have on Members' decision making and behavior. For example, in 1946, during the 79 th Congress (1945-1946), Senator Wayne Morse introduced S.Res. 306, to require Senators to disclose sources of outside income. His resolution, which was not adopted, was predicated on the idea that Members' behavior should be above suspicion and that the disclosure of income would dispel rumors of impropriety.", "In 1951, criticism of congressional investigative procedures began to increase with some commentators claiming that Members were abdicating responsibility for their behavior by relying on voters to \"punish\" misbehavior. Voters, however, might not possess adequate knowledge of their Member's behavior and were often quick to \"forgive\" Members disciplined by the chamber in which they served.", "The 85 th Congress (1957-1958) adopted a general Code of Ethics for Government Service covering officials and employees in the three branches of government. Initially proposed in 1951 by Representative Charles Bennett, the Code of Ethics was adopted following a House investigation of presidential chief of staff Sherman Adams, who was alleged to have received valuable gifts from an industrialist being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission. The standards included in the Code of Ethics for Government Service are still recognized as continuing ethical guidance in the House and Senate. They are, however, not legally binding because the code was adopted by congressional resolution, not by public law.", "The existence of a \"club spirit\" and reliance on unwritten norms of conduct continued in Congress until the 1960s. In 1966, political scientist Robert Getz observed that \"the combination of historical precedent, the fear of partisan motivations, and the requirement of functioning in an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation has given rise to the view that Congress is not the forum before which the membership should be disciplined.\"", "In the 1960s, investigations of alleged misconduct by Bobby Baker, secretary to the Senate majority, and Representative Adam Clayton Powell drew attention to the lack of specific congressional standards of conduct and a means of enforcing congressional self-discipline. Subsequently, the Senate created the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct in 1964, and the House established the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in 1967. Each committee was given the authority to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Members, officers, and employees; to adjudicate evidence of misconduct; to recommend penalties, when appropriate; and to provide advice on actions permissible under congressional rules and law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposals for Extra-Congressional Ethics Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["In seeking to be fair to Members, and not to prejudice the consideration of an allegation, the House and Senate ethics committees have operated quietly over the years.

Sitting and former Members of Congress, as well as congressional scholars, discussed the pros and cons of entities outside Congress assisting the ethics committees in the enforcement of congressional rules of conduct.

Some witnesses before the task force had suggested the participation of \"outsiders\" would enhance public trust and confidence and minimize partisanship. Task force members, however, feared that the use of private citizens would interfere with the constitutional responsibility of each House to discipline its Members. A majority of the task force also believed that incumbent House Members better understand the practices of the House, and that Members accused of misconduct should be judged by their peers.", "Accordingly, the task force recommended, and the House adopted, a policy of appointing a bipartisan reserve \"pool\" of House Members to serve on any House Committee on Ethics investigative subcommittees if needed.
