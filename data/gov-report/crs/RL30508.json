The remainder of DOTfunding is from federal Treasury general funds. The transportation trust funds include: the highwaytrust fund, the transit account of the highway trust fund, the airport and airway trust fund, and theinland waterways trust fund. All of these accounts derive their respective funding from specificexcise and other taxes.", "Together, highway and transit funding constitute the largest component of DOT appropriations, and can account for 60% to 70% of total federal transportation spending in any given year. Mosthighway and the majority of transit programs are funded with contract authority derived by the linkto the highway trust fund. This is very significant from a budgeting standpoint. Contract authorityis tantamount to, but does not actually involve, entering into a contract to pay for a project at somefuture date. Under this arrangement, specified in Title 23 U.S.C., authorized funds are automaticallymade available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriationslegislation. Appropriations are required to make outlays at some future date to cover theseobligations.", "Where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process, transportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation. That is, the authority tospend for the largest programs under their control already exists and the mechanism to obligate fundsfor these programs is also in place. ", "Prior to the FY1999 DOT Appropriations Act, changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes inbudget/contract authority and by placing limitations on obligations. The principal function of thelimitation on obligations is to control outlays in a manner that corresponds to congressional budgetagreements.", "The authority to set a limitation on obligations for contract authority programs gave appropriators considerable leeway in allocating funds among the various federal transportationactivities in function 400, which includes agencies such as the Coast Guard and the Federal AviationAdministration. In addition, the inclusion of the highway and transit programs and their trust-fundgenerated revenue streams in the discretionary budget provided appropriators with additionalflexibility as part of the annual process by which available funds were allocated amongst the 13standing appropriations subcommittees in the House and the Senate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in Transportation Appropriations as a Result of TEA-21", "paragraphs": ["TEA-21 changed this budgetary procedure in two ways. First, it created new budget categories and second, it set statutory limitations on obligations. TEA-21 amends the Balanced Budget andEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to create two new budget categories: highway and masstransit. TEA-21 further amends the budget process by creating a statutory level for the limitation onobligations in each fiscal year from FY1999 to FY2003. ", "In addition, TEA-21 provides a mechanism to adjust the amounts in the highway account (but not the transit account), to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in the highway-generatedrevenues. This Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) redistributes to the various states, forobligational TEA-21 highway programs, the trust fund revenues that are in excess of projectedreceipts. These additional revenues are allocated to the states using the formulas spelled out in thelaw. However, the FY2000 and FY2001 DOT requests proposed redirection of RABA funds fromhighway programs to other DOT initiatives. In the end, the FY2000 and FY2001 DOT appropriationsacts did not adopt the Administration's proposed redirection of RABA funds.", "The net effect of the creation of these new budget categories is a predetermined minimum level of funding for core highway and transit programs, referred to in TEA-21 as a discretionary spendingguarantee. The highway and mass transit categories are separated from the rest of the discretionarybudget in a way that prevents the funds assigned to these categories to be used for any other purpose.These so called \"firewalls\" are viewed, in the TEA-21 context, as guaranteed and/or minimum levelsof funding for highway and transit programs. Additional funds above the firewall level can be madeavailable for highway and transit programs through the annual appropriations process. ", "TEA-21 changes the role of the House and Senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The appropriationscommittees are precluded from their former role of setting an annual level of obligations. In addition,it appears that the Act precludes, at least in part, the House and Senate appropriations committeesfrom exercising what some Members view as their traditional option of changing spending levelsfor specific programs or projects. In the FY2000 Appropriations Act the appropriators took sometentative steps to regain some of their discretion over highway spending. The FY2000 Act called forthe redistribution of some funds among programs and added two significant spending projects. Inthe FY2001 Appropriations Act the appropriators have continued in this vain by adding $1.37 billionin \"miscellaneous highway project funds\" for a large number of earmarked projects. Further theFY2001 Act calls for a redirection of a limited amount of funding between programs and includessignificant additional funding for some TEA-21 programs.", "As suggested earlier, the TEA-21 firewalls appear to diminish the flexibility of the committees on appropriations to meet the goals of the annual budget process, because the committees can onlyadjust the DOT agency or program budgets outside the firewalls. Hence, any reduction in spendingfor function 400 must be allocated to agencies or programs other than highways or transit. In the erabefore the budget surplus, i.e. last year, this raised special concern for supporters of the Coast Guardand Amtrak, which are the largest DOT functions without firewall protection.

The guarantee for aviation spending, however, is significantly different from thatprovided by TEA-21. Instead of creating new budget categories, the FAIR21 guarantee rests onadoption of two point-of-order rules for the House and the Senate. The first point-of-order preventsCongress from considering any legislation that does not spend all of the \"total budget resources\" asdefined by FAIR21 for aviation purposes. Total budget resources for purposes of the Act areessentially the revenues and interest accruing to the aviation trust fund. The second point-of-orderprevents any spending for FAA operations and maintenance (O&M) or Research, Engineering andDevelopment (RE&D), unless the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Facilities andEquipment (F&E) portions of the FAA account are funded at their fully authorized levels.", "Almost all observers view the FAIR21 guarantees as being somewhat weaker than those provided by TEA-21 for highway and transit programs. Congress can, and sometimes does, waivepoints-of-order during consideration of legislation. In addition, there is a sense that appropriatorsmight still have some latitude to make significant changes to FAA O&M funding, which isdependant on both trust fund and general fund contributions. For FY2001, however, nopoint-of-order waivers were considered. ", "Supporters of FAIR21 believe the Act requires significant new spending on aviation programs. And for at least the FY2001 appropriations cycle, this has been the case. Enactment of FAIR21means that transportation appropriators have total control over spending for only the Coast Guard,the Federal Railroad Administration (including Amtrak), and a number of smaller DOT agencies.All of these agencies were concerned about their funding prospects. However, the FY2001 Actprovides increases for all major DOT agencies except for the FRA budget which is funded at roughly1% below its FY2000 enacted level.", "Supporters of the Coast Guard are especially concerned about this new transportation appropriations environment. The Coast Guard is not funded by a trust fund and, hence, cannot claima user-fee base to support an argument for its own budget firewalls. The Coast Guard has a uniquestatus within the transportation budget category because of its wartime role in national defense. Itis not unusual for the Coast Guard to receive some funds from military appropriations during theannual appropriations process. It is possible that the Coast Guard will seek additional funding fromthe military side of the budget in the years ahead if additional funds from transportationappropriations do not become available.

The Administration's budget proposal requested theestablishment of a new grant program to aid Amtrak and intercity rail passengerservice, to be funded at $468 million in FY2001. The money was to come fromRABA funds associated with the highway trust fund. The projects funded would haverequired a 100% state match; a positive financial contribution to Amtrak; publicbenefits in excess of public costs and would have to be located on a current orpotential intercity rail corridor. Funds were to go toward the acquisition ofequipment, construction of infrastructure improvements (including acquisition ofright-of-way), and planning and design. Funds were to be used only for capital asdefined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), thus excluding themfrom use for maintenance of equipment or track. The House and Senate-passed bills,as well as the conference agreement, provided no funding for FY2001.", "In the Senate, an amendment was offered from the floor to allow states to use their apportionments from the highway trust fund (specifically, from the nationalhighway system program, the surface transportation program, and the congestionmitigation and air quality improvement program) to pay for capital improvements forintercity passenger rail service. The argument for this amendment was that theindividual states were the best judges of their most urgent transportation needs andshould be given the flexibility to spend their available transportation funds as theysee fit. The arguments against this amendment were that since the repair andmaintenance needs of the nation's highway system are great, none of the money forthat purpose should be used for anything else; and also that expanding the spendingcriteria to include things other than highways would constitute legislating in anappropriations bill. The amendment failed on a point-of-order objection that theamendment was legislating in an appropriations bill; the objection was upheld by a52-46 vote."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)", "paragraphs": ["http://www.fhwa.dot.gov", "The FY2001 Appropriations Act provides FHWA with budgetary resources of$33.452 billion. The government-wide rescission mandated in the ConsolidatedAppropriations Act ( P.L. 106-554 ) along with some additional appropriations and thecarry-over of some unobligated exempt obligations created a new total of $33.425billion. Even accounting for these adjustments the final enacted funding isdramatically above the level provided in FY2000, an increase of approximately $4.6billion or roughly 16%. The FHWA component of the final act is, in fact,dramatically larger than the amounts provided in either the House or Senate versionsof the appropriations bill. Almost all of the additional funding in the Act comes fromthe addition of earmarked highway projects outside the core TEA-21 programs. Thelargest components of this increase include: $1.37 billion in earmarked\"miscellaneous highway\" project funds, an additional $720 million for the emergencyrelief program, an additional $55 million for the Appalachian development highwaysystem, and $600 million for the reconstruction of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. ", "With the exception of funding provided for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, all additional spending for FY2001 comes from the highway trust fund. The additionalspending proposals in the bill tend to distract from the fact that core FHWA spendingalso receives a significant increase as a result of the availability of additional RABAmonies. As a result, the FY2001 limitation on obligations rises to almost $29.7billion, an increase of almost $2 billion from the FY2000 level. ", "The Senate-passed version of the FY2001 appropriations bill provided FHWA with total budgetary resources of $30.7 billion, comparable to those found in theHouse-passed version of the bill, also $30.7 billion. Both House and Senate billsprovided funding at levels slightly above the $30.6 billion level found in theAdministration proposal. Programmatically, the House and Senate bills closelytracked the Administration proposals, which are in turn governed by the provisionsof TEA-21. The limitation on obligation funding level in both bills was an identical$29.7 billion. The House and Senate bills essentially ignored an Administrationrequest to redistribute a portion of FY2001 revenue aligned budget authority (RABA)funds. ", "The FHWA portion of the appropriations bill drew little comment during floor consideration of this legislation in the House, the Senate, or during consideration ofthe conference report. There was little by way of controversy surrounding the FHWAbudget; the possible exception was some early concern over the level of earmarkingfor the Federal Lands Highway Program and the Transportation and Community andSystem Preservation Pilot Program. Reports accompanying both the Senate andHouse bills detailed specific, and in some cases different, project earmarks for bothof these programs. ", "The Administration was proposing a total FHWA budget of $30.358 billion for FY2001. In terms of the total FHWA budget, this represented an increase of just over5% from the FY2000 level. The obligational limitation, which supports most of thefederal-aid highway program, was set at $29.319 billion; funding for exemptprograms (emergency relief and a portion of minimum guarantee funding) was set atjust over $1 billion. All of the core FHWA funding programs received considerableincreases in the context of the program framework established by TEA-21 (describedlater in this section).", "The Administration was also proposing that only $2.31 billion of the available RABA be assigned to highway programs. This meant that $741 million of RABAfunds would have been transferred within DOT agencies for mostly non-highwayactivities. In addition, the Administration was proposing that specific programswithin FHWA's jurisdiction receive -- for example, funding for Indian reservationroads and highway tax fuel evasion projects -- receive designated distributions ofRABA funds. The proposal to change the distribution of RABA would haveincreased these programs to levels beyond those provided by TEA-21. The proposalto change the distribution of RABA funds is a controversial one. The Administrationmade a similar redistribution proposal in FY2000 that was ultimately ignored byCongress. The Administration proposal for FY2001 is of a different nature than lastyear's request in that it does not provide a major shift of RABA funds to transit.", "A final issue likely to have arisen as a result of the Administration proposal was the use of contract authority to fund a number of the proposed increases discussedabove. The net effect of this proposal was to potentially exceed the obligationallimitation detailed in TEA-21. In other words, the Administration spending proposalappeared to exceed TEA-21 authorized levels for some programs. Hence, either newauthorizing legislation, with concomitant increases in contract authority, would havebeen needed to accommodate the new funding levels (an unlikely prospect at themoment) or some existing programs would have seen spending reductions toaccommodate the increased spending for favored initiatives. Both of these scenarioswere unpopular with highway interest groups and with those Members who do notwant to see the TEA-21 framework changed.", "In FY2001, as discussed earlier, the FHWA was provided with $33.425 billion (rescission adjusted) in total budgetary resources. The FY2001 Appropriations Actcontinues the dramatic growth in FHWA funding that resulted from passage ofTEA-21 in 1998 and now from the availability of a budget surplus. By way ofcomparison, FHWA funding for FY2001 is at a level of almost $15 billion more thanwas available in FY1995.", "The FY2001 Act largely followed the provisions of TEA-21 in terms of overall funding distribution (a discussion of the TEA-21 program structure follows thissection), with the exception of the additional funding provided outside the coreprograms. The principal change in the FY2000 Act was in the distribution of RABAfunds for programs under the direct control of the FHWA. These changes werecontinued in FY2001. These so called \"allocated\" funds go to programs such as theFederal Lands Highway Program and the Highway Beautification Program. Theeffect of the FY2000 Act's provisions was to transfer a significant portion of theRABA funds designated for the allocated funds to core highway programs (surfacetransportation program, national highway system program, etc.) for distribution to thestates on a formula basis. The other major change in the FY2000 Act was asignificant increase in the number of specific projects and funding levels detailed inthe legislation. This trend continued in the FY2001 Act. This earmarking is acommon feature in other parts of the transportation appropriations Act, but had beenabsent from the highway section of the Act for several years. ", "0.08% Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)Provision. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 4475 included a provision that would have reduced the amount of highway trust funds thata state received if it did not adopt and enforce a \"0.08% blood alcohol concentration\"( 0.08 BAC) per se law. Such a statute makes it illegal (by definition) to operate amotor vehicle at or above a 0.08% BAC. (9) No similarprovision was included in theHouse bill. Those supporting the Senate approach often assert that the incentivespecified in TEA-21 (see section 163 (a) of chapter 1 of title 23of the U.S. Code),which provides additional federal aid funds to those states that enact and enforce a0.08 BAC law, has not proven sufficient to encourage many additional states toimplement the 0.08% BAC limit and that stronger measures are needed. Thoseagainst the approach specified in the Senate bill typically maintain that each stateshould determine its own traffic safety laws without federal pressure or dictates.Some also contend that the weight of evidence documenting the effectiveness of a0.08 BAC law needs to be strengthened before the federal government imposes afinancial penalty on states for not enacting and enforcing such a measure.", "The FY2001 DOT Appropriations Act modifies the Senate provision and provides that states that fail to adopt and enforce the 0.08 BAC standard (as detailedin section 163(a) of title 23, United States Code) would have 2% of specifiedportions of their federal aid highway funding withheld beginning in FY2004, 4%withheld in FY2005, 6% withheld in FY2006, and 8% withheld in FY2007. The Actprovides that if within four years from the date that a state's apportionment isreduced, the Secretary determines that the state has adopted and is enforcing a 0.08BAC statute, the apportionment of such state shall be increased by an amount equalto the reduction. Otherwise the funds withheld would lapse. ", "The TEA-21 Funding Framework.TEA-21 created the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history. For themost part, however, it did not create new programs. Rather, it continued most of thehighway and transit programs that originated in its immediate predecessor legislation,the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA, P.L.102-240 ). Programmatically, TEA-21 can be viewed as a refinement and update ofthe ISTEA process. There are a few new funding initiatives in TEA-21, such as aBorder Infrastructure Program, but the vast majority of funding is reserved forcontinuing programs.", "There are several groupings of highway programs within the highway firewall. Most of the funding is reserved for the major federal aid highway programs, whichcan be thought of as the core programs. These programs are: National HighwaySystem (NHS), Interstate Maintenance (IM), Surface Transportation Program (STP),Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation, and Congestion Mitigation and Air QualityImprovement (CMAQ). All of these programs are subject to apportionment on anannual basis by formula and are not subject to program-by-program appropriation. ", "There is a second category of highway funding within the firewalls. This so called \"exempt\" category consists of two elements: an additional annualauthorization of minimum guarantee funding ($639 million per fiscal year) andemergency relief ($100 million per fiscal year). These funds are not subject to theannual limitation on obligations.", "A further set of programs, which are also within the firewall, are known as the \"allocated\" programs. These programs are under the direct control of FHWA or othergovernmental entities. These programs include: the Federal Lands Highway Program,High Priority Projects (former demonstration project category), AppalachianDevelopment Highway System roads (formerly ineligible for trust fund contractauthority), the National Corridor Planning and Border Infrastructure Program, andseveral other small programs.", "As discussed earlier, TEA-21 provides a link between the highway generated revenues that flow into the highway account and highway spending. The Act requiresthat the Secretary of Transportation make an annual evaluation of revenues into thehighway account during the previous fiscal year vis-a-vis spending authorized withinthe highway firewall for the new fiscal year. If revenues go up, program spending isincreased. Conversely, spending can go down if revenues go down. TEA-21 specifiesa formula to determine the direction and amount of highway funding adjustment.Known as RABA, this mechanism was employed beginning in FY2000. ", "FHWA Research, Development, and Technology(RD&T) Programs. The FHWA proposed increasing funding forvarious RD&T activities from $437.2 million in FY2000 to $658.8 million in FY2001. RD&T funds are used primarily to advance and deploy technologies intendedto improve highway pavements, structures, roadway safety, highway policies, andintelligent transportation systems (ITS). The largest requested increases, in dollaramounts, were in FHWA's Surface Transportation R&D and the IntelligentTransportation Systems (ITS) programs. More specifically, FHWA requestedincreased funding for its surface transportation R&D program from $98 million inFY2000 to $138 million in FY2001. The Administration also requested $238 millionfor ITS deployment, which is $120 million above the amount of contract authorityspecified in TEA-21. The ITS deployment program provides funds for states andlocal governments to use advanced communication and information systems toimprove the management and safety of their surface transportation systems. Thesource of the proposed additional funding was to be new contract authority thatwould be added to the contract authority already authorized under TEA-21. Becausea legislative change to Title V of TEA-21 would have been required to add thisadditional contract authority, it was uncertain whether the additional fundingrequested by FHWA for RD&T would be provided. The House and Senate passedbills and the conference agreement specified $437.2 million, including $98 millionfor surface transportation research program and $118 million for ITS deployment. (10)", "An issue associated with the ITS deployment program is the earmarking of funds. During the last few years, the appropriators have designated a substantialportion of the incentive funds used to accelerate ITS deployment. For example,FY2000 and FY2001 DOT Appropriations Acts, Congress earmarked the deploymentaccount by specifying which cities or states would receive those funds and theamounts to be obligated.
