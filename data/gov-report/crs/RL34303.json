There are a host of federal criminal laws that prohibit obstructions of justice. The six most general outlaw obstruction of judicial proceedings (18 U.S.C. 1503), witness tampering (18 U.S.C. 1512), witness retaliation (18 U.S.C. 1513), obstruction of congressional or administrative proceedings (18 U.S.C. 1505), conspiracy to defraud the United States (18 U.S.C. 371), and contempt (a creature of statute, rule and common law).", "The laws that supplement, and sometimes mirror, the basic six tend to proscribe a particular means of obstruction. Some, like the perjury and false statement statutes, condemn obstruction by lies and deception. Others, like the bribery, mail fraud, and wire fraud statutes, prohibit obstruction by corruption of public employees or officials. Some outlaw the use of violence as a means of obstruction. Still others ban the destruction of evidence. A few simply punish \"tipping off\" those who are the targets of an investigation.", "Many of these offenses may also provide the basis for racketeering and money laundering prosecutions, and each provides the basis for criminal prosecution of anyone who aids and abets in or conspires for their commission.", "Moreover, regardless of the offense for which an individual is convicted, his sentence may be enhanced as a consequence of any obstruction of justice for which he is responsible, if committed during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing for the offense of his conviction.

The offenses have similar, but not identical, objectives and distinctive elements of knowledge and intent. Section 1512 also contains freestanding provisions that apply to one or more of the offenses within the section. These deal with affirmative defenses (18 U.S.C. 1512(e)); jurisdictional issues (18 U.S.C. 1512(f),(g),(h)); venue (18 U.S.C. 1512(i)); sentencing (18 U.S.C. 1512(j)); and conspiracy (18 U.S.C. 1512(k))."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Obstruction by Violence (18 U.S.C. 1512(a))", "paragraphs": ["Subsection 1512(a) has slightly different elements depending upon whether the offense involves a killing or attempted killing\u201418 U.S.C. 1512(a)(1)\u2014or some other use of physical force or a threat\u201418 U.S.C. 1512(a)(2). In essence, they condemn the use of violence to prevent a witness from testifying, producing evidence for an investigation, or bringing a crime to the attention of authorities, and they set their penalties according to whether the obstructive violence used is a homicide, an assault, or a threat. In more exact terms, they declare:", "Unless countermanded by subsection 1512(j), subsection 1512(a)(3) provides the sanctions for both subsection 1512(a)(1) and (a)(2). Homicide is punished as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1111 and 1112, that is, murder in the first degree is punishable by death or imprisonment for life; murder in the second degree is punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life; voluntary manslaughter is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years and involuntary manslaughter by imprisonment for not more than 8 years. Attempted murder, assault, and attempted assault are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 years; and a threat to assault punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years.", "Subsection 1512(j) provides that the maximum term of imprisonment for subsection 1512(a) offenses may be increased to match the maximum term of any offense involved in an obstructed criminal trial.", "To secure a conviction under the communication to a law enforcement officer offense, \"the Government must prove (1) a killing or attempted killing, (2) committed with a particular intent, namely, an intent (a) to 'prevent' a 'communication' (b) about the 'the commission or possible commission of a federal offense' (c) to a federal 'law enforcement officer or judge.'\" Attempt requires proof that the defendant intended to commit the killing and that he took a substantial step in furtherance of that intent.", "There are two statutory defenses to charges under \u00a71512. One covers legitimate legal advice and related services, 18 U.S.C. 1515(c), and is intended for use in connection with the corrupt persuasion offenses proscribed elsewhere in \u00a71512 rather than the violence offenses of subsection 1512(a). The other statutory defense is found in subsection 1512(e) and creates an affirmative defense when an individual engages only in conduct that is lawful in order to induce another to testify truthfully. The defense would appear to be of limited use in the face of a charge of the obstructing use or threat of physical force in violation of subsection 1512(a).", "Subsections 1512(f) and 1512(g) seek to foreclose a cramped construction of the various offenses proscribed in \u00a71512. Subsection 1512(f) declares that the evidence that is the object of the obstruction need not be admissible and that the obstructed proceedings need not be either pending or imminent. Whether the defendant's misconduct must be shown to have been taken in anticipation of such proceedings is a more difficult question.", "The Supreme Court rejected the contention that language like that found in subsection 1512(f) (making \u00a71512 applicable to obstructions committed before any official proceedings were convened) absolved the government of having to prove that the obstruction was committed with an eye to possible official proceedings. That case, the Arthur Andersen case, however, involved the construction of subsection 1512(b) which requires that the defendant be shown to have \"knowingly\" engaged in the obstructing conduct. Subsection 1512(a) has no such explicit \"knowing\" element. Yet, the government must still show that the offender's violent act was committed with the intent to prevent testimony in a federal official proceeding.", "By virtue of subsection 1512(g), \"where the defendant kills a person with an intent to prevent communication with law enforcement officers generally, that intent includes an intent to prevent communications with federal law enforcement officers only if it is reasonably likely under the circumstances that (in the absence of the killing) at least one of the relevant communications would have been made to a federal officer.\"", "As a consequence of subsection 1512(h), murder, attempted murder, or the use or threat of physical force\u2014committed overseas to prevent the appearance or testimony of a witness or the production of evidence in federal proceedings in this country or to prevent a witness from informing authorities of the commission of a federal offense or a federal parole, probation, supervised release violation\u2014is a federal crime outlawed in subsection 1512(a) that may be prosecuted in this country.", "As a general rule, the courts will assume that Congress intends a statute to apply only within the United States and to be applied consistent with the principles of international law\u2014unless a contrary intent is obvious. Subsection 1512(h) supplies the obvious contrary intent. Since a contrary intent may be shown from the nature of the offense, the result would likely be the same in the absence of subsection 1512(h). In the case of an overseas obstruction of federal proceedings, the courts could be expected to discern a congressional intent to confer extraterritorial jurisdiction and find such an application compatible with the principles of international law. The existence of extraterritorial jurisdiction is one thing; the exercise of such jurisdiction is another. Federal investigation and prosecution of any crime committed overseas generally presents a wide range of diplomatic, legal, and practical challenges.", "Subsection 1512(i) states that violations of \u00a71512 or \u00a71503 may be prosecuted in any district where the obstruction occurs or where the obstructed proceeding occurs or is to occur.

Section 371 is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and conviction requires the government to prove the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the scheme by one of the conspirators. Subsection 1512(k) has no specific overt act element, and the courts have generally declined to imply one under such circumstances. Regardless of which section is invoked, conspirators are criminally liable as a general rule under the Pinkerton doctrine for any crime committed in the foreseeable furtherance of the conspiracy.", "Accomplices to a violation of subsection 1512(a) may incur criminal liability by operation of 18 U.S.C. 2, 3, 4, or 373 as well. Section 2 treats accomplices before the fact as principals. That is, it declares that those who command, procure or aid and abet in the commission of a federal crime by another, are to be sentenced as if they committed the offense themselves. As a general rule, \"[i]n order to aid and abet another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something he wishes to bring about, [and] that he seek by his action to make it succeed.\" It is also necessary to prove that someone else committed the underlying offense.", "Section 3 outlaws acting as an accessory after the fact, which occurs when \"one knowing that an offense has been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder his or her apprehension, trial, or punishment.\" Prosecution requires the commission of an underlying federal crime by someone else. An offender cannot be both a principal and an accessory after the fact to the same offense. Offenders face sentences set at one half of the sentence attached to the underlying offense, or if the underlying offense is punishable by life imprisonment or death, by imprisonment for not more than 15 years (and a fine of not more than $250,000).", "Although at first glance \u00a74's misprision prohibition may seem to be a failure-to-report offense, misprision of a felony under the section is in essence a concealment offense. \"The elements of misprision of a felony under 18 U.S.C. 4 are (1) the principal committed and completed the felony alleged; (2) the defendant had full knowledge of that fact; (3) the defendant failed to notify the authorities; and (4) defendant took steps to conceal the crime.\" The offense is punishable by imprisonment for not more than three years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000.", "Solicitation to commit an offense under subsection 1512(a), or any other crime of violence, is prohibited in 18 U.S.C. 373. \"To establish solicitation under \u00a7373, the Government must demonstrate that the defendant (1) had the intent for another to commit a crime of violence and (2) solicited, commanded, induced or otherwise endeavored to persuade such other person to commit the crime of violence under circumstances that strongly corroborate evidence of that intent.\" Section 373 provides an affirmative statutory defense for one who prevents the commission of the solicited offense. Offenders face penalties set at one half of the sanctions for the underlying offense, but imprisonment for not more than 20 years, if the solicited crime of violence is punishable by death or imprisonment for life.", "A subsection 1512(a) violation opens up the prospect of prosecution for other crimes for which a violation of subsection 1512(a) may serve as an element or otherwise related.

Probation, for example, is unavailable to those charged with a Class A or B felony, special assessments range from $5 to $100 depending on the classification of the offense for which an individual is convicted, and the maximum permissible term of supervised release, if any, is determined in many instances by whether the offender has been convicted of a Class A, B, C, D, or E felony or a misdemeanor other than a petty offense.", "When the question has been raised, prosecutors have sometimes argued that criminal contempt under \u00a7401 should be considered a class A felony, since it is punishable by any term of imprisonment up to and including life imprisonment.

Section 201 defines the public officials covered broadly to envelope jurors in federal and District of Columbia courts, federal and D.C. officers and employees, as well as those acting on their behalf. This includes anyone who \"occupies a position of public trust with official federal responsibilities.\" Although there is a statutory definition of \"official act,\" it has been a matter of some dispute, perhaps because of its sweeping language. The question becomes particularly difficult when the bribery charge alleges that a bribe was provided in exchange for some unspecified official act or acts or for some general course of conduct. The application difficulties seem to have been exemplified by one appellate panel which held that governmental plea bargain practices fell within the reach of \u00a7201's prohibitions.

Thus, an agent need not have authority to act with respect to the funds the entity receives from the United States. Whether he must have authority to act with respect to the recipient's funds in some manner is more uncertain. The section reaches agents of any governmental or non-governmental entity that receives $10,000 or more in federal funds \"in any one year period.\" It extends to corrupt offers and solicitations whether they occur before or after federal funds have arrived.", "Section 666 does not say what constitutes \"corruptly\" giving or accepting a thing of value. It does exempt salaries and other ordinary business expenses. The lower courts have yet to endorse a single definition of the term, finding that the term means either a breach of public or private duty or finding alternatively that it means committing an unlawful act or committing a lawful act illegally.", "As for the offer-or-solicit element, bribery is ordinarily a this-for-that ( quid pro quo ) offense. Nevertheless, several federal appellate courts have concluded that \u00a7666 demands no more than an offer or request with the intent to influence a business, transaction, or series of transactions; proof of a specific act in exchange for a thing of value, that is, proof of a specific quid pro quo , is unnecessary. ", "The \"thing of value\" element \"encompasses all transfers of personal property or other valuable consideration, in exchange for the influence or reward.\" The placement of the $5,000 threshold makes it difficult to determine whether the section is referring to the value of the bribe or the value of the targeted transaction: \"Whoever ... corruptly gives ... anything of value ... with intent to influence ... an agent ... in connection with any ... transaction ... involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.... \" Some courts use the value of the thing offered; others, the value of the transaction with which it is associated.

They reach any scheme to obstruct the lawful functioning in the judicial, legislative, or executive branch of government that involves (1) the deprivation of money, property, or honest services, and (2) the use of the mail or wire communications as an integral part of scheme.", "The elements of the two offenses are similar. Mail fraud is the federal crime of scheming to defraud when use of the mail furthers the scheme, 18 U.S.C. 1341. Wire fraud is the federal crime of scheming to defraud when use of wire communications furthers the scheme, 18 U.S.C. 1343. The courts have construed their common elements in the same manner. Thus, what constitutes a scheme to defraud is the same in both instances: any act or omission that \"wrong[s] one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes and usually signif[ies] the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching.\" The deception that is part of the scheme, however, must be material; that is, it must have a natural tendency to induce reliance in the victim to his detriment or the offender's benefit. Both crimes require a specific intent to defraud, and they are punishable regardless of whether the scheme succeeds. As for the jurisdictional element, the \"statute doesn't require that a defendant be able to anticipate every technical detail of a wire [or postal] transmission, before she may be held liable for causing it. It's enough if she 'sets forces in motion which foreseeably would involve' use of the wires.\" And so it is with mail fraud. ", "Both statutes refer to a \"scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses ... \" The extent to which that phrase encompasses intangibles has not always been clear. In spite of a generous interpretation by many of the lower federal appellate courts that encompassed frustration of governmental functions in many forms, the Supreme Court in McNally declared that the mail fraud statute did not proscribe schemes to defraud the public of the honest and impartial services of its public employees or officials.", "Lest McNally be read to limit the mail and wire fraud statutes exclusively to tangible money or property, the Court explained in Carpenter , soon thereafter, that the \"property\" of which the mail and wire fraud statutes speak includes recognized intangible property rights. There, it upheld application of the mail fraud statute to a scheme to deny a newspaper its pre-publication property right to its confidential information. The Court later confirmed that the wire fraud statute could be used against a smuggling scheme that deprived a governmental entity of its intangible right to collect tax revenues.", "In the wake of McNally , Congress expanded the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes with the passage of 18 U.S.C. 1346, which defines the \"scheme to defraud\" element in the fraud statutes to include a scheme \"to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\" Section 1346 extends mail and wire fraud to prohibit the deprivation of the intangible right to honest services of both public and private officers and employees. ", "Until construed more narrowly by the Supreme Court in Skilling , some of the lower courts understood it to proscribe bribery, kickbacks as well as various forms of self-dealing committed to the detriment of those to whom the offender owed a fiduciary duty of some kind. In the public sector, it was thought to condemn dishonesty in public officers and employees, although the exact scope of that proscription remained largely undefined. Some lower courts said that honest services fraud in the public sector \"typically occurs in either of two situations: (1) bribery, where a public official was paid for a particular decision or action; or (2) failure to disclose a conflict of interest resulting in personal gain.\" The bribery examples caused little pause; more perplexing were the issues of how broadly the conflict-of-interest provision might reach and what atypical situations might come within the honest services fraud prohibition. The uncertainty led the Supreme Court to conclude that Congress intended the honest services provision to apply to bribery and kickbacks, but that \"[i]nterpreted to encompass only bribery and kickbacks, [it] was not unconstitutionally vague.\"", "Prosecutors may favor a mail or wire fraud charge over or in addition to a bribery charge if for no other reason than that under both fraud sections offenders face imprisonment for not more than 20 years rather than the 15-year maximum found in \u00a7201.", "Mail fraud and wire fraud are both RICO and money laundering predicate offenses.

Conviction does require a showing, however, that the two statements were made under oath; it is not enough to show that one was made under oath and the other was made in the form of an affidavit signed under penalty of perjury. Moreover, the statements must be so inherently contradictory that one of them of necessity must be false.", "Some years ago, the Supreme Court declined to reverse an earlier ruling that \"[t]he general rule in prosecutions for perjury is that the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not enough to establish the falsity of the testimony of the accused set forth in the indictment.\" Since the two witness rule rests on the common law rather than on a constitutional foundation, it may be abrogated by statute without offending constitutional principles.

There is some disagreement whether a recanting defendant must be denied the defense if both the substantial impact and manifest exposure conditions have been met or if the defense must be denied if either condition exists. Most courts have concluded that the presence of either condition dooms the defense.", "Early construction required that a defendant establish both that his false statement had not substantially affected the proceeding before his recantation and that it had not become manifest that his false statement would be exposed. One more recent appellate case, however, decided that the defense should be available to a witness who could show a want of either an intervening adverse impact or of likely exposure of his false statement.
