However, there are a few changes, most notably an amendment adopted during debate on the House flooramending the definition of FAPE. Current law defines FAPE as meaning \"special education andrelated services that - (A) have been provided at public expense, under public supervision anddirection, and without charge; (B) meet the standards of the State educational agency; (C) includean appropriate preschool, elementary, or secondary school education in the State involved; and (D)are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under Sec. 614(d).\" (6) The amendment would add the following provision at the end of section C: \"That is reasonablycalculated to provide educational benefit to enable the child with a disability to access the generalcurriculum.\" The intent of the amendment, as expressed by a colloquy during House floor debate,is to codify the interpretation of FAPE contained in the Supreme Court decision Board of Educationof the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley . (7)", "In addition, a new definition of \"highly qualified\" would be added by H.R. 1350 with the same meaning as the term in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act(ESEA). This helps to align IDEA with the new requirements for highly qualified teachers mandatedin the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA). (8)", "Definitions of children with disabilities for the purpose of IDEA were discussed during the House debate on H.R. 1350 . An amendment offered by Rep. Shadegg and passed onthe House floor provides in part that it is the sense of Congress that \"students who have not beendiagnosed by a physician or other person certified by a State health board as having a disability (asdefined under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) should not be classified as childrenwith disabilities for purposes of receiving services under that Act.\" Also, H.R. 1350 would require several GAO studies on various IDEA issues (see below). One of these studies wouldbe a review of variation among the states in definitions and evaluation processes relating to theprovision of services under IDEA to children having conditions falling under the terms \"emotionaldisturbance,\" \"other health impairments,\" and \"specific learning disability.\" (9)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Allocation Formula Provisions", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 1350 would make minimal changes in IDEA state and substate grant formulas, none of which would appear to change how IDEA funds are currently allocated. The billwould simplify the language of the Part B grants-to-states formula, for example, by eliminatinglanguage on the \"interim formula,\" which had been in effect before the \"permanent formula\" becameeffective in FY2000. After that date, the interim formula would never become effective again. H.R. 1350 would limit the number of children with disabilities ages 3 to 17 that are tobe counted for the purposes of determining maximum state grants to 13.5% of all children in that agegroup within a state. (10) This provision would haveno impact on a state's allocation until the statebecame eligible for its maximum grant and then only if the number of children with disabilitiesserved was greater than 13.5% of all children ages 3 to 17 in the state. (11) The presumed impact of thischange would be to discourage states from \"over-identifying\" children with disabilities to increasetheir maximum grants.", "Under current law, Part B authority for appropriations is permanent and provides for \"such sums as may be necessary.\" (12) H.R. 1350 would specify authorized amounts for Part Bappropriations, except for the preschool program under section 619. These authorized amountsincrease annually from FY2004 ($11.1 billion authorized-a $2.2 billion increase over the FY2003appropriations)and FY2005 ($13.6 billion authorized-a $2.5 billion increase over the FY2004authorization) (13) to FY2010 ($25.2 billionauthorized). After FY2010, authorizations would returnto \"such sums\" for FY2011 and subsequent fiscal years. Thus the permanent authorization of PartB grants to states is maintained. (14)", "H.R. 1350 would make certain changes in provisions governing state reserves for administration and other state-level activities. Under current law, the maximum amounts states mayreserve from their Part B grants for administration and for state-level activities are determined byincreasing the prior-year reserve by the lesser of the rate of inflation or the percentage increase, ifany, in state grants. Since appropriations for the Part B grants-to-states program have been growingat rates well above inflation, the state reserves have been increased from year to year by inflation. Of this amount, states may reserve for state administration 20% or a minimum of about $570,000, (15) whichever is greater. Currently these provisions mean that states can retain for state purposes, onaverage, about 10% of their state grants and about 2% of state grants, on average, for administration. But these percentages vary somewhat from state to state, and, under current law, will almost certainlychange (probably decreasing) in the future. (16)", "Although H.R. 1350 apparently retains current-law language related to state set-asides, it would add language (based on an accepted floor amendment offered by Reps. McKeonand Woolsey) that appears to override provisions on how much states can reserve for state-wideactivities. Based on this language, for any fiscal year for which a state's Part B grant is equal to orgreater than its FY2003 grant, H.R. 1350 would set the maximum a state could retainfor state-level activities at the amount it retained in FY2003. (17) In addition, H.R. 1350 would increase the state minimum for administration to $750,000; however, this minimum amountwould not be inflation-adjusted as it is in current law.", "H.R. 1350 would allow states to use up to 40% of the amount reserved for state-level activities for establishing and implementing \"cost or risk sharing funds, consortia, orcooperatives to assist local educational agencies in providing high cost special education and relatedservices.\" This provision (together with the permitted use of local funds discussed below) addressesthe issue of educating children with low incidence, high cost disabilities. This issue gained increasedprominence when the Supreme Court decided the case Cedar Rapids Community School District v.Garret F. (18) Garret F. was a child paralyzedfrom the neck down as a result of a motorcycle accidentbut who retained his mental abilities. His family had arranged for his physical care during the dayfor a number of years but eventually they requested the school to accept financial responsibility forhis health care services during the school day. The Supreme Court, interpreting the definition ofrelated services, held that the extensive services required by Garret F. must be provided by the schoolas long as they were not medical services that must be provided by a physician. (19)", "Current law specifies uses for reserves for state-level activities, including providing direct services to children with disabilities, administering monitoring and complaint resolution, andestablishing the mediation process. H.R. 1350 would add several permitted uses offunds for state-level activities, including implementing voluntary binding arbitration and developingand maintaining a prereferral educational support system (discussed below).

(21) H.R. 1350 would change the language of section 612(a) by striking \"demonstrates to the satisfaction of\" andinserting \"reasonably demonstrates to.\" The exact implications of this change are not clear. However, \"reasonably demonstrates to\" would appear to be a less stringent requirement than thecurrent law version of \"demonstrat(ing) to the satisfaction of the Secretary.\" ", "The House report discusses this change and indicates that it was made in response to a concern about the Department of Education overemphasizing compliance with process.

The Committee does not intend this to imply that States do not need to implementeffective policies or procedures under the Act or demonstrate the existence of effective policies andprocedures. The change in language is not intended to provide a rationalization to States for failureto effectively implement the Act.

(23) H.R. 1350 would amend requirements for state personnel standards and performancegoals and indicators to align them with NCLBA requirements. For example, states would have to\"ensure that special education teachers who teach core academic subjects [e.g., mathematics andreading and language arts] are highly qualified in those subjects.\" (24) H.R. 1350 wouldapparently remove requirements regarding a state comprehensive system of personnel developmentand regarding hiring and retraining personnel to meet highest state personnel standards. (25) Requiredstate performance goals for children with disabilities would have to be \"the same as the State'sdefinition of adequate yearly progress . . . under section 1111(b)(2)(C) of the Elementary andSecondary Education Act of 1965,\" which NCLBA reauthorized and significantly amended.
