This evolution became evident whenPresident Uribe was elected on a platform of taking a tougher approach to the illegally armed groups(IAG) that operate in the country and benefit from participation in drug trafficking. He vowed notto negotiate with any of the armed groups until they declared a cease-fire and disarmed. In addition,Uribe implemented new laws giving the security forces increased powers, and instituted a one-timetax to be used to increase the troop strength and capabilities of the Colombian military. Heincreasingly equated the guerrillas with drug traffickers and terrorists, and initiated a militarycampaign, called Plan Patriota , to recapture guerrilla-controlled territory.

Colombia produces most (6) of the world supply, with 90% of the cocaine entering the UnitedStates originating in or transiting through Colombia. The country also produces significantquantities of high quality heroin. ", "The supply of drugs is often judged by changes in price, with higher prices signifyingdecreased supply. In November 2005, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)announced that from February to September 2005, prices for cocaine increased 19% while puritydecreased 15%. This follows a long trend line, beginning in the early 1980s, of falling cocaineprices. Earlier in the year, ONDCP reported that the availability of South American heroin had alsofallen, with heroin prices increasing 30% and purity decreasing 22%. (7) Heroin purity had beensteadily increasing since the 1980s. Despite increasing prices, the National Institute on Drug Abuse(NIDA) reported that drug use among young people has declined by 11% from 2001 to 2003, andagain by 6% from 2003 to 2004. (8) While these surveys report a declining trend in overall drug use,they also report that the use of cocaine and heroin has remained stable. In fact, the National Surveyon Drug Use and Health reported that \"There was no change in the overall rate of illicit drug usebetween 2002 and 2003.\" (9) The same report showed that cocaine and heroin use has remained stable over the same time periodat 2.3 million persons (not limited to young Americans) and 119,000 users respectively. Someobservers criticize the value of these types of surveys because they rely on self-reporting. (10) ", "Some observers have expressed caution in interpreting the ONDCP figures on price, purity,and availability. They maintain that short-term fluctuations are not uncommon and may not besustainable. (11) Thereare several reasons why prices and supply remained stable for such a long period. In testimonybefore Congress in June 2004, John P. Walters of ONDCP argued that interdiction efforts take timeto show their impact on price and availability, and that the effect would begin to show in the next12 months. (12) Someargue that an increase in the street price of cocaine and heroin is unlikely to appear in the near termbecause of the large profit margin. Even if the availability of coca leaf and opium poppies isdecreasing, and consequently the price for the raw materials is increasing, they constitute a verysmall fraction of the U.S. retail price. Traffickers are easily able to absorb this increased cost. (13) ", "The interdiction of the final product, rather than the raw ingredients, imposes greater costson traffickers. In June 2004, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) reported that domestic seizuresof heroin had steadily increased from 1,152 kilograms in 1999 to 2,351 kilograms in 2003. Seizuresof cocaine, both domestic and maritime, have increased from 106,623 kilograms in 2000 to 115,725kilograms in 2003. Much of this gain is from maritime seizures in the South Atlantic and Caribbean,and southwest Pacific regions. Operation Panama Express, which targets Colombian cocainetrafficking in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific oceans, resulted in seizures of more than 15.7 metrictons since it began operations in February 2000. (14) In Colombia, the Ministry of Defense reports cocaine seizuresof 148 tons in 2004, a 30% increase from 2003, and heroin seizures of 721 kilograms in 2004, a43.9% increase from 2003.", "The State Department's International Narcotics Strategy Report 2005 (INCSR) credited theAir Bridge Denial (ABD) program (a joint U.S.-Colombian aerial interdiction program) with thedestruction of 13 aircraft, the capture of three aircraft in Colombia and eight in Central America, andthe seizure of about 3 metric tons of cocaine in 2004. This is in addition to the destruction of severalaircraft and the seizure of more than five metric tons of cocaine during 2003.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)estimates that at the end of 2003, Colombia had 212,506 acres of coca under cultivation, havingreduced its production by 47% since 2000. Opium poppy under cultivation covered about 10,000acres, from 16,000 acres in 2000. (18) In 2004, ONDCP reports that 337,000 acres of coca and 27,000acres of opium poppy were sprayed. However, its recently completed survey concluded that the areaunder cultivation for coca remained stable in 2004, due to replantings of previously eradicated crops.Although the 282,000 acres of existing coca crops remained stable, ONDCP argues that cocaineproduction fell from 460 to 430 metric tons in the previous year because newly-planted crops are lessproductive. Opium poppy cultivation decreased by 52% between 2003 and 2004. The UNODCrecently reported that cultivation in 2004 had decreased by 7%.

Criticism has centered on the possible environmental and health effects of the fumigant used, andon the pace of development programs to provide farmers with alternatives to drug crop cultivation. Some critics argue that the ratio of security assistance to alternative development programs is skewedtoo heavily in favor of the former. They contend that more resources need to be devoted todevelopment as the only sustainable method to reduce drug crop cultivation in the long run. (20) They believe the focus oncounternarcotics at the level of coca cultivation causes serious problems for growers who rely onillicit crops for their livelihoods. They contend that spray drift has destroyed licit crops and thatgrowers seeking compensation, as provided by law, are regularly denied benefits. (21) Some observers alsocontend that eradication of crops in one area results in their displacement to other areas, and they citecoca production increases in Bolivia of 17% in 2003. In the same period, cultivation in Peru dropped15%. In 2004, cultivation increased slightly in Bolivia and fell slightly in Peru, according toONDCP. This information counters the prediction of an official with Peru's anti-narcotics agencythat acreage devoted to growing coca probably increased in 2004 and that further increases could beexpected in 2005. (22) ", "Some observers believe that reporting the acreage of crops sprayed does not reflect actualcultivation, and that the technology used does not produce accurate assessments. Fumigation causesdefoliation, but does not always kill the plant. Further, spraying does not prevent, although it maydiscourage, the replantings of illicit crops. Surveys of the area under cultivation conducted by theUnited States often differ from those of the United Nations. (See tables below.) According to U.S.government sources, the acreage under coca cultivation has dropped by 7% since 1999, while theUnited Nations shows a 50% decrease. There are also indications that growers are resorting tosmaller plots, and are interspersing them with legitimate crops, making the aerial imaging ofplantings difficult. The UNODC reported that the size of single plots had decreased, with themajority on plots of 7.4 acres or less. (23) ", " Table 2.

Most of the rightist paramilitary groups are coordinated by the United Self-Defense Forcesof Colombia (AUC). The AUC, with estimated membership ranging from 12,000 to 19,000, hasagreed to demobilize, resulting in their planned disbandment by the end of 2005. Legislation thatwould provide for conditional sentencing for their human rights abuses and other crimes, as well astheir reintegration into society, was approved by the Colombian legislature, and the demobilizationprocess has been proceeding. The new Peace and Justice Law has been controversial in bothColombia and the United States. Critics believe it is too lenient and could interfere with theU.S.-Colombia extradition treaty. Supporters believe it is the only possible way to end paramilitaryactivities. It is estimated that about half of AUC members have demobilized, leaving 10,000 yet tolay down their arms.

TheFARC controls vast territory in the country, mainly in the southern and eastern regions. There isconflicting evidence of FARC resources, most likely due to the difficulty in determining the extentof their business activities. The United Nations estimates that the FARC's average annual incomeis $342 million of which $204 million comes from the drug trade.

In 2004, military operations, conducted by up to 17,000 troops, turned to regaining FARCterritory in the southern and eastern regions of the country. Anecdotal evidence indicates that theColombian military has forced the FARC to change tactics by atomizing into smaller cells to avoiddetection and reducing the number of large-scale attacks on military facilities.

This is of particular concern in Latin America where militaries haveoften intervened in civilian politics. Critics contend that the United States should not be expandingthe role of foreign militaries to perform functions that would not be in line with its own laws or thoseof other democracies. (The U.S. Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 established the principle prohibitingthe use of the armed forces in law enforcement activities.)

The demobilization of rightistparamilitary fighters is proceeding, but the new Peace and Justice Law has been criticized for beingtoo lenient on AUC members who have committed gross violations of human rights and drugtrafficking crimes. ", "While the demobilization process holds the promise of removing up to 19,000 fighters fromthe conflict, Congress has expressed concerns that the process ensures that illegally armed groupsare dismantled, deters members from resuming illegal activities, and holds accountable those whohave violated human rights and committed other crimes. The FY2005 Consolidated AppropriationsAct ( P.L. 108-447 ) recommended that the State Department not request funding for demobilizationuntil the Department of Justice determines that the process is consistent with U.S. anti-terrorismlaws, that the demobilizing groups are respecting a cease-fire and cessation of illegal activities, andthat the legal framework eventually adopted not prevent the extradition of suspected criminals to theUnited States. ", "The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-102 ) provided $20 millionfor the demobilization process but conditioned it on a certification from the Secretary of State. Thecertification must demonstrate that assistance will only be provided for individuals who haveterminated their association with foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) and who are meeting therequirements of Colombia's demobilization law. It must also include assurances that the Colombiangovernment is cooperating with the United States on extraditions and is implementing a workableframework for dismantling FTOs. U.S. funds can only be used for verification, reintegration,vetting, recovery of assets for reparations of victims, and investigations and prosecutions.", "Some Members of Congress have urged the \"Colombianization\" of the program, under whichColombian security forces would assume the operational capabilities to take over functions nowprovided by the United States. General James T. Hill testified to Congress in 2004, when he wasthe head of the U.S. Southern Command, that the capabilities of the Colombian military hadmeasurably improved, as evidenced by Plan Patriota . (37) On the other hand, the Government Accountability Officereported in 2003 that Colombia was not capable of assuming more responsibilities in the near future,despite U.S. training programs. (38) The Colombian government is now spending more on itssecurity forces than ever (4.5% of GDP), but some observers doubt the sustainability of the effortwithout fiscal reforms. (39) The House-passed FY2006 Foreign Operations AppropriationsAct ( H.R. 3057 / H.Rept. 109-152 ) included report language that expressed concern withthe Colombian government's ability to assume more operational and maintenance functions of PlanColombia.", "Some Members believe the international community should be providing more support forPlan Colombia. The Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the House International RelationsCommittee held hearings on the topic on November 18, 2004. Rates of cocaine abuse have increasedin Europe, yet critics argue that Europe has not provided sufficient levels of assistance. TheColombian Agency for International Cooperation reported that the European Union and its memberstates spent about $120 million in Colombia in 2003. (40) At a February 3-4, 2005 international donors conference heldin Cartegena, Colombia, attended by the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, Argentina, Brazil,Chile and Mexico, the Colombian government presented its demobilization plan and the need forinternational support. It is estimated that the AUC demobilization will cost about $160 million. (41) Donors expressed supportfor the demobilization process, but insisted that Colombia adopt a legal framework that ensuresdemobilized fighters are prosecuted for crimes, citing the need for \"truth, justice, and reparations,\"before aid would be committed.
