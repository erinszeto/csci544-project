Congress responded by creating Amtrak\u00e2\u0080\u0094officially, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation\u00e2\u0080\u0094to preserve a basic level of intercity passenger rail service, while relieving private railroad companies of the obligation to maintain a business that had lost money for decades. In the years since, the federal government has funded Amtrak and, in recent years, has funded passenger-rail efforts of varying size and complexity through grants, loans, and tax subsidies.", "Efforts to improve intercity passenger rail can be broadly grouped into two categories: incremental improvement of existing services operated by Amtrak and implementation of new rail service where none currently exists. Efforts have been focused on identifying corridors where passenger rail travel times would be competitive with driving or flying (generally less than 500 miles long) and where population density and intercity travel demand create favorable conditions for rail service.", "Improving existing routes: On the busy Northeast Corridor line owned by Amtrak, several projects to modernize or extend the life of existing infrastructure have been completed using federal grants overseen by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Amtrak has also received annual appropriations above authorized levels for use on the Northeast Corridor in recent years, but proposed projects to add capacity or reduce trip times require a level of investment that outstrips existing options for passenger rail funding. Federal grants have enabled state-supported routes off the Northeast Corridor to add additional trains per day and/or to reduce trip times (whether by increasing speeds or rerouting trains onto more direct alignments). Some grant funds have also preserved service on Amtrak's long-distance lines, which account for under 15% of ridership but incur the largest operating subsidies.", "State-supported and long-distance routes generally operate over tracks owned and maintained by freight railroads (called \"host\" railroads), which can interfere with existing service and complicate plans to add trains to already congested freight lines. Interference by freight trains has been cited by Amtrak as a major contributor to its trains' poor on-time performance, although freight railroads sometimes dispute this. A federal law passed in 2008 was designed to hold host railroads to new performance standards, but has been the subject of court challenges for nearly a decade. While legal issues surrounding on-time performance standards may be resolved in the short term, on-time performance has fallen from its system-wide high of 80% (four trains out of five arriving at all stops on time) achieved in 2012 and has been slow to rebound.", "New rail services: Amtrak has partnered with several states to extend existing routes beyond their former termini to serve new stations, sometimes using additional federal grant money. A high-profile project to build a truly high-speed rail system in California was awarded nearly $4 billion out of the roughly $10 billion appropriated for intercity rail projects in 2009-2010, but projected costs exceed earlier estimates and current funding is sufficient to build only an initial segment. The Trump Administration is now seeking the return of some federal grants. A smaller and less technically complex project to introduce new rail service connecting Chicago, IL, and Iowa City, IA, received federal funding but was delayed at the state level, and it is not clear when or if it will be completed. Meanwhile, several efforts are under way in the private sector to bring intercity passenger rail to major urban corridors. One of these, the Brightline service in Florida, has already begun serving Miami and West Palm Beach on a line that will eventually reach Orlando. While privately funded and operated, these projects do benefit from public assistance in other ways, as Brightline was allowed to issue tax-subsidized qualified private activity bonds to finance construction. Pilot programs to allow private railroads to compete for the right to serve existing Amtrak routes have been less successful.", "Rail programs were included in the most recent surface transportation authorization, which expires at the end of FY2020. Issues in reauthorization include whether and how to fund plans to build new infrastructure for improved rail services, especially on the federally owned Northeast Corridor; federal support for operating intercity rail services; the process by which rail lines are planned; the obligations of freight railroads to carry passenger trains; and whether other opportunities exist for the private sector to build or operate passenger rail services."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Intercity passenger rail in America dates to the rail industry's origins in the 19 th century. As common carriers engaged in interstate commerce, railroad companies built hundreds of thousands of miles of track across the country offering both freight and passenger transportation, making the distinction between a freight railroad and a passenger railroad a relatively recent one. Federal regulation was important in the industry's development. The Hepburn Act of 1906 (34 Stat. 584) authorized the Interstate Commerce Commissi on (ICC) to regulate maximum interstate passenger fares to ensure that they were \"just and reasonable.\" The Transportation Act of 1958 (P.L. 85-625, 72 Stat. 571) gave the ICC authority to allow a railroad to discontinue passenger service on a line while continuing freight service.", "By the mid-20 th century, passenger services faced increased competition from jet airliners offering faster travel times and private automobiles offering convenient access to a network of new federally funded highways. The rail industry's worsening financial health meant that infrastructure conditions also worsened as maintenance was deferred, contributing to reduced speeds and reliability. With ridership declining, the ICC permitted railroads to discontinue many passenger services and focus on carrying freight. In an effort to shore up flagging passenger rail service, Congress passed the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-221), creating an office in the Department of Commerce to foster research and development of new transportation technologies (the Department of Transportation did not yet exist). This contributed to the establishment of the nation's fastest rail service, the Metroliner, on the Washington, DC, to New York City portion of the Northeast Corridor (NEC), when that line was still under private ownership.", "In the years since, Congress has taken an active role in preserving and improving passenger rail service. Although ridership is much lower than in the heyday of long-distance trains, the federal government continues to support passenger rail through a variety of grants, loans, and tax preferences. There continues to be debate over whether federal subsidies for passenger rail are justified, given competing alternatives by air or highway that dominate most intercity travel markets (though these alternatives may also receive subsidies). The Trump Administration has called for \"the end of the [federal] Government subsidizing operating losses\" on passenger trains, shifting decisionmaking and cost responsibility to states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Role in Passenger Rail", "paragraphs": ["As several freight railroads, including the Pennsylvania Central, the nation's largest, entered bankruptcy in 1970, Congress created Amtrak\u00e2\u0080\u0094officially, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation\u00e2\u0080\u0094to preserve a basic level of intercity passenger rail service, while relieving private railroad companies of the obligation to run passenger trains that had lost money for decades. Amtrak is structured as a private company, but virtually all of its shares are held by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT).", "Amtrak owned no infrastructure at the time of its creation. It was originally structured as a contracting agency, and Amtrak trains were operated by private railroads over tracks they owned. Under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act (4R Act) of 1976, ownership of the NEC was transferred from the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad to Amtrak. At the same time, Congress initiated the Northeast Corridor Improvement Program, which required travel times of 3 hours and 40 minutes between New York and Boston, and of 2 hours and 40 minutes between New York and Washington, by 1981. While the act funded many improvements along the corridor, these goals were not achieved.", "The law that created Amtrak also stipulated that Amtrak pay host railroads for the incremental costs specific to Amtrak's usage of tracks\u00e2\u0080\u0094for instance, the additional track maintenance costs required for passenger trains. Amtrak is not required to contribute to a freight railroad's overhead costs. Then, in 1973, Congress granted Amtrak \"preference\" over freight trains in using a rail line, junction, or crossing ( P.L. 93-146 , \u00c2\u00a710(2), 87 Stat. 548), but Amtrak has been unable to enforce this preference to ensure that host railroads operate its trains on schedule. ", "Several railroads continued to operate long-distance passenger services after 1970 rather than contracting with Amtrak. The last of these services was discontinued in 1983. Amtrak itself discontinued a number of the routes it originally operated, but has been required by Congress to maintain a \"national network\" of long-distance trains. Amtrak has received federal funds to cover operating losses and capital expenditures since its creation.

These were required to be \"rail lines where railroad speeds of 90 miles per hour are occurring or can reasonably be expected to occur in the future\" (\u00c2\u00a71010). ISTEA created an annual set-aside of $5 million from a highway funding program to fund railway-highway crossing safety improvements on these corridors. As the presence of grade crossings can restrict how fast trains can travel, this provision funded projects that had the potential to boost maximum speeds.", "The Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21, P.L. 105-178 ) increased the number of high-speed rail corridors to 11 (see Table A-1 ). These have a total length of roughly 9,600 miles, less than half the length of the current Amtrak network. Several of the designated \"corridors\" are in fact networks of interlocking or diverging lines. For example, the Midwest high-speed rail corridor, as initially designated, consisted of lines radiating outward from Chicago to Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Detroit; further extensions to these lines have since been added to the corridor designation, which now goes by the name of the Chicago Hub Network. Most corridors were designated at the discretion of U.S. DOT, but three\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Gulf Coast, Keystone, and Empire State corridors\u00e2\u0080\u0094were designated by statute. Almost all corridors are between 100 and 500 miles in length, the distance range in which rail is expected to be competitive with other modes.", "Most federally designated corridors already receive some intercity passenger rail service, and roughly half of all federally designated corridors are served by Amtrak's NEC or state-supported routes. Approximately 1,500 miles of federally designated high-speed rail corridors currently receive no intercity passenger rail service of any kind. Some of these segments were regularly served by Amtrak trains as recently as 2005; others have not seen intercity passenger rail service since before Amtrak initiated operations in 1971. There is no longer a dedicated funding program for this network as there had been under ISTEA, but federal designation was incorporated into later efforts to improve passenger rail as discussed below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rail Corridor Improvement Grants", "paragraphs": ["The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act (PRIIA, P.L. 110-432 , Division B), enacted in 2008, created discretionary grant programs to expand or otherwise improve passenger rail service.

One of these new programs, which authorized $1.5 billion specifically for high-speed rail corridor improvements, explicitly defined \"corridor\" as a federally designated corridor established by ISTEA or TEA-21.", "With PRIIA in effect, the 111 th Congress appropriated a total of $10.6 billion to develop intercity passenger rail services in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) and the FY2009 and FY2010 Department of Transportation Appropriations Acts (Division A, Title I, P.L. 111-117 ), well in excess of authorized levels. That same year, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) published its High-Speed Rail Strategic Plan, which outlined the Obama Administration's priorities to improve intercity passenger rail service using the programs created by PRIIA and the infusion of funds provided by ARRA. This document indicated that the federally designated high-speed rail corridors were to be prioritized in the coming solicitations for intercity passenger rail grant funds.", "FRA ultimately used this money to award 158 grants under the new High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail (HSIPR) Grant Program. Some 80% of the funding went to a relatively small number of large-scale projects, each within a federally designated priority corridor. These included multi-billion-dollar grants to California and Florida for new high-speed rail lines; Florida subsequently turned down its grant. Most grants funded projects that made incremental improvements to existing services, rather than the establishment of new lines (with the notable exception of California's high-speed rail project, discussed later in this report). HSIPR also offered grants for passenger rail planning, which previously had not been addressed by departments of transportation in some states. The 112 th Congress rescinded $400 million of the $10.6 billion previously appropriated and did not adopt the Obama Administration's requests for additional funding. No subsequent HSIPR funding has been provided. ", "Several states ultimately declined HSIPR grants to improve or expand intercity passenger rail service. That funding was reallocated to other states. Some of the remaining projects encountered delays in delivery, meaning their effects on passenger rail service have only recently begun to be felt. Other projects are still years away from completion, and still others funded planning and engineering work that requires additional funding for construction.

Amtrak periodically rehabilitates and expands its own fleet of rail cars and locomotives, although some states have purchased specialized rail equipment to supplement Amtrak's existing fleet.", "Section 305 of PRIIA tasked Amtrak with creating a Next Generation Corridor Equipment Pool Committee to design, develop specifications for, and procure standardized rail equipment for use on state-supported short distance corridors.

", "The locomotive procurement was awarded to Siemens, and Siemens-built \"Charger\" diesel locomotives are now in service on several Amtrak routes, with the potential for additional follow-up orders. The regional passenger car procurement was awarded to Sumitomo Corporation of America, and subcontractor Nippon Sharyo was to assemble the cars at a newly expanded factory in Rochelle, IL. However, a prototype car failed an important structural test, and the requisite design changes would have delayed the project beyond certain deadlines imposed by the federal funding agreement. Ultimately, Nippon Sharyo was replaced by Siemens, and the procurement was modified to substitute single-level rail cars for the bi-levels originally contracted. The delays resulted in a portion of the $268 million grant expiring and being returned to the Treasury.", "Procurement of new rail equipment can be constrained by certain federal regulations. Purchases of rail equipment using federal funds are subject to \"Buy America\" requirements for domestic content and final assembly. FRA safety standards require passenger rail cars that operate in mixed traffic with freight trains to be able to withstand certain crush forces. This makes most passenger rail equipment designed for use in Europe or Asia impossible to deploy in the United States without major modifications, increasing unit production costs. The safety standards also make passenger rail equipment heavier, which in turn makes it more difficult for trains to accelerate and decelerate quickly, increasing trip times. Regulations promulgated by FRA in 2018 attempt to address this, creating a category of Tier III passenger rail equipment permitted to operate at speeds up to 220 miles per hour (mph) on dedicated tracks or up to 125 mph on lines also used by freight trains. The regulation also modifies certain crashworthiness and occupant-protection requirements on Tier I equipment (designed for speeds below 125 mph) to permit a greater variety of train car designs to operate on the U.S. network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Loans for Passenger Rail Projects", "paragraphs": ["Passenger rail projects are eligible under two federal loan programs, the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) program and the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program.

Because loans require a revenue source to establish creditworthiness (the ability to repay a loan), and because passenger rail lines rarely generate an operating profit, these programs have seen limited application to intercity rail. However, Amtrak has used RRIF loans to purchase new locomotives for the Northeast Corridor, which does generate an operating profit.

The freight lines used by most Amtrak services may have little incentive to give priority to Amtrak trains at the expense of their own more profitable operations. However, trains on the Amtrak-owned NEC also reached their final destinations late on one trip out of five. Figure 1 below illustrates the fluctuations in endpoint on-time performance for Amtrak's three business lines over the last 15 years.

In one recent example from February 2019, a Twitter account used by Amtrak to alert riders of service issues identified host railroad Norfolk Southern by name as the cause of a delay. In response, Norfolk Southern issued a letter disputing the cause of the delay, accusing Amtrak of damaging Norfolk Southern's reputation, and threatening further action. Amtrak's response continued to blame Norfolk Southern, listing additional delays it attributed to the company and suggesting that it take \"immediate action to improve the on-time performance of Amtrak trains on your railroad.\"", "The 110 th Congress attempted to address on-time performance in Section 207 of PRIIA. This section directed FRA, Amtrak, and the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which regulates competition in the rail industry, to develop minimum performance standards, incorporate those standards into rail service contracts, and resolve disputes arising from these standards in arbitration.

A series of federal court decisions culminated in a unanimous Supreme Court ruling that Amtrak could be considered part of the government for the purposes of deciding the case. The 2010 standards were suspended during much of the legal proceedings, and Amtrak on-time performance has decreased since reaching a systemwide high of roughly 80% in 2012.
