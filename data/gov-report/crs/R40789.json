In their capacity as lenders, institutions are required to disclose certain information about the terms and conditions of Perkins Loans to borrowers prior to making a loan, as part of the loan agreement, and also prior to the commencement of repayment. In addition, institutions must disclose information about borrower's Perkins Loans to consumer reporting agencies, including information about the disbursement and repayment of loans, loan defaults, and the rehabilitation of defaulted loans. Requirements for institutions to report or disclose information about the terms and conditions of Perkins Loans to borrowers, and the repayment of loans to consumer reporting agencies is presented in Table 20 . In addition, as a requirement of program participation agreements (see previous discussion), institutions must report information on Perkins Loans to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. IPEDS and Other Postsecondary Education Data Collections", "paragraphs": ["Under Title IV, Part G, as part of Program Participation Agreements, IHEs are required to respond to IPEDS or any other federal postsecondary institution data collection effort, as specified by the Secretary, in a timely manner and to the satisfaction of the Secretary. There are multiple postsecondary data collections that are conducted by ED on either an annual basis (e.g., IPEDS) or every few years (e.g., NPSAS). For some of these data collection efforts the participation of all IHEs is required (e.g., IPEDS), while for others a sample of IHEs are selected for participation (e.g., the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS)). Because IPEDS is an annual, mandated reporting requirement for all IHEs, this appendix provides a detailed depiction of the IPEDS reporting requirements. A review of other postsecondary data collections is beyond the scope of this report.", "Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System", "IPEDS is the primary postsecondary education data collection program for the National Center of Education Statistics at ED. Through IPEDS, data are collected from all primary providers of postsecondary education in the U.S. through surveys. Data are collected from academic, vocational, and continuing professional education programs that are provided by institutions open to the general public. All IHEs that participate, or are authorized to participate, in any of the federal student aid programs authorized by Title IV of the HEA are required to respond to IPEDS. Other institutions may choose to participate in IPEDS. Selected data for any institution that responds to IPEDS are included in the College Navigator website.", "IPEDS data are collected through a series of eight survey components: institutional characteristics, degree completions, 12-month enrollment, human resources (including fall staff and salaries), fall enrollment, finance, financial aid, and graduation rates. Most surveys are conducted annually. Examples of data collected on each of these surveys are provided below.", "Institutional characteristics: institutional contact information, educational offerings, mission statement, control, affiliation, admissions requirements, and student charges. Degree completions: level or type of degree (degree programs) and length of program (non-degree programs). 12-month enrollment: unduplicated headcounts and instructional activity, and full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment. Human resources: employees assigned by position, including full- or part-time status, function, or occupational category; and faculty status and tenure status; as well as data on fall staff and salaries. Fall staff: full-time faculty by contract length and salary intervals, non-faculty employed full time by primary occupational activity and salary class intervals, tenure of full-time faculty, and number of new hires by primary occupational activity (data collected biennially in odd-numbered years from IHEs with 15 or more full-time employees). Salaries: number of full-time instructional staff by rank, gender, and length of contract; total salary outlay; and fringe benefit information (data are collected from degree-granting institutions only). Fall enrollment: number of full- and part-time students enrolled in the fall, students in courses creditable toward a degree, and students enrolled in courses that are part of a vocational or occupational program; residence of students; and age of students. Finance: revenues by source, expenses by function, physical plant assets and indebtedness, and endowment investment. Financial aid: number of students receiving federal grants, state and local government grants, institutional grants, and loans; and average amount of aid received by type of aid. Graduation rates: number of students entering the institution, number of students completing their program within 150% of the normal period of time, number of students who transferred, and number of students who received athletically related student aid.", "It should be noted that not every survey is administered to every institution each year, and that not every student is included in various data elements. For example, the fall staff survey component is conducted only in odd years. The salaries survey component is required to be completed only by degree-granting institutions. Financial aid data are collected for full-time, first-time, and degree- and certificate-seeking students only. In calculating graduation rates, only full-time, first-time, and degree- or certificate-seeking students are counted in the initial calculation of the number of students entering an institution during a particular year. In addition, different versions of various surveys are administered to IHEs depending on whether the IHE is a four-year, two-year, or less-than-two-year institution; on whether the IHE is a public, private nonprofit, or private for-profit institution; and on other institutional factors such as the institution's number of full-time employees.", "The individual survey components are administered in either the fall, spring, or winter. For the 2008-2009 academic year, the following components were administered in each of these time periods.", "Fall 2008: Institutional Characteristics, Completions, and 12-Month Enrollment Winter 2008-2009: Human Resources, Fall Enrollment, and Finance Spring 2009: Graduation Rates and Student Financial Aid, as well as Fall Enrollment and Finance (for IHEs that did not finalize these data during the winter data collection)", " Table A-1 provides an overview of the survey items to which a public, four-year institution would be required to respond. As previously discussed, the specific survey components, survey items, and number of survey items varies based on institutional characteristics, such as institutional level and control."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
