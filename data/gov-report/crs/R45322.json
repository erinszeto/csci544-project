In many instances, the FAR requires procurement contracts to include \"inspection clauses\" that explicitly authorize procuring agencies to require contractors to remove, correct, or replace rejected goods, or reperform services (together, to take \"corrective actions\") for failing to conform to contract specifications and requirements. Relatedly, inspection clauses often authorize agencies to make equitable cost reductions or seek repayment to account for all of the costs associated with deficient services that cannot be reperformed or goods the agency received and accepted despite the deficiencies.", "Incentive Fees. Under certain circumstances, procuring agencies are permitted to incentivize contractors with performance-based payments. These \"incentive fees\" can be an effective contractor accountability measure because they can be paid to reward contractors for meeting or exceeding goals or standards contemplated in the contract or withheld or reduced when contractors fail to meet or exceed those goals or standards.", "Performance and Payment Surety Bonds. Under certain circumstances, government contractors are required to acquire a surety bond, through which a third-party surety promises to assume a contractor's responsibilities in the event that the contractor fails to meet specified contractual obligations. A bond can serve as a contractor accountability measure because it subjects a contractor to potential additional costs, which could include liability expenses under indemnity agreements with the surety and increased costs of acquiring a bond for future contracts.", "Liquidated Damages. Liquidated damages are predetermined sums a contractor must pay the procuring agency for specified contract breaches or performance failures. By predetermining the costs associated with a breach or failure to perform, liquidated damages clauses hold contractors accountable for noncompliance, while saving time and litigation costs.", "Contract Termination for Default. Termination of a contract because of a contractor's default is arguably the most consequential and dramatic contract-based contractor accountability tool at the government's disposal. A default termination \"discharges government duties under the contract while exposing the contractor to potential liability for the consequences of its breach.\" In addition to other potential repercussions, the cause of the default could serve as grounds for suspending or debarring a contractor from future contracts.", "Contractor Performance Evaluations. When selecting contractors, procuring agencies often consider various contractor accountability issues, notably including the contractor's performance under other contracts, through (1) responsibility determinations and (2) source selections under negotiated contracting. To facilitate agency evaluations of a prospective contractor's likelihood of success on future contracts, the FAR generally requires procuring agencies to conduct and document performance evaluations of contractors in federal databases and to review these databases before awarding contracts.", "Suspension and Debarment.

However, contracting officers are bound by governing procurement statutes, regulations, and executive orders regulating government contracts. In many instances, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \u2014the government-wide regulation that generally applies to acquisitions by federal executive branch agencies \u2014requires that particular contracts incorporate specific standard contractual terms (or slightly modified versions thereof, as applicable). Part 52 of the FAR, and in some cases individual agencies' supplements to the FAR, provide for dozens of standard terms agencies must include in their contracts. Many of these standard contract clauses are designed to protect the government's interests, such as by ensuring that goods and services are provided in the time, manner, and quality contemplated and in accordance with the procuring agency's programmatic objectives. ", "Certain \"mandatory contract clauses that express a significant or deeply ingrained strand of public procurement policy\"\u2014such as the right to terminate contracts for the government's convenience, discussed further below\u2014are available to the federal government \"by operation of law\" even in the absence of express authorization. Other rights and remedies may be available to the government only if the relevant procurement contract expressly provides or incorporates such terms by reference. ", "When problems arise in the performance of a contract, the parties can address them through their contract rights. Contract disputes potentially can be reviewed and resolved by a federal court (typically, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims) or a board of contract appeals in accordance with the Contract Disputes Act. The contract dispute process is outside the scope of this report.", "The terms that a procuring agency incorporates into a particular contract\u2014and, by extension, the rights and remedies at the agency's disposal\u2014can vary considerably according to the type of contract the agency solicits. The type of contract an agency chooses may depend on, among other factors, the types of goods or services sought; the timeline by which the agency needs delivery or performance; the objective and complexity of the acquisition; the depth and breadth of the qualified contractor pool; and the certainty with which costs can be predicted. This report focuses on the two most common categories of government contracts: fixed-price and cost-reimbursement. ", "Fixed-price contrac t. Through a fixed-price contract, a procuring agency acquires a good or service for a specified price that is either firm, or, under certain circumstances, adjustable in accordance with conditions spelled out in the contract. The contractor under a fixed-price contract generally assumes the risk of cost overruns. As a result, the government typically prefers using fixed-price contracts to the extent that they are appropriate for the given circumstances. When administering a fixed-price contract, the government's focus is generally on whether the acquired good or service comports with the contract's specifications and meets the agency's needs. ", "Cost-reimbursement contract . In contrast, through a cost-reimbursement contract, a procuring agency agrees to reimburse a contractor for specified allowed costs the contractor incurs, subject to a cap. The payment structure of cost-reimbursement contracts subjects the government to a greater risk of wasteful spending than in fixed-price contracts. An agency will typically use a cost-reimbursement contract when there are too many uncertainties regarding the cost, performance, or specifications for the procuring agency to utilize a fixed-price contract. When overseeing the administration of a cost-reimbursement contract, the government generally focuses on \"ensuring that the contractor expends funds to most effectively accomplish the government's objectives.\"", " Table 1 details selected common contract types for each category; the situations in which they are typically utilized; and a selection of regulatory conditions imposed on their use.", "What follows is an analysis of selected contractual rights and remedies that federal agencies may employ to obtain products and services that meet the quality, cost, and other specifications for which they contracted.

These standard \"inspection clauses\" authorize procuring agencies to require contractors to remove, correct, replace rejected goods, or reperform services, (together, to take \"corrective actions\") for failing to conform to contract specifications and requirements. ", "The type of contract involved typically determines which party assumes the costs associated with taking corrective action. Under many fixed-price contracts, contractors assume all of the costs associated with valid corrective actions. In contrast, under many cost-reimbursement contracts, procuring agencies pay contractors for certain specified allowable costs the contractor incurs to perform corrective actions, subject to a defined ceiling. The standard inspection clauses applicable to cost-reimbursement contracts generally authorize contractors to charge the government for the actual cost\u2014not including profits\u2014of correcting or replacing nonconforming goods, unless the lack of conformity resulted from (1) the contractor's \"fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct;\" or (2) a \"habitually careless or unqualified\" employee of the contractor. When contractors fail or refuse to take corrective actions, inspection clauses under both fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contracts authorize the government, under certain circumstances, to hire new contractors or initiate other measures to correct the deficiencies and then to charge the original contractor for the reperformed work. ", "The procuring agency's general right to require contractors to perform corrective actions to ensure strict compliance with contract specifications is subject to some limitations. For example, procuring agencies generally cannot insist on reperformance when \"the cost of correction is economically wasteful and the work is otherwise adequate for its intended purpose.\" ", "Relatedly, inspection clauses often provide agencies with the authority to make equitable cost reductions or seek repayment to account for all of the costs associated with deficient services that cannot be reperformed or goods the agency receives and accepts despite the deficiencies. The cost adjustment is typically calculated by how much the contractor saved as a result of the defective work or the reduced value of the defective work, and, thus, can vary considerably. For instance, an equitable reduction might be modest when the government will still substantially benefit from the good or service in spite of the deficiencies. In contrast, the contract price might be significantly reduced when deficiencies largely eliminate the usefulness of the good or service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incentive Fees", "paragraphs": ["Under certain circumstances, procuring agencies are permitted to incentivize contractors with performance-based payments \"to . . . motivate contractor efforts that might not otherwise be emphasized and . . . discourage contractor inefficiency and waste.\" Incentive fees can be an effective contractor accountability measure because they can be paid to reward contractors for meeting or exceeding goals or standards contemplated in the contract or withheld or reduced when contractors fail to meet or exceed those goals or standards.", "The FAR provides that incentive fees may be used in situations in which an agency's needs cannot be met with a firm-fixed-price contract and in which performance-based payments can reduce costs or enhance the technical quality or timely delivery of goods and services. Incentive fees can be utilized in both fixed-price (other than firm-fixed price) and cost-reimbursement contracts. Contracts generally provide for an incentive fee to be paid to a contractor if the contractor meets certain cost targets; however, a contract may also provide for incentive fees if the contractor meets other performance targets, such as those related to delivery schedule or the technical standards of the procured good or service. The FAR provides that performance targets should be \"reasonable and attainable . . . and clearly communicated\" to the contractor. To establish an incentive fee as a reward for a contractor meeting certain technical performance targets, for example, contracts generally must specify compliance and quality testing standards applicable to those targets.", "The FAR provides that the determination of an incentive fee is a \"unilateral decision[] made solely at the discretion of the Government.\" Nevertheless, an agency may not exercise its discretion arbitrarily or capriciously, and this discretion can be constrained by other terms of the contract.", "The FAR also establishes the general conditions under which a procuring agency can reduce or withhold an incentive fee. The degree of discretion that a contracting officer has to reduce or withhold incentive fees varies according to the terms of the contract. Generally speaking, contract officers have less discretion to reduce or withhold incentive fees that are tied to quantitative metrics such as cost or delivery times. In contrast, contract officers have more discretion to reduce or withhold incentive fees that are based on more qualitative performance standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance & Payment Bonds", "paragraphs": ["Another potential contract mechanism that federal agencies can use to promote contractor accountability is to require a security bond. In the government contract context, a bond is a security instrument in which a third-party surety promises to assume a contractor's responsibilities in the event that the contractor fails to meet specified contractual obligations. The surety might either fulfill the responsibilities under the contract itself or cover the cost\u2014up to the maximum bond amount\u2014for the government to hire a different contractor to complete the procurement. The surety bond must be backed by cash, U.S. Treasury securities, or other \"acceptable assets,\" as defined in the FAR. While the primary purpose of a surety bond is to protect the government, a bond also arguably serves as a contractor accountability measure because it subjects a contractor to potential additional costs. These could include, for example, liability expenses under indemnity agreements with the surety. Moreover, it is possible that the contractor would find it more expensive and more difficult\u2014perhaps even impossible\u2014to qualify for a bond for future contracts. ", "The FAR authorizes several different types of bonds, but the two most relevant to contractor accountability are performance and payment bonds, which are described in turn.", "Performance b onds . An agency may request a performance bond to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with their contractual obligations. The FAR generally requires performance bonds in construction contracts valued over the simplified acquisition threshold (i.e., $250,000), but a procuring agency may also request such a bond when it is \"necessary to protect the Government's interest.\" The FAR provides that performance bonds might be necessary in nonconstruction contracts when, for instance, the agency is contracting for demolition projects. The maximum amount (i.e., penal amount) of a performance bond generally must be the full contract price, including coverage for any potential increase in the contract price, unless the procuring agency determines that it will be adequately protected by a lower penal amount.", "Payment bonds . A payment bond is used to ensure that all subcontractors, laborers, and suppliers that play a role in performing a contract are paid in accordance with the law. The FAR generally requires that a contract also include a payment bond when a performance bond is required. An agency can also request a payment bond when it \"is in the Government's interest.\" The penal amount of payment bonds must not be less than that of the contract's performance bond, and, thus, is generally the full contract price, including potential increases, unless the contracting officer determines in writing that such amount would be \"impractical.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Liquidated Damages", "paragraphs": ["Liquidated damages are predetermined sums a contractor must pay the procuring agency for specified contract breaches or performance failures. By predetermining the costs associated with a breach or failure to perform, liquidated damages clauses hold contractors accountable for noncompliance, while \"sav[ing] the time and expense of litigating the issue of damages.\" The FAR authorizes (and in some cases, requires) the use of liquidated damages clauses in contracts when an agency reasonably expects that a contractor's failure to meet timelines for the delivery of goods or the performance of services will harm the government, but \"[t]he extent or amount of such damage would be difficult or impossible to estimate accurately or prove.\"", "Liquidated damages are intended to represent \"just compensation for the harm that is caused by late delivery or untimely performance of the particular contract.\" Courts will generally enforce a liquidated damages clause if it is reasonable and not punitive in nature. Liquidated damages must bear some reasonable relation to the potential damage that the government would suffer as a result of performance or delivery delays. For example, a liquidated damages clause in a construction contract should encompass \"the estimated daily cost of Government inspection and superintendence [and] . . . other expected expenses associated with delayed completion.\" A contractor challenging a liquidated damages clause as an unenforceable penalty has a \"heavy\" burden of proof because, by their very nature, liquidated damages are intended to cover harms that \"are uncertain or hard to measure.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contract Termination for Default", "paragraphs": ["Termination of a contract because of a contractor's default is arguably the most consequential and dramatic contract-based contractor accountability tool at the government's disposal. By terminating a contract, in whole or in part, for default, a procuring agency is informing a contractor that its failure to meet contract requirements \"discharges government duties under the contract while exposing the contractor to potential liability for the consequences of its breach.\" Courts have long held that the federal government has the authority to terminate contracts even in the absence of express contract termination rights. Nevertheless, the FAR generally requires agencies to incorporate termination clauses in procurement contracts. ", "The FAR authorizes an agency to terminate a contract for default due to a \"contractor's actual or anticipated failure to perform its contractual obligations.\" Courts review an agency's decision to terminate a contract for default on an \"ad hoc, factual\" basis, \"examin[ing] and weighing [] all relevant circumstances.\" These facts and circumstances can include the extent of performance and the time left to complete the contract; whether the contractor has met performance goals; the contractor's history of performance; the contractor's finances; and issues with suppliers or subcontractors. ", "In order to terminate a contract for default, the FAR requires a procuring agency to comply with various procedural requirements, such as providing the contractor with notice of the default and 10 days to cure the breach. If the contractor fails to rectify (i.e., cure) the problems that served as the basis for the notice of the default (e.g., correcting defective supplies) within 10 days, the procuring agency may issue a written notice of termination, at which point the contractor generally must immediately halt work on the terminated portion of the contract and inform subcontractors and vendors to do the same.", "The financial impact that a contractor suffers when a procuring agency exercises its right to terminate a contract for default varies according to the contract type. Typically, the financial impact of a default termination is most dramatic with fixed-price supply contracts because the procuring agency must provide compensation only for supplies that it accepts and that meet the contract specifications. Consequently, a contractor under a fixed-price supply contract generally will be responsible for all of the costs associated with manufacturing/assembling goods that the procuring agency rejected for failure to meet contract specifications. In contrast, under construction and service contracts, the procuring agency generally must compensate contractors for all performance that takes place prior to the default and termination. Regardless of contract type, contractors generally will be liable for the extra cost to the government of reprocuring the contract. Additionally, contractors might be required to return certain compensation (e.g., progress payments) they had received prior to the termination for default, and they might be liable for liquidated damages, actual damages, and the repercussions of triggering a surety bond.", "On top of these contractual liabilities, contractors that have had contracts terminated for default might have difficulty receiving future contracts because, as is discussed in the next section of this report, procuring agencies generally consider prior contract performance during the contract solicitation and selection processes. Furthermore, the cause of a termination for default potentially could serve as grounds for suspending or debarring a contractor from government contracting, as discussed in the final section of this report.", "A contractor may challenge a default termination by arguing, for example, that the default was caused by \"excusable\" forces outside of the contractor's control (e.g., natural disaster), or that the procuring agency failed to follow the FAR's default termination procedures. Nevertheless, even if the contractor's challenge proved successful, the contract generally would not be reinstated, but, rather, likely would be converted from a default termination to a termination for the government's convenience if it is in the government's interest to do so.", "The FAR defines \"[t]ermination for convenience\" to \"mean[] the exercise of the Government's right to completely or partially terminate performance of work under a contract when it is in the Government's interest.\" Courts have construed the term \"Government's interest\" broadly to include situations in which the agency no longer needs the products or services; the acquisition has become too expensive; or there has been a corrosion in the relationship between the agency and contractor. The conversion of a default termination to a termination for the government's convenience \"is a very common practice and has been extended to practically any reason for wrongful default termination.\" ", "When the government terminates a contract for convenience it is generally liable for the \"recovery [of] costs incurred, profit on work done, and costs of preparing the termination settlement proposal.\" However, the contractor is not able to recover \"anticipatory profits,\" which would generally be recoverable, when the government has breached the contract."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Contractor Performance Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["When selecting contractors, procuring agencies often must consider various contractor accountability issues, notably including the contractor's performance under other contracts, through (1) \"responsibility determinations\" to assess whether the contractor is capable of performing on the contract; and (2) source selections under negotiated contracting.

The FAR further prohibits procuring agencies from viewing a prospective contractor's lack of past performance history either favorably or unfavorably.

The fraudulent activities that PFCRA bars are very similar to those barred by the FCA. The PFCRA does not create any new civil fraud violations beyond those established by the FCA except that contractors can be held liable under the PFCRA for making false statements that are not tied to a claim. Instead, the PFCRA provides an additional avenue to hold contractors accountable for fraud. Unlike the FCA, which is exclusively judicially enforced, the PFCRA provides an administrative process for enforcing fraudulent claims in addition to a judicial process. Also in contrast to the FCA, the PFCRA is limited to small claims of not more than $150,000.", "Contractors that violate the PFCRA can be subject to a civil penalty up to $5,000 (adjusted for inflation), as well as an assessment equal to twice the amount of any fraudulent claim that was paid by the government.", "Procuring agency personnel may report suspected potential violations of the PFCRA to the relevant agency's inspector general or other \"investigating official.\" The investigating official may investigate allegations and, if warranted, issue a report with conclusions about violations to a separate and independent \"reviewing official.\" The reviewing official, upon reviewing the report, may notify the Attorney General of a potential referral of the matter along with an explanation of, among other things, evidence supporting the allegations and the estimated value of the alleged fraud. Upon the Attorney General's approval, the reviewing official may then file a complaint with the contractor or seek to settle the issue with the procuring agency. The contractor may request an administrative hearing, generally conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, before an Administrative Law Judge or other \"presiding officer.\" ", "If, upon finding that the government met its burden of proof that the contractor, based on a preponderance of the evidence, violated the PFCRA, then the presiding officer may issue an initial decision recommending the issuance of civil penalties and assessments against the contractor.

If the contractor does not appeal the presiding officer's initial decision, that decision becomes final.
