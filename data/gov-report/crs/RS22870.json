{"id": "RS22870", "title": "Waiver Authority Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)", "released_date": "2014-04-07T00:00:00", "summary": ["Transportation fuels are required by federal law to contain a minimum amount of renewable fuel each year. The renewable fuel standard (RFS), established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct, P.L. 109-58) and amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140), required that a total of 16.55 billion gallons of renewable fuels be used to offset gasoline and diesel fuel in 2013. Under EISA, the scheduled mandates grow each year (to 36 billion gallons in 2022). However, the ability of fuel suppliers to meet the growing RFS mandates has been questioned. For 2014, instead of a total of 18.15 billion gallons scheduled in EISA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed using waiver authority within the statute to lower the mandate to 15.21 billion gallons. Within the overall RFS there are sub-mandates (or \"carveouts\") for advanced and cellulosic biofuels. EPA has proposed lowering these as well.", "Most of the overall RFS mandate (84% for 2013) is currently met using corn-based ethanol. The vast majority of the ethanol supplied to meet the RFS is blended into gasoline at the 10% level (E10). However, there is a limit to the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline at this level, and other options for supplying ethanol (e.g., higher-level ethanol blends such as E15 and E85) are currently constrained because of infrastructure and other impediments. In prior years this had not been a problem because the volume of biofuels needed to meet the RFS mandate was below the maximum amount of ethanol that could be supplied as E10; but stakeholders were especially concerned about the possibility of facing the \"blend wall\" in either 2013 or 2014.", "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to waive the RFS requirements, in whole or in part, if certain conditions outlined in the law are present. Under EISA the overall RFS is scheduled to grow to 18.15 billion gallons in 2014. In November 2013 EPA proposed using its general authority to lower the RFS mandates in cases of \"inadequate supply.\" In this case, they interpreted \"inadequate supply\" to include an inability to deliver the necessary biofuels to consumers, even if there is sufficient production of said biofuels. Gasoline and diesel fuel suppliers and other stakeholders have generally been supportive of EPA's proposal, while biofuel producers and corn growers believe that EPA is overstepping its authority.", "Questions have also been raised over whether the overall mandate diverts enough corn supply from food/feed production to dramatically raise prices in those markets, and whether there is enough feedstock supply and production capacity to meet the carveouts for fuels other than corn ethanol. In 2008 the governor of Texas requested a waiver of the RFS because of high grain prices, although that waiver request was denied because EPA determined that the RFS requirements alone did not \"severely harm the economy of a State, a region, or the United States,\" a standard required by the statute. A similar waiver petition was filed by the governors of several states in August 2012. That petition was denied for similar reasons.", "In February 2010, as part of a final rulemaking implementing the RFS as expanded by EISA, EPA waived most of the 2010 cellulosic biofuel carveout\u2014as they have in each subsequent year. In cases where EPA projects inadequate production of cellulosic biofuels to meet the schedule in EISA, the agency must lower the mandate to the projected level, although EPA's process for doing so has been controversial, and the agency's 2012 cellulosic mandate was remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. EPA ultimately revised the 2012 standard to zero.", "This report discusses the process and criteria for EPA to waive various portions of the RFS."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Recent History", "paragraphs": ["The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct, P.L. 109-58 ) established a renewable fuel standard (RFS), requiring the use of biofuels (such as ethanol) in the nation's fuel supply. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140 ) significantly expanded this mandate. The RFS mandate has been a major impetus to the development of U.S. biofuels industries, especially the ethanol industry. As a result, ethanol production capacity and the demand for corn as a biofuel feedstock have grown dramatically over the past few years. In 2005, the United States produced 3.9 billion gallons of ethanol, requiring roughly 1.4 billion bushels of corn; in 2007, those numbers had increased to 6.5 billion gallons and 2.3 billion bushels. In 2007, roughly one-quarter of the U.S. corn crop was directed to ethanol production. In 2013, production had increased to roughly 14 billion gallons using approximately 5 billion bushels of corn or roughly 40% of the 2013 crop.", "Increasing demand for corn for biofuels, the rise in energy prices, and other supply concerns in international grain markets led to rapid increases in corn and other grain prices in 2008. These higher grain prices raised concerns globally over food prices and availability. Because of these concerns, as well as the capacity for the U.S. industry to meet the growing RFS mandates, there is continuing interest among some policy makers to amend or eliminate the RFS. ", "Under the provisions of EPAct and EISA, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to waive the RFS requirements in whole or in part, in response to a petition by a state or a fuel provider, or on her own motion. In April 2008, Texas Governor Rick Perry sent a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson petitioning for a 50% waiver from the RFS requirements. In his letter, Governor Perry stated that he initiated the petition because of the negative effect of the requirements on the Texas economy and on global food prices. In August 2008, EPA denied the waiver request because the agency found that the effects of the RFS on food, feed, and fuel prices was minimal, and thus the economic effects of the RFS \"could not be categorized as severe.\" In August 2012, Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe and North Carolina Governor Beverly Eaves Perdue submitted petition letters to EPA requesting full or partial waivers of the 2012 and 2013 RFS mandates. Governors of several other states joined that petition. The governors cited the effects of the 2012 drought, further compounded by the increased grain demand from the RFS, as leading to severe economic harm to their states, especially their livestock producers. However, EPA denied these petitions for similar reasons as in 2008.", "Another factor that could lead the EPA Administrator to waive certain parts of the RFS is the \"blend wall.\" The vast majority of the RFS is met using ethanol blended into gasoline at the 10% level (E10). However, there is a limit to the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline at this level, and other options for supplying ethanol (e.g., higher-level ethanol blends such as E15 and E85) are currently constrained because of infrastructure and other impediments. In prior years this had not been a problem because the volume of biofuels needed to meet the RFS mandate was below the maximum amount of ethanol that could be supplied as E10; but stakeholders were especially concerned about the possibility of facing this \"blend wall\" in either 2013 or 2014. In November 2013 EPA proposed using its general authority to lower the RFS mandates in cases of \"inadequate supply.\" EPA proposed an overall mandate of 15.21 billion gallons for 2014, instead of the 18.15 billion gallons of biofuels scheduled for 2014 in EISA, and below the 2013 mandate of 16.55 billion gallons.", "Within the overall RFS there are sub-mandates for the use of cellulosic biofuels, biomass-based diesel fuels, and other advanced biofuels. However, questions have been raised over whether there is enough feedstock supply and production capacity to meet some of these carveouts, especially the cellulosic biofuel carveout. EPA waived most of the 2010 cellulosic biofuel carveout\u2014EISA set the mandate at 100 million gallons but EPA only required 6.5 million gallons, more than 90% less than scheduled by EISA. EPA cited a lack of then-current and expected production capacity, driven largely by delays in production plans and a lack of investment in commercial-scale refineries. Similarly, EPA finalized cellulosic biofuel mandates of 6.0 million and 10.45 million gallons for 2011 and 2012, respectively\u201497% and 98% lower than the amounts scheduled in EISA. Because of a lack of commercial cellulosic biofuel production capacity\u2014only about 20,000 gallons were registered in 2012\u2014gasoline and diesel fuel producers challenged the lowered mandates in court. In January 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the 2012 cellulosic mandate and remanded the rule back to EPA. EPA subsequently set the 2012 level at zero and has proposed doing the same for 2011. For 2013, EPA finalized a cellulosic mandate of 6.0 million gallons (instead of 1 billion gallons), and this lowered mandate is also subject to a court challenge, and EPA granted petitions from two oil industry groups to reconsider the 2013 rule.

As has been the case in previous years, in 2013 the vast majority of the mandate was met with U.S. corn ethanol (and a smaller amount of biodiesel, as well as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil). For 2014, the overall mandate is scheduled to increase to 18.15 billion gallons, with up to 14.4 billion gallons coming from corn ethanol and 3.75 billion gallons coming from advanced biofuels, and 1.75 billion gallons of the advanced biofuel mandate coming from cellulosic biofuels.

Severe droughts across much of the United States in the summer of 2012 which cut into corn yields, along with high worldwide demand for food and feed grains, had pushed December 2012 corn futures prices up from roughly $5.30 per bushel in early July 2012 to above $8.00 per bushel in mid-August. By mid-September prices had moderated somewhat to the mid-$7.00's. Those high prices raised the feed costs of cattle and other livestock, which may have led to higher consumer meat prices. EPA determined that the RFS requirements alone did not cause severe harm, and a waiver would do little to alleviate any problems in the states. According to EPA,", "it would not be sufficient for EPA to determine that there is severe harm to the economy of a State, region or the United States; rather, EPA must determine that RFS implementation would severely harm the economy. Furthermore, EPA interprets the word \"would\" as requiring a generally high degree of confidence that implementation of the RFS program would severely harm the economy of a State a region, or the United States. EPA interprets \"severely harm\" as specifying a high threshold for the nature and degree of harm. Although there are many factors that affect an economy, the RFS waiver provisions call for EPA to evaluate the impact of the RFS mandate itself. EPA does not evaluate the impact of the RFS volume requirements in isolation, but instead evaluates them in the context of all of the relevant circumstances, including in this case the impact of the drought. However the purpose of this analysis is to characterize the impact of the RFS mandate itself, within this context."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Waiver of 2014 Standards", "paragraphs": ["In November 2013, EPA, under its own authority, proposed lowering the 2014 overall RFS mandate from 18.15 billion gallons to 15.21 billion gallons, and the advanced biofuel mandate from 3.75 billion gallons to 2.20 billion gallons. As noted above, most of the RFS mandate is met through the use of ethanol blended in gasoline at the 10% level (E10), and the volume of gasoline consumed in the United States is basically fixed. Thus, the maximum amount of ethanol that can be supplied in that gasoline is also fixed in a given year. Some stakeholders raised concerns that the scheduled volumes for 2014 would exceed the \"blend wall\" limitations. Others argued that maintaining the levels set in EISA would provide the necessary incentive for the development of infrastructure to provide fuels other than E10.", "EPA has proposed using its general authority to lower the RFS mandates in cases of \"inadequate supply.\" In this case, they interpreted \"inadequate supply\" to include an inability to deliver the necessary biofuels to consumers, even if there is sufficient production of said biofuels. As noted by EPA,", "[W]e believe that this ambiguous provision is reasonably and best interpreted to encompass the full range of constraints that could result in an inadequate supply of renewable fuel to the ultimate consumers, including fuel infrastructure and other constraints. This would include, for instance, factors affecting the ability to produce or import qualifying renewable fuels as well as factors affecting the ability to distribute, blend, dispense, and consume those renewable fuels. ", "The waiver provision at CAA 211(o)(7)(A)(ii) is ambiguous in several respects. First, it does not specify what the general term ''supply'' refers to. The common understanding of this term is an amount of a resource or product that is available for use by the person or place at issue. [footnote omitted] Hence the evaluation of the supply of renewable fuel, a product, is best understood in terms of the person or place using the product. In the RFS program, various parties interact across several industries to drive the ultimate use of renewable fuel by consumers of transportation fuel. For example, supplying renewable fuel to obligated parties and terminal blenders is one part of this process, while supplying renewable fuel to the ultimate consumer as part of transportation fuel is a different and later aspect of this process. This is clearly the case with respect to the renewable fuels ethanol and biodiesel, which are typically supplied to the obligated parties and terminals as a neat fuel, but in almost all cases are supplied to the consumer as a blend with conventional fuel (ethanol and gasoline or biodiesel and diesel). The waiver provision does not specify what product is at issue (for example, neat renewable fuel or blended renewable fuel with transportation fuel) or the person or place at issue (for example, obligated party or ultimate consumer), in determining whether there is an \"inadequate domestic supply.\"", "Gasoline and diesel fuel suppliers and other stakeholders have generally been supportive of EPA's proposal, while many biofuel producers believe that EPA is overstepping its authority.

Current cellulosic biofuel production is limited, with few commercial-scale plants in operation. Because of uncertainties over production capacity and cellulosic biofuel supply, in its February 2010 rulemaking, EPA reduced the cellulosic mandate from 100 million gallons to 6.5 million gallons for 2010. EPA set cellulosic mandates of 6.0 million gallons, 10.45 million gallons, and 6.0 million gallons for 2011, 2012, and 2013 respectively, well below the scheduled amounts of 250 million gallons, 500 million gallons, and 1.0 billion gallons for those years.

If she is going to do so, the administrator must reduce the required amount by November 30 of the preceding calendar year. If the administrator does reduce the mandated amount of cellulosic biofuel, she may also reduce the required amount of advanced biofuel as well as the total volume required for that year under the RFS by an equal or lesser amount, but she is not required to do so.

The BBD carve-out started in 2009 at 0.5 billion gallons and increased to a minimum of 1.0 billion gallons in 2012.
