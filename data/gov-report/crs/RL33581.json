Specifically, Kaasik seesallowance prices as a derivative of natural gas and coal pricing, at least in theshort-term. Assuming natural gas-fired and coal-fired generation are the marginalcost suppliers of power, allowance prices will respond positively to increasingnatural gas prices or decreasing coal prices.

First, countries with potentialsurpluses may want to retain at least some of that surplus to help fuel their countries'economic growth, possibly at the expense of a Member State that needs allowances.

Each country is to spell out what \"supplemental\" meansin its NAP for the second trading period.", "A third consideration is the overall commitment of the Kyoto Protocol. Asnoted earlier, the ETS only covers a percentage of the overall greenhouse gasemissions in the various Member States of the EU. The analysis provided in Table3 assumes that the ETS will have to provide a proportional amount of that reductionbased on 2003 emissions. However, some sectors not covered by the ETS may growfaster than sectors covered by the ETS, creating difficulties for compliance. Inparticular, the transportation area has become a major source of concern. Thetransportation sector is not a part of the ETS and is not likely to be included beforethe third trading period. (29) Instead, transport controls are based on voluntaryagreements with automobile manufacturers to improve fuel economy, fuel-economylabelling of cars, and promoting fuel efficiency by fiscal measures. (30) Thecornerstone is the agreements with automobile manufacturers to achieve improvenew car fleet average CO 2 emissions rates. As announced in 1996, the objective ofthe EU Council of Environmental Ministers and European Parliament was to achievea new car fleet average CO 2 emissions rate of 120 grams per kilometer (g CO 2 /km)by 2005, or by 2010 at the latest. (31) ", "This objective was not met in 2005 and is unlikely to be met by 2010. Voluntary commitments by the European, Japanese, and Korean AutomobileManufacturers Associations in 1998 and subsequently endorsed by the EC set targetsof 140 g CO 2 /km by 2008/2009. At the end of 2005, the average new car emissionsrate is about 160 g CO 2 /km. The rate of reduction in CO 2 /km for new cars wouldhave to double for the automobile manufacturers to achieve their commitments,which appears unlikely. (32) Indeed, despite improvements in emissions rates,CO 2 emissions in the EU continue to rise because of increased miles driven,increased size and weight of cars, and falling car occupancy rates. The EC 2005progress report also notes that despite EU's effort to increase information on fuelefficiency and CO 2 emissions for consumers, the effectiveness of the effort seemslow: \"a significant impact on consumer's decisions could not yet be noticed.\" (33) ", "Attempts to balance the burden between ETS and non-ETS sectors havealready created tension in Germany with respect to the second trading period.

In addition, Germany is proposing to permitevery new power station built between 2008 and 2012 to opt out from CO 2 caps andthe ETS for 14 years, generally to encourage construction of coal-fired facilities.

The ETS applies to energyactivities for all sectors with combustion installations above 20 MW of thermal ratedinput, oil refineries, coke ovens, and, subject to size criteria, iron and steel, cement,lime, glass, ceramics, and pulp and paper facilities. However, Finland and Swedenopted to include small district heating installations with a rated thermal input below20 MW.

The anticipateddeficit between the second trading period for the original 15 Member States can becovered by trading with the newer Member States that anticipate a surplus.

Table 6 provides one series of estimates ofavailable allowances for the Kyoto Protocol's five-year compliance period.Obviously, not all these allowances may be available to the EU alone; othercountries, such as Japan and Canada, may decide to incorporate emissions tradinginto their implementation strategies and acquire allowances from these sources.

The availability of surplus credits created via JI and CDM is restricted by the EC linking directive that requires thatsuch credits be \"supplemental\" to a country's domestic efforts. Each country is tospell out what \"supplemental\" means in its NAP for the second trading period.Individual countries are likely to define that term differently -- restricting allowancetrades and purchases in some countries.", "Another consideration is the overall commitment of the Kyoto Protocol. Asnoted earlier, the ETS only covers a percentage of the overall greenhouse gasemissions in the various Member States of the EU. Some sectors not covered by theETS may grow faster than sectors covered by the ETS, creating difficulties forcompliance. In particular, the transportation area is already a major source ofconcern.", "A final consideration for the ETS is its suitability for directing long-terminvestment toward a low-carbon future -- the ultimate goal of any climate changeprogram. It is too early to tell whether the ETS market signal and individualcountries' NAPs will move investment in the appropriate direction. The early signsare not particularly encouraging, with the 2005-2008 NAPs producing anover-allocation of allowances, and one major Member State, Germany, attemptingto direct its second NAP toward carbon-intensive, coal-fired electric generatingfacilities rather than low-carbon alternatives.

Norway's system covers 51 facilities in the energy andprocess sectors such as oil refining and iron and steel processing, and has severalfeatures in common with the EU ETS. (48) These sectors account for about 10-15% of thecountry's emissions. Other parts of Norway's industry, particularly its offshore oiland gas sector, are covered by the country's carbon tax of almost 40 euro per metrictonne of CO 2 -- much higher than the anticipated allowance price under the tradingprogram. The carbon tax is levied on about 64% of the country's CO 2 emissions --about half the country's total greenhouse gas emissions.

Arguing in favor of regulating CO 2 emissions at theproducer (upstream) level from mobile sources and some stationary sources, theQuota Commission states:", "For these emissions, regulation at theproducer level will not create weaker incentives for reducing emissions thanregulation at the consumer level, because the volume of emissions from a particularcommodity is not dependent on technology. For those process emissions which arerecommended for inclusion in the system, regulation by quotas should be imposedat the end-user level in cases where the processes originate with major industrialcompanies. For process emissions stemming from a series of small sources, e.g.emissions of N 2 O from commercial fertilizers, regulation by quotas should beimposed on retailers, or importers in order to avoid unacceptably high systemcosts.

TheInternational Energy Agency (IEA) states:", "The government had indicated earlierthat it would consider expanding the [trading] system from 2008 to include as manysources of emissions as practical through an upstream system allocating allowancesto fossil fuel producers and importers.
