The Dialogue now serves as the principal security coordination mechanism between the United States and the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)\u00e2\u0080\u0094Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman. The core objectives of the Dialogue are the promotion of intra-GCC and GCC-U.S. cooperation to meet common perceived threats. The Dialogue provides a framework for U.S. engagement with the GCC countries in the following six areas: (1) the improvement of GCC defense capabilities and interoperability; (2) regional security issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Lebanon; (3) counter-proliferation; (4) counter-terrorism and internal security; (5) critical infrastructure protection; and (6) commitments to Iraq.", "The Administration has proposed a series of arms sales intended to enhance the defense capabilities of the GCC countries and improve the interoperability of their militaries in line with the objectives of the Gulf Security Dialogue. In particular, the Administration recently has proposed the sale of defense systems designed to strengthen the maritime, air, and missile defenses of some GCC members. Under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), Congress must be formally notified 30 calendar-days before the Administration can take the final steps to conclude a government-to-government Foreign Military Sale of: 1) major defense equipment to a non-NATO government valued at $14 million or more, 2) defense articles or services valued at $50 million or more, or 3) design and construction services valued at $200 million or more. Congress may review proposed sales and take steps to amend or prohibit them.", "In late 2007, some Members of Congress expressed concern regarding an Administration proposal to sell satellite-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) kits to Saudi Arabia. In the Middle East region, to date, the United States has sold JDAM kits to Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman. Since August 2007, the Administration has notified Congress of proposals to sell 10,000 JDAM kits to Israel and 200 JDAM kits to the United Arab Emirates. On January 14, 2008, the Administration formally notified Congress of a proposal to sell 900 JDAM kits to Saudi Arabia (Transmittal No. 08-18). On January 15, 2008, Representative Anthony Weiner introduced H.J.Res. 76 to prohibit the JDAM sale to Saudi Arabia. The bill was cosponsored by 104 Members of Congress, but was not considered by the House Foreign Affairs Committee within the 30-calendar day review period provided by the AECA. Congress has the option of passing legislation to block or modify any arms sale at any time up to the point of delivery of the items involved.", "This report describes the structure and objectives of the Gulf Security Dialogue; briefly assesses its regional implications; summarizes related proposed arms sales; provides an overview of congressional notification and review procedures; and analyzes recent related activity in the Administration and Congress.

Primary U.S. objectives have included securing the free flow of the region's oil and natural gas to international markets and supporting allied regional governments in their efforts to balance external threats and maintain internal security. In pursuit of these objectives, successive U.S. administrations have demonstrated security commitments to the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)\u00e2\u0080\u0094Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman. Significant arms sales, prolonged military training programs, material pre-positioning and basing arrangements, joint exercises, and direct military interventions have characterized U.S. policy toward the Gulf region.", "The Arab Gulf countries founded the Gulf Cooperation Council in 1981 as a mechanism for resolving internal political and economic issues and coordinating multilateral security cooperation. Both of these goals supported the GCC members states' fundamental desire to minimize the potential need for external intervention in Gulf affairs. Throughout the 1990s, U.S. military posture in the Gulf region and U.S. attempts to promote GCC security coordination were designed to contain potential conventional military threats from Iraq and Iran. In the late 1990s, the Clinton Administration initiated a program to promote cooperation to meet threats from weapons of mass destruction (see below). The emergence of sophisticated transnational terrorist and proliferation networks, the removal of Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq, and the relative strengthening of Iran have now created a more complex strategic environment. The Bush Administration established the Gulf Security Dialogue in May 2006 as a mechanism for reinvigorating established U.S.-GCC defense cooperation, mitigating emerging terrorism and proliferation threats, and responding to changes in the regional strategic balance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Gulf Security Dialogue", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Structure and Objectives", "paragraphs": ["The Administration is seeking to establish the Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD) as the principal security coordination mechanism between the United States and the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.

The Dialogue provides a framework for U.S. engagement with participating GCC countries in the following six areas: (1) the improvement of GCC defense capabilities and interoperability; (2) regional security issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Lebanon; (3) counter-proliferation; (4) counter-terrorism and internal security; (5) critical infrastructure protection; and (6) Iraq.", "The Dialogue serves as a forum for U.S. officials and their counterparts in participating GCC countries to discuss bilateral and multilateral initiatives to address issues in these areas. On the U.S. side, GSD engagement is led jointly by Assistant Secretaries in the Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. To date, formal GSD discussions have been held with each country semi-annually. At the working level, interagency representatives from the National Security Council, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the Department of State, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Staff carry out ongoing bilateral consultations with GCC officials in support of initiatives coordinated under the GSD. Administration officials have stressed that the Dialogue is not intended to replace or detract from longstanding bilateral arrangements between the United States and individual GCC countries, but rather to ensure the complementarity of ongoing efforts and to promote new multilateral cooperation. In the case of some GCC member states, traditional bilateral coordination mechanisms such as established military to military coordination programs have not yet been replaced by interagency, integrated GSD engagement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis and Regional Implications", "paragraphs": ["U.S. policymakers have long sought to balance the security benefits of a sustained U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf region with the material and political costs that such a presence creates. As a result, successive Administrations have promoted intra-GCC and GCC-U.S. cooperation as a potential means of reducing regional dependence on U.S. and allied forces over time. The United States has supported GCC initiatives such as the creation of the small GCC multilateral force known as Peninsula Shield and the establishment of the GCC \"Belt of Cooperation\" air space monitoring network. During the Clinton Administration, the United States promoted bilateral and multilateral cooperation with the GCC countries to meet chemical and biological threats under the auspices of a multi-pillar Cooperative Defense Initiative. As such, the establishment of the Gulf Security Dialogue and the announcement of related arms sale proposals do not mark significant changes in the overall direction of U.S. foreign policy in the region, but rather the renewal and consolidation of a policy trend that has continued over several decades.", "Nevertheless, changes in the regional security environment since the mid-1990s have prompted an evolution in the focus of U.S. engagement with the GCC countries. These changes are reflected in the priorities defined by the Gulf Security Dialogue. The elevation of counterterrorism and counter-proliferation efforts alongside conventional military cooperation signals that increased emphasis is now being placed on these issues. It also suggests that U.S. policy makers may be concerned that existing initiatives are not sufficient to address transnational threats effectively. The inclusion of political consultations on Iraq and regional security issues like Israeli-Palestinian affairs in U.S.-GCC dialogue demonstrates that the United States has acknowledged the importance of these issues to the security calculations of the GCC countries. Terrorist threats to and attempted attacks on critical energy infrastructure in the Gulf region have prompted the opening of discussions on securing key sites, in spite of historic sensitivities regarding sovereignty and foreign participation in the regional energy industry.", "To date, efforts to promote intra-GCC and GCC-U.S. security cooperation have faced significant challenges, some of which remain relevant in the current strategic environment. The GCC countries have unique perspectives on the various security threats they face and on the preferability of various policy responses. Although complex transnational threats may compel the GCC countries to pursue more cooperative policies, some GCC leaders appear to remain reluctant to fully embrace integrated responses. Arab concern about Iranian intentions and military capabilities is evident, but the GCC countries continue to reach out to Iranian leaders to avoid the appearance of siding as a consolidated bloc with the United States against their Gulf neighbor. The GCC countries have endorsed the International Compact for Iraq and have made pledges to Iraq regarding debt forgiveness and diplomatic representation. However, some regional governments led by Sunni Arabs may continue to limit their engagement with the Iraqi government based on perceptions that some Shiite Iraqi leaders are motivated by sectarian interests. Intra-governmental politics limit the willingness of some GCC members to engage in joint military and interagency consultations, both within their own government and with the United States through the Gulf Security Dialogue.", "The stability and security of the Persian Gulf region and its energy resources will likely remain U.S. national security priorities for the foreseeable future. Key short- and medium-term concerns include evolving terrorism and proliferation threats, Iranian investment in ballistic missile and nuclear technology, and growing interest in Gulf security from China, Russia, and India. Looking forward, Congress may seek to influence U.S. foreign policy toward the GCC countries through the appropriation of funds for programs coordinated under the Gulf Security Dialogue and the evaluation of related arms sale proposals. Traditional congressional concerns about preserving Israel's so-called 'qualitative military advantage' are likely to persist.
