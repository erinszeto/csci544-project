(11) The goal of the project was to establish a far-reaching servicedelivery system to improve access, delivery, and quality of services for young children who wereexposed to or at risk of exposure to violence. This effort was to be accomplished by expandingexisting community partnerships between service providers in key fields such as law enforcement,health, mental health, early childhood education, child welfare, substance abuse prevention andtreatment, domestic violence crisis interventions, and others.

Those sites wereBaltimore, Maryland; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Chatham County, North Carolina; Chicago, Illinois;Rochester, New York; Pinellas County, Florida; San Francisco, California; Spokane, Washington;and Washington County, Maine. In 2001, two tribal sites were selected -- the Pueblo Tribe of Zuni,New Mexico, and the Sitka Tribe of Alaska.

Emphasis would continue, however, to be placed upon young childrenfrom infants to six years of age and their families. OJJDP noted that the reason for this particularemphasis was twofold -- research indicated that younger children were at the greatest risk of harmfrom exposure to violence, and because the exposure of younger children was often unrecognized. Furthermore, the number of developmentally specific services as well as the number of resourcesand points of entry into services and support for young children were limited.
