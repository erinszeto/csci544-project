Although LNG has had a record of relative safety for the last 45 years, and no LNG tanker or land-based facility has been attacked by terrorists, proposals for new LNG terminal facilities have generated considerable public concern. Some community groups and governments officials fear that LNG terminals may expose nearby residents to unacceptable hazards. Ongoing public concern about LNG safety has focused congressional attention on the exclusivity of FERC's LNG siting authority, proposals for a regional LNG siting process, the lack of \"remote\" siting requirements in FERC regulations, state permitting requirements under the Clean Water Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act, terrorism attractiveness of LNG, the adequacy of Coast Guard security resources, and other issues.", "LNG terminals directly affect the safety of communities in the states and congressional districts where they are sited, and may influence energy costs nationwide.

Primarily because of low domestic gas prices, LNG imports stayed relatively small\u2014accounting for only 1% of total U.S. gas consumption as late as 2002. In countries with limited domestic gas supplies, however, LNG imports grew dramatically over the same period. Japan, for example, imported 97% of its natural gas supply as LNG in 2002, more than 11 times as much LNG as the United States. South Korea, France, Spain, and Taiwan also became heavy LNG importers.", "Natural gas demand growth accelerated in the United States from the mid-1980s through 2000 due to environmental concerns about other energy sources, widespread building of natural gas-fired electricity generation, and low natural gas prices. Domestic gas supplies have not always kept up with growth in demand, however, so prices have become volatile. At the same time, international LNG costs have fallen since the 1970s because of increased supplies and more efficient production and transportation, making LNG more competitive with domestic natural gas.", "In 2003 testimony before Congress, the Federal Reserve Chairman called for a sharp increase in LNG imports to help avert a potential barrier to U.S. economic growth. According to the Chairman's testimony: \"... high gas prices projected in the American distant futures market have made us a potential very large importer.... Access to world natural gas supplies will require a major expansion of LNG terminal import capacity.\" Likewise, FERC Commissioner Suedeen Kelly told industry representatives in 2006 that,\"while LNG has made a marginal contribution to gas supply over the last 30 years, it is poised to make a major contribution in the future.\" Because burning natural gas produces only half as much carbon dioxide as burning coal, and also less carbon dioxide than vehicular fuels like gasoline, some also anticipate natural gas demand to grow as the preferred fuel in the near-term for power plants and motor vehicles under a national policy of carbon control.

Such clouds may begin near the ground (or water) when they are still very cold, but rise in air as they warm, diminishing the threat to people. Due to its extremely low temperature, LNG could injure people or damage equipment through direct contact.

LNG tankers have experienced groundings and collisions during this period, but none has resulted in a major spill. The LNG marine safety record is partly due to the double-hulled design of LNG tankers. This design makes them more robust and less prone to accidental spills than old single-hulled oil and fuel tankers like the Exxon Valdez , which caused a major Alaskan oil spill after grounding in 1989. LNG tankers also carry radar, global positioning systems, automatic distress systems and beacons to signal if they are in trouble. Cargo safety systems include instruments that can shut operations if they deviate from normal as well as gas and fire detection systems.", "The safety record of onshore LNG terminals is more mixed. There are more than 40 LNG terminals (and more than 150 other LNG storage facilities) worldwide.

Two of these accidents caused single fatalities of facility workers\u2014one in Algeria in 1977, and another at Cove Point, Maryland, in 1979. On January 19, 2004, a fire at the LNG processing facility in Skikda, Algeria killed an estimated 27 workers, injured 74 others, destroyed a processing plant, and damaged a marine berth. (It did not, however, damage a second processing plant or three large LNG storage tanks also located at the terminal, nor did the accident injure the rest of the 12,000 workers at the complex.) It was considered the worst petrochemical plant fire in Algeria in over 40 years. According to press reports, the accident resulted from poor maintenance rather than a facility design flaw.

Consequently, some fear that LNG hazards may be misrepresented by government agencies, or that certain LNG hazards may simply not be understood well enough to support a terminal siting approval.", "Hazard analyses for LNG terminals and shipping depend heavily upon computer models to approximate the effects of hypothetical accidents. Federal siting standards specifically require computer modeling of thermal radiation and flammable vapor cloud exclusion zones (49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 193.2057, 2059). Such models are necessary because there have been no major LNG incidents of the type envisioned in LNG safety research and because historical LNG experiments have been limited in scale and scope. But LNG hazards models simulate complex physical phenomena and are inherently uncertain, relying on calculations and input assumptions about which fair-minded analysts may legitimately disagree. Even small differences in an LNG hazard model have led to significantly different conclusions.

In this view, worst-case hazard studies alone do not provide a sufficient basis for evaluating public safety. Unfortunately, few LNG safety studies comprehensively and convincingly address the probability of catastrophic accidents or attacks actually occurring. In part, this shortcoming arises from a lack of historical LNG incidents and detailed terrorist threat information on which to base such probabilities.

Any federal permit applicant for a project that may discharge pollutants into navigable waters must provide the permitting agency with a certification from the state in which the discharge originates or will originate that the discharge is in compliance with the applicable provisions of the CWA, including the state's water quality standards. States potentially could use their certification authority under the Clean Water Act to influence the siting of an LNG project by attaching conditions to the required water quality certificate or by denying certification. This certification authority has become an important tool used by states to protect the integrity of their waters. It is worth noting that the Energy Policy Act of 2005 created one potential avenue of relief for potential developers by providing for expedited review in a federal court of any order or action, or alleged inaction, by a federal or state agency acting under the authority of federal law.

A state wishing to forestall the licensing of an LNG terminal in its coastal waters could deny the certification required by the CZMA. However, unlike the state-issued water quality certificates required for federal permitting by the Clean Water Act, the CZMA provides an alternative to applicants who are unable to obtain state certification. Under the CZMA, applicants may appeal the state's decision to the Department of Commerce, which may find that the activity is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of national security, and thus override the state's denial of certification. One analyst has suggested that there is a specific set of circumstances in which a state could create a regulatory stalemate pursuant to its CZMA authority by rejecting an application as incomplete (rather than rejecting it as improper or by failing to act). Under these circumstances the statute does not grant the Secretary of Commerce authority to review the decision.

(33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1502(9a))", "The Deepwater Port Act sets out a detailed process for offshore facility siting applications. The act also authorizes regulations addressing potential threats to the environment or human welfare posed by development of offshore LNG facilities (33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1504, 1508; 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 148). The act also requires regulations for the designation of safety zones around deepwater ports (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1509(d)). Among the amendments to the act is a provision exempting LNG terminals from the limitation on the number of \"deepwater ports\" that can be located in a designated \"application area,\" a provision applicable to oil terminals (33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1504(d)(4), (i)(4)). Additionally, a preexisting provision of the act allows the governor of a state adjacent to a proposed offshore LNG facility to have that facility license conform to state environmental protection, land and water use, or coastal zone management programs (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508(b)).", "The USCG's regulations regarding LNG facilities are codified throughout 33 C.F.R., with major provisions in part 127. These regulations detail the requirements for siting applications, which include information about the proposed location, design, construction, and operation (33 C.F.R. \u00a7 148.109). NEPA analysis is often instrumental in siting and safety-related decisions at specific proposed facilities and is facilitated by the Minerals Management Service, the agency responsible for offshore minerals extraction and the Outer Continental Shelf leasing program. Unlike requirements for onshore facilities, the Coast Guard does not appear to require generally applicable exclusion zones for offshore facilities, but relies instead on case-by-case designation of safety zones. Additional USCG regulations include agency oversight of emergency procedures, security, fire protection, and design and construction standards (33 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 127.109, 127.701-127.711, 127.601-127.617, 127.1101-127.1113, 149.205)."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
