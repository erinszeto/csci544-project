In serving Congress with nonpartisan and objective analysis and research, CRS does not make recommendations or take positions on particular options."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Independence", "paragraphs": ["Federal laws and administrative standards require IGs to be independent of the entities and/or activities they evaluate. There is no standard definition, however, for what constitutes IG independence. Rather, IGs derive independence from a combination of statutory authorities and requirements, such as the requirement that IGs be appointed on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in certain skill sets, and independence and transparency of IG budgets. It could be argued that challenges remain to ensuring that IGs possess the requisite independence to carry out their missions. Congress may consider several broad questions if it weighs further options related to IG independence, such as the following:", "What constitutes IG independence? IGs, agencies, and Congress may perceive independence differently, and by extension, may interpret and exercise statutory authorities that affect independence in varied (and possibly divergent) ways. A GAO report that assessed an IG's level of independence stated the following: To a large extent, independence is a state of mind of the auditor. The extent to which an auditor's independence has been affected by surrounding influences cannot be easily assessed by a third party. Any effort to assess auditor independence requires considerable subjective judgment, and reasonable people have room for disagreement. What factors affect IG independence? Several internal and external factors may also affect an IG's independence. Examples of internal factors include self-interest, familiarity with agency personnel in units undergoing a review, and other \"threats to independence\" outlined in CIGIE's quality standards. Examples of external factors include IG statutory authorities\u2014such as appointment and removal methods and access to agency records\u2014structure and leadership of the affiliated entity, and political influence. What is the appropriate balance between IG independence and agency management? The IG Act established a dual reporting structure that requires IGs to report to both Congress and their affiliated entity heads. This structure creates potential tension between IGs and their affiliated entity heads. An IG, therefore, must maintain independence from the agency head to assess the agency's programs and operations objectively while also fostering a working relationship with agencies to ensure the effectiveness of those assessments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appointment and Removal Methods", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier in this report, IGs can generally be appointed under one of three methods: (1) by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate (PAS); (2) by the President alone (PA); or (3) by the affiliated entity head. Observers have asserted that appointment and removal methods affect an IG's independence and effectiveness\u2014both directly and indirectly\u2014though opinions vary regarding the level and type of impact. ", "Direct impact . Some observers have argued that the PAS appointment method strengthens IG independence. For example, GAO general counsel Gary Kepplinger suggested that PAS-appointed IGs experience greater organizational independence compared to agency-appointed IGs, noting that \"the further removed from the appointment source is from the entity to be audited, the greater the level of independence.\" Others have asserted that PAS appointments\u2014including converting an IG from agency appointment to a PAS appointment\u2014might politicize the IG position and reduce IG effectiveness. Similar debates exist regarding IG removal methods. Some observers have expressed concern over potential politicization of the IG removal process, which may undermine IG independence. Some have suggested that limiting the removal of IGs \"for cause\" could mitigate arbitrary removal (such as for political reasons) and enhance IG independence. Others have asserted that this limitation might prevent the President or agency heads from removing IGs for legitimate reasons (such as poor performance), thus diminishing IG accountability. Indirect impact. IG appointment and removal methods may also indirectly affect independence by contributing to IG vacancies. Concerns exist that the IG vetting and confirmation processes (particularly PAS appointments) take too long, leading to prolonged IG vacancies and use of acting IGs. It could also be argued that removal methods (such as \"for cause\" removal and term limits) might increase the number and length of IG vacancies. Some observers have argued that acting IGs are inherently, or may be perceived as, less independent or effective compared to permanent IGs for various reasons. Examples include not having gone through formal vetting processes, reduced ability to set long-term strategies and priorities, and perverse incentives to not report problems in agency operations or resist political pressure from agency heads\u2014particularly for those seeking the permanent position. For example, in a letter to the majority and minority leaders of the Senate for the 115 th Congress, CIGIE stated that", "no matter how able or experienced an Acting Inspector General may be, a permanent IG has the ability to exercise more authority in setting policies and procedures and, by virtue of the authority provided for in the IG Act, inevitably will be seen as having greater independence.", "Other observers have asserted that acting IGs are not inherently less independent, nor do they appear or are perceived as less independent, than permanent IGs. For example, in a GAO report, some permanent IGs and OIG employees responding to a survey provided several reasons for why acting IGs are not less independent than permanent IGs. Examples include that acting IGs have the same statutory authorities as permanent IGs, are held to the same standards as permanent IGs, and are typically career OIG employees who prioritize independence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Audit Follow-Up and Oversight of IG Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["While IGs are authorized to develop recommendations to improve government programs and operations, they are not authorized to enforce them.

Certain agencies must \"take action to address deficiencies\" identified in IG reports or to certify that no action is necessary or appropriate. ", "Congress and other observers have expressed concern about the total number of unimplemented IG recommendations and potential barriers to resolving them, such as the quality and consistency of agency and IG audit follow-up procedures, tracking unimplemented recommendations, and determining the resolution of recommendations. Some observers have discussed options to improve audit follow-up and oversight of IG recommendations, such as", "standardized and enhanced audit follow-up procedures, including defined roles and responsibilities for IGs and their affiliated agencies; uniform terminology for the status of IG recommendations, including a standard definition for what constitutes an \"open\" recommendation; systematic tracking of and reporting on the total number and status of IG recommendations; prioritization of IG recommendations; and a centralized, public database of all open recommendations.

Traditionally, OIG workforces have been primarily composed of auditors and investigators, though OIG workforce professions and skills have diversified. These positions generally require education and experience in audit and investigative procedures, such as assessing agency programs according to government auditing standards and compiling and analyzing evidence. However, the qualification requirements for these positions may not require experience in certain specialty areas that OIGs might evaluate, such as information technology (IT).", "Some have argued that OIGs should further diversify their workforces, including by building expertise in specialty areas beyond auditing and investigations such as IT, cybersecurity, and data analysis. Some observers have further argued that broadening the mix of OIG personnel skills could improve the quality and utility of audits and inspections or evaluations. For example, it could be argued that building IT expertise within an OIG might enhance audit findings and recommendations related to securing and modernizing legacy IT systems\u2014a key management and performance challenge facing multiple agencies.

The Partnership for Public Service characterized this dichotomy as \"the difference between counting the number of people who show up at a job training program, versus examining the number of attendees who get and keep a job after participating in the program.\" Observers have further argued that greater emphasis on program outcomes could better improve agency programs and operations and, by extension, increase IG effectiveness. Some IGs already assess program outcomes in addition to outputs and compliance. For example, a Department of Labor IG audit concluded that the Job Corps program could not demonstrate that it helped place participants in meaningful jobs related to their training due primarily to noncompliance with certain program policies and ineffective transition services.", "In addition, some observers have argued that certain statutory requirements do not promote IG effectiveness. For example, the Project on Government Oversight argued that statutorily required metrics in IG semiannual reports focus on program outputs\u2014such as the dollar value of disallowed costs\u2014but not necessarily on program outcomes and that the IG peer review process focuses on compliance with applicable quality standards and does not evaluate the quality or effectiveness of an IG's work.
