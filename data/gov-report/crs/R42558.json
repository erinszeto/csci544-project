Despite these differing costs, DLA-E establishes a \"global leveled set price\" for each fuel type\u2014a single price for a gallon of that fuel type, regardless of where it is purchased. For example, DLA-E charges DOD customers the same price for a gallon of JP-8 (military jet fuel) purchased in Northern Afghanistan, Japan, or Fort Benning, Georgia.

The fully burdened cost of fuel that is used near a DLA-E delivery point in the United States is generally close to the DLA-E set price. In contrast, in rare cases, the fully burdened cost of fuel delivered by helicopter to a remote and isolated location can run into the hundreds of dollars per gallon. Costs for supplying fuel during overseas contingency operations, particularly costs for logistics and force protection, generally increase the fully burdened cost of fuel. A DOD analysis concluded that the \"hidden costs\" associated with the fully burdened cost of fuel have led DOD to \"systematically undervalue the true cost of supplying fuel to its battlespace forces.\"", "A number of studies have attempted to calculate the fully burdened cost of fuel in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2010, the Marine Corps estimated the fully burdened cost of fuel in Afghanistan at between $9 to $16 per gallon if delivered by land, and between $29 to $31 per gallon if delivered by air.

In DOD's FY2012 budget, for example, the cost of oil was forecast to be $130 per barrel, but oil prices in FY2012 rose to $156 per barrel, reportedly leading to an unfunded obligation of more than $3 billion across DOD.

Navy officials state that a one-dollar increase in the price of a barrel of petroleum costs the Navy alone about $30 million annually. (By extension, since DOD in FY2011 used about 117 million barrels of oil, a one-dollar increase in the price of a barrel of petroleum would cost DOD as a whole about $117 million.)

There are alternatives that the Navy could pursue to reduce its dependence on petroleum-based fuels, such as nuclear-propulsion for surface combatants other than aircraft carriers or kite-assisted propulsion for Navy auxiliary ships. It is not clear whether developing advanced biofuels would provide the Navy (and the nation) with much protection against volatility in petroleum-based fuel prices. Since advanced biofuels are intended to be drop-in substitutes for petroleum-based fuels, providers of cost-competitive advanced biofuels might simply adjust their prices up and down to match changes in prices for petroleum-based fuels. An alternative way to insulate the Navy (and DOD) from short-term volatility in petroleum-based fuel costs would be to purchase fuel through multiyear contracts that lock in prices over the term of the contract\u2014an approach that has long been used by commercial airlines and other firms to insulate themselves from volatility in energy prices. The Navy's decision to expend funding in an attempt to jumpstart a domestic advanced biofuels industry, and to pay a cost premium for early biofuel purchases, is not consistent with the decision by the Air Force\u2014a service that uses even more petroleum-based fuel than the Department of the Navy\u2014to not do these things. Given the current high cost of advanced biofuels, and technical challenges involved in developing cost-competitive advanced biofuels, it is not clear whether the Navy's initiative, even with the added efforts of USDA and DOE, will succeed in establishing a commercially viable domestic advanced biofuels industry or in reducing the costs of advanced biofuels to levels competitive with those of petroleum-based fuels. Particularly in light of current and future constraints on the Navy's budget, funding that the Navy is proposing to spend on advanced biofuels could be better spent on other Navy program priorities, such as platform acquisition.
