Resolution 2231, which was adopted in July 2015, prohibits arms transfers to or from Iran, but only for five years, and contains a voluntary restriction on Iran's development of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles for only up to eight years.", "On May 8, President Trump announced that the United States would no longer participate in the JCPOA and would reimpose sanctions that had been suspended pursuant to the agreement. The other powers that negotiated the accord with Iran\u2014Russia, China, France, Britain, and Germany\u2014opposed the U.S. decision and have been meeting with Iranian officials to continue implementing the JCPOA.

Gas centrifuges enrich uranium by spinning uranium hexafluoride gas at high speeds to increase the concentration of the uranium-235 isotope. Such centrifuges can produce low-enriched uranium (LEU), which can be used for fuel in nuclear power reactors or research reactors, and weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU). LEU used in nuclear power reactors typically contains less than 5% uranium-235; research reactor fuel can be made using 20% uranium-235; HEU used in nuclear weapons typically contains about 90% uranium-235. Tehran argues that it is enriching uranium for use as fuel in nuclear power reactors and nuclear research reactors.", "Natanz Commercial-Scale Fuel Enrichment Plant . In this facility, Iran is using first-generation centrifuges, called IR-1 centrifuges, to produce LEU containing up to 5% uranium-235. As of November 2013, Iran had installed about 15,400 of these centrifuges, approximately 8,800 of which are enriching uranium. Iran had also installed about 1,000 centrifuges with a greater enrichment efficiency, called IR-2m centrifuges, in the facility, but they are not enriching uranium. Natanz Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant . Iran had been using IR-1 centrifuges in this facility to produce LEU containing approximately 20% uranium-235 until halting this work pursuant to the JPA. Tehran's production of LEU enriched to the 20% level has caused concern because such production requires approximately 90% of the effort necessary to produce weapons-grade HEU, which, as noted, contains approximately 90% uranium-235.

Potential nuclear-related exports to Iran would remain subject to the Nuclear Suppliers Group's (NSG) export guidelines. The April 2018 State Department report noted that \"Tehran's adherence\" to its JCPOA commitments \"will hinder its ability to produce a nuclear weapon even after the time-bound provisions of the deal expire, helping to ensure that its nuclear program remains exclusively peaceful in nature.\" ", "The JCPOA also describes other monitoring and inspections. For 15 years, the IAEA will monitor the stored Iranian centrifuges and related infrastructure. During this time, Iran will also permit the IAEA \"daily access\" to \"relevant buildings\" at the Natanz facilities. For 20 years, Tehran will allow the agency to verify Iran's inventory of certain centrifuge components and the manufacturing facilities for such components. Additionally, Iran is to allow the IAEA to monitor the country's uranium mills for 25 years and to monitor Iran's plant for producing heavy water. As noted, Amano also reported that, since Implementation Day, the IAEA \"verified and monitored Iran's implementation of its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA.\"", "IAEA Director-General Yukiya Amano told reporters on July 14, 2015, that the agency's workload would increase under the JCPOA. On August 25, 2015, the IAEA Board of Governors authorized Amano \"to undertake the verification and monitoring\" of Iran's nuclear-related JCPOA commitments \"subject to the availability of funds and consistent with our standard safeguards practices.\" The IAEA has integrated these costs into its regular budget. ", "The Obama Administration argued that these provisions will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon covertly. Then-Secretary of State John Kerry explained in a September 2, 2015, speech that Iran \"would have to come up with a complete ... and completely secret nuclear supply chain,\" adding that \"our intelligence community and our Energy Department ... both agree Iran could never get away with such a deception.\"", "The JCPOA and U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 contain a variety of reporting provisions for the IAEA. For example, the resolution requests the agency's Director General ", "to provide regular updates to the IAEA Board of Governors and, as appropriate, in parallel to the Security Council on Iran's implementation of its commitments under the JCPOA and also to report to the IAEA Board of Governors and in parallel to the Security Council at any time if the Director General has reasonable grounds to believe there is an issue of concern directly affecting fulfillment of JCPOA commitments.", "It is worth noting that, although the IAEA reports findings of its inspection and monitoring activities and the JCPOA-established Joint Commission monitors the parties' implementation of the agreement, compliance determinations are national decisions.", "Access to Undeclared Sites . The JCPOA describes arrangements for the IAEA to gain access to Iranian sites other than those Tehran declares to the agency \"if the IAEA has concerns regarding undeclared nuclear materials or activities, or activities inconsistent with\" the JCPOA. If the IAEA has such concerns at one of these sites, the agency \"will provide Iran the basis for such concerns and request clarification.\" The IAEA could request access to the site if Iran's explanation did not provide sufficient clarification, and Tehran may respond by proposing alternative means of resolving the IAEA's concerns. If such means did not resolve the IAEA's concerns or the two sides did not \"reach satisfactory arrangements ... within 14 days of the IAEA's original request for access,\" Iran \"would resolve the IAEA's concerns through necessary means agreed between Iran and the IAEA.\" Tehran would make such a decision \"in consultation with the members of the Joint Commission\" established by the JCPOA. If the two sides cannot reach agreement, the commission \"would advise on the necessary means to resolve the IAEA's concerns\" if at least a majority of commission members agreed to do so. The Joint Commission would have seven days to reach a decision, and Iran is required to implement the necessary means within three additional days. ( The total time for the stipulated procedures would be 24 days. ) ", "The JCPOA contains several provisions that address Iranian concerns that IAEA inspectors may try to obtain information unrelated to the country's nuclear program. For example, the IAEA may only request access to the types of facilities described above \"for the sole reason to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA.\" In addition, the agency would provide Iran with written reasons for access and \"make available relevant information.\"", "Procurement Channel. The JCPOA established a \"procurement channel\" for Iran's nuclear program. The Joint Commission established by the JCPOA is to monitor and approve transfers made via the channel for 10 years. The agreement requires Iran to provide the IAEA with \"access to the locations of intended use of all items, materials, equipment, goods and technology\" listed in the NSG's \"Guidelines for Nuclear Transfers.\" Moreover, Tehran is to permit exporting governments to \"verify the end-use of all items, materials, equipment, goods and technology\" listed in the NSG's \"Guidelines for Transfers of Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Equipment, Materials, Software, and Related Technology.\"", "IAEA officials will have access to information about and may participate in meetings regarding such transfers when they are proposed. According to a June 2016 GAO report, IAEA officials asserted that \"there is additional work to be done in informing exporting countries of their obligations and standardizing the data that the countries would report to IAEA so that they are usable to the agency.\" ", "According to a December 8, 2017, report by U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the Security Council had received 37 nuclear-related export proposals since Implementation Day; the council approved 24 of those proposals and disapproved three. Five proposals were withdrawn by the submitting states and three were under review.", "Broader Conclusion . The JCPOA also indicates that the IAEA will pursue drawing a \"Broader Conclusion that all nuclear material in Iran remains in peaceful activities.\" According to the IAEA, the agency can draw such a conclusion for states with comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols in force. According to the IAEA, ", "The conclusion of the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities is drawn when the activities performed under an additional protocol have been completed, when relevant questions and inconsistencies have been addressed, and when no indications have been found by the IAEA that, in its judgement, would constitute a safeguards concern.", "The average time for the IAEA to draw the broader conclusion for states with complex nuclear programs has been five to seven years. Former IAEA Deputy Director General Heinonen wrote that \"it has taken up to five years for the IAEA to reach a 'broader conclusion' for other countries with large nuclear programs that are in good standing under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\" Amano explained on March 20, 2017, that \"I cannot tell how many years it will take\" to draw such a conclusion for Iran, adding that \"it depends very much on the level of cooperation from Iran.\" In October 2017, Amano stated that the process is \"likely to take many years,\" and there are no recent public indications that the IAEA is close to issuing that conclusion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Cooperation", "paragraphs": ["The JCPOA discusses a variety of nuclear projects in Iran that would include other countries.

Some, but not necessarily all, of the P5+1 countries, will participate in these projects. The JCPOA also envisions forms of technical cooperation between Iran and the IAEA.

As noted, the U.S. government assesses that Tehran has not mastered all of the necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon. In addition, for 15 years Iran is to refrain from \"producing or acquiring plutonium or uranium metals or their alloys\" and \"conducting R&D on plutonium or uranium (or their alloys) metallurgy, or casting, forming, or machining plutonium or uranium metal.\" Producing uranium or plutonium metals is a key step in producing nuclear weapons.

But past reports from Amano to the agency's Board of Governors said that, although the IAEA could verify that there was no diversion of nuclear material from Iran's declared nuclear facilities, it could not conclude that no nuclear weapons-related activity was taking place in the country.", "According to the JCPOA, Tehran would \"complete\" a series of steps set out in an Iran-IAEA \"Roadmap for Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues.\" According to Amano, this road map set out \"a process, under the November 2013 Framework for Cooperation, to enable the Agency, with the cooperation of Iran, to make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme.\" \"All the activities contained in the road-map were implemented in accordance with the agreed schedule,\" according to a December 2, 2015, report from Amano. ", "On December 2, 2015, in advance of the December 15 deadline in the road map, Amano presented the stipulated report, as a final assessment on all past and present outstanding [Iranian nuclear] issues described in a November 2011 report. It indicated that the information provided by Iran did not allow the IAEA to resolve some outstanding issues and also casts doubt on some of the information's accuracy. Nevertheless, the report assesses that \"before the end of 2003, an organizational structure was in place in Iran suitable for the coordination of a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.\" Iran conducted \"a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device ... prior to the end of 2003 as a coordinated effort,\" the report says, adding that \"some [nuclear weapons-related] activities took place after 2003,\" but \"were not part of a coordinated effort.\" The report concludes that \"these activities did not advance beyond feasibility and scientific studies, and the acquisition of certain relevant technical competencies and capabilities\" and notes that the IAEA \"has no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009.\" Amano told the IAEA board on December 15 that, although \"it was not possible for the Agency to reconstruct all the details of activities conducted by Iran in the past, we were able to clarify enough elements to provide an assessment of the whole picture.\" The IAEA reiterated this conclusion on May 1, 2018, following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's disclosure of documents concerning Iran's past nuclear weapons program, though the agency did not comment on the documents specifically. On June 5, 2018, Nicole Shampaine, the Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires at the U.S. Mission to International Organizations in Vienna, stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's April 2018 disclosure of documents concerning Iran's past nuclear weapons program \"further reaffirms\" the IAEA's December 2015 conclusion that Iran had conducted such research in the past. In accordance with the road map, Iran presented, in writing, its \"comprehensive assessment to the IAEA\" on Amano's report, on January 7, 2016. The document apparently acknowledges Iranian \"scientific studies of dual-use technologies\" for \"peaceful civilian or conventional military uses.\" But the statement reiterated previous Iranian claims that the country has done no work on nuclear weapons and that some of the evidence underlying the agency's concerns is inauthentic.", "Virtual Closure of the Issue. The JCPOA states that, following Amano's report, the P5+1 \"in their capacity as members of the [IAEA] Board of Governors, will submit a resolution to the Board of Governors for taking necessary action, with a view to closing the issue.\" The board adopted a resolution on December 15 which closed \"the Board's consideration\" of the \"outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear programme.\" ", "The Board is no longer focused on Iran's compliance with past Security Council resolutions and past issues concerning Iran's safeguards agreement, but is instead focused on JCPOA implementation and verification and monitoring in Iran in light of Security Council Resolution 2231. The resolution requests the Director General to issue quarterly reports to the board regarding Iran's \"implementation of its relevant commitments under the JCPOA for the full duration of those commitments.\" The Director General is also to report to the Board of Governors and the Security Council \"at any time if the Director General has reasonable grounds to believe there is an issue of concern\" regarding Tehran's compliance with its JCPOA or safeguards obligations. It is worth noting that the IAEA will not be able to draw the \"Broader Conclusion that all nuclear material in Iran remains in peaceful activities\" without addressing these issues. The April 2018 State Department report notes that closing the agenda item concerning Iran's past military-related nuclear activities \"does not preclude the IAEA from investigating if there is reason to believe Iran is pursuing any covert nuclear activities, including nuclear weapons work.\"", "Issue Significance. The significance of resolving these issues for ensuring that Iran's current program is for purely peaceful purposes is unclear. Former IAEA Deputy Director General Olli Heinonen argued during a July 2014 Senate hearing that gaining full understanding of Iran's past suspected nuclear weapons program is important for determining that Iran is not reconstituting that program and also for determining the probability that Iran will use a future centrifuge program to produce nuclear weapons. However, in April 2015, Jofi Joseph, a former Obama Administration official whose portfolio included the Iran nuclear issue, commented", "Some argue that it will be very difficult to identify future covert Iranian nuclear weapons efforts without a detailed understanding of what happened before. I'm not so sure. It is not clear if the individuals involved with the previous [nuclear weapons program] would be the ones tapped again for a future covert program or whether a clear understanding of their previous actions would help identify future efforts.", "Former State Department official Robert Einhorn argued that", "It is sometimes argued that full Iranian disclosure is essential to designing an effective JCPOA monitoring system. But the provisions of an agreement that could be most effective in monitoring small-scale weaponization activities would be more intrusive than any sovereign state would be willing to accept (e.g., keeping close track of all scientists with the necessary expertise, on-site verification of all equipment in the country that could be used in nuclear weapons design and diagnostics). With or without full knowledge of past Iranian activities, it would have been nearly impossible to reach agreement on such intrusive arrangements.", "Einhorn also explained that ", "the United States already has considerable knowledge of past Iranian nuclear weapons work. And in any event, in calculating how much time it would have to thwart an Iranian breakout, the United States would have to make the conservative assumption that Iran had made substantial headway in weaponization and would not require much time to proceed from the production of fissile material to the fabrication of a weapon. It is unlikely that anything the Iranians might say about past weaponization efforts would affect U.S. planning to stop an Iranian breakout, especially because whatever they said would hardly be taken at face value."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Iranian Compliance with the JCPOA Nuclear Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Regarding Iranian compliance with the JCPOA, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (INARA, P.L. 114-17 ) requires the President to \"determine whether the President is able to certify\" that Iran", "\"is transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing the agreement, including all related technical or additional agreements\"; \"has not committed a material breach\" of the agreement or cured any material breaches that Iran has committed; and \"has not taken any action, including covert activities, that could significantly advance its nuclear weapons program.\"", "Then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson issued this certification on July 17, 2017. , All official reports and statements from the United Nations, European Union, the IAEA, and the P5+1 indicate that Iran has complied with the JCPOA.

Security Council, which would be necessary to trigger the reimposition of U.N. sanctions, be accompanied by \"a description of the good-faith efforts the participant made to exhaust the dispute resolution process specified in this JCPOA.\" The agreement also states that the P5+1 and Iran \"commit to implement this JCPOA in good faith and in a constructive atmosphere, based on mutual respect, and to refrain from any action inconsistent with the letter, spirit and intent of this JCPOA that would undermine its successful implementation.\" Whether this course of action violates UNSCR 2231 is unclear. U.S. officials have argued that the JCPOA is not legally binding.

Spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Behrouz Kamalvandi stated on June 5 that the organization \"will start the process of boosting the capacity of the country's uranium enrichment,\" by increasing Iran's capacity to produce uranium hexafluoride.

Iran \"will begin building a centrifuge rotor plant,\" he noted.

At Iran's request, the Joint Commission held meetings, attended by all of the JCPOA parties except for the United States, on May 25 and July 6. At the conclusion of the July 6 meeting, the Joint Commission participants reaffirmed their commitment to the EU \"practical measures\" enumerated above. However, President Rouhani reacted to the pledges by saying that \"Unfortunately, the EU's package of proposals lacked an operational solution and a specific method for cooperation.\" Rouhani's reaction likely reflected a lack of confidence that EU and other countries can counter the effects of a steady stream of announcements by EU, Japanese, South Korean, and Indian companies that they are leaving the Iran market rather than face the risk of reimposed U.S. sanctions. The corporate announcements are the result, at least in part, of Trump Administration official statements that the Administration plans to fully enforce reimposed sanctions and will likely deny requests by companies and their governments for waivers or exemptions to the U.S. sanctions.

Nuclear Weapons Development", "An effective nuclear weapons capability has three major elements: producing fissile material in sufficient quantity and quality for a nuclear explosive device; designing and weaponizing a survivable nuclear warhead; and producing an effective means for delivering the weapon, such as a ballistic missile. The U.S. government assesses that, although Iran could eventually produce nuclear weapons, it has not yet decided to do so and has not mastered all of the necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon. Tehran had a nuclear weapons program but halted it in 2003, according to U.S. government estimates.", "Before the JCOA took effect, then-Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman explained during an October 3, 2013, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that Iran would have needed as much as one year to produce a nuclear weapon if the government made the decision to do so. This estimate took into account the amount of time that Iran would have needed to produce a sufficient amount of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU), which is widely regarded as the most difficult task in building nuclear weapons, as well as to develop the other components necessary for a nuclear weapon. This estimate did not include the time that Iran would need to be able to render a nuclear weapon deliverable by a ballistic missile. Then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in January 2012 that Iran would have needed \"possibly ... one to two years in order to put [a nuclear weapon] on a deliverable vehicle of some sort.\" ", "A senior intelligence official explained during a December 2007 press briefing that the \"acquisition of fissile material\" was the \"governing element in any timelines\" regarding Iran's production of a \"nuclear device.\" However, the estimate articulated by Sherman assumed that Iran would need two to three months to produce enough weapons-grade HEU for a nuclear weapon. This estimate also apparently assumed that Iran would use its declared nuclear facilities to produce fissile material for a weapon. The other assumptions behind the estimate are not clear.", "Tehran would probably use covert enrichment facilities to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons\u2014a tactic that would require a longer period of time, according to testimony from then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during an April 18, 2013, Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. In his February 2016 testimony to Congress, Director Clapper said that ", "We continue to assess that Iran's overarching strategic goals of enhancing its security, prestige, and regional influence have led it to pursue capabilities to meet its nuclear energy and technology goals and give it the ability to build missile-deliverable nuclear weapons, if it chooses to do so. Its pursuit of these goals will dictate its level of adherence to the JCPOA over time. We do not know whether Iran will eventually decide to build nuclear weapons. ", "As noted in the body of this report, U.S. officials have argued that the International Atomic Energy Agency would likely detect an Iranian attempt to use its safeguarded facilities to produce weapons-grade HEU.
