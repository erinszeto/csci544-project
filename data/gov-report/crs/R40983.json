On June 25, 1996, Representative John McHugh introduced H.R. 3717 , the Postal Reform Act of 1996. The reform movement culminated in the 109 th Congress. On December 9, 2006, Congress enacted H.R. 6407 , the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA). President George W. Bush signed it into law on December 20, 2006 (PAEA; P.L. 109-435 ; 120 Stat. 3198). ", "A number of factors encouraged the movement for postal reform. Perhaps foremost were the financial challenges of the USPS. First class mail use was declining as customers substituted electronic alternatives, such as e-mail and online bill paying, for hard-copy letters. Yet the USPS's costs\u2014about 76% of which were labor-related\u2014rose with the addition of 2 million new addresses each year and mounting obligations for USPS future retiree health benefits.", "Additionally, the USPS, its board of governors, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), mailers' organizations, postal labor unions, and most recently a presidential commission said that the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 no longer provided a viable business model. The rate-setting process was criticized for preventing the USPS from responding quickly to an increasingly competitive marketplace. Critics also argued that long-standing political and statutory restrictions impeded efforts to modernize the mail processing network and close unneeded facilities.", "Finally, passage of the Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 (PCSRSFRA; P.L. 108-18 ; 117 Stat. 624) helped sow the seeds for reform. The PCSRSFRA was enacted after it was discovered that the USPS was over-funding its retirees' pensions. The act reduced the USPS's pension outlays. However, it shifted the costs of postal employees' military\u00a0service-related pension costs from the U.S. Treasury to the USPS\u2014a $27 billion obligation. The PCSRSFRA also required much of the reduction from the previous pension outlay levels to be put toward lowering the USPS's debt and funding an escrow account. The law did not, however, dedicate the escrow fund to any particular use (e.g., postal worker benefits), meaning that the USPS had to make a large annual payment that neither provided operational benefits nor generated revenues. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Major Provisions of the PAEA", "paragraphs": ["According to a CRS analysis using CQ.com's \"Law Track\" tool, the PAEA makes more than 150 changes to current federal law. The law's major changes include the following:", "Definition of the term \"Postal Service.\" Section 101 of the law defines \"postal service\" to mean \"the delivery of letters, printed matter, or mailable packages, including acceptance, collection, sorting, transportation, or other functions ancillary thereto.\" This provision is significant because previously the law did not define \"postal service,\" an omission, critics have contended, that permitted the USPS to undertake nonpostal activities (e.g., the sale of prepaid phone cards) to the detriment of private-sector firms. Alteration of the USPS's budget submission p rocess. Section 603 altered the budget submission process for the USPS's Office of Inspector General (USPSOIG) and the Postal Rate Commission (PRC). In the past, the USPSOIG and the PRC submitted their budget requests to the USPS's Board of Governors. Accordingly, past presidential budgets did not include the USPSOIG's or PRC's funding requests or appropriations. Under the PAEA, both the USPSOIG and the PRC\u2014which the PAEA renamed the Postal Regulatory Commission\u2014must submit their budget requests to Congress and to the Office of Management and Budget, and they are to be paid from the Postal Service Fund. The law further requires USPSOIG's budget submission to be treated as part of USPS's total budget, while the PRC's budget, like the budgets of other independent regulators, is treated separately. Return of m ilitary o bligations to the Treasury. Section 802 of the law relieves the USPS of the $27 billion cost of paying postal worker pension benefits that are attributable to military service. Repeal of the e scrow account . Section 804 of the law abolished the escrow account established by P.L. 108-18 . Establishment of the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund . Sections 801 to 803 of PAEA change the USPS from funding its retirees' health care costs from an out-of-pocket or pay-as-you-go basis to prefunding these obligations. To this end, the PAEA requires the USPS to pay more than $5 billion annually from FY2007 and FY2016 to build a retiree health benefits fund (RHBF) from which both USPS employees and USPS retirees will be paid come FY2017. The funds previously deposited in the escrow account were used to seed this new fund. A s tronger r egulator. Title VI of the law replaces the Postal Rate Commission with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC). The new regulator has subpoena power and a broader scope for the regulation of the USPS and the examination of the USPS's activities. For example, the PAEA requires the PRC to curb the USPS's issuance of nonpostal products, and to annually determine the USPS's compliance with the PAEA's requirements. Separation of USPS p roduct t ypes and rate-setting . Title II of the law divides USPS products into \"market-dominant\" and \"competitive\" classes. Market-dominant products include those products and services that the USPS need not compete with the private sector to provide. Market-dominant products include (1) first-class mail letters and sealed parcels, (2) first-class mail cards, (3) periodicals, (4) standard mail, (5) single-piece parcel post, (6) media mail, (7) bound printed matter, (8) library mail, (9) special services, and (10) single-piece international mail. Competitive products include those for which a competitive market exists. They include (1) priority mail, (2) expedited mail, (3) bulk parcel post, (4) bulk international mail, and (5) mailgrams. This separation of products into two types is significant because critics have said that the USPS has used revenues from market-dominant products (e.g., first class mail) to cross-subsidize competitive products (e.g., overnight package delivery). This, they contend, is unfair competition. Under PAEA, the USPS may raise the rates (prices) of products in the market-dominant class by no more than the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Prices of products in the competitive class must be based on market-type factors, such as \"costs attributable,\" which Section 202 of the statute defines as \"the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to such products through reliably identified causal relationships.\" An e xpedited r ate- s etting p rocess. Under the former rate-setting system, the USPS would submit a request to the Postal Rate Commission to raise postage prices that detailed the proposed increases and the justifications for them. This began a quasi-judicial process in which all interested parties, including citizens and business firms, would submit testimony to the commission concerning USPS's proposed postage rates. The Postal Rate Commission would hold a hearing, take testimony from witnesses, and issue a recommended decision, which the USPS's Board of Governors could accept or reject. Frequently, the entire process took more than six months, and the results were difficult to predict. The PAEA replaced this process with a less adversarial and more expeditious process that takes less than two months. Now, when the USPS wants to raise postage rates, it files a notice with the PRC, which takes public comments and verifies the proposed rates' compliance with the law. Reform of i nternational m ail r egulation. Section 407 of the law clarifies the authority of the Secretary of State to set international postal policy and enter agreements, and requires him/her to apply customs laws equally to private shipments and \"shipments of international mail that are competitive products.\" New q ualifications and l engths of t erms in o ffice for the USPS's g overnors. Section 501 of the PAEA requires that members of the Board of Governors of the USPS \"be chosen solely on the basis of their experience in the field of public service, law or accounting or on their demonstrated ability in managing organizations or corporations (in either the public or private sector) of substantial size.\" Of the nine governors, at least four would have to \"be chosen solely on the basis of their demonstrated ability in managing organizations or corporations (in either the public or private sector) that employ at least 50,000 employees.\" Governors' terms are reduced from nine to seven years. Increased USPS t ransparency. Section 204 requires the USPS to release more details on its finances and operations. In its financial reporting, the USPS must provide the same information that private firms provide under Section 4 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. GAO study on the USPS's b usiness m odel. Section 710 of the PAEA requires the GAO to assess the options for a future business model for the USPS. The GAO was required to deliver its report by January 20, 2011, and did so.

Should agencies interpret a statute based upon the text of the statute alone? Should they consider Congress's intent or try to ascertain the \"original understanding\" of the statute? Newly enacted statutes can be particularly susceptible to differing interpretations as political actors attempt to implement the statute. ", "As described earlier, the PAEA made numerous significant changes to U.S. postal law. Because of its length\u2014more than 20,000 words\u2014and complexity, it is not surprising that disagreements concerning implementation of the PAEA have arisen. As the words of the PAEA develop into governmental actions, Congress may mitigate some of the possible negative effects through active oversight of the USPS and the PRC.

Bush, did issue a signing statement that addressed a number of sections of PAEA, often in the context of the separation of powers. These include the following: ", "Section 205 permits \"any interested person (including an officer of the Postal Regulatory Commission representing the interests of the general public)\" to \"lodge a complaint\" with the PRC. The statement said the executive branch shall construe this portion of the statute \"not to authorize an officer or agency within the executive branch to institute proceedings in Federal court against the Postal Regulatory Commission.\" Section 404 establishes 39 U.S.C. 409(h), which limits the circumstances under which the Department of Justice may represent the Postal Service in legal cases. The signing statement declared that the executive branch \"shall construe subsection 409(h) of title 39 ... which relates to legal representation for an element of the executive branch, in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" Section 405 of the statute amends 39 U.S.C. 407 so that the \"Secretary of State shall be responsible for formulation, coordination, and oversight of foreign policy related to international postal services and other international delivery services,\" and Section 405 places certain limitations on the Secretary's powers to conclude treaties. Section 405 also places requirements upon the Secretary (e.g., the Secretary must \"coordinate with other agencies as appropriate\" in carrying out his or her responsibilities). The signing statement said that the executive branch shall construe this portion of the statute \"in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs, including the authority to determine which officers shall negotiate for the United States and toward what objectives, to make treaties by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and to supervise the unitary executive branch.\" Subsections 501(a) and 601(a) established 39 U.S.C. 202(a) and 502(a), which set the qualification requirements for members of the Board of Governors. The signing statement declared that this \"purport[s] to limit the qualifications of the pool of persons from whom the President may select appointees.\" The executive branch, it continued, shall interpret this portion of the statute \"in a manner consistent with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.\" Subsection 605(c) requires the appointment of an inspector general within 180 days of the enactment of the statute. The signing statement said that the \"executive branch shall also construe as advisory the purported deadline in subsection 605(c) ... as is consistent with the Appointments Clause.\" As enacted by Subsection 1010(e) of the act, 39 U.S.C. 404(c) requires the USPS to \"maintain one or more classes of mail for the transmission of letters sealed against inspection.\" It prohibits the opening of such mail \"except under authority of a search warrant authorized by law, or by an officer or employee of the Postal Service for the sole purpose of determining an address at which the letter can be delivered, or pursuant to the authorization of the addressee.\" The signing statement declared that the executive branch will interpret this prohibition \"in a manner consistent ... with the need to conduct searches in exigent circumstances ... and the need for physical searches specifically authorized by law for foreign intelligence collection.\" Subsection 504(d) and Section 2009 of Title 39, as amended by Section 603 of the act, and Sections 701(a)(2), 702(b), 703(b), 708(b), and 709(b)(2) of the statute, require the PRC to provide budget requests and assorted reports to Congress. The signing statement said that the executive branch shall construe the \"provisions ... that call for executive branch officials to submit legislative recommendations to the Congress in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and to recommend for congressional consideration such measures as the President shall judge necessary and expedient.\"", "Taken as a whole, then, the signing statement's individual contentions amount to a defense of executive branch authorities against perceived or possible legislative encroachments.

", "Taken as a whole, then, the PAEA's Section 102 aimed to direct the USPS to provide postal services and to refrain from offering new nonpostal services.", "Since the enactment of the PAEA, this latter objective has come into question. As mail volumes and revenues have dropped, the USPS has sought ways to increase its postal product and services revenues. In May 2009, the USPS proposed holding a \"summer sale\" that would give reduced postage prices to mailers who had sent over 1 million mail pieces in a six-month period. (The PRC promptly approved this proposal, and the USPS held the sale.) Five months later, the USPS announced it would begin selling Hallmark greeting cards at some of its retail postal facilities. (The PRC previously had approved greeting card sales.) ", "However, the USPS has said that these steps are not sufficient, and that it would like to be given greater authority to sell new nonpostal services. For example, then Postmaster General John Potter testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, and International Security that", "we are simply unable to generate the revenue necessary to support our retail and delivery network at their current size.... Other national [postal services] complement their traditional offerings with banking, cell phone, logistics, and other services to generate the income necessary to offset the costs of their universal service obligation\u2014costs that cannot be met solely by the price of postage.", "[W]e believe the time has come to allow the Postal Service to introduce new lines of business at its retail facilities.... This change is only possible with the concurrence of Congress through new legislation, and we ask for your consideration in this regard.", "Whether the USPS would benefit from additional authority to sell nonpostal products is unclear.", "Additionally, the USPS argument for the need for greater authority to sell nonpostal services rests on a broader argument\u2014that the USPS's business model is \"broken.\" Just four months after the enactment of the PAEA, then Postmaster General Potter testified before Congress that,", "[u]nfortunately, significant changes in the communications and delivery markets have made continued success under the original law problematic.

It is my hope that 30 years from today a future Postmaster General will sit at this table and report on the progress made possible by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. ", "Unfortunately, our business model remains broken, even with the positive pricing and product changes in the new law. With the diversion of messages and transactions to the Internet from the mail, we can no longer depend on printed volume growing at a rate sufficient to produce the revenue needed to cover the costs of an ever-expanding delivery network.", "This argument has been reiterated by the USPS's chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, who said the USPS's \"business model, quite frankly, is broken. It doesn't work for a declining-volume scenario.\" ", "The argument that the USPS's business model is \"broken\" and cannot cover its operating costs without being allowed to enter nonpostal lines of business appears to rest on a fundamental assumption: that over the long run the USPS's operating costs will continue to outstrip its operating revenues in perpetuity; and that this lag of revenue growth behind cost growth is the result of declining mail volumes (and the resultant revenues). Hence, the need for the USPS to reap additional revenues by offering new nonpostal services. ", "In its PAEA Section 710 report, GAO states, \"USPS's business model is not viable due to USPS's inability to reduce costs sufficiently in response to continuing mail volume and revenue declines.\" As Congress further considers the USPS's request for broader authorities to provide nonpostal services, it may wish to investigate these fundamental assumptions regarding postal economics and the possible ramifications for the USPS's operations.
