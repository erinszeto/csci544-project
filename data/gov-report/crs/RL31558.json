In this report, both terms are used interchangeably with \"nondiscriminatory.\" The UnitedStates accords general MFN treatment as a matter of international obligation as well statutory policyto all trading partners; however, MFN tariff treatment of several countries has been suspended underspecific legislation. Virtually all such suspensions, initially applied to 21 countries or politicalentities, took place under the mandate of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, and twomore under country-specific legislation. MFN tariff treatment of countries suspended under the 1951law can be restored and maintained in effect for one-year periods by using the procedure providedunder Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 for such restoration to \"nonmarket economy\" (NME)countries. Under this procedure, an NME country needs to conclude with the United States a tradeagreement containing a reciprocal MFN clause, and be in compliance with the criteria of theJackson-Vanik (J-V) freedom-of-emigration provision of that act. The two countries whose MFNstatus was suspended by country-specific legislation could -- and did -- have it restored byPresidential action under conditions specified in the suspending law.", "Trade agreements with NME countries must be approved by joint resolution, and aretriennially self-renewable, but their renewal is also subject to Presidential confirmation. To maintainin force the compliance with the J-V criteria (and the MFN status), such compliance must be eitherdetermined semiannually, or waived annually, by the Secretary of State, and such determinations orwaivers are annually subject to possible disapproval by joint resolution. Repeated past legislativeaction to disapprove some waivers, particularly those for China, has been unsuccessful and NTRtreatment contingent on a waiver has invariably remained in effect. Permanent restoration of NTRstatus of any country generally requires specific legislation.", "Of the 29 countries, today's successors of countries or areas originally subject to the 1951suspension, 15 had their permanent NTR status restored by specific legislation (five directly and tenafter a period of conditional restoration under the Jackson-Vanik amendment), one (Poland) by thePresident under then existing statutory authority, and one (East Germany) administratively throughunification with West Germany. The status of seven of them is still temporary, subject to thedetermination of full-compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment, and of three of them underthe Jackson-Vanik waiver provision. Two countries (Cuba, and North Korea) are denied NTR statusaltogether. The NTR status of two countries, suspended by individual legislation, has been restoredpermanently by Presidential action as authorized by the suspending legislation.", "This report will be updated as warranted."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What is Normal-Trade-Relations (Most-Favored-Nation) Treatment?", "paragraphs": ["In international trade, the expression \"most-favored-nation,\" usually abbreviated \"MFN,\"status (or treatment) has a specific meaning quite different from what it appears to mean. Whilesuggesting special and exclusive privileges granted to one country, it means in reality equal treatmentof all countries granted the MFN treatment. Defined in a more specific detail in Article I of theGeneral Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994, an integral part of the World TradeOrganization Agreement, the term denotes the reciprocal extension of any concessions, privileges,or immunities granted, or yet to be granted, by a country in a trade agreement (or in some other way)to one country which is, or would be, the \"most favored\" in this respect to all countries to which itaccords MFN treatment. As a consequence, all countries to which a country extends MFN treatmentare, or would be, treated by the extending country equally or in a \"nondiscriminatory\" fashion.", "The understandable misinterpretation of the most-favored-nation term in its literal meaning,particularly in the context of U.S. trade policy of the mid-1990s toward China, gave rise tolegislation (1) to replace theoften misleading term \"most-favored-nation\" treatment in the seven instances in the existing and inall future U.S. legislation with the term \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) or another appropriateexpression. The MFN term, however, has remained universally in use in international trade relations,including trade agreements to which the United States is party. Because of this fact and for reasonsof historical continuity both terms (MFN and NTR) are used in this report with the identical meaningand also interchangeably with the term \"nondiscriminatory,\" a term also often used in U.S. tradelegislation.", "In practice, the principal benefit a country gains from being accorded MFN status by anothercountry is that the latter's imports from the former are dutied at concessional rates (often referred toas \"MFN\" rates, and listed in the U.S. tariff schedules as \"General\") rather than full rates. Thus, theextension of MFN treatment to a country can often mean a significantly lower cost and, hence,greater competitiveness of its products in the extending country's markets than would otherwise bethe case. In this report, the MFN (NTR) treatment is discussed in the specific context of tariffs,because of the origins and historical development of the concept in the U.S. law and practice,particularly the denial or restoration of such treatment to nonmarket economy countries"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolution of U.S. Most-Favored-Nation Policy", "paragraphs": ["There are three basic, often overlapping, ways in which the United States accords generalMFN treatment to its trading partners. One is by means of a bilateral compact (e.g., a \"friendship,commerce, and navigation\" or similar treaty, or an executive trade agreement) in which MFN statusis accorded reciprocally. Another, much broader in its reach, is through being a member of theWorld Trade Organization (WTO), which, as a rule, carries with it the obligation of according MFNtreatment to all other members. ", "In addition, the United States specifically accords to all foreign countries any concession ontariffs or other import restrictions agreed to in reciprocal negotiations with any trading partner by itsown law, first enacted in 1934 and now contained in Section 126 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19U.S.C. 2136). U.S. legislation provides no specific procedure for extending MFN status to a country(except in the case of restoration of the status to \"nonmarket economy\" countries discussed below)nor is there an official list of countries with MFN status.

This action resulted inthe increase of customs duties assessed on the U.S. imports from the countries involved from theconcessional levels resulting from trade agreements with third countries to considerably higher levelsas enacted by the highly protectionist Tariff Act of 1930.

The implementation of this directivewas delayed and the law was later amended by allowing any country with MFN status at the time ofits enactment (December 16, 1963) to retain it if the President determines it to be in the nationalinterest.

While Section 401 of the act requires the continuation in force of the then existing suspensionsof MFN tariff status, it also, in other provisions of its Title IV, authorizes the President to restore\"nondiscriminatory\" status to a nonmarket economy country and maintain it in effect on a temporarybasis by a specific procedure.", "The key elements of the procedure for temporary restoration of the MFN status to an NMEcountry are (1) conclusion of a bilateral trade agreement, containing a reciprocal grant of the MFNstatus and additional provisions required by law (Section 405, Trade Act of 1974; 19 U.S.C. 2435),and approved by the enactment of a joint resolution (4) considered under a specific fast-track procedure set out in Section151 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2191); and (2) compliance with the freedom-of-emigrationrequirements (\"Jackson-Vanik amendment;\" Section 402; 19 U.S.C. 2432).

", "The continuation in force of an NME country's temporary MFN status is contingent on (1)automatic triennial extensions of the underlying trade agreement and (2) periodic renewal of theauthority of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. ", "The agreement, usually concluded for a three-year initial term, itself provides for automaticthree-year extensions (which do not require congressional approving action), but is subject totermination by either party upon notice at least 30 days before the expiration of any three-year term.The continuation in force of the agreement is also subject to the requirement of Section 405(b)(1)(B)of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)(B)) under which any trade agreement concludedunder Title IV is renewed triennially if a satisfactory balance of concessions has been maintainedduring the life of the agreement and the President determines \"that actual and foreseeable reductionsin United States tariff and nontariff barriers ... resulting from multilateral negotiations [which benefitthe country in question unilaterally because of its MFN status] are satisfactorily reciprocated by theother party to the bilateral agreement.\"", "Periodic renewal of the Jackson-Vanik amendment authority by the President must takeplace: (1) in the case of full compliance with the requirements of the amendment, by semiannualreports (by June 30 and December 31) by the President to Congress that the country continues to be,in effect, in full compliance with the freedom-of-emigration requirements of the statute; and (2) inthe case of waivers, by a Presidential recommendation, which must be made by June 3 of every year,that the overall waiver authority and the existing individual country waivers be extended for another12-month period (through July 2 of the following year).

Appropriately retitled, with the required technical changes, and signed ineach individual instance, it entered into force for each former Soviet republic upon the exchange ofnotices of acceptance (see below).", "Much activity related to MFN tariff status of U.S. trading partners took place during the102nd through 105th Congresses (1991-1998).", "MFN status was restored temporarily under the waiver provision of Title IV to Bulgaria andMongolia in November 1991; and permanently by law in December 1991 to previously non-MFNcountries Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, after they declared their independence from the SovietUnion, and, in April 1992, to Czechoslovakia (as of January 1, 1993, split into the Czech Republicand Slovakia) and Hungary (both of which already had MFN status under Title IV). After thedissolution of the Soviet Union in late December 1991, the suspension of MFN tariff statuscontinued in force individually with respect to the Soviet Union's other (than the three Baltic) 12former constituent republics.

This lapse, however,has not in practice affected the NTR status of the countries involved, since they are all still treatedas having NTR status, apparently solely on the basis of the standard provision for automatic triennialrenewal contained in the trade agreements themselves.", "During the entire period from mid-1989 to the statutory extension of PNTR in 2001, the mostcontroversial issue of the U.S. MFN policy has been the MFN status of China . The President'sannual renewals of China's Jackson-Vanik waiver and MFN status faced strong opposition inCongress. Nevertheless, joint resolutions introduced every year in the aftermath of the June 1989Tiananmen Square incident to disapprove such renewals were not adopted.

The delayed entry into force of P.L.106-286 was due to the provision of Section 102 of the law, which precluded the actual extensionof permanent NTR to China before China's accession to the World Trade Organization (whicheventually took place on December 11, 2001). ", "The tie-in between the U.S. grant of permanent NTR treatment to China and China'saccession to the WTO ran in both directions. On the one hand, although China's very comprehensivetrade agreement with the United States was negotiated outside the Working Party for China'saccession to the WTO, it became part of China's protocol of accession; on the other hand,most-favored-nation treatment of China by the United States was required by the WTO Agreementas a reciprocal obligation of WTO members. Such obligation could have been avoided only by theUnited States' (or China's) invocation of WTO Article XIII, which allows reciprocal nonapplicationof obligations under the WTO Agreement (including the MFN treatment) between a current and theacceding WTO member (cf. Kyrgyzstan, p. 9). Invoking Article XIII would have meant that theUnited States would be precluded from benefitting not only from China's comprehensive concessionsin its 1999 bilateral agreement with the United States but also from those in the agreements withother WTO members. Such action would have meant that the United States' benefits from trade withChina would have remained limited to those -- of very general nature -- contained in the much lesscomprehensive bilateral agreement concluded in 1979, provided China did not decide to renounceeven that in accordance with the provisions of that agreement itself.", "The bilateral trade agreement with China had been signed on November 15, 1999, afterprotracted negotiations.
