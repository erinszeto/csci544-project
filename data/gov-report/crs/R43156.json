When Congress failed to take action to reduce future deficits as required by the BCA, automatic cuts required by that act went into effect. On March 1, 2013, President Obama ordered the BCA-mandated sequestration. It required a 7.8% reduction in non-exempt defense discretionary funding, a 5.0% reduction in non-exempt nondefense discretionary funding, a 5.1% reduction for most non-exempt nondefense mandatory funding, and a 7.9% reduction for non-exempt defense mandatory funding.

According to a report accompanying the order, funding for DOT's programs and activities for FY2013 was reduced by about $1.6 billion as a result of the sequester. The largest DOT programs subject to the cuts were the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts Program (which provides funding to local governments for new subway and light rail transit lines), and the Federal Railroad Administration's grants to Amtrak. Because the cuts to FAA's funding could have led to disruptions in air travel due to furloughs of air traffic controllers, Congress enacted P.L. 113-9 in April 2013 to allow the DOT to transfer funding from other accounts to avoid controller furloughs.", "Nearly all of HUD's budget is non-exempt nondefense discretionary funding, and was thus subject to a 5.1% reduction in funding under the sequestration order.

Congress transferred a total of $34.5 billion from the general fund of the Treasury to the highway trust fund during the period FY2008-FY2010 to keep the trust fund solvent. In January 2012 the Congressional Budget Office projected that the trust fund would become insolvent around the end of FY2013, given current revenue and expenditure levels. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act, or MAP-21 ( P.L. 112-141 ), enacted in 2012, authorized additional transfers from the general fund to the highway trust fund to keep the fund solvent through FY2014.", "One reason for the shortfall in funding in the highway trust fund is that the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, while improved fuel efficiency and inflation have reduced the amount of fuel consumed and the value of the tax revenues. The tax is a fixed amount assessed per gallon of fuel sold, not a percentage of the cost of the fuel sold: whether a gallon of gas costs $1 or $4, the highway trust fund receives 18.3 cents for each gallon of gasoline and 24.3 cents for each gallon of diesel. Meanwhile, the capacity of the federal gas tax to support transportation infrastructure has been diminished by inflation (which has reduced the purchasing power of the revenue raised by the tax) and increasing automobile fuel efficiency (as more efficient vehicles are able to travel farther on a gallon of fuel). The Congressional Budget Office has forecast that gasoline consumption will be relatively flat through 2022, as continued increases in the fuel efficiency of the U.S. passenger fleet will offset increases in the number of miles people will drive.

CDBG formula grants are awarded to \"entitlement communities,\" which are defined as metropolitan cities or urban counties that meet certain population criteria. Under the proposal, which has not been formally introduced, a community qualifying for CDBG entitlement status based on the population threshold must also be eligible to receive a minimum grant amount equal to or greater than 0.125% of the amount made available to all entitlement communities in order to qualify for funds. The President's proposal for a minimum allocation would eliminate 239 communities as CDBG entitlement communities based on proposed FY2014 funding of $2.798 billion. The proposal, as outlined in the Administration's FY2014 budget justification, would be phased in over a number of years starting in FY2014 and ending in FY2018. HUD also proposed to eliminate the grandfathering provisions of the CDBG program, which extend entitlement status to communities that no longer meet the minimum population threshold. HUD estimates that an additional 57 communities would no longer meet the population threshold if the proposal to end granfathering were adopted.", "According to HUD, some communities that fail to meet the minimum allocation threshold would have the option of entering into a joint agreement with the urban county in which it is located.

In addition to receiving an annual appropriation for these activities, since 2008 NeighborWorks has also received additional funding to distribute to housing counseling organizations to use solely for foreclosure prevention counseling. This program is known as the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP), and was intended to be a temporary program to address high residential foreclosure rates in recent years.", "The President's FY2014 budget requested $127 million for NeighborWorks to support its traditional activities and $77 million for the NFMCP, for a total of $204 million.

The Senate committee proposed to continue funding the NFMCP at a similar level as the prior year.

Composition of the THUD Funding Bill", "Budget Concepts Relevant for THUD", "The numbers cited in discussions of the THUD appropriations bills can be confusing. Different totals may be published by the committees in their tables and press releases, reported in the press or by advocates, and even presented in this report, all of which may be technically correct. This is possible because the THUD appropriations bills include different types of funding mechanisms and savings mechanisms, which can result in different figures being reported for the same programs, depending on how the numbers are presented. The following section of this report explains the different types of funding often included in the THUD appropriations bill.", "Most of the programs and activities in the THUD bill are funded through regular annual appropriations , also referred to as discretionary appropriations. This is the amount of new funding allocated each year by the appropriations committees. Appropriations are drawn from the general fund of the Treasury. For some accounts, the appropriations committees provide advance appropriations , or regular appropriations that are not available until the next fiscal year.", "In some years, Congress will also provide emergency appropriations , usually in response to disasters. These funds are sometimes provided outside of the regular appropriations acts\u2014often in emergency supplemental spending bills\u2014and are generally provided in addition to regular annual appropriations. Although emergency appropriations typically come from the general fund, they may not be included in the discretionary appropriation total reported for an agency.", "Most of the Department of Transportation's budget is derived from contract authority . Contract authority is a form of budget authority based on federal trust fund resources, in contrast to \"regular\" (or discretionary) budget authority, which is based on the resources of the general fund of the Treasury. Contract authority for DOT is generally derived from the highway trust fund and the airport and airways trust fund.", "Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits on the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to appropriate no more than the allocated amount of discretionary funding in the regular annual appropriation act. Another way is to find ways to offset a higher level of discretionary funding. A portion of the cost of providing regular annual appropriations for the THUD bill is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions , or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding. The second is through offsetting receipts and collections , generally derived from fees collected by federal agencies.", "When the Appropriations Committee subcommittees are given their \"302(b) allocations\"\u2014that is, when the total amount that the Appropriations Committee has to spend for a fiscal year is divided among the subcommittees\u2014that figure includes only net discretionary budget authority (non-emergency appropriations, less any offsets and rescissions); contract authority from trust funds is not included. This can lead to confusion, as the annual discretionary budget authority allocations for THUD are typically around half of the total funding provided in the bill, with the remainder made up of contract authority, offset in some way.", "Allocation across Agencies", "Once the THUD subcommittees receive their 302(b) allocations, they must decide how to allocate the funds across the different agencies within their jurisdiction. As shown in Figure B-1 , when it comes to net discretionary budget authority (appropriations, less any offsets), the majority of funding allocated by the appropriations subcommittees generally goes to HUD (about two-thirds in FY2013). However, as shown in Figure B-2 , when taking into account contract authority\u2014which, as noted earlier, is not allocated by the appropriations committees\u2014the total resources available to DOT are greater than the resources available to HUD.", "Impact of Offsets", "Besides the level of the 302(b) allocation, one of the most important factors in determining how much in new appropriations the THUD subcommittees will provide in each year is the amount of savings available from rescissions and offsets. Each dollar available to the subcommittee in rescissions and offsets serves to reduce the \"cost\" of providing another dollar in appropriations. As shown in Table B-1 , in FY2012, without rescissions and offsets, it would have \"cost\" the THUD Subcommittee an additional $6 billion to provide the same amount of appropriations.", "The amount of these \"budget savings\" can vary from year to year, meaning that the \"cost\" of providing the same level of appropriations may vary as well."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
