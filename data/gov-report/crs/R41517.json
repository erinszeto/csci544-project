Enacted basically in its current form in 1972 (P.L. 92-500), the law established broad water quality restoration objectives for the nation's waters. The objectives were accompanied by statutory goals to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States by 1985 and to attain, wherever possible, waters deemed \"fishable and swimmable\" by 1983. Programs at the federal level are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); state and local governments have major day-to-day responsibilities to implement CWA programs through standard-setting, permitting, and enforcement. Considerable progress towards the goals of the act has been made, but long-standing problems persist and new problems have emerged. The last major amendments to the law were the Water Quality Act of 1987 ( P.L. 100-4 ), the most comprehensive amendments since 1972. Subsequently, congressional committees conducted oversight on the law, and Congress enacted bills addressing a number of regional water quality concerns.

National Estuary Program", "paragraphs": ["Estuaries are areas where rivers meet the sea and where fresh and salt water mix. They are critical to the health of coastal environments. They serve as important habitat for fish and wildlife, provide wetland plants and soils that trap pollutants and temper storm surges, and provide tangible, direct economic benefits to regions and the nation. Many, however, are threatened or degraded by overuse of resources and human development. In response to concerns about conditions of the nation's coastal estuaries, the 1987 CWA amendments established the National Estuary Program (NEP) in Section 320 of the act. The NEP is a program to promote comprehensive planning efforts to protect nationally significant estuaries that are threatened by pollution, development, and overuse. Once approved by EPA, local stakeholders can receive financial and technical assistance to develop and implement a comprehensive conservation management plan that addresses factors that contribute to the estuary's degradation. To date, EPA has approved 28 estuaries for participation in the program. Since 1987, Congress has amended Section 320 to reauthorize funding and in several cases to identify estuaries to be given priority consideration under the program. ", "Authorization of Section 320 appropriations expired at the end of FY2010. In April 2010, the House passed H.R. 4715 , the Clean Estuaries Act, to reauthorize assistance through FY2016 and to increase the authorization from $35 million annually to $50 million annually to encourage EPA to expand the number of estuaries included in the program. Further, H.R. 4715 would have added several requirements in the development of comprehensive management plans, such as addressing the impacts of climate change, and would have required periodic update of the plan and evaluation and approval by EPA. Under the House-passed bill, if the EPA review were to find the plan deficient, EPA could reduce grant funding until the plan was revised.", "The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved an amended version of H.R. 4715 in June ( S.Rept. 111-293 ). As reported, the bill would have increased authorization of appropriations to $75 million per year and would have required updates and evaluations every five years, rather than every four years as in the House-passed version.", "In S.Amdt. 4845 , National Estuary Program provisions were included in Division J, Title CII, Subtitle C. The provisions were essentially the same as in the bill as approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Modifications were included to clarify EPA procedures for reviewing and determining completeness of a comprehensive management plan. The provisions of S.Amdt. 4845 would have authorized appropriations of assistance for NEP estuaries for six years (through FY2017) at $75 million per year.

Chesapeake Bay", "paragraphs": ["The bill with the greatest potential for controversy is S. 1816 , the Chesapeake Clean Water and Ecosystem Restoration Act of 2009. It would revise CWA Section 117, which addresses restoration of Chesapeake Bay's water quality. Because of this stand-alone CWA provision, Chesapeake Bay is not included in the NEP.", "Despite several decades' of activity by governments, the private sector, and the general public, efforts to improve and protect the Chesapeake Bay watershed have been insufficient to meet restoration goals. Although some specific indicators of bay health have improved slightly or remained steady (such as blue crabs and underwater bay grasses), others remain at low levels of improvement, especially water quality. Overall, the bay and its tributaries remain in poor health, with polluted water, reduced populations of fish and shellfish, and degraded habitat and resources. ", "In May 2009, President Obama issued Executive Order 13508 that declared the bay a \"national treasure\" and charged the federal government with assuming a strong leadership role in restoring the bay. The executive order established a Federal Leadership Committee for the Chesapeake Bay to develop and implement a new strategy for protecting and restoring the Chesapeake Basin that would build on and accelerate existing programs like those under CWA Section 117.", "A central feature of the overall strategy is EPA's pledge to establish a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Chesapeake Bay. Section 303 of the CWA requires states to identify waters that are impaired by pollution, even after application of pollution controls. For those waters, states must establish a TMDL to ensure that water quality standards can be attained. A TMDL is essentially a pollution budget, or a quantitative estimate of what it takes to achieve standards, setting the maximum amount of pollution that a water body can receive without violating standards. If a state fails to do this, EPA is required to make its own TMDL determination for the state. Throughout the United States\u2014including the Chesapeake Bay watershed\u2014more than 20,000 waterways are known to be violating applicable water quality standards, and thus requiring development of a TMDL. Lawsuits have been brought to pressure EPA and states to develop TMDLs; under a consent decree in one such lawsuit, EPA must establish a Chesapeake Bay TMDL by no later than May 1, 2011, with a goal of having TMDL implementation measures in place by 2025. The Chesapeake Bay TMDL will be the geographically largest single TMDL developed to date. It will address all segments of the bay and its tidal tributaries that are impaired from discharges of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment, and the TMDL will allocate needed reductions of these pollutants to all jurisdictions in the 64,000-square-mile watershed. Detailed plans identifying specific reductions will be developed by the bay states in Watershed Implementation Plans.", "Environmental activists are pleased that the federal government is now asserting a leadership role to restore the bay and are supporting legislation that would codify procedural requirements and deadlines for the bay TMDL and authorize grants and other assistance for implementing required measures. S. 1816 proposed to do so. As reported, the bill generally sought to codify 2025 as a deadline for implementing restoration actions throughout the Chesapeake Basin and would have given EPA explicit backup authority to develop measures to restore the watershed, if states fail to do so. The legislation would have authorized significant financial resources, totaling $2.26 billion over six years, to assist in implementing programs, projects, and measures for restoration of the Chesapeake Basin watershed. The legislation was controversial\u2014as are EPA's TMDL plans and the overall federal Chesapeake Bay restoration strategy\u2014and a number of groups such as agriculture and developers have been concerned about the likely mandatory nature of many of EPA's and states' upcoming actions that will occur with or without the authorization of appropriations in the legislation.", "The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 1816 on June 30 ( S.Rept. 111-333 ). In the House, companion legislation was introduced ( H.R. 3852 ), as were several other bills concerned with Chesapeake Bay issues ( H.R. 5509 , H.R. 3265 , and H.R. 6382 ).

The provisions were generally the same as the Chesapeake Bay bill approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, but did include some modifications that were based in part on separate legislation, H.R. 5509 . In particular, revisions included the following: directing EPA to establish a website providing transparency on Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts, calling for EPA to prepare annually a financial report and interagency crosscut budget accounting for federal funding on Bay restoration, and modifying provisions related to compliance of agricultural or private forest conservation plans with state management plans for Bay restoration. Finally, the provisions of S.Amdt. 4845 included language that would amend the Food Security Act of 1985 (the farm bill) authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to identify conservation practices for agricultural and private foresters that Chesapeake Bay states could use in their restoration implementation plans.

Efforts by governments, private interests, and the public in both the United States and Canada to address these challenges have been underway for several decades. The 1987 CWA amendments established Section 118 of the CWA and put in place measures to achieve water quality improvement goals embodied in agreements between the United States and Canada. Congress has amended this provision several times since then, adding new authorities and requirements in order to strengthen Great Lakes restoration actions. In particular, in 2002 Congress passed the Great Lakes Legacy Act ( P.L. 107-303 ), which amended CWA Section 118 to authorize funds for projects to remediate toxic, contaminated sediments throughout the lakes.", "In 2004 President Bush issued Executive Order 13340, which created the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force of federal agencies to coordinate restoration of the lakes. In separate action, a Regional Collaboration of state and local governments, the public, and the private sector subsequently released a strategy and implementation framework for restoration. In the FY2010 budget proposal, President Obama requested increased funding (totaling $475 million) for an EPA-led Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to target federal funding to major threats to the ecosystem of the lakes that have been identified by the Interagency Task Force and the Regional Collaboration. The initiative is essentially a means of coordinating appropriations for Great Lakes restoration. Congress approved the requested FY2010 appropriations. In February 2010, the Interagency Task Force issued a multi-year restoration Action Plan to guide implementation of the Initiative through projects and grants in five areas: toxic substances, invasive species, nonpoint source pollution, habitat and wildlife restoration, and partnerships and communication.", "In the 111 th Congress, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved two bills concerning Great Lakes issues. First, S. 3073 , the Great Lakes Ecosystem Protection Act of 2010, addressed governance issues.

It also would have established in law the existing Interagency Task Force, to continue coordination of restoration efforts, and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, to target the most significant environmental problems of the ecosystem. The bill would have authorized $475 million annually through FY2016 for the initiative. It also would have reauthorized the Great Lakes Legacy Act program for projects to remediate contaminated sediments at $150 million annually through FY2015.", "A second Environment Committee-approved bill, the Contaminated Sediment Remediation Reauthorization Act ( S. 933 ), addressed only the existing program for remediation of contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes in CWA Section 118.

The Partnership would be responsible for developing a Great Lakes Restoration Blueprint, a strategy for protecting water quality and the ecosystem of the Great Lakes basin. The Leadership Council also would be responsible for developing annual priority lists of projects to advance the goals and objectives of the Blueprint or the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Action Plan. The legislation would have authorized to be appropriated $475 million per year through FY2017 and authorized EPA to transfer not more than $475 million to other federal agencies to carry out activities under the Blueprint, the Action Plan, or the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the United States.
