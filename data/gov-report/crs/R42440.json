In January 2010, ATF whistleblowers contacted Senator Charles Grassley with assertions that suspected gun traffickers had not been arrested in a timely fashion and, and as a result, a large number of suspect firearms had not been interdicted and have likely passed into the hands of drug traffickers and other criminals. The whistleblowers referred to this investigative tactic as \"gun walking.\" According to one source, 665 of these firearms have been recovered by law enforcement at crime scenes on both sides of the border. Another 1,355 suspect firearms reportedly remain unaccounted for.

In its FY2013 DOJ budget submission, the Administration has proposed dropping the Cornyn language related to \"gun walking,\" arguing that the prohibition is not necessary.

Burke resigned and ATF Acting Director Kenneth Melson was reassigned to the DOJ Office of Legal Policy. In Melson's place, U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota B. Todd Jones was appointed interim acting ATF Director, who is President Barack Obama's nominee for ATF Director. Earlier, on September 23, 2011, Representative Lamar Smith, Chair of the House Committee on the Judiciary sent Attorney General Eric Holder a letter expressing his continuing concerns about Operation Fast and Furious, as well as the appointment of an acting ATF director who would be focused on both his duties as ATF acting director and U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. He cited a provision in the FY2010 Omnibus Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-117 ) requires each U.S. Attorney to reside in the district in which he serves, and questioned how Jones would be able to serve simultaneously in Minnesota as U.S. Attorney and Washington as ATF acting director. In a similar vein, both the Senate and House committee-approved bills included provisions that would prohibit any U.S. Attorney from holding multiple jobs outside of the scope of a U.S. Attorney's professional duty (\u00a7213).

The shortfall in total NASA funding relative to the authorization act may raise questions about the feasibility of the human spaceflight program established by that act, as well as about the potential impact of human spaceflight's funding needs on funding for other NASA programs, such as science, aeronautics, and education.", "The Administration's $4.911 billion request for NASA's Science account in FY2013 was 3.5% less than the FY2012 appropriation. Funding for planetary science was to decrease $308.1 million (-20.5%). Most of that proposed reduction was in the Mars exploration program, whose costs were reduced by the launch of the Mars Science Laboratory in November 2011, the planned launch of the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN) in late 2013, and the termination of NASA's participation (with the European Space Agency) in the 2016 and 2018 ExoMars sample return missions. NASA is developing a new Mars exploration strategy that will integrate robotic missions funded by the Science account with human spaceflight and technology development activities in other accounts. Also in Science, funding for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was to increase $98.0 million (18.5%). Following an independent review of JWST in October 2010, NASA developed a revised plan for the program in 2011. In the FY2012 appropriations conference report, Congress capped the formulation and development cost of JWST and mandated annual reports on the program by the Government Accountability Office. The Senate committee recommended $5.021 billion for Science, or $110 million more than the request, including an increase of $100 million for Mars Exploration. The House-passed bill would have provided $5.095 billion, or $184 million more than the request, including an increase of $88 million for a future Mars sample return mission. If NASA's new Mars strategy does not include a sample return mission, the additional $88 million in the House bill was instead to be devoted to a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. The final appropriation for Science (before any sequestration) is $5.037 billion, including an increase of $82 million for Mars exploration. The explanatory statement rejected the House report language about redirecting Mars funding to a Europa mission.", "The request for Aeronautics was $551.5 million, a decrease of 3.2% from FY2012. Research on hypersonic entry, descent, and landing (EDL) was to be transferred to the Space Technology account, and most funding for air-breathing hypersonic flight systems was to be eliminated. The hypersonic research remaining in the Aeronautics program was to be combined with supersonic research to create a single project focusing on high-speed flight. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount. The House-passed bill would have provided $569.9 million. Both committees expressed concern about the planned changes in NASA's hypersonics research. The Senate committee directed NASA to provide a report on how it plans to maintain hypersonics expertise either with its own funds or in collaboration with other agencies. The House committee rejected the proposed transfer of EDL research to Space Technology and directed NASA to work with the Department of Defense to define agency roles and propose changes to the division of responsibilities. The final appropriation (before any sequestration) is $558.2 million. The explanatory statement confirmed the House and Senate report language.", "For Space Technology, the Administration requested $699.0 million, an increase of 21.6% from FY2012. About half of the increase was for technology demonstration missions designed to bridge the gap between early-stage development and operational use. In February 2012, the National Research Council (NRC) released its assessment of NASA's draft roadmaps for space technology development. According to NASA, the Space Technology program is investing at some level in all 16 of the technology areas that the NRC report recommended for emphasis. In February 2013, NASA created a Space Technology Mission Directorate; the Space Technology Program had previously been an activity within the Office of the Chief Technologist. The Senate committee recommended $651.0 million for Space Technology and directed NASA to give priority to ongoing activities. The House-passed bill would have provided $632.5 million. The final appropriation (before any sequestration) is $628.7 million.", "The Administration's request for Exploration in FY2013 was $3.933 billion, a 4.3% increase over FY2012 but 25.3% less than the authorized level. This account funds development of the Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and heavy-lift Space Launch System (SLS), which were mandated for human exploration of space beyond Earth's orbit by the 2010 authorization act, as well as development of the commercial crew transportation systems that NASA intends to use for U.S. astronaut access to the International Space Station. The request for Construction and Environmental Compliance and Restoration included $143.7 million for Exploration-related construction formerly included in the Exploration account. The shortfall in Exploration funding relative to the authorization act may raise questions about the feasibility of NASA's planned human spaceflight program. NASA expects the first uncrewed flight of the SLS to occur in December 2017, and the first crewed flight in August 2021. If funding had been appropriated at the requested level, NASA expected commercial crew transportation services to become available in early 2017; NASA officials stated that a lower funding level would not permit this. The Senate committee recommended $3.909 billion. Within this total, it provided $306.5 million more than the request for development of the MPCV and SLS and their associated ground systems, and $304.7 million less than the request for commercial crew. The House-passed bill would have provided $3.712 billion, including $112.5 million more than the request for the MPCV and SLS and their ground systems, and $329.7 million less than the request for commercial crew. The final appropriation (before any sequestration) is $3.806 billion, including $221.3 million more than the request for the MPCV and SLS and their ground systems and $315.6 million less than the request for commercial crew.", "The FY2013 request of $4.013 billion for Space Operations was a 5.2% decrease from FY2012. This account funds the International Space Station (ISS), the Space and Flight Support program, and the remaining costs for closeout of the space shuttle program. The last shuttle flight was completed in July 2011. With only $70.6 million requested for space shuttle closeout in FY2013, the other two elements of this account were both to receive increases. The Senate committee recommended $3.962 billion. The House-passed bill would have provided $3.985 billion. The final appropriation (before any sequestration) is $3.871 billion.", "The Senate committee proposed transferring responsibility for acquisition and procurement of NOAA operational satellites from NOAA to NASA. According to the Senate committee report, the funding recommended for this purpose matched the Administration's request, minus NOAA's portion of the management costs, but was to be provided to NASA rather than NOAA. NASA currently acts as NOAA's acquisition agent for such satellites on a cost-reimbursement basis.

It is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education program portfolio and federal STEM student aid and support.", "For FY2013, the House recommended $7.333 billion for NSF. This amount was $299.4 million (4.3%) more than the foundation's FY2012 estimated funding level of $7.033 billion, $40.6 million (-0.6%) less than the President's request for $7.373 billion, and $59.4 million (0.8%) more than the $7.273 billion recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. S.Rept. 112-158 , which accompanied S. 2323 when it left the Senate Committee on Appropriations, raised overall concerns about NSF's responsiveness to Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reports and recommendations and directed NSF to report to the Committee on its efforts to address issues identified by the OIG. The explanatory statement on H.R. 933 as published in the March 11, 2012, Congressional Record (hereafter referred to as the \"explanatory statement\") affirmed this directive. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ) provides $7.240 billion to the NSF in FY2013. ", "Since FY2006, overall increases in the NSF budget have been at least partially driven by the so-called \"doubling path policy.\" Congress and successive Administrations sought to double funding for the NSF, Department of Energy's Office of Science, and National Institute of Standards and Technology's core laboratory and construction accounts (collectively \"the targeted accounts\"). Under current authorizations for FY2011 to FY2013, targeted account funding levels would have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3%, a pace that would result in doubling in approximately 11 years. However, appropriations for the targeted accounts in FY2011 and FY2012 increased at rates of 4.6% and 4.1%, respectively (about a 17-year doubling pace). The President's FY2013 budget request established a 4.1% compound annual growth rate for targeted accounts. The funding levels in P.L. 113-6 provide for a compound annual growth rate of 3.8% (or about a 19-year doubling pace) for the targeted accounts.", "The full House and Senate Committee on Appropriations agreed on essentially identical funding levels for five of NSF's six major accounts in FY2013. (See Table 12 .) The primary difference between the two proposals was in the main research account (Research and Related Activities or R&RA). The House proposed $5.943 billion for R&RA in FY2013. This amount was $253.7 million (4.5%) more than the FY2012 estimated level of $5.689 billion, $40.6 million (-0.7%) less than the President's request for $5.983 billion, and $59.4 million (1.0%) more than the Senate Committee on Appropriations' recommendation for $5.883 billion. P.L. 113-6 provides $5.859 billion for R&RA in FY2013.", "NSF's FY2013 request for R&RA highlighted priorities in interdisciplinary research, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, materials, wireless communications, smart systems, and cybersecurity. The request included increases for all but one of the research directorates. The largest requested R&RA increase (by amount and percentage) was for the Integrative Activities (IA) account. Increases in IA would mainly apply to the R&RA contribution to the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) program and to increased support for the Integrated NSF Support Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education (INSPIRE) program. NSF also sought an increase in the Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program. The FY2013 request did not establish neuroscience as a crosscutting theme, as the FY2012 CJS conference report encouraged NSF to do; however, NSF's request stated that it would issue a \"Dear Colleague Letter\" supporting research in neuroscience and cognitive science. The FY2013 request also included $250,000 for a Giant Segmented Mirror Telescope planning solicitation, as per the FY2012 CJS conference report.", "H.Rept. 112-463 directed NSF to prioritize\u2014of new R&RA activities\u2014cybersecurity, advanced manufacturing, materials, and research in the natural and physical sciences, math, and engineering. In particular, the House report provided the requested level of $148.9 million for NSF's Advanced Manufacturing initiative. Other R&RA provisions in the House report included a requirement that I-Corps recipients commit to the domestic production of goods or services commercialized with NSF assistance; two required reports on the management of scientific facilities; and language encouraging NSF to establish neuroscience as a cross-cutting theme. H.Rept. 112-463 also endorsed NSF-proposed changes in R&RA, except for the termination of the Communicating Science Broadly program, which the House Committee on Appropriations sought to maintain.", "S.Rept. 112-158 highlighted R&RA support for scientific facilities and instrumentation; provided the requested levels for astronomical sciences ($244.6 million) and cybersecurity research ($161.0 million); and expressed concerns about the adequacy of funding levels for the Academic Research Fleet. The Senate committee report also provided the requested level of funding ($7.5 million) for Large Synoptic Survey Telescope pre-construction planning. Other provisions in S.Rept. 112-158 included $158.0 million for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in FY2013.

It incorporated language relating to reductions and terminations, and adopted by reference advanced manufacturing and I-Corps (with modifications) provisions from the House committee report. The explanatory statement also adopted Senate committee report provisions on cybersecurity research and provides $200.7 million for astronomical sciences (as well as specific directives for spending in that account) among other things.", "Both the full House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding all other major NSF accounts at FY2013 requested levels. These recommendations applied to Education and Human Resources (E&HR), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC), Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM), the National Science Board (NSB), and the OIG. For AOAM, NSB, and the OIG, the FY2013 requested levels were equal to the FY2012 estimate. The FY2013 request for MREFC was slightly below the FY2012 estimate. MREFC requested funding would support four on-going projects, two of which were close to completion. Provisions in H.Rept. 112-463 expressed continued concern about contingency costs in the MREFC account.

As noted previously, both the full House and Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the full request for E&HR in FY2013. These actions marked a change from FY2011 and FY2012, when Congress reduced funds for this account from prior year levels. FY2003-FY2012 trends generally showed a diminishing role for E&HR in the total NSF budget. P.L. 116-3 provides $877.0 million to E&HR in FY2013.

NSF requested $20.0 million ($5.0 million for each of E&HR's four divisions) in FY2013 to establish the reframing effort. Requested changes within E&HR were intended to occur in tandem with the launch of a new NSF-wide initiative, Expeditions in Education (E 2 ). NSF also sought increased collaboration with the Department of Education (ED) on the Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP) program and on efforts to establish standards of evidence for STEM education innovations and research. The FY2013 E&HR request also sought to shift $30.0 million in funding from the Discovery Research K-12 and Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM programs to a new $60.0 million competitive grant program aimed at fostering improvements in mathematics learning. This program was intended to be jointly administered with ED, which was to contribute $30.0 million.", "The FY2013 E&HR request also included $121.5 million for the GRF program, an $11.9 million (10.8%) increase over the FY2012 estimate.

Funding for minority-serving institutions (MSIs), the Robert Noyce Scholarship (Noyce) program, and the MSP program would have continued at FY2012 levels. The FY2013 NSF budget request did not appear to include a specified funding source for Hispanic-serving institutions. The FY2013 budget request for the Federal Cyber Services: Scholarship for Service/Cybercorps (SFS) program was $25.0 million, $20.0 million (-44.4%) below the $45.0 million level established for the program in the FY2012 CJS appropriations conference report.", "Although identical at the major account level, there were substantive differences between House and Senate appropriations committee recommendations for certain E&HR sub-accounts.

H.Rept. 112-463 would have funded the Advanced Technology Education (ATE) program at $69.0 million, while S.Rept. 112-158 would have provided $64.0 million. A third difference was between the two recommendations for NSF's Informal Science Education (ISE) program. H.Rept. 112-463 accepted the Administration's proposed changes to ISE, including a $13.6 million (-22.1%) reduction from the FY2012 estimate of $61.4 million. S.Rept. 112-158 rejected the requested reduction to ISE. The explanatory statement resolved these differences. It affirmed Senate committee report language on MSIs (described as \"broadening participation programs\" in the statement); accepted House committee report provisions on the ATE program, with modifications; and accepted the ISE name change to AISL while affirming Senate committee report language rejecting the Administration's proposed reductions to the program.
