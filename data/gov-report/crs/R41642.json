The 112th Congress has extended this authority through March 27, 2013. The Obama Administration has requested extension of this authority until October 4, 2013. Congressional policymakers have debated the scope and details of reauthorization and continue to consider legislation establishing an authority with longer duration. Some Members of Congress support extension, either short- or long-term, of the existing authority. Other Members call for revision and more extensive codification of chemical facility security regulatory provisions. Questions regarding the current law's effectiveness in reducing chemical facility risk and the sufficiency of federal funding for chemical facility security exacerbate the tension between continuing current policies and changing the statutory authority.", "Congressional policymakers have questioned DHS's effectiveness in implementing the authorized regulations, called chemical facility anti-terrorism standards (CFATS). The DHS finalized CFATS regulations in 2007. No chemical facilities have completed the CFATS process, which starts with information submission by chemical facilities and finishes with inspection and approval of facility security measures by DHS. Several factors, including the amount of detailed information provided to DHS, effectiveness of DHS program management, and the availability of CFATS inspectors, likely complicate the inspection process and lead to delays in inspection. Policymakers have questioned whether the compliance rate with CFATS is sufficient to address this homeland security issue.", "Key policy issues debated in previous Congresses contribute to the current reauthorization debate. These issues include the adequacy of DHS resources and efforts; the appropriateness and scope of federal preemption of state chemical facility security activities; the availability of information for public comment, potential litigation, and congressional oversight; the range of chemical facilities identified by DHS; and the ability of inherently safer technologies to achieve security goals.", "The 112th Congress might take various approaches to this issue. Congress might allow the statutory authority to expire but continue providing appropriations to administer the regulations. Congress might permanently or temporarily extend the statutory authority to observe the impact of the current regulations and, if necessary, address any perceived weaknesses at a later date. Congress might codify the existing regulations in statute and reduce the discretion available to the Secretary of Homeland Security to change the current regulatory framework. Alternatively, Congress might substantively change the current regulation's implementation, scope, or impact by amending the existing statute or creating a new one. Finally, Congress might choose to terminate the program by allowing its authority to lapse and removing funding for the program. This would leave regulation of chemical facility security to state and local governments.", "Both appropriation and authorization legislation in the 112th Congress address chemical facility security. P.L. 112-175 extended the existing authority until March 27, 2013.

The sudden release of hazardous chemicals from facilities storing large quantities might potentially harm many people living or working near the facility. Historically, chemical facilities engaged in security activities on a voluntary basis. Following September 11, 2001, some states enacted laws requiring additional consideration of security at chemical facilities. Congress debated whether the federal government should reduce the risk such facilities pose by regulating them for security purposes. In 2006, the 109 th Congress passed legislation providing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with statutory authority to regulate chemical facilities for security purposes. Subsequent Congresses have extended this authority. This statutory authority expires on March 27, 2013. The Obama Administration has requested extension of this authority until October 4, 2013. Both FY2013 homeland security appropriations bills ( S. 3216 and H.R. 5855 ) would extend the existing authority until October 4, 2013. Advocacy groups, stakeholders, and policymakers have called for congressional reauthorization of this authority, though they disagree about the preferred approach. Congress may extend the existing authority, revise the existing authority to resolve potentially contentious issues, or allow this authority to lapse.", "This report provides a brief overview of the existing statutory authority and implementing regulation.

The statute explicitly identified some DHS authorities and left other aspects to the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The statute contains a \"sunset provision\" and expires on March 27, 2013. The Obama Administration has requested extension of this authority until October 4, 2013.", "On April 9, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security issued an interim final rule regarding the chemical facility anti-terrorism standards (CFATS). This interim final rule entered into force on June 8, 2007. The interim final rule implements both statutory authority explicit in P.L. 109-295 , Section 550, and authorities DHS found Congress implicitly granted. In promulgating the interim final rule, DHS interpreted the language of the statute to determine what DHS asserts was the intent of Congress. Consequently, much of the rule arises from the Secretary's discretion and interpretation of legislative intent rather than explicit statutory language.", "Under the interim final rule, the Secretary of Homeland Security determines which chemical facilities must meet regulatory security requirements, based on the degree of risk posed by each facility. The DHS lists 322 chemicals as \"chemicals of interest\" for the purposes of compliance with CFATS. The DHS considers each chemical in the context of three threats: release; theft or diversion; and sabotage and contamination. Chemical facilities with greater than specified quantities of potentially dangerous chemicals must submit information to DHS, so that DHS can determine the facility's risk status. The statute exempts several types of facilities from this requirement: facilities defined as a water system or wastewater treatment works; facilities owned or operated by the Department of Defense or Department of Energy; facilities regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and those facilities regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-295 ).", "Based on the submitted information, DHS determines the risk associated with each facility. Facilities DHS deems high risk must meet CFATS requirements. The DHS assigns high-risk facilities into one of four risk-based tiers. Facilities in higher risk tiers must meet more stringent performance-based requirements. The statute mandated the use of performance-based security requirements. The DHS created graduated performance-based requirements for facilities assigned to each risk-based tier. ", "All high-risk facilities must assess their vulnerabilities, develop an effective security plan, submit these documents to DHS, and implement their security plan. The vulnerability assessment serves two purposes under the interim final rule. One is to determine or confirm the placement of the facility in a risk-based tier. The other is to provide a baseline against which to evaluate the site security plan activities. ", "The site security plans must address the vulnerability assessment by describing how activities in the plan correspond to securing facility vulnerabilities. Additionally, the site security plan must address preparations for and deterrents against specific modes of potential terrorist attack, as applicable and identified by DHS. The site security plans must also describe how the activities taken by the facility meet the risk-based performance standards provided by DHS.", "The DHS must review and approve the submitted documents, audit and inspect chemical facilities, and determine regulatory compliance. The DHS may disapprove submitted vulnerability assessments or site security plans that fail to meet DHS performance-based standards, but not because of the presence or absence of a specific security measure. In the case of disapproval, DHS must identify in writing those areas of the assessment and/or plan that need improvement. Owners or operators of chemical facilities may appeal such decisions to DHS. ", "Similarly, if, after inspecting a chemical facility, DHS finds the facility not in compliance, the Secretary must write to the facility explaining the deficiencies found, provide an opportunity for the facility to consult with DHS, and issue an order to the facility to comply by a specified date. If the facility continues to be out of compliance, DHS may fine and, eventually, order the facility to cease operation. The interim final rule establishes the process by which chemical facilities can appeal DHS decisions and rulings, but the statute prohibits third-party suits for enforcement purposes.", "The statute requires certain protections for information developed in compliance with this act. The interim final rule creates a category of information exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and comparable state and local laws. The DHS named this category of information \"Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information\" (CVI). Information generated under the interim final rule, as well as any information developed for chemical facility security purposes identified by the Secretary, comprise this category. Judicial and administrative proceedings shall treat CVI as classified information. The DHS asserts sole discretion regarding who will be eligible to receive CVI. Disclosure of CVI may be punishable by fine.", "The interim final rule states it preempts state and local regulation that \"conflicts with, hinders, poses an obstacle to, or frustrates the purposes of\" the federal regulation. States, localities, or affected companies may request a decision from DHS regarding potential conflict between the regulations. Since DHS promulgated the interim final rule, Congress amended P.L. 109-295 , Section 550, to state that such preemption will occur only in the case of an \"actual conflict.\" The DHS has not issued revised regulations addressing this change in statute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Within DHS, the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) is responsible for chemical facility security regulations.

Full-time equivalent staffing for this program has also increased over time. This increase in staffing reflects, in part, the development of a cadre of CFATS inspectors, based in regional offices.", "The DHS received statutory authority to regulate chemical facilities in 2006. It did not possess a chemical facility security office or inspector cadre at that time. The DHS requested additional positions to create an inspector cadre. As of February 2012, DHS had hired 102 of a planned 108 inspectors and all of 14 field leadership positions. Chemical inspectors must be able to assess the security measures at a chemical facility using the performance-based criteria developed by DHS. Performance-based security measures are likely more difficult than prescriptive measures for chemical inspectors to assess and thus may require greater training and experience in the inspector cadre. To overcome this challenge, DHS has established a Basic Inspector School training program. Such training, while likely improving the quality of inspection, also introduces additional time between the hiring of new inspectors and their deployment in the field.", "For FY2013, the House of Representatives and the Senate Committee on Appropriations have recommended different funding levels. The House would appropriate $45 million, a decrease of $30 million from the FY2013 request and $48 million from the FY2012 appropriation. In addition, the House report states, \"in spite of ample appropriations provided by Congress, the Department has made little progress carrying out its regulatory responsibilities for \u2026 the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program\u2026.\" The Senate committee, in contrast, recommends $86 million, an increase of $11 million from the FY2013 request and a decrease of $7 million from the FY2012 appropriation. The Senate committee states, \"it would be shortsighted, in the meantime, to take the full amount of [Administration's] proposed savings when the need for improvement has been documented. Funding will not resolve all of the outstanding issues, but the proposed cuts are too deep to ensure change for the better can be completed.\" The Senate report also would direct DHS to retain an inspector cadre of no fewer than 148 FTE for FY2013.", "The DHS has responded to the House-passed funding level, stating that this level of appropriations would ", "drastically curtail DHS's ability to: 1) implement the statutory and regulatory requirements for the security of high-risk chemical facilities as specified in CFATS; 2) continue development of the proposed Ammonium Nitrate Security Program; and 3) fully implement the program improvements identified in the ISCD Action Plan. DHS estimates that, after expending approximately $35 million for salaries and benefits for 242 FTEs, approximately $12 million would remain for implementing CFATS and completing development of the proposed Ammonium Nitrate Security Program. DHS would be forced to cease virtually all activities under CFATS other than those directly related to reviewing SSPs and performing facility inspections\u2014which means those other activities would be significantly delayed. At the proposed $45.4 million funding level, the Department's ability to conduct the most basic CFATS functions would be impacted. These include maintaining the CSAT and the Chemical-Security Management System information technology systems, and acquiring important technical and subject matter support. Additionally, CFATS-related outreach and engagement with the regulated community would be significantly reduced and some aspects would cease....

The DHS considered more than 7,800 of these facilities as preliminarily high-risk and required each to submit a site vulnerability assessment. From the submitted site vulnerability assessments, DHS identified and placed 4,433 facilities into preliminary or final risk tiers. Table 2 shows the number of high-risk facilities in each tier as of July 31, 2012, with Tier 1 those facilities of highest risk.", "In May 2010, DHS identified an anomaly in one of the risk-assessment tools used by DHS to determine a facility's risk tier. At that time, DHS believed that it had resolved the anomaly. In June 2011, a new acting ISCD Director \"rediscovered\" this issue, identified its potential effect on facility tiering, brought the issue to the attention of NPPD leadership, and notified facilities of their change in risk tier. Subsequent review of this risk-assessment tool resulted in DHS reassigning approximately 500 facilities to a lower risk tier. The DHS lowered the number of facilities allocated to the highest-risk tier from 211 to 102, a greater than 50% reduction. In some cases, DHS determined that some facilities no longer qualified as a high-risk facility and thus were not subject to CFATS regulation.", "Overall, the total number of chemical facilities assigned a risk tier by DHS has declined since the CFATS program began. Several factors may have contributed to this decline, including erroneous filing by regulated entities, process changes on the part of regulated entities, and business operations and decisions. The DHS has also engaged in targeted outreach activities to identify those facilities that fall under the regulation but have not yet complied by filing required information. The DHS asserts that the observed reduction in regulated chemical facilities indicates that the CFATS program and its statutory authority are increasing security by inducing voluntary reductions in chemical holdings by regulated entities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Facility Inspections", "paragraphs": ["The DHS planned to begin inspections of Tier 1 facilities as quickly as 14 months after issuance of regulations. Several factors have delayed inspections, including the release of additional regulatory information in the form of an appendix and the need to build an inspector cadre, to establish a regional infrastructure, and to perform pre-authorization inspections at facilities. DHS officials have provided a series of timeframes for beginning inspections. The DHS began inspections of Tier 1 facilities in February 2010. At that time, DHS testified that it planned to inspect all Tier 1 facilities by the end of calendar year 2010, but DHS had only performed nine authorization inspections as of September 2011. Similarly, although DHS subsequently stated that it expected to inspect all Tier 1 facilities by the end of calendar year 2011, it had approved 10 site security plans and no implementation of any site security plan by that time. Since then, DHS has implemented an interim site security plan review process that it asserts is more effective and timely. The DHS has used this interim review process to authorize additional site security plans. As of September 9, 2012, DHS had approved or conditionally approved 73 site security plans. The DHS also reported that it had successfully inspected and approved the site security plan implementation at two facilities. ", "The DHS also identifies annual performance measures for the inspection of high-risk chemical facilities. The DHS uses as a performance measure the ratio of inspected high-risk chemical facilities that are compliant with CFATS risk-based performance standards to the number of high-risk chemical facilities selected for inspection each year. Table 3 summarizes the information presented by DHS in its annual performance reports. While DHS set target goals of high levels of compliance within inspected facilities, DHS did not meet this goal in FY2008. Beginning in FY2011, DHS lowered the target goal. The DHS reports in the most recent annual performance report that 9.1% of inspected chemical facilities were compliant, even though DHS has testified that no chemical facility has had a successful authorization inspection.", "Beyond challenges related to program management, DHS identified an additional factor in the delay of the inspection schedule: the necessary iteration between DHS and the regulated entity regarding its site security plan. The DHS has issued 66 administrative orders to compel facilities to complete their site security plans. In addition, DHS established a pre-authorization inspection process to gain additional information from facilities to fully assess the submitted site security plan. Once DHS completes a pre-authorization inspection at a facility, the facility may amend its site security plan to reflect the results of the pre-authorization inspection. The DHS had performed approximately 180 pre-authorization inspections as of February 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internal Review of CFATS Program", "paragraphs": ["A series of challenges internal to the Infrastructure Security Compliance Division (ISCD), which implements CFATS regulations, led to an internal review of ISCD. These challenges included problems with the assignment of regulated chemical facilities to risk tiers and issues with respect to locality pay. In December 2010, NPPD initiated a management review of ISCD through the NPPD Office of Compliance and Security. In July 2011, new leadership took charge of ISCD and, at the direction of Under Secretary Beers, began a review of the goals, challenges, and potential corrective actions to improve program performance. In November 2011, ISCD leadership presented Under Secretary Beers with a report containing the results of both reviews. According to DHS, the report was intended as a candid, internal assessment that focused predominantly on the challenges faced by ISCD rather than on the program's successes and opportunities.", "At the time of the report, DHS had received approximately 4,200 site security plans but had not yet approved any. The review report identified several factors that contributed to this lack of success. These factors included the inability to perform compliance inspections and the lack of an established records management system to document key decisions were identified. Other challenges facing ISCD reportedly include human resource issues, such as having employees with insufficient qualifications and work training, erroneous impressions of inspector roles and responsibilities, and the use of contractors to perform inherently governmental work. Additional reported challenges include difficulty in quickly altering workplace requirements, resolving personnel security requirements, detailing site security compliance inspections, managing workplace behavior and perceptions, and dealing with a unionized workforce. Additionally, ISCD lacked a system for tracking the usage of consumable supplies, potentially allowing for waste fraud and abuse; faced challenges in hiring new qualified individuals; and suffered from a lack of morale. ", "The memorandum identified three top priorities to address the challenges addressing ISCD:", "clearing the backlog of site security plans; developing a chemical inspection process; and addressing ISCD statutory responsibilities for regulating ammonium nitrate and managing personnel surety as part of the CFATS program.", "The ISCD has established a working group to look at potential legislative and regulatory changes and developed an action plan with discrete action items to address these challenges. In addition to the action plan, NPPD has requested ISCD leadership to provide milestones and a schedule for completion of the action plan tasks. The ISCD is implementing this plan with the oversight of NPPD leadership. The DHS expects to assess the ongoing success of the action plan and revise it as necessary. According to GAO, ISCD has developed at least eight sequential versions of the action plan, updating each additional version, and in some cases adding additional detail, milestones, or timelines.", "The DHS reports it has completed 59 of the 95 action items included in the action plan. The ISCD has implemented an interim review process for site security plans with a goal of formalizing a new review process by July 2012. To comply with items in the action plan, ISCD has updated its internal policy and guidance materials for inspections, created a monthly ISCD newsletter, promoted staff engagement and dialogue, provided additional supervisory training and guidance, and attempting to hire a permanent leadership team. In addition, NPPD is overseeing review of the process by which ISCD assigns risk tiers to regulated facilities.", "The GAO has reviewed DHS progress on the action plan and stated that \"ISCD appears to be heading in the right direction, but it is too early to tell if individual items are having their desired effect because ISCD is in the early stages of implementing corrective actions and has not established performance measures to assess results.\" The GAO provides several caveats to its assessment, including that it did not have available documentary evidence about the causes of the issues identified in the ISCD memorandum.

As stated by DHS when describing its efforts to hire, train, and deploy an inspector cadre and support staff:", "Infrastructure Security Inspectors, located in up to 10 primary field offices across the Nation, will inspect and ensure regulatory compliance at facilities covered by the CFATS regulation, including site security plan approval and maintaining respective inspection and audit schedule. Creating a fully functional cadre will require not just recruiting and training staff, but also procurement of communications and [information technology] equipment (laptops, blackberries, etc.) to facilitate work efforts while conducting inspections and traveling, but also the acquisition of office space and equipment, government vehicles, support staff, safety equipment and clothing, and support for frequent travel.", "The degree to which funds meet agency needs likely depends on factors external and internal to DHS. External factors include the number of regulated facilities and the sufficiency of security plan implementation. Internal factors include the ratio between headquarters staff and field inspectors; the risk tiers of the regulated facilities; and the timetable for implementation of inspections. Once the DHS determines the tiers of all regulated facilities and their associated timetables, DHS may be able to more comprehensively determine its resource needs. Now that DHS has begun implementation of these requirements, it may be able to provide further estimates of both funding and staff requirements. According to the committee report accompanying S. 3216 , Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2013, NPPD will complete during FY2012 a detailed manpower and systems review that will identify the total number of inspectors. A key factor may be the success in training inspectors to perform CFATS inspections, given the reported difficulties in developing effective inspector training combined with the requirements of a new regulatory program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rate of Inspection", "paragraphs": ["As of September 2012, two chemical facilities have completed the CFATS process, which starts with information submission by chemical facilities and finishes with inspection and approval of security measures by DHS. The DHS states that the first authorization inspection was conducted in 2010, and as of September 2012, DHS has conducted 19 authorization inspections. According to the report accompanying H.R. 5855 , Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2013, DHS projects that it will require almost seven years of inspections to approve and inspect all regulated facilities. Some policymakers have expressed surprise at the pace of inspection and questioned whether DHS should continue at the current pace or accelerate the compliance process. Several factors likely complicate and slow the inspection process. One factor appears to be the internal operations of the DHS implementing office. Another factor appears to be that the information facilities submit in site security plans may not provide what DHS views as necessary detail to evaluate compliance. Rather than reject these site security plans, DHS implemented an additional inspection function, a pre-authorization inspection, to allow DHS to gather the necessary information from regulated facilities. ", "While pre-authorization inspections may lead to higher quality site security plan submissions, they appear to be a significant drain on DHS resources. In principle, such pre-authorization inspections may lower the future authorization inspection burden, as CFATS inspectors will be familiar with security measures at the chemical facility. Such familiarity may hasten the actual authorization inspection. ", "The DHS has also suggested that pre-authorization inspections are most necessary at higher risk tier facilities, due to the complexity of the facility, the potential presence of multiple chemicals of interest, and the more stringent risk-based performance standards that apply. Lower risk tier facilities may not need pre-authorization inspections both because of their comparative simplicity and because inspectors may develop best practices through the pre-authorization inspections of higher tiered facilities.", "Some policymakers have questioned whether the low inspection rate is due to constraints in the number of chemical facility security inspectors hired by DHS or the availability of appropriated funding. The CFATS regulation states that DHS will inspect the implementation of site security plans at all facilities and requires that facilities resubmit their site security plan every two years for Tier 1 and Tier 2 facilities or three years for Tier 3 and Tier 4 facilities. This requires DHS to perform approximately 1,700 inspections annually to inspect each facility's implementation of its site security plan. The DHS has asserted that inspections require two or more inspectors and approximately one week to perform.", "The DHS appears to have requested sufficient inspectors to manage the workload associated with a reinspection cycle of every two years for top tier facilities and every three years for lower tier facilities, but such a staffing level may be insufficient to address the large number of initial regulatory submissions or a more frequent reinspection cycle. This level of staffing would appear to require approximately a full cycle of inspections to reduce the backlog created from the initial site security plan submissions. If DHS were to hire additional inspectors, it might reduce the backlog of site security plans but also run the risk of having additional unnecessary staff in future years. The DHS might hire temporary or short-term staff to augment the inspector cadre, but the need to train such employees for CFATS-specific inspections may pose challenges.", "Finally, because DHS has focused on inspecting those facilities in the highest risk tier, it potentially faces the most complicated inspection environments. Inspections of lower risk tier facilities may pose fewer complications, take less time, and involve fewer inspectors. If so, DHS might quickly and substantially increase the number of facilities inspected by focusing efforts on lower tier facilities. Through this approach, DHS might gain insight and experience among the inspector cadre while reducing some national risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Preemption of State Activities", "paragraphs": ["The original statute did not expressly address the issue of federal preemption of state and local chemical facility security statute or regulation. When DHS issued regulations establishing the CFATS program, DHS asserted that the CFATS regulations would preempt state and local chemical facility security statute or regulation that conflicted with, hindered, posed an obstacle, or frustrated the purposes of the federal regulation. Subsequent to the release of the regulation, Congress amended DHS's statutory authority to state that only in the case of an \"actual conflict\" would the federal regulation preempt state authority. Few states have established independent chemical facility security regulatory programs, and conflict between the federal and state activities has not yet occurred. The DHS did not identify any state programs that conflict with the CFATS regulations. The DHS has also not altered its regulatory language in response to the statutory amendment.", "Advocates for federal preemption call for a uniform security framework across the nation. They assert that a \"patchwork\" of regulations might develop if states independently develop additional chemical facility security regulations. Variation in security requirements might lead to differing regulatory compliance costs, and companies might suffer competitive disadvantage based on their geographic location.", "Supporters of a state's right to regulate chemical facility security claim that the federal regulation should be a minimum standard with which all regulated entities must comply. They assert that DHS should allow states to develop more stringent regulations than the federal regulations. They claim such regulations would increase security. Some supporters of state regulation suggest that more stringent, conflicting state regulations should preempt the federal regulations. Such a case might occur if a state regulation mandated the use of a particular security approach at chemical facilities, conflicting with the federal regulation that adopts a performance-based, rather than prescriptive, approach. The desire to retain industries that might relocate if faced with increased regulation arguably would temper state inclinations to require overly stringent or incompatible regulations.", "Some policymakers may assert that chemical facility security should be left to the states rather than be implemented by the federal government.

They assert that those individuals living in surrounding communities require such information to plan effectively and make choices in an emergency.", "The current statute and regulation prohibit public disclosure of security-related information. Only specific \"covered persons\" may access CVI. While acknowledging a legitimate homeland security need to limit dissemination of security information, some policymakers have questioned whether such limitations hinder other efforts. For example, first responders and community representatives have highlighted how such information protection regimes may impede emergency response and the ability of those in the surrounding community to react to emergency situations at the chemical facility. Additionally, worker representatives have raised concerns that these limitations and the lack of mandated inclusion of worker representatives may impede worker input into security plans. ", "The current information protection regimes for chemical facility security information, CVI under CFATS and Sensitive Security Information (SSI) under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA), do not contain penalties for incorrectly marking information as protected. Only disclosure of correctly marked information is penalized. Additionally, the chemical facility is responsible for identifying and appropriately marking protected information. These information markings only would be assessed in the case of dispute. As was asserted during congressional oversight, this disparity may lead to a tendency by regulated entities, in order to protect themselves against potential liability or scrutiny, to erroneously limit dissemination of information that should be made available to the public. ", "Congressional investigation indicated that documents related to the 2007 explosion at a Bayer CropScience chemical facility in West Virginia were incorrectly labeled as protected from disclosure. The DHS regulated this chemical facility under MTSA, not CFATS. In this case, security information was protected from disclosure as SSI, an information protection regime similar to CVI. Company officials broadly applied SSI markings to facility documents partly in hopes of avoiding a public debate on the use and storage of particular chemicals at the facility. This revelation led to questions regarding the application and oversight of such protective markings.", "Additionally, the existing statute contains no provisions explicitly protecting or allowing for concerned covered persons to divulge CVI or to challenge the categorization of information as protected in an attempt to inform authorities about security vulnerabilities or other weaknesses. Depending on the circumstances, those individuals might be penalized for their disclosure of protected information. The CFATS regulations, reflecting this inherent tension, provide for a point of contact to which such information might be revealed, but also state \"Section 550 did not give DHS authority to provide whistleblower protection, and so DHS has not incorporated specific whistleblower protections into this regulation.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of Chemical Facility", "paragraphs": ["The DHS regulates both entities that possess and entities that manufacture chemicals of interest. Thus, the term chemical facility encompasses many types of facilities, including agricultural facilities, universities, and others. With DHS defining chemical facilities according to possession of a chemical of interest, facilities not part of the chemical manufacturing and distributing chain have become regulated facilities. Stakeholders have expressed concern that the number of entities so regulated might be unwieldy and that the regulatory program might focus on many chemical facilities that pose little risk rather than on those facilities that pose more substantial risk. For example, during the rulemaking process, DHS received commentary and revised its regulatory threshold for possession of propane, stating:", "DHS, however, set the [screening threshold quantities] for propane in this final rule at 60,000 pounds. Sixty thousand pounds is the estimated maximum amount of propane that non-industrial propane customers, such as restaurants and farmers, typically use.

The federal government does not regulate water and wastewater treatment facilities for chemical security purposes. Instead, current chemical security efforts at water and wastewater treatment facilities are voluntary in nature. Some advocacy groups have called for inclusion of currently exempt facilities, such as water and wastewater treatment facilities. Some drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities possess large amounts of potentially hazardous chemicals, such as chlorine, for purposes such as disinfection. Advocates for their inclusion in security regulations cite the presence of such potentially hazardous chemicals and their relative proximity to population centers as reasons to mandate security measures for such facilities. In contrast, representatives of the water sector point to the critical role that water and wastewater treatment facilities have in daily life. They caution against including these facilities in the existing regulatory framework because of the potential for undue public impacts. They cite, for example, loss of basic fire protection and sanitation services if the federal government orders a water or wastewater utility to cease operations for security reasons or failure to comply with regulation.", "If Congress were to remove the drinking water and wastewater treatment facility exemption, the number of regulated facilities might substantially increase, placing additional burdens on the CFATS program.

The number of regulated facilities would depend on the criteria used to determine inclusion, such as chemical possession or number of individuals served.

It is challenging to unequivocally state that one technology is inherently safer than the other without adequate metrics. Risk factors may exist outside of the comparison framework. Some experts have asserted that the metrics for comparing industrial processes are not yet fully established and need additional research and study. The National Academies have recommended that DHS support research and development to foster cost-effective, inherently safer chemistries and chemical processes. The National Academies has identified as a potential concern that inherently safer process analyses may become narrowly focused and its outcomes inappropriately weighted. A facility might consider many additional factors beyond homeland security implications when weighing the applicability and benefit of switching from one process to another. These factors include cost, technical challenges regarding implementation in specific situations, supply chain impacts, quality and availability of end products, and indirect effects on workers. ", "Supporters of adopting these approaches as a way to improve chemical facility security argue that reducing or removing these chemicals from a facility will reduce the incentive to attack the facility. They suggest that reducing the consequences of a release also lowers the threat from terrorist attack and mitigates the risk to the surrounding populace. They point to facilities that have voluntarily changed amounts of chemicals on hand or chemical processes in use as examples that facilities can implement such an approach in a cost-effective, practical fashion.", "Opponents of mandating what proponents call inherently safer technologies question the validity of the approach as a security tool and the government's ability to effectively oversee its implementation. Industrial entities assert that process safety engineers within the regulated industry already employ such approaches and that these are safety, not security, methods. They assert that process safety experts and business executives should determine the applicability and financial practicality of changing existing processes at specific chemical facilities. A 2011 industry survey stated that, of those respondents that assessed using alternative chemicals or processes, 66.4% determined such alternatives were not technically feasible. Opponents of an inherently safer technology mandate also state concern that few existing alternative approaches are well understood with regard to their unanticipated side effects. They claim that researchers should continue to study these alternative approaches rather than immediately apply them, since unanticipated side effects could injure business and other interests. A third opposing view questions whether the federal government contains the required technical expertise to adjudicate the practicality and benefit of alternative technological approaches. Holders of this view raise concerns that the federal government may not possess the required knowledge or expertise to judge whether a particular site can implement alternative technology, even if the alternative theoretically provides benefits over existing technology.", "The DHS has engaged in research and development activities within its Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate to develop a better understanding of inherently safer technology, including efforts to define inherently safer technology.

Regulated entities incur a cost when meeting existing CFATS requirements, and small businesses may be challenged to make necessary capital investments. In its interim final rule, DHS estimated that even without an inherently safer technology requirement CFATS \"may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\" Because of the performance-based nature of the regulatory requirement, it is difficult to detail the exact impact on small businesses. Adding an inherently safer technology requirement might increase the cost of CFATS compliance and might disproportionately affect small entities not already incorporating such activities in their business processes.

The extent to which homeland security impact has factored into these industry decisions is unknown, but DHS has identified cases where chemical facilities have voluntarily modified chemical processes to lower their CFATS tier. An additional complication to assessing inherently safer technology is the varying amounts and quality of information available regarding industrial implementation of inherently safer technologies. While some facilities have converted to processes generally deemed as inherently safer, other facilities may not have sufficient information available to effectively assess the impacts from changing existing processes to ones considered inherently safer.
