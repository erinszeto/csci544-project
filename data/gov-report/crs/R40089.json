Written, passed, and signed into law at what some consider the height of the Cold War, the act is seen by some today as anachronistic. Ironically, when President Kennedy urged the 87th Congress to enact foreign aid legislation that would exemplify and advance the national interests and security strategies of the United States post-World War II, he described the existing foreign aid mechanisms as bureaucratic, fragmented, awkward, and slow. Some have used the same language today, more than 50 years later, to characterize the legislation he promoted.", "On several occasions over the past 20 years, Congress has set out to assess the current body of law that comprises foreign aid policy, starting with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations Committees, in recent past Congresses, have considered legislation to rebuild the United States' capacity to deliver effective foreign aid, and make aid more transparent and responsive to today's quick-changing international challenges. Proposals have ranged from setting up advisory committees to a complete overhaul of foreign aid objectives and programs.", "This report presents the authorities of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and correlates those authorities with the operative appropriations measure (division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012; P.L. 112-74; 124 Stat. 786 at 1164) that funds those authorities. It replaces an earlier issue of the same report, dated July 29, 2011, to incorporate the current appropriations act.", "For many years, foreign aid appropriations measures have waived the requirement that funds must be authorized before they are appropriated and expended. Understanding the relation between the authorities in the cornerstone act and appropriations is key to foreign aid reform."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195; 22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), enacted at the behest of President Kennedy, sought to organize and implement U.S. foreign assistance programs with a commitment to long-range economic assistance to the developing world. The President, in a \"Special Message to the Congress on Foreign Aid,\" delivered March 22, 1961, described the U.S. foreign aid programs emerging from World War II as", "[b]ureaucratically fragmented, awkward and slow, its administration is diffused over a haphazard and irrational structure covering at least four departments and several other agencies. The program is based on a series of legislative measures and administrative procedures conceived at different times and for different purposes, many of them now obsolete, inconsistent and unduly rigid and thus unsuited for our present needs and purposes. Its weaknesses have begun to undermine confidence in our effort both here and abroad.", "President Kennedy went on to note the declining prestige of the United States' foreign aid apparatus and the negative impact of that decline on administering and staffing programs abroad. The President also cited the uneven and undependable short-term financing of programs and the resulting disincentive for long-term efficient planning. Congress and the executive branch worked together to enact the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to address these shortcomings at a time when much of the developing world was emerging as newly independent states, when those new nations were, \"without exception ... under Communist pressure,\" and when \"the free industrialized nations\" found themselves in a position \"to assist the less-developed nations on a long-term basis ... [as they find themselves] on the threshold of achieving sufficient economic, social and political strength and self-sustained growth to stand permanently on their own feet.\"", "Though the original Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 lengthened the authorization time frame for funding development assistance to five years, other programs were authorized for shorter periods. The act still required occasional reauthorization legislation to renew programs beyond that original time frame, and Congress retained its role of appropriating funds. The original act authorized the funding levels shown in Table 1 .", "Through 1985, Congress regularly enacted new authorization legislation or amended the original act to update authorization time frames, and to incorporate newer programs and authorities. From 1986 on, however, Congress turned more frequently to enacting freestanding authorities that did not amend the 1961 act, and included language in annual appropriations measures to waive the requirement to keep authorizations current. Thus, sections in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, in many instances, do not refer to authorization beyond fiscal years 1986 and 1987 (unless the program was added to the act by an amendment enacted after that period), but programs are continued through appropriations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Other Authorizations", "paragraphs": ["A few programs are established outside the statutory framework of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and thus are not included in detail in this report. Reimbursable military exports, for example, are addressed in the Arms Export Control Act and subsequent Security Assistance Acts. Since 1985, the last year Congress passed a comprehensive reauthorization of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, both Congress and the President have promoted a variety of specialized authorities in freestanding legislation. And, on rare occasion, Congress has established new authorities or programs in annual appropriations acts. Some freestanding laws that authorize foreign aid or apply new conditions to aid authorized in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 are shown in Table 2 ."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Foreign Assistance Act of 1961: Authorities and Appropriations", "paragraphs": [" Table 3 presents the authorities enacted in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and the corresponding appropriations that fund those authorities in the current foreign assistance appropriations act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Authorization", "paragraphs": ["The left-side column of Table 3 cites sections of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, that authorize programs, and provides the latest year for which authorization is enacted.
