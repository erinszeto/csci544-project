{"id": "R42343", "title": "Health Insurance Coverage of Children, 2010", "released_date": "2012-02-09T00:00:00", "summary": ["In 2010, 90% of children had health insurance coverage in the United States, and 10% of children were uninsured. Among children with coverage, private health insurance, including employer-sponsored insurance and nongroup insurance, was the predominant source of coverage, followed by public coverage, including Medicaid and other means-tested public programs (e.g., the State Children's Health Insurance Program\u2014CHIP), as well as Medicare and military health care.", "These estimates, and the estimates detailed in this report, are from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS, commonly known as the March Supplement). The CPS is representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States. National-level estimates in this report are created using the most recent CPS data, representing data from 2010, as well as historical data from previous years. State-level estimates are created using a three-year average of CPS data (representing data from 2008 to 2010), which provide reliable state estimates.", "The national-level estimates provide only a limited understanding of the health insurance coverage of children under age 19. To better understand this population, the report provides an analysis of the variation in coverage by selected demographic and family characteristics, including age, race, ethnicity, citizenship status, poverty status, and family composition. For example, in 2010, non-citizen children, Hispanic children, and children not living with at least one parent/guardian were more likely to be uninsured compared with other children.", "Another important factor affecting uninsurance rates among children is the variation across states. During the 2008-2010 period, the percentage of uninsured children ranged from a high of 17.3% in Texas to a low of 3.2% in Massachusetts. Not only does coverage vary by states, but the source of insurance coverage also varies by states. The percentage of children covered by private health insurance ranged from 80.1% in New Hampshire to 46.9% in Mississippi, and the percentage of children covered by public coverage ranged from 50.6% in the District of Columbia to 18.3% in Utah.", "Finally, examining changes in coverage and source of coverage over time provides additional insight into insurance and sources of coverage for children. Between 2000 and 2010, the uninsured rate among children decreased by about 1 percentage point, while the percentage of children with private insurance decreased by more than 11 percentage points and the percentage with public coverage increased by 13.5 percentage points.", "As Congress focuses on allocating limited resources to programs such as Medicaid and CHIP, a deeper understanding of the characteristics of uninsured children may prove useful to inform this discussion."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, research has consistently shown that children with health insurance coverage have better access to health care services and a regular health care provider, which in turn results in better health outcomes. According to the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS, often called the March Supplement), in 2010, 90.0% of children had health insurance and 10.0% were uninsured. Similarly, in 2009, 10.2% of children were uninsured. ", "While overall 10.0% of children are uninsured, the uninsured rate among children varies in different segments of the population. For example, older children are more likely to be uninsured compared with younger children, and Hispanic children have twice the uninsured rate compared with non-Hispanic children. State factors, such as eligibility levels for public programs (e.g., Medicaid) and a state's health insurance market, also affect the health insurance status of children. The CPS data show that the uninsured rate among children across the states ranges from 17.3% in Texas to 3.2% in Massachusetts.", "Children who have health insurance have either private insurance, public coverage, or both. Private insurance includes employer-sponsored insurance and nongroup insurance (insurance purchased in the individual market); public coverage includes Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and any other means-tested public programs, as well as Medicare and military health care (e.g., TRICARE and Veterans Administration [VA] Health Care). Children may have more than one source of coverage, and those coverage types could be different. For example, a child could have employer-sponsored insurance, a type of private insurance, and Medicaid, a type of public coverage. In 2010, 59.9% of children had private insurance and 37.2% had public coverage.", "Sources of health insurance coverage vary according to a child's demographic and family characteristics. For example, in 2010, children living in families with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) were more likely to have public coverage and less likely to have private insurance compared with children living in families with higher incomes.
