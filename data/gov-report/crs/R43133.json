Alaska began implementing its FY2013 sequester cuts on May 19, 2013, which was after the last payable EB period in Alaska ended. Therefore, in FY2013, states were responsible for implementing the sequester of EUC08 benefits only. According to the National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA), of the 52 states and territories that responded to a survey in June 2013,", "19 states implemented FY2013 sequester cuts of 10.7% on March 31, 2013; 9 states implemented cuts by April 30, 2013; 14 states implemented cuts by May 31, 2013; 8 states planned to implement cuts by June 30, 2013; and 1 state planned to implement cuts by August 31, 2013. ", "In addition, NASWA reported that North Carolina did not plan to implement the sequester reduction for FY2013 since the EUC08 program in that state no longer met the federal requirements to offer EUC08 to its workers as of July 2013.", "Not all states implemented the sequestration reductions uniformly across all EUC08 beneficiaries in FY2013. Several states were unable to implement the preferred method of reduction as outlined by the U.S. DOL. Among these states, there were three alternative methods used in FY2013: (1) paused-week, (2) grandfathering, and (3) reduction of weeks within a tier.", "1. Paused-Week : States scheduled two-three weeks during which no EUC08 benefits were paid. The remaining weeks of EUC08 were still paid. For example, South Carolina did not pay EUC08 benefits for the weeks ending on May 18, July 13, and August 31, 2013. 2. Grandfathering : The sequester cuts applied only to claimants entering a new EUC08 tier. For example, in California the 17.69% cut did not impact anyone collecting EUC08 on an existing tier filed with an effective date before April 28, 2013. Instead, the sequester reduction was implemented when an individual finished a current tier and became eligible to receive benefits on the next EUC08 tier filed with an effective date of April 28, 2013, or after. 3. Reduction of Weeks in EUC08 Tiers : The state reduced the number of weeks available in each tier of EUC08, but did not reduce the weekly benefit paid. For example, Maine opted to stop paying the last eight weeks of tier III EUC08 benefits, leaving one remaining week available.", "For more specific information on state implementation of the UI sequester, links to state workforce agency websites are available through the U.S. Department of Labor's America's Service Locator at http://www.servicelocator.org/OWSLinks.asp ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Has There Been Any Legislation Proposed to End the UI Sequester?", "paragraphs": ["There has been no relevant legislation introduced in the 114 th Congress as of the date of this publication.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) states:", "An administrative furlough is a planned event by an agency which is designed to absorb reductions necessitated by downsizing, reduced funding, lack of work, or any budget situation other than a lapse in appropriations. Furloughs that would potentially result from sequestration would generally be considered administrative furloughs.", "In the event of a furlough, federal employees may become eligible for UI benefits through the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. Under federal law, UCFE provides income support for laid-off or furloughed federal employees in the same way as under the UC program for other types of workers. Eligibility\u2014as well as benefit levels and the waiting period for benefits\u2014under UCFE are determined according to the state laws of the UC program in the state where the federal employee's official duty station was located. As with UC, separated federal employees, including furloughed employees, must have earned a certain amount of wages or have worked for a certain period of time (or both) within the previous 12-18 months to be monetarily eligible to receive any UI benefits (although methods that states use to determine this eligibility vary greatly).", "Thus, whether or not a furloughed federal employee may be eligible for UCFE will depend on relevant state UC laws. In particular, two key state law issues factor into this type of UCFE eligibility decision: (1) the state definition of \"partial unemployment\" and (2) whether or not there is a \"waiting week\" required under state law.", "First, because UI benefits are designed to provide temporary income support to the involuntarily unemployed , a furloughed federal employee must meet the relevant state definition of unemployment. The UI system permits benefit receipt in certain circumstance of reduced work hours or short-term reemployment\u2014primarily in order not to discourage work or reemployment. Therefore, each state has its own laws regarding how much work may be performed without making an individual ineligible for UI benefits, that is, partial unemployment. Under state laws, an individual is generally considered to be partially unemployed in any week with less than full-time work and with earnings of less than the weekly benefit amount, or the weekly benefit amount plus an allowance. For instance, in the District of Columbia, an individual is considered partially unemployed if he or she has earnings that are less than the individual's weekly benefit amount plus $20. Furloughed individuals must meet the state definition of partial unemployment in order to be potentially eligible for UC or UCFE benefits. ", "Second, most states require that eligible individuals first serve a waiting week before receiving any UI benefits. For instance, the District of Columbia and Virginia have a waiting week requirement of one week. Maryland has no waiting week requirement. In states with a waiting week requirement, an individual's furlough days would need to be spread out across more than one week of unemployment. That is, an individual would need to meet the state's definition of unemployment\u2014including partial unemployment\u2014in more than one week (i.e., the waiting week plus an additional week) in order to be eligible for UI benefits.", "For additional guidance on furloughed federal employees and UCFE, see", "U.S. DOL, \"Information for Furloughed Federal Workers,\" available at http://www.dol.gov/sequestration/ui-federalemployees.htm ; and OPM, \"Guidance for Administrative Furloughs,\" June 10, 2013, p. 18 (H.1.), available at http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/furlough-guidance/guidance-for-administrative-furloughs.pdf ."], "subsections": []}]}}
