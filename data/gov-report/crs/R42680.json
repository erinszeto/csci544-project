With the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992, Congress authorized FDA to collect user fees from the manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products and to use the revenue for specified activities. PDUFA became possible when FDA, industry, and Congress agreed on two concepts: (1) performance goals \u2014FDA would commit to performance goals it would negotiate with industry that set target completion times for various review processes; and (2) use of fees \u2014the revenue from prescription drug user fees would be used only for activities to support the review of human drug applications and would supplement\u2014rather than replace\u2014funding that Congress appropriated to FDA. The added resources from user fees allowed FDA to increase staff to review what was then a backlog of new drug applications and to reduce application review times. Over the years, Congress has added similar authority regarding the regulatory review of medical devices and animal drugs. User fees make up 35% of the FY2012 FDA budget. Their contribution to FDA's human drug program is larger at 51%.", "Following the precedent set by PDUFA, all the user fee programs addressed in this legislation include both (1) legislation and (2) performance goals agreements developed with representatives of the regulated industry in consultation with representatives of patients and advocates, academic and scientific experts, and congressional committees.", "FDA may use the revenue from PDUFA fees to support \"the process for the review of human drug applications.\" With each reauthorization of PDUFA, Congress has expanded the range of activities included in that phrase.

Medical devices are broadly integrated into health care and include simple devices, such as tongue depressors, as well as more complex devices, such as implantable hips. The extent of FDA authority to regulate whether a device may be marketed in the United States and how it is monitored afterward varies across types of devices.", "In order to determine the applicability of premarket requirements (i.e., clearance or approval before marketing) for a given device, FDA classifies the device based on the risk to the patient: (1) low-risk devices are class I; (2) moderate-risk are class II; and (3) high-risk are class III. Low-risk medical devices (class I) and a very small number of moderate-risk medical devices (class II) are exempt from premarket review. In general, for moderate-risk and high-risk medical devices, there are two pathways that manufacturers can use to bring such devices to market with FDA's permission: (1) premarket approval (PMA) and (2) premarket notification submission (also known as a 510(k) submission, after the section in the FFDCA that authorized this type of notification).", "The PMA process generally consists of conducting clinical studies and submitting a PMA application, which requires evidence providing reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. This is somewhat analogous to the new drug application process. A PMA is used for novel and high-risk devices, is often lengthy and expensive, and results in a type of FDA permission called approval. The other path involves submitting a 510(k) notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device already on the market (a predicate device) that does not require a PMA. The 510(k) process is unique to medical devices and results in FDA clearance. Substantial equivalence is determined by comparing the performance characteristics of a new device with those of a predicate device.", "Once a device is on the market, FDA has authority to carry out certain activities to monitor its safety and effectiveness. The extent of the agency's postmarket authority is tied to characteristics of the device. Manufacturer requirements include areas such as labeling, postmarket surveillance, device tracking, and adverse event reporting.", "Provisions in FDASIA make modifications to various aspects of premarket and postmarket device regulation. Premarket modifications include those intended to (1) affect the efficiency, transparency, and data requirements of the 510(k) and PMA processes; and (2) alter or make clarifications to certain types of exempt devices, for example, custom devices and humanitarian use devices. With respect to postmarket regulation, provisions focus on expanding active postmarket surveillance; altering requirements related to postmarket studies for devices; and strengthening both device recall and tracking capabilities through a recall program and the unique device identifier system. Miscellaneous reforms include those aimed at increasing transparency of FDA's approval and clearance decisions and processes for issuing industry guidance documents; improving health information technology for the agency; and harmonizing device regulation with FDA's international counterparts.", "In general, Title VI:", "Clarifies that the Secretary will not be allowed to disapprove an investigational device exemption (IDE) application because the Secretary determines that (1) the investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of a device, (2) the investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device, or (3) an additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device (\u00a7601). To clarify \"the least burdensome standard\" for PMA applications (without altering the criteria for evaluating a PMA application), defines the requirement for necessary clinical data as the minimum required to demonstrate, for purposes of approval, the effectiveness of a device for the conditions of use (\u00a7602). To clarify \"the least burdensome standard\" for 510(k) notifications (without altering the standard for determining substantial equivalence), defines the requirement for necessary information (to demonstrate that devices with differing technological characteristics are substantially equivalent) as the minimum required to support a determination of substantial equivalence between a new device and a predicate device (\u00a7602). Requires the Secretary to completely document the scientific and regulatory rationale for any significant decision regarding submission or review of a report under Section 510(k), a PMA application, or an IDE application, including documentation of significant controversies or differences of opinion, and to provide this documentation to the applicant upon request; a supervisory review of the significant decision may also be requested (\u00a7603). Requires the Secretary to withdraw the July 2011 draft FDA guidance entitled \"Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\u2014510(k) Device Modifications: Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device,\" leaving the prior guidance issued in 1997 in effect (\u00a7604). Requires a report to House and Senate committees regarding when a 510(k) notification should be submitted for a modification or change to a legally marketed device; draft guidance or proposed regulation on 510(k) device modification will not be issued before these committees receive this report and final guidance or regulation will not be issued until one year after the committees receive such report (\u00a7604). Requires the Secretary to establish a program to improve the device recall system, to include the assessment of information on device recalls; clarification of procedures for conducting device recall audit checks; assessment of the effectiveness of corrections or action plans for recalls; and documentation of the basis for terminations of recalls (\u00a7605). Allows the Secretary, at any time, to issue a clinical hold prohibiting the sponsor of a medical device from conducting a clinical investigation using the medical device if the Secretary determines the device represents an unreasonable risk to the safety of the persons who are the subjects of the clinical investigation or for such other reasons the Secretary may establish by regulation (\u00a7606). Allows the Secretary, for certain new devices, in response to a request for an initial device (de novo) classification, to classify the new device without first issuing a determination that it is not substantially equivalent (NSE) to an existing device; this classification request may be declined if there exists a legally marketed device on which to base a substantial equivalence review, or if the new device is not a low-moderate risk device or general controls would be inadequate to control risks and special controls cannot be developed (\u00a7607). Allows the Secretary to change the classification of a device based on new information, and to revoke any regulation or requirement under FFDCA Sections 514 or 515, by administrative order instead of by regulation; requires publication of the proposed order with a substantive summary of the scientific evidence for the reclassification; specifies requirements for public comment, a meeting of a device classification panel, and a final order; specifies that Administrative Procedure Act requirements regarding regulations would not apply, although the order would be subject to judicial review; and limits authority to issue the administrative order so it cannot be delegated below the Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, acting in consultation with the FDA Commissioner (\u00a7608). Authorizes the Secretary, with respect to devices, to enter into arrangements with nations regarding harmonization of regulatory requirements for activities, including inspections and common international labeling symbols, and to participate in international fora, including the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (\u00a7\u00a7609 and 610).

Allows a device granted a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) to qualify for an exemption to the general ban on selling such devices for a profit if the HDE device is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of (1) a disease or condition that does not occur in pediatric patients, or, (2) that occurs in pediatric patients in such numbers that device development is impossible, highly impracticable, or unsafe (\u00a7613). Allows a sponsor of a device granted an HDE prior to the bill's enactment to seek a determination as to whether it would qualify for an exemption to the profit ban (\u00a7613). Requires the Secretary to issue proposed regulations for a unique device identification system not later than December 31, 2012; to finalize proposed regulations no later than six months after the close of the comment period; and to implement final regulations with respect to certain devices no later than two years after finalization of the regulations (\u00a7614). Requires the Secretary to modify Sentinel (the Postmarket Risk Identification and Analysis System) to include medical devices, and requires the Secretary, when expanding this system, to engage stakeholders and to use relevant data on cleared and approved devices (\u00a7615). Specifies that the Secretary's authority to order the conduct of postmarket surveillance is at the time of approval or clearance of a device or at any time thereafter; and requires the manufacturer to commence any required postmarket surveillance not later than 15 months after being so ordered (\u00a7616). Broadens the definition of custom devices, which are exempt from the requirements of FFDCA Sections 514 and 515; outlines limitations to the exemption; and requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations on the replication of custom devices (\u00a7617). Requires the Secretary to make public a report containing a proposed strategy and recommendations on a regulatory framework pertaining to health information technology, including mobile medical applications, and authorizes the Secretary to convene a working group of external stakeholders to provide input on the strategy and recommendations required in this report (\u00a7618). Treats three types of notices related to devices as guidance documents for the purposes of ensuring that procedural requirements on public participation would apply to such documents (unless the Secretary determines participation is not feasible or appropriate) before they could be implemented: (1) notice to industry guidance letters; (2) notice to industry advisory letters; and (3) notices setting forth either initial interpretations of a regulation or policy or changes in interpretation or policy (\u00a7619).

The FDA chart includes actions specified in the letters from the Secretary to Congress that present the performance goals negotiated with industry for the user fee programs. This appendix includes only requirements specified in FDASIA. The FDA chart includes a column that FDA will use to publicly track its progress as it completes each requirement. This appendix does not duplicate that effort.", "Legal Effect of Deadlines", "As a matter of administrative law, the enforceability of statutory deadlines is determined primarily via private civil litigation against the agency for failure to comply with the deadline. Although a court may compel an agency to take action when the agency has \"unreasonably delayed,\" courts generally provide agencies deference in order to avoid dictating how an agency should allocate its limited resources. In Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. FCC (TRAC), the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit) established a set of factors to consider when determining whether an agency has delayed unreasonably in taking a required action. In TRAC, the D.C. Circuit noted that courts should be guided by a \"rule of reason\" when determining whether the agency has unreasonably delayed, but also stated that \"where Congress has provided a timetable or other indication of the speed with which it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling statute, that statutory scheme may supply content for this rule of reason.\"", "The D.C. Circuit's language in TRAC provides that a court should consider congressionally imposed deadlines, but also indicates that a court should not necessarily find that an agency delayed unreasonably based solely on the fact that the agency missed a statutory deadline. In one prominent example, the D.C. Circuit declined to compel a rulemaking by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) even though the agency had violated a statutory deadline for completing the regulation. The court agreed, however, to retain jurisdiction and required MSHA to report regularly on the status of its rulemaking process. In an administrative adjudication context, the D.C. Circuit similarly refused to compel the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to complete the review of a generic drug application even though the FDA missed a statutory deadline by a significant margin. Therefore, although the FDASIA imposes statutory deadlines on various executive agencies, the enforceability of these statutory deadlines in court would be determined through civil litigation on a case-by-case basis.
