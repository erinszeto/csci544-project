Overseas military mail delivery is somewhat more complicated. The USPS delivers mail and packages to USPS gateway sites in New York, Newark, San Francisco, Miami, and Chicago. Domestic postage covers the cost of this service.

This privilege is currently available to service members in Iraq, Afghanistan, and certain surrounding countries and seas, and to service personnel hospitalized in a military facility as a consequence of service in the designated areas.

The bill would have authorized appropriations to reimburse the USPS for its extra expenses in transporting such mail. ", "Another approach to providing a free postage benefit was taken by Representative Harold E. Ford, Jr., in H.R. 2874 , the Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2005, which was introduced on June 14, 2005. The bill would have provided a free postage benefit to both families of service members and charities. Soldiers mobilizing for overseas duty would have been given an allotment of special stamps (equivalent in value to $150 per calendar quarter) to send to their families or selected charities. These stamps would have permitted them to mail letters and packages to service members without postage. There would have been a 10-pound limit on packages mailed, and the DOD would have reimbursed USPS for providing this service. By putting individual service members into the authorization chain for the mail they received, this bill would have avoided the problem of the free postage benefit being used to send unsolicited mail to the troops. Additionally, capping the allotment per service member would have mitigated potential stress on the military postal system. H.R. 2874 was referred to the House Committees on Armed Services and Government Reform.", "On September 29, 2005, the House Government Reform Committee marked up H.R. 923 and, in doing so, adopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute that incorporated the core concept, as well as the title, of H.R. 2874 . As amended and ordered to be reported by voice vote of the committee, the new version of H.R. 923 would have required the DOD, in consultation with the USPS, to establish a one-year program under which a qualified member of the Armed Forces would have received a monthly voucher. The voucher was transferable to a service member's family or friends, and would cover the postage to send one letter or parcel (weighing up to 15 pounds) to the service member. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that nearly all of the about 145,000 American service personnel who would have been eligible for the postage benefit would have taken advantage of it, and assigned it a budget cost of $30 million over FY2006 and FY2007.", "The House Armed Services Committee added the language of H.R. 923 as Sections 575, 576, and 577 of H.R. 5122 , the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007.

Should legislation provide guidance or direction for this aspect of implementation?", "(2) What precautions would be adopted to ensure that vouchers were not counterfeited? Is there any risk that individuals could sell or trade postage vouchers for cash?", "(3) Recent bills would have permitted a voucher to be used either to send correspondence or a package. As noted above, currently a mailer must pay between $0.44 and $3.28 in postage to send written correspondence. Should this relatively low-cost mailing be further subsidized by enacting a free-mail-to-troops postage benefit? And are senders likely to use a voucher for letters that can be used to cover the more expensive parcel postage?", "(4) The dimensions and shape of a package significantly affect the USPS's costs to deliver it. For example, mailing 15 pounds of widgets in a 20\" by 4\" by 4\" package (320 cubic inches) from the Silver Lake, Ohio zip code 44224 to the APO zip code 96278-2050 would require over $20 in postage. Sending the same 15 pounds of widgets in a 12\" by 12\" by 5\" Priority Mail Flat-Rate Box (720 cubic inches) would cost $14.95.
