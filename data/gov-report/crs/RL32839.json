We also patrol almost 95,000 miles of shoreline and navigable waters, and 361 ports that see 8,000 foreign flag vessels, 9 million containers of cargo, and nearly 200 million cruise and ferry passengers every year. We have some 422 primary airports and another 124 commercial service airports that see 30,000 flights and 1.8 million passengers every day. There are approximately 110,000 miles of highway and 220,000 miles of rail track that cut across our nation, and 590,000 bridges dotting America's biggest cities and smallest towns.

Protection efforts at the border are extended to encompass both such extra -border activities as targeting and pre-inspection of people and cargo in originating ports around the world, cross-border efforts between ports of entry by the Border Patrol, as well as intra -U.S. efforts to intercept people and goods as they are shipped inland from their original port of arrival (or from internal U.S. sites).

This phase also receives increased policy attention because of the nature of particularly response activities that are deployed not just to respond to terrorist attacks, but also to natural disasters and other scenarios. For example, the response to Hurricane Katrina has resulted in significant analysis and policy action. Thus, while funding is greatest for border security (and for the military in its operations related to terrorism), the preparedness and response stage of protection cannot be overlooked because of the irreducible level of vulnerability that will always remain.

Political scientists, geographers, sociologists, economists, and a variety of others have contributed much to research and have offered a variety of constructs and avenues of approach to the notion of borders. Prior to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the thinking often focused on several trends that challenged the prevailing concept of borders strictly defined by the boundaries of the nation-state including (1) geopolitical watersheds such as the end of the Cold War, or the launch of the Schengen Treaty in Europe; (2) increasing economic integration in the global economy; (3) increasing integration of border towns and so-called 'border regions'; and (4) the developing boundary-less virtual societal space created through the Internet. These challenges all seemed to be leading towards a world where borders became evermore permeable to all sorts of things (people, goods, ideas, identities), inexorably tied to the changing place of the nation-state, and perhaps becoming increasingly irrelevant. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, these ideas are being reevaluated, particularly in the United States where, as seen above, border security (or good border management) forms an integral part of the national strategy for providing homeland security.", "In broad terms, good border management seeks to balance the competing (but not necessarily conflicting) goals of (1) facilitating (and even expediting) access for people and goods that are both needed and desired; with (2) interdicting and stopping 'bad' people and 'bad' things from entering the country. The key to success in this endeavor is the ability to accurately and efficiently identify high-risk passengers and cargo, target them for inspection, and prevent the entry of dangerous goods and people without impeding the flow of legitimate cross-border traffic. The task for the policy maker is to identify and promote those policies which will enhance the efficacy of the tools employed for these tasks.", "More specifically, the border enforcement agent or inspector is ultimately engaged in an identification and verification process. It is an effort to determine the identity of the people or cargo requesting entry, and to verify the legitimacy of the request for entry. There are many debates about how best to do this. The current entry processing procedures for both people and cargo are complex, and involve numerous steps each of which presents both an opportunity for interference or for interception. Identifying the first step in this process is a challenging endeavor, for reasons that will become ever clearer throughout the course of this series of reports. In the case of cargo, is the first step when the goods first leave the factory where they were produced? Or is the first step when the goods are placed on the conveyance (ship, aircraft, traincar, truck) that will ultimately deliver them to the United States? In the case of people, is the first step when the individual applies for a passport from their own country? Or is the first step when they apply for a visa to enter the United States?", "The 'last' step in this process is easier to pinpoint as it is the inspection at the port of entry. One of the vexing questions confronting policy makers is what actually constitutes an inspection? Does a review of entry documents alone constitute an inspection? Or does something physical have to occur, for example taking fingerprints, or taking an x-ray of a container? Does the inspection mean that the inspector must physically open up and look inside every container to verify its contents? Compounding the problem is the seeming interchangeability of the terms 'inspection' and 'screening.' Typically, the term 'inspection' is used to denote some level of examination of a person or a good, and as noted above can entail a number of different actions. The term 'screening' generally is used when referring to applying a filter or a 'screen' to information or characteristics of cargo and people seeking entry. The screen is typically designed to match either certain known criteria with information about the entering cargo or person; or to flag certain patterns, characteristics, or indicators, as high risk attached to the entering cargo or person. The Security and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port Act ( P.L. 109-347 ) contained definitions for the terms: examination; inspection; scan; screening; and search with regard to maritime container inspections referred to in the bill.", "Another important debate concerns the level of inspection to be applied, in particular to U.S.-bound maritime containers. Some observers contend that the current layered approach to targeting containers for inspection is insufficient at identifying high-risk containers and/or shipments, and calls for increasing levels of inspection or even for inspecting, in some manner, 100% of U.S.-bound cargo containers. The level of inspection or screening (in whatever context these terms are used) is likely to remain a significant part of the border security debate for the foreseeable future.", "In sum, what does good border management look like? Recent experience has illustrated with remarkable clarity what it should not look like. In the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, the borders of the United States were essentially shut down. All air traffic into the United States was either cancelled or diverted (including both commercial passengers and cargo). The U.S. Customs Service went to its highest state of alert. On the land border, this meant that every vehicle entering the United States from Canada and Mexico was searched, causing delays of up to 12 hours at some border crossings in Michigan and New York. These delays resulted in significant economic losses, in particular to those industries, such as the auto industry, that rely on just-in-time shipping to keep their production lines running. By September 13, DaimlerChrysler reportedly announced the closure of one of its manufacturing plants on the following day; and on September 14, Ford announced that it would have to close five plants during the ensuing week.", "What follows are a series of conceptualizations to assist the policy maker in developing a redefined understanding of the border that includes good border management."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Developing a Possible Typology for the Policy Maker", "paragraphs": ["Border management is an extremely complex task.

The first two questions, the what and the where of the border, are related and somewhat interdependent. For example, if the what of the border is simply the physical geographic boundary and limited to U.S. ports of entry, then the where and the when are self explanatory: people or goods enter the United States when they have physically crossed the territorial boundary , and they need not be addressed until they reach the border. This approach to border control might work in a situation where the flow of cross-border traffic was small, and the resources available to process this traffic were plentiful. However, the current environment for securing U.S. borders is far more complicated, as noted above in the Introduction with the statement of Admiral James Loy, former Deputy Secretary of the DHS.", "If the border is envisioned not merely as a physical boundary but rather as a flexible concept that allows for the possibility that the border begins at the point where goods or people commence their U.S.-bound journey, a significantly wider array of options for border management policies becomes available.

Figures 2-4 , and the accompanying text illustrate this complex process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Movement of Goods from Place to Place (Places in the Logistics Chain)", "paragraphs": ["On its journey from the country of origin to the destination country, cargo moves through the hands of numerous actors in a variety of places. Figure 2 illustrates the case of cargo being transported between countries in maritime containers. Cargo begins its journey in the source zone, at the factory. From the factory, the cargo may travel by truck, rail, or air, to reach the FPOE (departure zone) in the country of origin. During this leg of the journey, the cargo may be warehoused for export at a later date; it may stop at a consolidation center where it may be combined with other cargoes to comprise a full-container's (truckload's, railcar's) worth of shipments; and it may be transferred from one mode of transportation to another (from rail to truck for example) before reaching the port of exit. Once at the port (departure zone), the cargo is transferred to the ocean-going vessel that will take it across the transit zone. The cargo may pass through another port in the transit zone before reaching the final port of entry in the destination country. From the port of entry in the destination country (DPOE) (arrival zone), the cargo may travel to the distribution zone by truck or by rail to be (1) warehoused for distribution at a later date; or (2) de-consolidated and perhaps re-consolidated for transport to the buyer. A variety of actors are involved in each of these places in the logistics chain, possessing 'custody' of the cargo on its journey.", "However, the movement of maritime containers is likely the most complex case. Air cargo shipments move in a similar manner, though the time it takes for a shipment to travel from the source to the destination zone is typically measured in hours rather than the days and even weeks for maritime shipments. Air cargo shipments can move by more than one mode of transportation to a consolidator or directly to an airport; shipments may be consolidated with others into air cargo containers (which are smaller than sea containers and configured to maximize storage space in the cargo holds of aircraft); cargo may pass through a transit airport on its way to the destination airport; once at the destination airport the air cargo may be transported offsite to a consolidated freight station and de-consolidated, transferred to a truck or a rail car and moved to the final destination.", "In contrast to shipments moving by sea or by air, the time it takes land-border shipments to travel from the source to destination zone can be measured in hours, if not minutes. One facet of the land border environment has been the advent of highly integrated 'just-in-time' (JIT) shipping. JIT is particularly prominent in the automotive industry where for example on the northern border: seats for General Motors (GM) cars arrive at the GM plant in Detroit, MI less than an hour after being assembled and sent across the Peace Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. In other cases, where smaller or less frequent shipments are required, they travel from the factory to a consolidator who consolidates less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments into a complete container, and transports them across the border. Another unique facet of truck transport prevalent along the southern border is the process of 'drayage' where short-haul trucks ferry cargo back and forth across the border. This adds another transfer phase to the process where drayage is used, as an extra carrier is involved.", "For shipments crossing the border by rail, the flow is also similar, in that the factory shipments may be placed directly into railcars (as is the case with some auto plants for example) or they may transported by truck to a consolidator or to an intermodal rail facility where shipments (complete or consolidated) are placed in railcars for shipment across the border."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Movement of Custody from Person to Person (Actors in the Logistics Chain)", "paragraphs": ["Each cargo shipment begins with a buyer and an originating shipper, typically the manufacturer. Intermediaries such as buying agents and freight forwarders are the most frequently utilized intermediaries between the originating shipper and the ocean carrier. Freight forwarders can provide multiple services needed to transport cargo from factory to port: transport; warehousing; consolidation; etc. However, other actors can provide these services individually as well. These include customs brokers, truck and rail carriers, warehouse agents, consolidators, etc. Thus, cargo shipments can be held by a number of different actors on the journey to the port of exit (in the case of Figure 3 , the FPOE). Once at the port, the cargoes pass through the control of the customs authority and are transferred to the port operator, who then transfers them to the maritime carrier for transport through the transit zone. Upon arrival at the port of entry in the destination country, the process is reversed. The cargo passes through the custody of the port operator, the customs authority, and possibly to customshouse brokers or de-consolidators to the transport operator, and finally to the buyer.", "It is important to note that there are in reality two sets of actors involved: those who hold what could be termed as documentary custody, the people in the offices at each of the places outlined in Figure 3 who handle the paperwork side of the transaction; and those actors who have physical custody or are in physical proximity to the cargo itself (the warehouse and dock workers, longshoremen and truck drivers, etc.).

These reviews are intended to ensure that they are not ineligible for visas or admission under the grounds for inadmissibility spelled out in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).", "Goods \u2014Just as with people who seek to enter the United States, goods entering the country are also accompanied by a set of documents. As noted above, there are many stages and actors through which cargo can pass before arriving in the United States. The OECD notes that some imports can require as many as 40 separate documents in order to complete the journey from the point of origin in the source zone to the destination. Each time a shipment changes hands from person-to-person or place-to-place (as illustrated by Figures 2 and 3 ) it requires documentation. The required documentation generally includes two primary sets: commercial documents that move cargo from each private sector actor (carrier, broker, freight forwarder, consolidator, driver etc.); and customs entry documents which contain information that can be used both for security and commercial compliance screenings.", "Generally, goods cannot legally enter the commerce of the United States until CBP has released them. Importers or their agents (e.g., customs brokers) are required to file entry documentation with CBP for each importation regardless of whether or not duty must be paid on the merchandise. To expedite clearance of their goods, importers often file documents electronically and pay the bonds before the merchandise arrives at the port of entry. Entry documents include proper bills of lading, entry forms, invoices, and evidence of the right to make entry. Customs also collects information from manifests for security purposes, including data about the shipper, importer or consignee, and information concerning the nature of the merchandise. The data contained in these documents gives CBP necessary information to target and screen high-risk shipments both for security and for commercial entry purposes. CBP inspectors examine goods for admissibility (regarding any commercial or compliance issues) before releasing them into commerce. Goods are also inspected for security purposes including terrorist weapons; illegal narcotics; and other contraband.", " Figure 5 integrates the information contained in the previous figures (bearing in mind that at the land borders, the transit zone is eliminated).

It shows all of the different people, places, and zones through which cargo or individuals can pass en route to the United States from a foreign country.", "In addition to the points of vulnerability discussed above, the OECD highlighted a series of related risk considerations relative to ocean-borne cargo shipping. These factors include risks that arise from: the cargo itself; the vessels carrying the cargo; the people associated with the cargo and the vessels; and the money involved in shipping activities. This set of risk factors is also adaptable to other modes of transportation, including planes, trucks, rail cars, etc. Cargo shipments present a risk in that they can be used to smuggle weapons (conventional, chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons), other types of contraband, or people (as in immigrant smuggling in vessel containers, potential terrorists, etc.). This risk is possible not only for vessel-borne containers, but also for containers transported by plane, truck containers, or even rail cars. The vessel, or conveyance itself, presents several risks in that it could (1) be a target itself, (2) be used to launch an attack, or (3) be used as a weapon (as in the case of the 9/11 attacks). People present a risk factor in that terrorists could attempt to gain access to a conveyance by, for example joining a vessel crew, working at a dock or port, or by traveling as a passenger. The money risk factor lies outside the scope of this report.", "It is important to note that border management is not necessarily a zero-sum game.

These policies are grouped in a framework that suggests types of possible policy actions:", "pushing the border outwards to intercept unwanted people or goods before they reach the United States; hardening the border through the use of technology and the presence of more agents at the border; making the border more accessible for legitimate trade and travel; strengthening the border through more effective use of intelligence; and multiplying effectiveness through the engagement of other actors in the enforcement effort (including engaging Canada, Mexico, state and local law enforcement resources, and the private sector).", "Security of people and cargo destined for the United States requires a complex set of policies that engage actors from each of the geographic zones (foreign governments, private sector actors, and other U.S. government agencies). These relationships and policies must also take into consideration requirements unique to the different modes of transportation (air, vessel, truck, and rail). Policies could, for example, encompass the entire journey from the source zone to the destination zone; or policies could focus distinctly on a particular zone/place/actor in the journey. Or, a layered approach may be employed that involves nearly all of the constructs identified in Figure 5 ( viz ., people, conveyances, cargo, places, routes, etc.). The transit zone in the maritime environment poses a unique challenge for cargo security. This is because there is no single governing body responsible for regulating the zone. Organizations like the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have adopted measures and are working towards developing strategies to harmonize customs procedures and increase maritime security, but the standards and conventions developed by these institutions must be adopted by individual governments for them to have any real authority.", "The third report in the series, CRS Report RL32841, Border and Transportation Security: Possible New Directions and Policy Options builds on the first two reports, and offers possible new directions and policy options that spring directly from the analytical frameworks contained within those reports."], "subsections": []}]}}
