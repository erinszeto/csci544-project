This report provides a summary of the provisions under each of the titles and subtitles in the bill, and compares them with other relevant legislation. In particular, the report relates the provisions of S. 1462 to similar or identical provisions contained in the House-passed version of H.R. 2454 , the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (ACES), and to spending or tax provisions contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ).", "Although this bill is compared with certain energy provisions in H.R. 2454 , substantial differences exist between the provisions of this bill and the energy provisions of the combined energy-climate change bill in the House. H.R. 2454 is a broader bill that includes a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade system not found in the Senate Committee bill. Instead, separate climate legislation is to be developed in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and in the Senate Finance Committee. Climate change legislation developed in the Senate may or may not be combined with these energy provisions in S. 1462 to produce a package that might be conferenced with H.R. 2454 .

It would establish a Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA), which would be a quasi-independent agency under the DOE. CEDA would use a Clean Energy Investment Fund to operate a broad program of lending and other incentives to stimulate the deployment of innovative and commercial clean energy technologies. In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) would be given an expanded role and authority to coordinate the implementation of a national transmission infrastructure policy through regional plans, and to exercise federal eminent domain authority to ensure that land is available for siting transmission lines. This title would also establish a federal Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency requirement for electric utilities that sell electricity to end users. Such utilities would have to obtain a percentage of their annual power supply from renewable energy or energy efficiency starting at 3% in 2011 and rising incrementally to 15% by 2021. It would provide for research and analysis of the impact of energy production on U.S. water resources, and of the use of energy in the water sector. This provision is motivated by increasing awareness in Congress of the relationship between energy and water (the energy-water \"nexus\") whereby changes affecting one resource may directly influence the cost, availability, or quality of the other. Finally, this title would promote the deployment of advanced technology vehicles, especially electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles that reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.", "Title II promotes enhanced energy efficiency through a combination of policies that target manufacturing, appliances, buildings, and the electric grid. By providing government-backed loans to developers of energy-efficient technologies, the bill would accelerate the implementation of industrial and commercial applications of technologies or processes to enhance efficiency and U.S. industrial competitiveness, and would establish research and innovation programs to develop new energy-efficient manufacturing technologies. Energy and water efficiency of consumer products, industrial equipment, and lighting is promoted through improved testing processes and a more sophisticated application of the EnergyStar Program. Energy efficiency in buildings is addressed through improved model building codes and standards, a grant program for multifamily and manufactured housing efficiency improvements, establishment of training centers for development of building efficiency expertise, weatherization assistance for low-income persons, energy-efficiency retrofit programs, and mechanisms for encouraging energy efficiency in federal agencies. The efficiency of the electric grid would be enhanced by using smart grid technologies to reduce peak demand, according to an interagency plan, and directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to establish a national interconnection standard.", "According to the Senate Committee, Title III is intended to enhance U.S. energy security by addressing critical electric infrastructure, nuclear waste disposal, additional petroleum storage, expansion of oil and gas leasing in certain offshore areas, development of renewable energy resources on public lands, large-scale and long-term geologic storage of CO 2 , and reduction of the reliance of U.S. island territories on imported fossil fuels. This portion of the bill provides for expedited procedures and mechanisms to mitigate a cyber threat to the nation's electric infrastructure. A National Commission on Nuclear Waste would be established to study alternative means of managing or disposing of spent nuclear fuel and waste from civilian nuclear plants; alternatives would include reprocessing of spent fuel. Preparations for physical or economic disruptions in petroleum supply would be enhanced by the establishment of a strategic reserve of refined petroleum products to complement the existing strategic reserve of crude oil. This section also expedites the conduct of an inventory of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas resources, as directed in EPACT05, and would open portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico to leasing. Title III also promotes the development of renewable energy resources on federal lands by modifying the permitting process, requiring a programmatic environmental impact statement for wind and solar development and establishing a series of field offices to manage the program. Provisions in this title provide for establishment of partnerships for 10 large-scale demonstration projects for geologic storage of CO 2 and would provide $10 billion per project for indemnification. Finally, Title III would establish the Affiliated Island Energy Independence Team to provide technical, programmatic, and financial assistance to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and the United States Virgin Islands to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels through increased efficiency and the use of indigenous clean-energy resources.", "Title IV contains provisions for advancing energy innovation and workforce development.

This title would provide a training program to build expertise for an energy workforce, and would support subsurface geosciences and engineering education and training programs. ", "Title V contains several measures designed to stabilize the oil, natural gas, and electricity markets and to enhance energy security. It would enhance the ability of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to collect data about product ownership and inventories for oil and natural gas in the United States. This title would establish an office within EIA, along with an interagency working group on energy markets, to monitor prices of crude oil and refined petroleum product and to recommend any statutory authority that may be needed to oversee and regulate energy markets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would be authorized to issue temporary emergency orders to suspend or modify tariff rates, terms, or conditions if necessary to protect electric consumers, and to issue cease-and-desist orders to prevent the manipulation of the electric or natural gas markets.", "Title VI would provide direction and authorization for a number of studies and reports that would include assessing helium and potash resources, improving energy policy planning, addressing climate change in China and India, assessing the risk of international carbon leakage resulting from a cap-and-trade program, examining foreign fuel subsidies, assessing biofuel energy resources, reviewing the efficiency of electric generation facilities, evaluating the emissions of alternative transportation fuels, and identifying options for reaching specific goals in the reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brief Legislative History of S. 1462", "paragraphs": ["The following legislative history is taken verbatim from the report of July 16, 2009, by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources ( S.Rept. 111-48 ):", "The text of the American Clean Energy Leadership Act was drawn from 6 bills introduced by the Chairman, 3 of which were cosponsored by the Ranking Republican Member, and 9 chairman's marks.

CEDA would use a Clean Energy Investment Fund to operate a broad program of lending and other incentives aimed at stimulating the deployment of both \"innovative\" and \"commercial\" clean energy technologies. Over a transitional period of 18 months, CEDA would absorb the existing DOE Loan Guarantee Program, which was established by Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to support \"innovative\" energy technologies and was later expanded by ARRA to allow support for certain \"commercial\" energy technologies and transmission equipment.", "Under the EPACT05 provisions, from August 2006 through September 2008, DOE issued five solicitations for loan guarantee projects. In July 2009, DOE issued two more solicitations, funded mainly by ARRA, for fast track (by the end of FY2011) renewable energy, electric power transmission, and leading edge biofuel projects. DOE noted that it had \"streamlined its processes to accelerate these new loan solicitations.\" The first loan guarantee under the program was issued September 4, 2009, to a solar panel manufacturer.", "In August 2009, Congress voted to use $2.0 billion of the ARRA appropriation to extend the \"cash-for-clunkers\" program, which encourages consumers to scrap old, inefficient cars and to buy new, efficient ones.", "S. 1462 would modify the Loan Guarantee Program and increase DOE's flexibility to offer additional financial incentives. Two of the proposed changes have been particular subjects of debate. First, the bill addresses a limitation set by the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA). Under the current Loan Guarantee Program, FCRA Sec. 504(b) requires new budget authority or other funding limits to cover the subsidy costs (the present value of estimated long-term costs to the government) that might result from any expansion of the portfolio of projects. The Senate bill would exempt CEDA from the requirement for new budgetary authority to support loan guarantees, and instead would allow balances in the fund to cover the cost of loan guarantees. Opponents of the provision argue that it \"would circumvent the appropriations process,\" would likely lead to an underestimate of costs, and could also \"allow for potentially unlimited loan guarantees, disproportionately benefit more expensive and risky technologies, and fail to ensure that the cleanest technologies are prioritized.\" Proponents counter-argue that \"simply being in an appropriations process does not change the risk calculation,\" and that the bill \"continues to require full accounting of risks and costs of CEDA loans and loan guarantees in exactly the same way that all loan and loan guarantee programs are currently handled.\" They emphasize that FCRA Sec. 503(d) would still apply, requiring annual reviews of \"the performance of outstanding direct loans and loan guarantees to improve estimates of costs.\"", "Second, an issue affecting the debt financing structure surfaced in 2007 during DOE's rulemaking process for the current Loan Guarantee Program. The rule has been criticized for prohibiting a shared priority (pari passu) collateral structure for project debt. Under present DOE rules, the Department's guaranteed portion of the debt would have a first claim (lien position) on all assets of a project and any additional collateral pledged by the borrower. This means that any co-lenders of the unguaranteed portion of the project debt would be subordinated to the government-guaranteed debt. This situation has posed a deterrent to potential private sector co-lenders, according to industry groups. The Senate bill proposes to allow \"pari passu\" financing, wherein DOE would take an equal lien position with other lenders in making claim to collateral for the debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CEDA Goals, Structure, and Operations", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Energy would be required to develop goals for clean energy technology deployment and provide short- and long-term numerical targets.

A loan loss reserve would be established to provide an internal mechanism for balancing risks and returns in the portfolio. An \"indirect support unit\" would aim to create financial products designed to leverage private sector participation and to aggregate private debt into more marketable products.

CEDA would be allowed to share the collateral risk by spreading it out in equal amounts with other lenders. Fees collected for administrative expenses would be required to be deposited in the Fund.", "The existing functions and authorities of the DOE Loan Guarantee Program would be transferred to CEDA within 18 months after enactment. At the same time, a direct appropriation of $10 billion would be transferred to the Fund. Fee payments could be retained in the fund for further use.

First, the House bill would establish CEDA as an independent corporation wholly owned by the federal government, and it would modify the existing DOE Loan Guarantee Program but otherwise leave it in place. In contrast, the Senate Energy Committee proposed that CEDA be established as an agency within DOE and that CEDA and the Clean Energy Investment Fund absorb the entire DOE Loan Guarantee Program.", "Second, there are differences in how the fund would be structured and funded. Given CEDA's proposed status as an independent corporation, the House proposed that the Department of the Treasury would issue $7.5 billion in new authority for CEDA to issue \"green\" bonds to support the fund. Raising funds from bond sales would not be consistent with the FCRA concept that funds be obtained through the appropriations process. In contrast, the Senate panel proposed that $10.0 billion be transferred from the Treasury and that subsidy costs be treated outside FCRA requirements. Further, the Senate proposal would eliminate the FCRA requirement for new budgetary authority to support loan guarantees. In a case where the project sponsors pay the subsidy cost, no appropriations would be required and, thus, there would be no cap on these loan guarantees.", "Third, in comparison with the House bill, the Senate Energy proposal would allow greater support for nuclear power project development. The House proposal would prohibit any single category of energy technology (including nuclear power) from receiving more than 30% of CEDA's total financial support. That restriction is expected to affect nuclear power projects more than others because those projects generally require a much larger capital investment and there are more nuclear projects currently proposed than other technology projects.

It (1) would require that the SPR include 30 million barrels of refined product; (2) would transfer authority for a drawdown from the President to the Secretary of Energy; and (3) would amend the drawdown authority to permit drawdown and sale in the event of a \"severe energy market supply interruption\" that has caused, or is expected to cause, \"a severe increase\" in prices.", "The proposal to establish product reserves very likely stems from the sharp increase in the price of gasoline during 2008 that was attributed, in part, to a different market situation than has been the historic norm. In the past, inadequate supplies of refined products have had, as their principal cause, a shortage in crude supply, or uncertainty about crude supply that becomes reflected in market distribution. However, high prices in 2008 occurred in a setting where the supply of product was tight in some regions, even though crude itself was plentiful. Drawdown of the SPR is currently premised on crude oil supply, and not product supply or price.", "The Senate report on the bill does not provide an explanation for the vesting of authority for a drawdown with the Secretary of Energy rather than the President. Some may believe that the Secretary might be inclined to call for a drawdown sooner than the President because the Secretary presumably has closer contact on energy-supply developments, or that a decision by the Secretary to call upon the SPR would be less freighted with political considerations. However, the reason for the change is unspecified.", "The proposal to shift from premising drawdown on a \"severe energy market supply interruption\" instead of a \"severe energy supply interruption\" may be the most sweeping shift in the Senate bill provisions affecting the SPR. As has been noted, the current authorities authorize drawdown based upon crude supply. While a shortage of crude generally expresses itself in higher prices for both crude and products, many calls for tapping of the SPR when prices have spiked have brought the response that the SPR is not supposed to be used to respond to high prices. The Senate Committee bill's proposed change, if enacted, adds language permitting a drawdown of SPR oil if a \"market supply interruption\" has brought about high prices, or is expected to do so. Expressed another way, a drawdown can be initiated not just to respond to supply conditions \"upstream\" or \"downstream,\" but to supply and price conditions. ", "If enacted, the legislation would require a report to Congress within 180 days describing what refined products would be acquired for the Reserve and how they would be acquired at minimal cost or disruption of markets. The report would be required to assess storage options (which would need to be above-ground) and \"the anticipated location of existing or new facilities.\" Presumably, some analysis would need to be undertaken to identify regions that might be likeliest affected by incapacitation of normal product distribution, as well as seasonal differences in the refined product itself.", "No similar provisions are included in H.R. 2454 or ARRA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Subtitle D\u2014Federal Oil and Gas Development90", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Summary and Analysis of This Subtitle", "paragraphs": ["Congress is currently debating how much of the outer continental shelf (OCS) should be open for oil and gas development.

The extent of some of the environmental impacts of renewable energy production has been controversial, such as impacts on wildlife and on environmentally sensitive areas.

First, the operator would need to maintain financial assurances during the post-injection closure and monitoring phase until the site is certified as closed by the Secretary. Second, the operator would need to maintain financial protection in a form and amount acceptable to the Secretary of Energy, to the Secretary (either of the Interior or of Agriculture) with jurisdiction over the land, and to the EPA Administrator. These assurances must be maintained until the project complies with site closure requirements over a period of at least 10 consecutive years after the plume of CO 2 has stabilized within the geologic storage unit after injection has ceased.", "The legislation would require the operator to meet all the post-closure requirements, and maintain the financial assurances and protection, such as insurance, before the federal government would accept title and long-term stewardship responsibilities for the site. The post-closure requirements essentially ensure that the CO 2 plume and area of elevated pressure in the underground reservoir have ceased to change (e.g., the plume is no longer spreading, and the pressure in the formation is no longer increasing); CO 2 or displaced formation fluid is not leaking out of the reservoir and endangering underground sources of drinking water; and CO 2 or formation fluids are not expected to leak out of the reservoir in the future. Subject to the operator successfully meeting these requirements, the federal government may take title to the land or interest in the land necessary for monitoring, remediation, or long-term stewardship of the project site.", "In addition to financial assurances provided by the operator, the legislation would authorize the Secretary of Energy to indemnify the operator from liability arising from a demonstration project that is in excess of the liability covered by the financial assurances and protections held by the operator. The legislation would authorize up to $10 billion of indemnification per project, but would not indemnify the operator from liability arising out of gross negligence or intentional misconduct. The Secretary would be authorized to collect a fee from the recipient of the indemnification agreement, in an amount equal to the net present value of payments made by the United States to cover liability under the indemnification agreement. The criteria for determining the amount of the fee would be established by regulation, taking into account the risk of an incident resulting in liability and other factors related to determining the hazard of operating a particular project.", "The indemnification provision in the legislation is likely intended to address one of the perceived barriers to commercial-scale deployment of CCS: the risk and magnitude of liability from injecting CO 2 underground in a regulatory environment that is still a work in progress. Also, it is widely perceived that many of the fears and uncertainties associated with injecting industrial-scale quantities of CO 2 could be addressed by on-the-ground projects instead of theoretical modeling simulations\u2014a learning-by-doing approach.

Taken together, these studies are intended to provide Congress and other decision makers with improved information and understanding for the management of resources and formulation of policy.", "Sec. 601 of this title would direct the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct a national assessment of helium resources, which are important for a variety of industrial and medical applications, with information on other gases associated with the helium.", "Sec. 602 calls for an assessment and report on known and undiscovered potash deposits in the United States, and would include provisions for a drilling program and an evaluation of assessment methodologies. Potash is a general term applied to potassium oxide, potassium carbonate, and a variety of related potassium salts that go into fertilizer and the manufacture of glass.", "Sec. 603 would amend the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7321) with the aim of improving national energy planning and strategies. The improved planning process would include input from relevant federal agencies and would examine federal policies that affect energy production, energy efficiency, reduction of air pollution, and the reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of greenhouse gases. This provision would require the National Academy of Sciences to participate in the planning process and would provide authorization of funding for such studies.", "Sec. 604 acknowledges that international climate change strategies will depend in part on the actions of China and India, and that improved understanding of their actions will benefit strategies undertaken by the United States to help reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases. This section would establish an interagency task force to investigate and analyze national or subnational policies, programs, laws, regulations, incentive mechanisms, and other measures that might reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in China and India. The report would include the current status of, and opportunities and recommendations for, research cooperation and technology deployment and trade, and would be submitted to Congress within six months of passage.", "Under Sec. 605, carbon leakage is defined as a substantial increase in greenhouse gas emissions by a manufacturing facility located in a country without a greenhouse gas emission regulation commensurate to a cap-and-trade program, or an increase in emissions caused by an increase in the incremental cost of production in the United States as a result of a domestic cap-and-trade program. This section would require DOE, in consultation with other relevant federal agencies, to conduct a study that characterizes the relative risk of such carbon leakage and changes in output and investment in U.S. industrial sectors resulting from the implementation of a cap-and-trade program in the Unites States. The study is to include an assessment of price and trade elasticity of U.S. industries, as well as other economic indicators. DOE would also be directed to conduct a study evaluating the impact of potential measures that might be implemented to mitigate carbon leakage, including an analysis of measures used by other jurisdictions to reduce carbon leakage, the risk of carbon leakage from U.S. industries under potential prices of greenhouse gas emissions, and scenarios for international climate policy.", "Sec. 606 would require the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretaries of State and Commerce, to conduct a study and report to Congress on the impact of foreign fuel subsidies on global energy supply and demand, and on the global economy, with associated recommendations for mitigating actions.", "Sec. 607 would amend Sec. 201(b) of EPACT05 to require the Secretary of Energy, as part of the current requirement for an annual assessment of renewable energy, to assess the quantity of biomass needed for thermal applications, biofuels, and biomass-based electricity, the highest efficiency energy use of biomass resources, the requirements and costs associated with the deployment for each of these applications, and the market penetration for each renewable energy resource that could be accomplished by 2030.", "Sec. 608 calls for a review to quantify the efficiencies of U.S. electric generation facilities. It would require identification of, among other things, the technologies that may be deployed to increase the efficiency of the electric generation facilities and any obstacles that could impede the deployment of those technologies.", "Sec. 609 would require DOE, in cooperation with other relevant federal agencies, to evaluate the emissions from the use of alternative transportation fuels and fuel blends used in heavy-duty and light-duty diesel engines and in the aviation sector.

An interagency task force composed of DOE and other relevant agencies would submit a report to Congress describing options for agency actions that would reduce forecasted U.S. oil consumption in stages by 10,000,000 barrels of oil per day by 2030. Recommended actions would be required to comply with the policy statement above, include only options directly related to reduced oil consumption, describe advantages and disadvantages for each option, and avoid increases in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions above levels in effect on the date of enactment.
