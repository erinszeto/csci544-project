Chosen Soren represents a minority of the 640,000 ethnic Koreans in Japan; membership estimatesrange from 50,000 to 180,000. (1) Established in 1955,the group is made up primarily of descendantsof Koreans who moved to Japan as laborers in the 1930s when the Korean peninsula was annexedby Japan. Chosen Soren reportedly administers and finances 140 schools and a university thatemphasize Korean language and culture; publishes a newspaper; serves as a confederation for 12affiliated associations; holds close ties with financial institutions catering exclusively to ethnicKoreans; and acts as an unofficial representative of the North Korean government. Up to 30% ofthe pachinko industry (a popular form of pinball gambling with over 18,000 parlors nationwide) iscontrolled by ethnic Koreans, many of whom have close ties to Chosen Soren. (2)", "The Chosen Soren has a counterpart in the pro-Seoul Korean organization Mindan (Korean Residents Union in Japan). Both organizations work to promote ethnic Koreans' civil rights inJapan. Members of both are classified as \"special permanent residents,\" but hold official citizenshipin North or South Korea. The groups differ in approach: Mindan supports the enfranchisement inJapan of special permanent residents (the designation of most ethnic Koreans) while Chosen Sorenadvocates a strong national identity with North Korea. Chosen Soren facilitated the repatriation ofover 100,000 Korean residents living in Japan to the North and sparred with Mindan in the 1960's,including outbreaks of violence. (3) Membership inMindan now outpaces Chosen Soren about 4 to1, and the trend over the past few years indicates that ethnic Koreans are increasingly eitherbecoming naturalized Japanese citizens or associating with Mindan.

Although some Korean families have been in Japan for several generations, asspecial permanent residents they do not have the right to vote, cannot work for the centralgovernment, and were required to be fingerprinted as resident aliens until the early 1990's. (5) Together with the history of Japan's often brutal 35-year colonization of the Korean peninsula(1910-1945), relations between the Korean minority and the Japanese government have always beenstrained. Japanese political leaders have avoided confrontation with Chosen Soren both out of fearof provoking reaction from Pyongyang and out of a sensitivity to accusations of racialdiscrimination. (6) Government agencies also largelyignored the money flow from Japan to NorthKorea, permitted ferry links with little enforcement of safety measures and cargo inspections, (7) andallowed Chosen Soren to maintain its tax-free diplomatic status for years. (8)", "Traditionally Chosen Soren had close ties with the political left in Japan, particularly the Socialist Party. But until very recently, Chosen Soren leadership also enjoyed warm relations withseveral members of the Liberal Democratic Party. Accusations have arisen regarding ChosenSoren's ties with organized crime in counterfeiting and the drug trade. Some critics suggest thatJapanese politicians may intentionally allow cash remittances and contacts between Chosen Sorenand North Korea to continue because of the politicians' own involvement with gangster trade. Detractors allege that the interdiction of links with Pyongyang could expose LDP affiliation with the yakuza organized crime syndicate.

Most observers now agree with Nicolas Eberstadt's estimation that, even at their peak,remittances generally were below $100 million annually. (13) Remittances are passed either in personwhen Korean residents travel to North Korea or by transfers through financial institutions.

(16)", "Reportedly, Japan-based firms often go through third countries in their dealings with North Korea. In Meishin's case, the transformers were destined for Pyongyang through Loxley Pacific, asubsidiary of Loxley PCL, one of Thailand's top communications companies. Loxley has significantbusiness interests in North Korea as well, holding exclusive 30 year rights to telecommunicationservices in Rajin-Sonbong, a Special Economic Zone in the North. According to press reports,Loxley Pacific often acts as a middleman between Meishin and Daesong for trade in rubber, sugar,and other products.

The Japanese engineering firm Seishin Enterprises wasfound to have shipped a jet mill, a machine that can be used to grind solid fuel into fine powder foruse in missiles, to North Korea in 1994 on board the Mangyongbong ferry and attempted again inMay 2003 to export electronic scales that could be used in the production of biological and chemicalweapons. A senior member of a science and technology organization affiliated with Chosen Sorenreportedly coordinated price negotiations and product specifications for the order.
