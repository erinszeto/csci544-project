The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had earlier found that the statutory exemption applied only to clinical research activity that contributes \"relatively directly\" to information the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers in approving a drug.

Prior to its enactment, pharmaceutical companies had to wait until all relevant patents expired before undertaking the clinical research necessary to obtain FDA approval of generic equivalents. Thus, an established drug's patent term was de facto extended beyond its expiration date by the length of the FDA regulatory process for approving the generic equivalent, which took more than two years.

Following its interpretive lead in Eli Lilly, the Supreme Court in Merck KGaA v. Integra Lifesciences I, Ltd .

Scientists working for Telios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. discovered that the RGD peptide had potential use in promoting wound healing and biocompatibility of prosthetic devices, prompting Telios to obtain patents for the RGD peptide compositions and methods. However, after failing to develop a viable commercial product, Telios sold the patents to Integra.", "In the mid-1980s, Dr. David Cheresh at the Scripps Research Institute (\"Scripps\"), a non-profit corporation that conducts biochemical research, discovered that blocking integrin receptors using the RGD peptide inhibited angiogenesis, a process by which new blood vessels sprout from existing vessels. Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the spread of many diseases, including cancerous tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis.", "Merck KGaA (\"Merck\"), a German pharmaceutical corporation unaffiliated with the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company Merck & Co., was interested in developing this discovery into a drug to control angiogenesis. In 1988, Merck entered into an agreement with Scripps to provide funding for Dr. Cheresh's research, in exchange for Scripps granting Merck an option to license future discoveries arising from his research. In 1994, Dr. Cheresh succeeded in reversing tumor growth in chicken embryos using a RGD peptide identified as EMD 66203, which had been provided by Merck. This peptide was covered by Integra's patent.", "Due to Dr. Cheresh's breakthrough achievement, Merck and Scripps entered into a new collaboration agreement in September 1995 to fund the \"necessary experiments to satisfy the biological bases and regulatory (FDA) requirements for the implementation of clinical trials\" with EMD 66203 or a derivative thereof. Dr. Cheresh then proceeded to conduct in vivo and in vitro experiments on EMD 66203 and two derivatives of it, EMD 85189 and EMD 121974, in order to evaluate each peptide as potential drug candidates. These \"tests measured the efficacy, specificity, and toxicity of the particular peptides as angiogenesis inhibitors, and evaluated their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics in animals.\" Based on these tests, in November 1996 Merck's pharmaceutical steering committee selected EMD 85189 for pre-clinical development; in April 1997, Merck switched to EMD 121974 as its most promising candidate for clinical testing. In October 1998, Merck reached an agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to sponsor the clinical trials, and later that year, the NCI filed an IND application with the FDA for EMD 121974.", "When Integra became aware of Merck's agreement with Scripps to conduct angiogenesis research for commercial purposes, Integra offered Merck the opportunity to purchase licenses to use its patented RGD peptides. In July 1996, after Merck had declined the offer, Integra sued Merck, Scripps, and Dr. Cheresh, seeking monetary damages for Merck's alleged patent infringement and a declaratory judgment against Scripps and Dr. Cheresh.

The district court instructed the jury that, for Merck to prevail on the safe harbor defense, it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it was objectively reasonable for the company to believe that \"there was a decent prospect\" that the experiments \"would contribute, relatively directly,\" to the generation of information likely to be relevant to the drug approval regulatory process.", "The jury found Merck liable for infringing Integra's patents and that Merck had failed to show that \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) protected its post-1995 research activities.

In response to post-trial motions, the district court dismissed Integra's suit against Scripps and Dr. Cheresh, but affirmed the jury's monetary award, explaining that there was substantial evidence to show that the connection between the experiments and FDA review was \"insufficiently direct to qualify for the [\u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) exemption].\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Integra in the Federal Circuit", "paragraphs": ["In June 2003, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's determination as to liability but reversed the court's refusal to modify the damages award.

Moreover, some companies rely on such fees for their financial existence, since many of these research tools have little commercial value beyond usage in drug research. The Federal Circuit in Integra had specifically identified this potential negative consequence for patented research tools, in its support for a more limited safe harbor:", "[T]he context of this safe harbor originally keyed its use to facilitating expedited approval of patented pioneer drugs already on the market. Extending \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) to embrace all aspects of new drug development activities would ignore its language and context with respect to the [Hatch-Waxman Act] in an attempt to exonerate infringing uses only potentially related to information for FDA approval. Moreover, such an extension would not confine the scope of \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) to de minimis encroachment on the rights of the patentee. For example, expansion of \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) to include the Scripps-Merck activities would effectively vitiate the exclusive rights of patentees owning biotechnology tool patents. Thus, exaggerating \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) out of context would swallow the whole benefit of the Patent Act for some categories of biotechnological inventions. Needless to say, the [Hatch-Waxman Act] was [not] meant ... to deprive entire categories of inventions of patent protection.", "In its amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court, the U.S. Government suggests that \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) does not apply to patented research tools. The Government's brief explains that the safe harbor section, by its own terms, applies only to \"a patented invention.\" The Patent Act defines the term \"invention\" to mean any \"invention or discovery,\" \" unless the context otherwise indicates.\" The brief asserts that the context of \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) indicates that Congress may not have intended to include patented research tools within the scope of the safe harbor exemption. Since most research tools are used to study or develop other compounds for submission to the FDA regulatory approval process, rather than being themselves the subject of FDA regulatory review, it is plausible to conclude that research tools are not \"patented inventions\" within the meaning of the statute.", "In Integra, the Supreme Court expressly declined to decide whether or to what extent the exemption applies to patented research tools since the matter was not at issue in the case. The Court explained that Integra had never argued that the RGD peptides were used by Merck/Scripps as research tools, \"and it is apparent from the record that they were not.\" Thus, without a definitive judicial determination from the Court , the use of patented research tools in drug research and development may or may not fall under the \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) exemption from infringement. Such uncertainty over the patent rights of makers of research tools could serve as a source of continued confusion and litigation in this area."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The original legislative intent behind the Hatch-Waxman Act that created \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) was to facilitate the introduction of a generic drug upon the patent expiration of the brand name drug. However, as the Supreme Court explained in the Eli Lilly case that broadened \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) beyond generic drugs to the entire statutory scheme of FDA regulation: \"[I]t is not the law that a statute can have no effects which are not explicitly mentioned in its legislative history.\"", "The consequences of the Supreme Court's decision in Integra are significant. Some observers argue that if the Federal Circuit's opinion had not been vacated, its narrow interpretation of the patent law's safe harbor potentially would have created a chilling effect on the development of innovative, pioneer drugs and new generic drugs. Limiting \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) to only clinical research appears contrary to the objectives of the Hatch-Waxman Act: If a drug manufacturer could not perform the preclinical studies needed to obtain FDA approval to conduct clinical studies, \"the [\u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1)] exemption would never be reached because the underlying preliminary research and development work could not be undertaken\" without risking patent infringement liability.", "The Supreme Court's more expansive construction of \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) avoids this result. Since \"it will not always be clear to parties setting out to seek FDA approval for their new product exactly which kinds of information, and in what quantities, it will take to win that agency's approval,\" the safe harbor provision is needed to immunize certain preclinical studies that use patented compounds. The Court also provided an articulated standard for courts, scientists, drug companies, and patent holders to follow concerning the scope of \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1) coverage: Safe harbor applies if there is a reasonable basis to believe that the preclinical experiments will produce information that is relevant to an IND or NDA submission with the FDA. Failure to meet this standard would constitute infringing conduct not exempted by \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1). By unanimous opinion, the Integra Court has emphatically clarified that preclinical use of patented compounds in pharmaceutical research is not categorically unprotected and can qualify for the patent law's safe harbor as long as it comes within this enunciated standard.", "However, the Integra Court left unresolved the issue of whether research tools come within the scope of the safe harbor exemption. It is important to note that Integra does not affect the validity and value of patented research tools when they are employed in basic research or for purposes unrelated to an FDA submission. Yet the unauthorized use of research tools in the development of information for the FDA regulatory process may constitute infringing conduct or could be exempted by the patent law's safe harbor. This legal uncertainty raises concerns about the enforceability of research tool patents in this circumstance. Unless or until the Supreme Court answers this question in a future case, Congress may desire to clarify \u00c2\u00a7 271(e)(1)'s applicability to research tools."], "subsections": []}]}}
