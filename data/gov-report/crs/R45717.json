", "A portion of the budget outcomes is a function of general economic conditions, and the remainder is a function of policy choices. For example, deficits tend to rise during recessions (through a combination of decreased revenues and increased spending on programs like unemployment), whereas the opposite is generally true during economic expansions. Policy choices, such as the decline in defense spending after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, may change the budget situation due to changes in national priorities.", "The accumulation of net deficits over time results in the federal debt. As shown in Table 1 , the cumulative federal debt in 2018 was 78% of GDP.", "Of concern is that the federal budget deficit has resulted in the growth of the federal debt that has regularly exceeded the growth rate of the economy. The debt can grow without increasing the ratio of debt to GDP as long as it rises at a rate less than or equal to GDP growth. For example, if the debt is 80% of GDP and the economy is growing at 1.6%, a deficit of 1.28% of GDP (1.6% of 80%) will maintain the debt-to-GDP ratio.

Outside of the 9% provision for domestic goods, defense spending for goods and services constitutes about 15% of federal spending. In this area as well, there are limits to the savings that might be found without compromising national security. Therefore, to address the budget shortfalls facing the country over the long run, it is likely that (1) transfer payments, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, to or on behalf of individuals (which already account for half of federal spending and are growing) must be reduced; (2) transfers to state and local governments must be reduced (which would shift the budget decisions to a different level of government); (3) taxes must be raised; or some combination of the three.

It demonstrates that the surge in the debt is a recent phenomenon that has occurred with the recession and is inherently transitory. Going forward, however, as shown in the subsequent section, the growth in transfers to the elderly and spending for health care\u2014a trend that has been under way for some time but was offset by a decline in spending for other purposes, relative to GDP\u2014will increasingly contribute to unsustainable deficits. The following section addresses philosophies for approaching deficit reduction, as embodied in a number of proposals. It discusses how different approaches to and constraints imposed on deficit reduction will have consequences for the menus of other available choices. For example, if deficit reduction begins with a constraint that taxes will not rise, policy would almost certainly require significant cutbacks in Social Security and Medicare. If the benefits of these programs are to be maintained, an increase in taxes would likely be required.

Measured by the amount of spending, defense is the most important pure public good the federal government provides. Many public and quasi-public goods, as well as income-support programs, are provided by state and local governments, and some federal spending is through grants to state and local governments for these programs. For example, in FY2016, state governments received 29.1% of total revenues from federal transfers, and local governments received 3.8%. States also provide transfers to local governments, and local governments provide transfers among themselves as well. These intergovernmental transfers are important in evaluating budget proposals, because a reduction in transfers to state and local governments may in large part shift the burden to these governments rather than reduce the overall government role.", "Spending in the U.S. budget can be divided in various ways that are relevant to considering deficit reduction. In the discussion that follows, government spending is divided by whether the spending is to provide public goods or transfers, whether it is discretionary or mandatory (and the major categories within those divisions), and by function. The first approach to presenting spending distinguishes between the provision of goods and services (defense and nondefense) and transfers to persons or to state and local governments. This approach is not a typical way of presenting budget data. It is important to divide spending in this way, however, to address concerns about potential inefficiency in federal government operations, especially outside of defense, as it indicates the scope for cutbacks relative to the deficit. The second approach divides spending into discretionary (provided in annual appropriations acts) and mandatory (controlled by permanent laws, and including entitlements to benefits). It is associated with the procedures needed to alter spending. The third, a common way of presenting budget data, divides spending by function (defense, education, energy, health, etc.).

At the same time, transfers to persons increased by more than 40%, and transfers to state and local governments increased by less than 5%. Spending rose nearly 2% of GDP by 2018, primarily due to transfers to persons, whereas consumption continued to decline. Figure 2 shows how the economic form of federal spending has shifted since 1968.", "In calendar year 2007, 28% of government spending was categorized as consumption and involved the direct provision of goods and services. Of the remaining amount, 44% were transfers to persons, 13% transfers to state and local governments, 14% interest payments, and 2% subsidies. Although federal government spending amounted to 19.9% of output in 2007, federal government spending on the provision of public and quasi-public goods was 5.5% of output. Based on budget data reported subsequently, 3.8% was for defense, leaving 1.7% for nondefense. Because total nondefense discretionary spending was 3.4% of GDP, half of this amount was transfers. ", "By 2018, with the economy at or near full employment, federal government consumption spending had declined to 5% of output, whereas transfers had increased. Government spending on nondefense goods and services was 1.9% of GDP, and defense spending was 3.2% of GDP. Budget data for FY2017 indicate that discretionary spending was 6.3% of GDP, with defense spending at 3.1% of GDP and nondefense at 3.2% of GDP. Thus, roughly 60% of nondefense spending, about 1.9% of GDP, was transfers at that time. ", "State and local government spending (netting out transfers between these remaining two levels of government spending) in 2007 was 14% of output, and total spending by all forms of government (after netting out federal transfers) was 31.5% of output. A larger share of state and local spending (which includes federal government transfers), 69%, was in government provision of goods and services (consumption), with 21% in transfers to persons, 9% in interest payments, and less than 1% in subsidies. In the third quarter of 2018, state and local spending net of federal transfers was 14%, for a total of 32.5% for all government spending. Provision of goods and services was 64%; transfers were 26%; and interest was 9%. ", "Combining all levels of government, in 2007, government production of goods and services was 15.2% of output, thus the federal government share (5.5%) was about one-third of the total provided by all levels of government. Subtracting 3.8% from the federal government share and the total share to eliminate national defense spending (shown subsequently), the federal share of nondefense provision of goods and services by all levels of government was 11%.

Though technically classified as mandatory spending, interest payments tend to be listed separately because they are a consequence of past spending and tax policies. Discretionary spending is controlled by the annual appropriations process and is normally divided into defense and nondefense categories. Discretionary spending is where most of the public provision of goods and services occurs, but some discretionary spending is in the form of transfers. Mandatory spending is generally governed by a set of permanent statutory provisions, and some of these programs (such as Social Security and Medicare) are referred to as entitlements. ", "Since the late 1960s, as shown in Figure 3 , defense spending has declined as a share of output, first as a result of the ending of the Vietnam War (by FY1981, defense spending was 5.2% of output). It rose in the 1980s and then fell, reaching 3.0% by 2001, before rising again with the Afghanistan and (second) Iraq wars. This pattern suggests that although defense spending may generally grow with the economy and be affected by other factors (such as moving to an all-volunteer force or the peacetime buildup in the 1980s), it also fluctuates depending on whether the United States is engaged in prolonged international conflicts.", "Nondefense discretionary spending has fluctuated much less, although it rose in the late 1970s, then reverted to historical levels. Nondefense discretionary funding, although small as a share of the budget and of GDP, is largely the spending that many people think of when they think of the direct provision of goods and services by the federal government.", "Mandatory spending, although it varies over time, has generally increased as a share of the economy since the 1960s. The increase is most pronounced for health spending and has grown relative to GDP due to rising health care costs, certain other benefit changes, aging, and increased life spans.

Overall discretionary spending over this time period declined from 9.9% of GDP to 6.2% of GDP, or a change of 36.9% (with declines of 35.4% for defense and 37.3% for nondefense discretionary spending), whereas total mandatory spending has increased by 35.9% over the same time period.", "Within mandatory spending, health spending (Medicare and Medicaid)\u2014which has increased 223.5% since FY1980\u2014primarily drives the overall increase in mandatory spending.

Social insurance or payroll taxes generated an estimated $1.2 trillion, or 35% of revenue in FY2018. Estimates indicate that the remainder of federal revenue collected in FY2018 came from excise taxes (3%) or other sources (6%).", "The relative importance of these components can change over time, as seen in Figure 5 . The individual income tax, the largest single source of revenue as a percentage of GDP, has fluctuated considerably over time. Individual income tax revenues grew in the late 1970s due to bracket creep, reaching 9.4% in FY1981. The tax cuts in the Reagan Administration are the major reason revenues declined, falling to 7.9% in FY1990. Revenues increased slightly with the 1993 Clinton Administration tax increase ( P.L. 103-66 ), but the more significant growth occurred with the strong economic performance in the late 1990s, leading to a ratio of 9.9% in FY2000. They declined during the first decade of the 21 st century following the George W. Bush Administration tax cuts ( P.L. 107-16 ) and JGTRRA ( P.L. 108-27 ). Along with the individual income tax, total taxes have also fluctuated. Prior to the Bush tax cuts, total taxes dropped as low as 17.1% in FY1977 and rose as high as 20.6% in FY2001. During the 2007-2009 recession taxes fell to less than 15% of GDP. ", "Corporate taxes have fluctuated as well, although largely due to economic conditions, whereas payroll taxes rose to around their current levels as a percentage of GDP by the mid-1980s, reached a peak of 6.8% in 2001, and have since declined slightly. Excise taxes have declined by two-thirds, and other revenue sources have remained about the same.

Individual income taxes are progressive, have graduated rates, and can be revised in a variety of ways, including changing rates, deductions, exclusions, and credits. Income taxes are the main source of revenue for most federal spending outside of Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI, whose benefits are less than half of Medicare spending). Corporate income taxes are levied at a flat rate after allowing for various deductions and credits. Estate taxes are also progressive, but they are a small share of government revenues and have been declining in magnitude over the past 20 years. ", "Payroll taxes tend to fall more heavily on middle- and lower-income individuals. Payroll taxes, the next-largest source of revenue after individual income taxes, have flat rates (except for the Additional Medicare Tax) with an earnings cap for Social Security (but not Medicare). These taxes tend to be proportional, with a reduced burden on high-income taxpayers. Because of their simple structure, the main options for increasing revenues from this source are increasing rates and raising or eliminating the earnings cap. ", "Social Security payroll taxes are the basic source of finance for Social Security, and they are linked to benefits so that larger taxes lead eventually to larger benefits, although there are progressive elements in the benefit formula. Medicare payroll taxes qualify individuals for Medicare HI coverage, but the Medicare benefits are the same for all recipients.", "Excise taxes , which largely apply to alcohol, tobacco, and transportation fuels, tend to be regressive and fall more heavily on middle- and lower-income individuals, but are also a smaller revenue source.

The special tax credits and deductions in the income tax can also be viewed as a form of spending through the tax code. That is, one can view revenues as receipts without the special benefits and the special benefits from tax expenditures as spending. According to an FY1974-FY2004 Government Accountability Office (GAO) study, tax expenditures averaged 7.5% of GDP during that period. In FY2007, tax expenditures were 7.2% of GDP and about 36% of total government direct spending. In FY2018, tax expenditures were 7.2% of GDP and about 35% of government spending.", "From the perspective of dividing government activity between transfers and direct provision of public goods, as in Table 2 , tax expenditures are transfers and subsidies that go to persons, as is the case with the bulk of federal spending. From the perspective of discretionary versus mandatory spending, as in Table 3 , they are similar to a mandatory form of spending. Finally, from the perspective of budget function, as in Table 4 and as shown in Table 5 , which compares spending and tax expenditures by budget function for FY2018, the pattern of tax expenditures is quite different from that of spending. A much larger share of tax expenditures is for physical resources. For specific subcategories, the largest share of tax expenditures is for commerce and housing, a category that attracts a small share of spending. The size of this category reflects special benefits for earnings from capital income. It also reflects benefits for housing in the form of mortgage interest and property tax deductions and, to a lesser extent, exemption from capital gains tax on owner-occupied housing and the low-income housing credit. The relatively large share for general government reflects tax-exempt bonds and itemized deductions for state and local income and sales taxes. (These amounts could also be distributed across the functional categories of state spending and thus would be more broadly distributed.)

In contrast, DI and HI payroll tax revenues have been flat or increasing (as a percentage of GDP) over the same time period, while payments have been flat or increasing more modestly than OASI. By FY2018, payments for Social Security and Medicare benefits exceeded payroll tax collections. Because initial Social Security benefits are indexed to wages (and subsequently to prices), they tend to be a relatively constant share of output. Benefits have grown because of increasing longevity and an aging population. Revenues also tend to be a relatively constant share of output but were increased in the mid-1980s.", "Table 7 provides information on the income and outflow for the SMI trust fund. In FY1971, this fund was nearly equally financed by premiums paid by beneficiaries and federal contributions from general revenues. Although premiums have increased as a percentage of output, the vast majority of financing is now from general revenues. The premium share for Medicare Part B (physicians) fluctuated over time, but it is now set by law at 25% of the cost of funding Medicare Part B; the premiums share for Medicare Part D (drug) program is set at 25.5% of the estimated cost of the standard benefit.", "As these tables indicate, the size of these programs, particularly Medicare, has grown over time. SMI has grown faster than HI, and general revenue contributions have grown at a similar pace. SMI currently accounts for more than half the cost of Medicare.", "One open question surrounding the formulation of a long-run budget policy is whether to continue financing Social Security and Medicare HI from payroll taxes. In this case, both programs' future benefits are expected to outstrip future receipts and eventually draw down all the assets.

Potentially more serious imputation problems arise with valuing the tax expenditure associated with defined benefit pension plans, which accounts for 7.2% of the total.
