The conference report, H.Rept. 113-449, resolved differences between H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 (WRRDA 2013), and S. 601, the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 (WRDA 2013). Both bills represented omnibus authorization legislation for water resource activities, principally associated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps).", "Authorizing and Deauthorizing Projects. WRRDA 2014 authorized 34 construction projects totaling $25.65 billion ($15.64 billion federal, $10.01 billion nonfederal). It established expedited House and Senate procedures for bills authorizing construction projects meeting specified criteria. It requires an annual report from the Administration identifying proposed new studies, completed feasibility reports, and project modification reports. WRRDA 2014 also authorized a process to deauthorize previously authorized projects with federal costs to complete totaling $18 billion; the process will be led by the Administration, with opportunities for public input and congressional disapproval.", "Expediting Studies, Environmental Reviews, and Permits. The conference report, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601, aimed to expedite Corps studies and compliance with applicable environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It raised the project cost trigger for independent peer review of feasibility studies from $45 million to $200 million.", "Expanding Project Delivery and Financing Opportunities. The conference report, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601, encouraged nonfederal opportunities in delivering water resources projects. It expanded opportunities for crediting for nonfederal work, financial, and study and project management. Like S. 601, the conference report established a pilot program known as the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) to finance water infrastructure projects. The Corps and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are responsible for administering the WIFIA pilot program.", "Investing in Navigation. WRRDA 2014 encouraged increased spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF). It modified prioritization of HMTF funding among different types of harbors but retains similar provisions contained in H.R. 3080 and S. 601 reserving certain portions of funds to harbors with less cargo. The conference report, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601, did not enact changes to inland waterway revenues in general but increased the threshold for major rehabilitation efforts on inland waterways, authorized changes to waterway project delivery, and altered the cost-share for one project (Olmsted Locks and Dam). These changes may increase the likelihood of Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) monies being available for use on other inland waterway construction projects.", "Reducing Flood Risks. WRRDA 2014 authorized establishment of a levee safety initiative\u2014a scaled-down version of S. 601 provisions\u2014expanding Corps technical assistance and training to promote levee safety, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance in establishing or improving state and tribal levee safety programs, and Corps levee rehabilitation assistance. Like H.R. 3080 and S. 601, WRRDA 2014 required the Corps to develop national levee safety guidelines and review.", "Restoring and Protecting Aquatic Ecosystems. WRRDA 2014 provided congressional direction on various efforts for regional river and coastal restoration (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, North Atlantic coastal restoration) and authorized the construction of projects which have previously been studied in the Everglades and Coastal Louisiana, among other places. It also added to Corps authorities for the prevention, control, and eradication of invasive species.", "Addressing Other Issues. WRRDA 2014 included provisions amending the applicability of the scope of the Environmental Protection Agency's oil spill prevention, control, and countermeasure regulations, by exempting certain farms from the requirements. It also included amendments to certain water infrastructure provisions of the Clean Water Act (CWA). These CWA provisions, while representing the first amendments to CWA Title VI since 1987, did not address many of the more long-standing or controversial CWA issues. WRRDA 2014 did not include the ocean-related provisions of H.R. 3080 and S. 601. Instead, it authorized the Corps studies and limited construction of Corps projects to enhance ocean and coastal ecosystem resiliency."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "WRRDA Conference Report Developments", "paragraphs": ["The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014, P.L. 113-121 ) became law on June 10, 2014. Its conference report, H.Rept. 113-449 , resolved differences between the House-passed H.R. 3080 , the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 (WRRDA 2013), and the Senate-passed S. 601 , the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 (WRDA 2013). The conference report adopted Water Resources Reform and Development Act for the act's title. Both H.R. 3080 and S. 601 represented omnibus authorization legislation focused on water resource activities, principally of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and a few other environmental issues. The bills addressed many similar issues, but often used different means. During the House and Senate deliberations, some Members expressed frustration with how long Corps projects take. Some Members also expressed interest in authorizing new projects and deauthorizing older unconstructed projects. Some Members wanted more prominent nonfederal roles. Others supported more funding for harbor maintenance and improved inland waterway construction. The earmark debate and concerns about congressional roles also shaped each bill's approach. The Administration provided comments during congressional deliberations. The two most recent communications consisted of a December 11, 2013, letter from the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), hereinafter referred to as the ASA, to the conference managers ; and Army Corps testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I), Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, on April 29, 2014.", "Authorizing Projects . WRRDA 2014 authorized a fixed set of 34 new construction projects totaling $25.65 billion ($15.64 billion in federal costs and $10.01 billion in nonfederal costs) and increased the authorization of appropriations for eight previously authorized projects. It established expedited House procedures for the remainder of the 113 th Congress and expedited Senate procedures through 2018 for bills authorizing construction projects that meet specified criteria. It requires an \"Annual Report\" from the ASA to Congress identifying proposed new studies (including studies proposed by nonfederal entities) and completed feasibility and project modification reports. When the Senate passed S. 601 on May 15, 2013, there were an estimated 19 construction projects representing approximately $10.8 billion ($6.3 billion federal and $4.5 billion nonfederal) that appeared to meet the new project authorization criteria in S. 601 . When the House passed H.R. 3080 on October 23, 2013, it would have authorized a fixed set of 23 new construction projects at a total cost of $13.0 billion ($7.7 billion in federal costs and $5.3 billion in nonfederal costs). WRRDA 2014 included no comparable title to Title III of S. 601 , Project Modifications.", "Expediting Studies, Environmental Reviews, and Permits . P.L. 113-121 , like H.R. 3080 and S. 601 , encouraged completion of Corps studies within three years, limited study costs, and established new procedures intended to expedite Corps completion of environmental compliance requirements, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Independent peer review was among the \"reforms\" adopted in WRDA 2007 ( P.L. 110-114 ). WRRDA 2014's conference report raised the standard threshold for performing an independent peer review of a feasibility study from $45 million total project costs to $200 million, and extend applicability of the review requirement to studies initiated through 2019.", "Expanding Project Delivery and Financing Opportunities . WRRDA 2014, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601 , encouraged nonfederal opportunities in delivering water resources projects through provisions on crediting for nonfederal work and increasing opportunities for nonfederal contributions and nonfederal study and project management. It required the ASA to establish a five-year pilot program for nonfederal management of studies and a five-year pilot program of 15 projects for nonfederal management of project construction. It also consolidated various authorities under which nonfederal entities can perform construction on water resources projects and allow the federal share of construction costs to be reimbursed or credited (and credit transferred to other projects). Like S. 601 , WRRDA 2014 established a pilot program known as the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) to finance water infrastructure projects. The Corps and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are responsible for administering the pilot program. ", "Investing in Navigation . WRRDA 2014, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601 , encouraged increased spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF). As in S. 601 , the enacted legislation eliminated the 50% nonfederal cost sharing requirement for harbor maintenance between 45 and 50 feet deep. It modified prioritization of HMTF funding among different types of harbors but retained similar provisions contained in H.R. 3080 and S. 601 reserving certain portions of funds to harbors with less cargo. The final legislation, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601 , did not enact changes to inland waterway revenues in general but increased the threshold for major rehabilitation efforts on inland waterways, authorized changes to waterway project delivery, and altered the cost-share for one project (Olmsted Locks and Dam). These changes may increase the likelihood of Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) monies being available for use on other inland waterway construction projects.", "Reducing Flood Risks. P.L. 113-121 authorized establishment of a levee safety initiative that expanded Corps technical assistance and training to promote levee safety, expanded Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance in establishing or improving state and tribal levee safety programs, and expanded Corps authority to provide levee rehabilitation assistance. Elements of the enacted initiative are similar to provisions in S. 601 , but with either no or lower levels of authorizations of appropriations. Like H.R. 3080 and S. 601 , the enacted legislation required the ASA to develop national levee safety guidelines and review and update Corps guidelines for vegetation on levees. Similar to S. 601 , the conference report allowed the ASA to repair a levee to the design level of protection (rather than to pre-storm conditions) or if needed modify the project to address major deficiencies or implement nonstructural measures. WRRDA 2014 directed the ASA to ensure that part of its levee inspection program provides adequate information for reaching a levee accreditation decision for purposes of floodplain mapping related to FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) mapping. ", "Restoring and Protecting Aquatic Ecosystems . WRRDA 2014 provided congressional direction related to various regional river and coastal restoration efforts (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, North Atlantic coastal restoration) and authorized the construction of projects which have previously been studied in the Everglades and in Coastal Louisiana, among other places. Similar to a proposal in H.R. 3080 , WRRDA 2014 also added to Corps authority to undertake activities for the prevention, control, and eradication of invasive species at Corps projects. ", "Deauthorizing Projects and Managing the Backlog . WRRDA 2014 created a one-time process aimed at deauthorizing previously authorized projects with federal costs to complete totaling $18 billion; the ASA is responsible for leading the process, and is required to provide opportunity for public input and congressional disapproval. This one-time process and other backlog provisions included in P.L. 113-121 combined elements of the deauthorization and backlog management provisions of H.R. 3080 and S. 601 .", "Addressing Other Issues. The conference report included provisions, different from those in S. 601 , amending the applicability of the Environmental Protection Agency's oil spill prevention, control, and countermeasure regulations. The enacted legislation also included certain water infrastructure provisions of the Clean Water Act (CWA) that were not included in H.R. 3080 or S. 601 . These CWA provisions, while representing the first amendments to CWA Title VI since 1987, did not address many of the more longstanding or controversial CWA issues. Most of the CWA provisions included in WRRDA 2014 addressed CWA Title VI, which authorized grants to states to capitalize state loan programs (State Revolving Funds, or SRFs) for wastewater treatment facility projects. ", "P.L. 113-121 did not include the ocean-related provisions of the House and Senate bills. H.R. 3080 would have prohibited programs or actions authorized by H.R. 3080 to be used for furthering implementation of Executive Order 13547 on coastal and marine spatial planning. S. 601 would have created a National Endowment for the Oceans. Instead, WRRDA 2014 authorized the ASA to undertake studies of Corps projects in coastal zones to enhance ocean and coastal ecosystem resiliency; it also authorized the construction of smaller projects or inclusion of recommendations for congressional authorization in the Annual Report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparison of H.R. 3080, S. 601, and Conference Report", "paragraphs": ["The remainder of this report provides a side-by-side analysis of selected provisions of H.R. 3080 , S. 601 , and the conference report which became WRRDA 2014. The selection of provisions addressed herein was based on attention during congressional deliberations, significance for the Corps and its activities, or policy differences between the bills. Many of the project-specific or geographically specific provisions (e.g., provisions of Titles III and V of S. 601 , Title IV of the conference report) generally are not discussed. The Appendix identifies the comparable titles of the two bills and conference report. The report is divided into the sections shown in Table 1 ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expediting Studies, Environmental Reviews, and Permits", "paragraphs": ["Like both the House and Senate bills, the conference report for WRRDA 2014 included provisions aimed at expediting water project delivery and permit processing. Most of these provisions intended to expedite\u2014", "Corps studies by establishing deadlines, schedules, or funding limits for feasibility studies and eliminating certain study requirements; environmental compliance requirements, including primarily provisions intended to expedite Corps compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and outside agency issuance of any permit, review, or other approval required under any applicable federal law; and Corps permitting.", "During the House and Senate deliberations, some Members expressed frustration with the cost and duration of Corps studies. Most Corps feasibility studies are cost-shared 50% federal and 50% nonfederal. The degree to which various factors and requirements contribute to the time it takes to complete a Corps study is difficult to parse out and attribute to a single environmental requirement. For example, activities performed to demonstrate compliance with applicable environmental requirements may occur concurrently to the Corps completing actions required by other laws (e.g., preparing analyses necessary to determine a project's economic costs and benefits). The larger, more complex, and costly the project being studied, often the longer each step in the study process may take to complete. Anecdotal evidence indicates that individual studies may take longer due to disagreements with federal resource agencies or state permitting agencies, but there are limited data available to determine whether such delays are systemic or project-specific. The role that Congress plays in authorizing studies and project construction and the timing of appropriations have been identified as factors having significant effect on the duration of studies and ultimately project delivery. For example, in terms of the project development process, years may pass between the following steps shown in each bullet:", "approval to initiate a study, to appropriation of federal funds for the study, complete reconnaissance study, to initiation of feasibility study, and ASA transmission to Congress of the feasibility report, to congressional construction authorization. ", "At an April 29, 2014, House T&I Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment hearing, the Corps witness testified that, while the agency is committed to expediting the Corps planning process:", "certain elements of provisions in the proposed legislation regarding the elimination of reconnaissance studies, fixed lengths for feasibility studies, project permitting and environmental streamlining, study authority resolutions, and the application of Independent External Peer Review, could actually become counterproductive. By constraining the Corps from exercising the same initiative that led to Civil Works Transformation and Planning Modernization, certain requirements could lead to a less flexible, overly restrictive program that reduces efficiency, hinders project approval, and increases the probability of a project being terminated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Corps Studies", "paragraphs": ["The conference report for WRRDA 2014 required that the Corps complete feasibility studies within certain time limits (with more flexibility provided for timing of study completion than in H.R. 3080 ) and federal funding limits. Like \u00a7104 of the House bill, the conference report eliminated the requirement to prepare a separate reconnaissance study and instead directed the Corps to include analysis required for those studies (preliminary analysis of the federal interest and the costs, benefits, and environmental impacts of the project) in a feasibility report. Like \u00a72034 of the Senate bill, the conference report required the Corps to develop a detailed project schedule for certain milestones needed to complete feasibility studies. Selected provisions related to study acceleration are shown in Table 2 .", "Independent peer review was among the \"reforms\" adopted in WRDA 2007 ( P.L. 110-114 ). The conference report raised the standard threshold for performing an independent peer review of a feasibility study; it increased from $45 million total project costs to $200 million. Like S. 601 , the conference report extended the requirement for independent peer review from those studies initiated between 2007 and 2014 to those initiated between 2007 and 2019, and amended the congressional requirements on the reporting on decisions not to perform peer review and distribution of the results of the peer review and the agency's responses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Environmental Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Project acceleration provisions in WRRDA 2014 (\u00a71005) are intended to expedite the Corps' overall project development by expediting one element of the feasibility report process\u2014preparation of documents necessary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). To do so, WRRDA 2014 (\u00a71005(a)) amended the project streamlining requirements in Section 2045 of WRDA 2007 ( P.L. 110-114 , codified at 33 U.S.C. 2348). ", "The NEPA compliance process is sometimes referred to as the environmental review process. Broadly, NEPA requires federal agencies to fully consider a project's significant impacts on the environment, and to inform the public of those impacts, before making a final decision about the project. Provisions in the conference report (\u00a71005(a)) expanded the definition of \"environmental review process\" to include the \"process for and completion of any environmental permit, approval, review, or study required for a water resources project under any Federal law other than NEPA.\" Provisions in the conference report, however, apply primarily to actions taken by the Corps within the context of demonstrating compliance with NEPA. ", "In accordance with its broader obligation to determine a project's potential economic, social, and environmental benefits and detriments, Corps planning is performed in accordance with its \"Environmental Evaluation and Compliance\" process. That process is implemented by the Corps to ensure that activities necessary to identify and demonstrate compliance with any applicable environmental requirements are integrated into the Corps' overall planning process. The Environmental Evaluation and Compliance process includes steps necessary to ensure compliance with environmental requirements that arise from local, tribal, state, or federal laws and regulations that may apply as a result of project-specific impacts to protected resources. The NEPA compliance process generally forms the framework that the Corps uses to identify applicable project-specific requirements and to coordinate with outside agencies, if necessary, to comply with those requirements. For projects that require a feasibility study, the Corps usually must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), pursuant to NEPA. Generally, it is Corps practice to ensure that any outside agency consultations and decisions regarding any permits or approvals are complete before a feasibility study/EIS is complete. ", "Many of the project acceleration provisions in the conference report (\u00a71005(a)) pertained to outside agency involvement in the NEPA process or in making decisions under other environmental laws. Those provisions largely were intended to coordinate actions or input from outside federal agencies which have some expertise regarding an affected resource or jurisdiction by law to control the impacts to that resource (e.g., an agency authorized to issue a permit or other approval associated with an impact to that resource). ", "Prior to WRRDA 2014, Section 2045 of WRDA 2007 (33 U.S.C. 2348) required that the Corps establish a coordinated review process for any water resources project that requires the preparation of a feasibility study and an EIS under NEPA. When implementing that process, the Corps was authorized to establish a schedule for federal, state, or local government agencies or Indian tribes to process, approve, or issue all reviews, analyses, opinions, permits, licenses, and approvals required for a water resources project (which is also allowed under existing regulations implementing NEPA). Provisions included in the conference report similarly apply to project studies that require the preparation of an EIS under NEPA, but may also be applied to other projects as deemed appropriate by the ASA. ", "As in Section 2045 of WRDA 2007, many of the provisions in WRRDA 2014 codify requirements that are largely similar to preexisting regulations implementing NEPA. However, some provisions may add to or change preexisting Corps practices or requirements used to demonstrate compliance with NEPA, or change outside agencies' procedures for completing their respective decision-making processes. Selected provisions that may result in such changes are listed in Table 3 . While the conference report may change certain procedures applicable to environmental reviews, none appear to substantially affect the Corps' obligation to comply with existing environmental requirements (established under NEPA or any other environmental law) that may apply to a project.", "Until the Corps interprets the project acceleration provisions and integrates them with its current Environmental Evaluation and Compliance process, it is difficult to determine whether the procedural changes will expedite environmental reviews. Some of provisions could add time to the Corps' already complex planning process. For example under WRRDA 2014, the Corps is required to prepare a coordination plan to coordinate and schedule outside agency participation in the environmental review process (see Table 3 ). When preparing the plan, the Corps is required to set deadlines for outside agencies to complete the environmental review process\u2014something the Corps could previously do on a project-by-project basis. Those deadlines may be extended for \"good cause.\" Other than requiring the Corps to prepare an additional planning document, this provision may not substantially alter the Corps' procedures to coordinate outside agency actions.", "The conference report (\u00a71005(a)) also establishes unique requirements applicable to the NEPA compliance process, in general, but may have limited impact on the Corps' NEPA process, in particular. Specifically, financial penalty provisions create a unique system of reprogramming a federal agency's funding if that agency does not reach a decision on a permit, license, or other approval by a certain deadline (the later of 180 days after an application for the approval is complete; and the Corps completes the NEPA process). As discussed above, the Corps generally does not complete the NEPA process until permits and other required approvals are in place. Also, approvals required for Corps projects, including those required under federal environmental laws, are most often issued by state, tribal or local agencies, not federal agencies. Given the timing in which the Corps generally has such approvals in place and the role that federal agencies generally have in issuing such approvals for Corps projects, there may be limited circumstances in which the financial penalty provisions may be invoked.", "WRRDA 2014 also included a provision (\u00a71005(b)) related to actions associated with the repair, reconstruction or rehabilitation of a project in operation or under construction when damaged in an event associated with a major disaster or emergency declared by the President pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.). Such actions would be processed as a categorical exclusion (CE), pursuant to CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1508.4). According to those CEQ regulations, projects known by an agency to have no significant impact on the environment may be categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an environmental assessment or EIS, under NEPA. Those regulations also provide for conditions under which an agency may be required to determine whether a given project involves \"extraordinary circumstances\" that may result in significant impacts (e.g., circumstances that may require additional review under NEPA). ", "WRRDA 2014 (\u00a71005(b)) may not substantially change Corps practices. In its procedures implementing NEPA, the Corps explicitly identifies \"activities at completed Corps projects\" as actions processed as CEs, regardless of whether those activities are undertaken in response to an emergency. If the action is to address a project \"under construction,\" any additional NEPA compliance may not be required, since the impacts of that project would presumably be evaluated in an existing NEPA document. Also, the Stafford Act statutorily exempts certain disaster-related activities from NEPA, including the repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement of a damaged public facility. As a result, some disaster\u2013related repairs undertaken by the Corps could potentially be waived from NEPA. Designating a project as a CE is not a waiver from NEPA. Until the Corps interprets this directive, it is not clear whether it could result in a project being subject to some, albeit limited, level of NEPA review when it otherwise may have been subject to no review, pursuant to the Stafford Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corps Permitting", "paragraphs": ["In addition to undertaking water resources projects, the Corps also has regulatory responsibilities related to activities that may affect navigable waters and wetlands.", "H.R. 3080 and S. 601 each included provisions that could be identified as accelerating or streamlining the Corps' regulatory program as shown in Table 2 . Both bills proposed eliminating the expiration of a Corps authority that allows the agency to accept funds from nonfederal public entities to expedite the processing of Corps permits for projects serving a public purpose. The authority was set to expire December 31, 2016. Additionally, H.R. 3080 would have expanded the eligibility of entities that can provide funds to the Corps to expedite its processing of permits. The current authority is limited to nonfederal public entities. H.R. 3080 would have added public-utility companies and natural gas companies. In December 2010, Congress clarified in P.L. 111-315 that private entities were not eligible entities under this authority after concerns that a Corps district was allowing limited use of the authority by private entities at the request of public entities. S. 601 would not have expanded the eligible entities for this authority; instead, S. 601 would have required the Corps take steps to improve the transparency, reporting, and consistency of how this authority is implemented.

The WIFIA concept is modeled after a similar program that assists transportation projects, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or TIFIA, program.

The HMTF is supported by a tax on cargo moving through ports and cruise ship passengers (the Harbor Maintenance Tax, HMT). In recent years, annual HMTF expenditures (which require congressional appropriations typically as part of an Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act) have amounted to a little more than half of annual HMT collections and interest. Like H.R. 3080 and S. 601 , the conference report sought to increase HMTF spending, but not at the expense of available funding for other Corps activities. Thus, increased HMTF spending is predicated on the condition that the Corps total budget increases by at least the same amount.", "WRRDA 2014 expanded the eligible uses of HMTF monies to dredging activity that is now paid by nonfederal sponsors (e.g., the dredging of berths by port authorities), but only at ports that generate more HMT revenue than they have received from the HMTF. The conference report adopted the provision in S. 601 that eliminated the 50% nonfederal cost share for the incremental cost of maintaining harbors at depths between 45 and 50 feet. Thus, the conference report could increase HMTF spending on harbors handling large volumes of cargo that in the past have made relatively little use of HMTF funds. The Administration objected to expanding the federal role in harbor maintenance to include activities that historically have not been a federal responsibility.", "An issue reflected in the legislation is how to prioritize harbor maintenance among ports that handle large amounts of cargo and those that do not. The conference report reserved specified portions of HMTF funding for harbors with less cargo or that have not been fully maintained in prior years. The conference report modified a provision in H.R. 3080 that required the Corps to provide a written response to a nonfederal interest seeking federal maintenance of a harbor. ", "In addition to the dredging of berths and certain legacy-contaminated sediments, the conference report adopted language from S. 601 to allow \"donor ports\" and \"energy transfer ports\" to use appropriated funds for rebating HMT payments to shippers or for other dredging-related activity that otherwise is not a federal responsibility (see Table 8 for definitions). This could be especially appealing to U.S. ports that contend shippers favor nearby foreign ports to avoid payment of HMT. It appears that Seattle and Tacoma, WA, would qualify as \"donor ports.\" It appears that fourteen ports may qualify as \"energy transfer ports\" (five ports in Louisiana; four ports in Texas; plus Mobile, AL; New York/New Jersey; Baltimore, MD; Norfolk, VA; and Long Beach, CA). To qualify as a donor port, a port must generate substantially more HMT than it receives, but this is not the case for an energy transfer port. An energy transfer port is defined as a harbor handling more than 40 million tons of cargo of any type and at which energy products comprised more than 25% of this tonnage (the HMT is not assessed on export cargo).

The IWTF has a declining balance that appears to have limited waterway construction projects in recent years. One inland waterway construction project, the Olmsted Locks and Dam project, has received the majority of the inland waterways construction monies in recent years, while construction on other inland waterway projects has been postponed.
