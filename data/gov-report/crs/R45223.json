These efforts have identified between 105 and 254 STEM education programs and activities at 13 to 15 federal agencies. Annual federal appropriations for STEM education are typically in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.4 billion. All published inventories identify the Department of Education, National Science Foundation, and the Department of Health and Human Services as key agencies in the federal effort. Over half of federal STEM education funding is intended to serve the needs of postsecondary schools and students; the remainder goes to efforts at the K-12 educational level. Much of the funding for postsecondary students is in the form of financial aid, including fellowships and grants.", "It is often suggested that the United States performs poorly in STEM education, but the data paint a complex picture. By some measures, U.S. students appear to be doing quite well. For example, overall graduate student enrollments in science and engineering (S&E) grew 15% over the last decade. Further, S&E degree attainment for groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM majors\u2014such as Hispanic/Latino, African American, and female students\u2014grew by 122%, 35%, and 37%, respectively. On the other hand, concerns remain about persistent academic achievement gaps between various demographic groups, STEM teacher quality, the rankings of U.S. students on international STEM assessments, foreign student enrollments and increased educational attainment in other countries, and the ability of the U.S. STEM education system to meet domestic demand for STEM labor.", "Federal STEM education policy concerns center on broad issues\u2014such as governance of the federal effort and broadening participation of underrepresented populations\u2014as well as those that are specific to STEM education at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Governance concerns focus on perceived duplication and lack of coordination in the federal effort; broadening participation concerns tend to highlight achievement and participation gaps between various demographic groups. A variety of policy options have garnered attention in recent years, relating to elementary, secondary, and postsecondary STEM education. At the K-12 level, these include proposals to address educational accountability, standards, and teacher quality. At the postsecondary level, proposals center on efforts to remediate and retain students in STEM majors.", "This report is intended to serve as a primer on existing STEM education policy issues and programs.

Since World War II, the United States has benefitted from the social, economic, health, and military advances made possible, in part, by a highly skilled STEM workforce. Today, a wide range of U.S. occupations\u2014in STEM and non-STEM fields\u2014either require or benefit from workers with STEM skills and knowledge. Most observers would likely argue that science and technology skills will continue to be as important in the future as they were in the past, if not more so. As such, many observers consider widespread STEM literacy, as well as specific STEM expertise, to be critical human capital competencies for the 21 st century. ", "The education system is one major source of STEM skills and knowledge among the U.S. population. Federal legislators have paid close attention to the STEM-related outputs of that system\u2014such as the number of college graduates with degrees in STEM fields or the performance of U.S. students on international mathematics tests\u2014and have sought to increase its functioning and capacity through federal policy and investments. For example, over 300 bills containing just the term \"science education\" were introduced in the 20 years between the 105 th (1997-1998) and 115 th (2017-2018) Congresses. Agency reauthorization bills often contain STEM education-related provisions, and at least 14 federal agencies conduct STEM education programs or activities. The annual federal investment in STEM education programs, while difficult to estimate, is typically considered to be around $3 billion.", "Given policymakers' ongoing interest in the scope and scale of the federal STEM education effort, this report aims to provide an overview of the current and historical landscape of programs and issues in STEM education.

These include programs such as Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which provides additional funds for school districts serving large concentrations of children living in poverty. These also include postsecondary federal student aid, consisting of Pell grants, student loans, and campus-based programs for students attending institutions of higher education (IHEs). Students who receive Pell grants or federal student loans may choose to use the money to pursue degrees in STEM fields; however, routing students into those fields is not the primary purpose of those programs.

The responsibility for coordinating STEM education programs and initiatives across the federal government falls to the NSTC's Committee on STEM Education (CoSTEM). CoSTEM was established in 2011 in accordance with statutory requirements of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ). Since its establishment, CoSTEM has carried out an inventory of the federal effort in STEM education (hereinafter referred to as NSTC-11) in response to concerns about the focus and possible overlap in the nature of federal approaches and has created and begun implementing the Federal STEM Education Five-Year Strategic Plan.", "The NSTC-11 inventory found that, as of FY2011, federal agencies were making 254 distinct investments in STEM education for a total budgetary commitment of $3.4 billion. The inventory characterized federal investments in STEM education by primary objective. Of the eight pre-defined primary objectives, federal agencies reported the largest shares of their STEM investments were for the following: (1) increasing the number of postsecondary STEM degrees, (2) preparing people to enter into STEM careers, and (3) conducting STEM education research and development. The distribution of federal STEM investments by primary objective is shown in Figure 2 . NSTC-11 also reported that nearly three-quarters (74%) of all federal STEM education investments had at least two secondary objectives in addition to the primary one.", "The inventory also included NSTC's suggestions for possible approaches to improving the federal STEM education portfolio.

Some observers view underrepresentation of certain demographic groups in STEM majors as an issue of limiting U.S. economic competitiveness: not including significant portions of the population in STEM majors and careers can decrease the talent pool for U.S. employers looking for the top workers with the best STEM skills. Others see it as an issue of equity and social justice: STEM degrees can lead to a variety of lucrative careers, and underrepresentation of minorities in those careers can keep those groups from increasing their economic prosperity and perpetuate economic gaps that exist in the United States.
