Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP)", "When the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) was incorporated into the IC, there was no separate HSIP, although OIA's customers were extremely diverse. It was entirely funded through the NIP. In the words of Francis Taylor, the current Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis (DHS/I&A), \"I&A has one of the broadest customer bases in the IC, ranging from the Secretary, to DHS policymakers and operators, to thousands of state and local officials and private sector partners\u2014each of whom have different information classification requirements and limitations.\"", "In time, the DNI and DHS leadership argued that because OIA supported both an IC-wide mission and a department-specific mission, it needed both NIP funds to support DNI requirements, and separately controlled HSIP funds to support DHS requirements. In response, the congressional intelligence committees established the HSIP within DHS/OIA to include those \"intelligence activities ... that serve predominantly departmental [DHS] missions.\" For example, some of DHS's cyber support, and some of the governance activities associated with the Homeland Security Intelligence Council staff have been funded with HSIP dollars.", "In S.Rept. 112-192 , accompanying the IAA for FY2013, the Senate Intelligence Committee stated its support of the concept, but maintained its jurisdiction over the HSIP:", "The OIA is currently funded through the NIP. The Committee supports the request of the Secretary and DNI to fund OIA through the NIP and a new HSIP but is continuing to study the question of whether other intelligence activities of the Department should be included in the HSIP. The Committee intends to continue oversight of and authorize the HSIP.", "The IAA for FY2015 ( P.L. 113-293 \u00a7324) requires the DHS/I&A to provide the congressional intelligence committees with a report on each intelligence activity of each intelligence component of the Department that includes, among other things, the amount of funding requested, the number of full-time employees, and the number of full-time contractor employees. In addition, Section 324 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to the congressional intelligence committees a report that examines the feasibility and advisability of consolidating the planning, programming, and resourcing of such activities within the HSIP. ", "According to the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the IAA for FY2015:", "The HSIP budget was established to fund those intelligence activities that principally support missions of the DHS separately from those of the NIP. To date, however, this mechanism has only been used to supplement the budget for the office of Intelligence and Analysis. It has not been used to fund the activities of the non-IC components in the DHS that conduct intelligence-related activities. As a result, there is no comprehensive reporting to Congress regarding the overall resources and personnel required in support of the Department's intelligence activities.", "In summary, within DHS, the NIP budget funds activities within the OIA that support national-level, IC-wide roles and responsibilities. The NIP does not fund OIA department-specific activities. The NIP budget provides no funds to operate DHS intelligence activities such as its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Intelligence because ICE is not an IC element. Because it is not part of the NIP, management of the HSIP does not belong to the DNI; it belongs to the Secretary of Homeland Security.", "Thus, the Secretary of DHS manages intelligence-related budgets (that fall outside the NIP) that include: department specific, intelligence-related activities of an IC component ; and intelligence-related activities of non-IC components within their departments. The same can be said of the Secretary of Defense, who manages the MIP and intelligence-related activities of non-IC components within the DOD. Other department secretaries, such as the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Treasury manage the intelligence-related activities of non-IC components within their departments, not the DNI. It is unclear how well the myriad of intelligence-related activities that fall outside the NIP or MIP are managed, coordinated or overseen on a day-to-day basis.", "Appendix E.
