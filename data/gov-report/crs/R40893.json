For example, the Museum Professionals for the 21 st Century specifically supports professional training and leadership development for museum staff. The Conservation Project Support program provides funding to help museums identify their conservation needs and conduct activities to ensure the safekeeping of their collections. There are also two programs that support museums that primarily serve certain populations. For example, the Native American/Native Hawaiian Museum Services Grants provide grants for museums that serve Native populations with the goal of furthering professional development and enhancing museum services in general.

As discussed earlier in this report, FY2009 was the first year initial state grant awards had increased (from $340,000 to $680,000) since 1971. Some argue that $340,000 is simply too small an amount for states to use to implement a state grant program. The upcoming reauthorization may include consideration of whether the authorization of appropriations for LST should be increased to help ensure that initial state grant awards do not fall below $680,000. The Laura Bush 21 st Century Librarian program. This program was originally created via FY2003 Appropriations legislation. It has been funded each year since its inception, with funding increasing from $9.9 million in FY2003 to $25.5 million in FY2009. This program has funded 3,220 master's degree students, 186 doctoral students, 1,256 pre-professional students, and 26,206 continuing education students. Some argue that there is a continuing need for this program, and they argue that it should receive a specific authorization in the upcoming reauthorization. The FY2003 Budget Request to Congress stated that librarians had \"one of the highest median ages of any occupation (47 years old).\" The Budget Request indicated that impending retirements, among other things, supported the need for a new program to recruit and educate the next generation of librarians. The most recent BLS employment projections indicate that more than two out of three librarians are 45 or older. BLS reports that the retirement of these librarians will result in several job openings over the next decade. BLS also notes that recent enrollments in MLS programs have been rising\u2014potentially increasing the pool of new librarians entering the field. R ole of Libraries as a Community Hub . Libraries have increased the variety of resources and services they provide to communities. The free internet access provided by libraries has become increasingly important in many communities; 72.5% of libraries indicated that they provided the only free internet access in their communities. Many individuals rely on this access to download government forms and learn about government services. Libraries also provide access to job announcements and training resources for job seekers. In addition, they provide after school activities, online homework help, early childhood literacy programs, technology training, and adult literacy classes, among other things. Library advocates argue that the involvement of libraries in this wide array of community resources and services could be expanded with more support; they are encouraging that an increased emphasis on these activities be incorporated into the upcoming legislation reauthorizing the IMLS. They also argue that the role for libraries in providing needed services to communities during national disasters should be addressed in the upcoming reauthorization. Role of Libraries as a P rovider of Employment and Job-Training Resources . One of the new activities being provided by more libraries is assistance for job seekers. Many employers now require all job applications to be filed online. In addition to free internet access, examples of services that are currently being provided by libraries include online job searches, provision of career information, and training on resume development. Reauthorization may include discussion of how to expand these services, and how to coordinate them with existing federal government job-training programs and related services. More Flexibility in the Use of LST State Grant Funds . LST State Grants are intended to provide states with wide latitude in their use of funds. Funds are to be used to expand services in a variety of formats to all types of libraries, to improve electronic and other linkages to better serve consumers of library services, and to target library services to underserved or disadvantaged populations. An important aspect of meeting these objectives is continually improving the capacity of library staff to become experts in the new technologies and services being provided by libraries. Library advocates indicate that there is an ongoing need for continuing education for library staff, but that the current legislative language in LST may not be sufficiently flexible to allow funds to be used for this purpose. For that reason, some recommend that language be added during reauthorization to ensure that LST State Grant funds can be used for continuing education for library staff. Enhancing Policy Research and Coordination of Library Services. As discussed earlier in the report, the 2003 reauthorization of IMLS included new language requiring the agency to undertake analyses of the impact of library and museum services. The upcoming reauthorization may consider making this role more expansive by including more extensive, detailed requirements of IMLS. Possible amendments would also reflect consideration of the implementation of existing provisions to date. In addition, there may be proposals for new authorizing language regarding the responsibilities (previously housed with NCLIS and the Department of Education) that have been delegated to IMLS (also discussed earlier in this report)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Museum Services", "paragraphs": ["Potential reauthorization issues related to Museum Services may include the following:", "Funding . The issue of federal funding levels for museums consistently arises during reauthorizations of museum services. Beyond rethinking the federal role for funding museum services, museum organizations are requesting significant increases in funding. For example, the American Association of Museums has recommended the reauthorization of OMS within IMLS and an incremental appropriation reaching $95 million over a five-year time period. The FY2010 appropriation for Museum Services was approximately $34 million. An annual appropriation of $95 million over a period of five years would represent a significant increase in the rate of funding over the previous five years. Assistance to Small and Midsize Museums . In public hearings conducted by IMLS, participants expressed concern about the special needs of small to midsize museums. Because IMLS support for Museum Services is distributed through competitive grants, small and midsized museums may be disadvantaged in competing for these grants due to their relative lack of institutional capacity, lack of grant writers on staff, and lack of experience needed to administer federal funds. In addition, some participants felt that the accountability requirements attached to federal funds made them less likely to apply because the application and reporting requirements placed a heavy burden on a small staff. Although there was general consensus about the special needs of small and midsized museums, there was disagreement concerning the most appropriate way to address these needs. A frequently cited solution was to develop federal-state partnerships for Museum Services (see below). Federal-State Partnerships . In response to requests from several members of Congress, IMLS conducted several studies regarding the state of public support for museum services and the feasibility of alternate funding mechanisms. One study was an initial investigation of federal-state partnership models as a mechanism for distributing federal funds. A federal-state partnership model would require the creation of intermediary organizations at the state level that would represent museum services as a whole. The study found that current federal-state partnership programs for museum services tend to be discipline based; that is, art museums, planetariums, zoos, and other museum disciplines had their own state-level organization. Currently, there is no state-level organization that represents museums as a whole. Other federal arts and humanities agencies, such as the NEA and NEH, have state-level organizations that represent the arts or the humanities sector as a whole (i.e., the State Arts Agencies and State Humanities Councils, respectively). Using federal-state partnerships as a mechanism to distribute federal funds for Museum Services may require the cooperation of multiple state-level organizations or a reorganization of state-level organizations. IMLS states that there are several potential barriers to the development of federal-state partnerships for Museum Services. First, there is a lack of consistent state-level information on the number of museums and the capacity of museums that make up the sector. Systemic data collection activities may be required to assess state-level infrastructure and institutional capacity. Similar data collection activities have been undertaken by the library sector; however, given the decentralized, discipline-based organization of museums, these data collection activities may be more cumbersome for the museum sector. Grants to States Program . IMLS has also investigated the potential of using a population-based state grant program as a mechanism to distribute federal funding for Museum Services. At the IMLS public hearings, some participants advocated for a federal funding formula for Museum Services; however, other participants had concerns that the current funding levels for OMS would not support a federal funding formula and that, in the current fiscal climate, OMS could not reasonably expect an increase in funding that would allow a formula grant program to be effective. In addition to interest at the public hearing, several organizations have created a national initiative to institute a federal funding formula. Most advocates of a federal funding formula prefer a population-based state grant program. One potential difficulty with using a population-based formula is that the number of museums per state varies, and there is no clear correlation between the number of museums in a state and the state's population. If Congress chose to implement a state grant program for Museum Services, it might consider several approaches toward equitable or optimal allocation of funds. For example, Congress might chose to design a population-based funding formula that allows the museums within a state a proportional share of funding based on the number of likely visitors to the museums within that state.
