A combination of factors combined to present policymakers with difficult decisions on how best to stimulate the economy. Troubling instability in the housing and financial services sectors, weak auto manufacturing demand, and high energy costs earlier in 2008 had slowed growth dramatically and forced millions into unemployment. With declining tax revenue and increasing costs to provide unemployment and other benefits to unemployed workers, states were implementing measures to rein in spending, including restricting Medicaid eligibility and services.", "Congress considered legislation aimed at stimulating economic activity in selected industrial sectors to save existing and create new jobs, reduce taxes, invest in future technologies, and fund infrastructure improvements. In addition to reducing some taxes and funding infrastructure projects, ARRA provisions were designed to provide: temporary support to families and individuals by increasing unemployment compensation benefits; financial assistance for individuals to maintain their health coverage under provisions in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA); temporary increases in Medicaid matching rates; and increases in disproportionate share hospital allotments.", "The House approved the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (H.R. 1) on January 28, 2009.

However, some economists and forecasters had been concerned that a combination of factors might make this economic contraction much worse than other post-war slowdowns. At first, economic instability seemed limited to the housing sector as housing values decreased in many markets, forcing some subprime and highly leveraged home owners into foreclosure. The problems that began in housing, quickly spread to banking and financial services and were compounded earlier in 2008 by spikes in energy prices. The solvency of automobile manufacturers rapidly deteriorated, possibly due in part to tight credit policies, rising unemployment, and high fuel costs. National unemployment rose steadily throughout 2008 reaching 7.2% in December. ", "Due to slower economic activity caused by the recession, many states also faced large tax revenue decreases, forcing them to reduce Medicaid eligibility and spending, just when the demand for additional public sector health care was expanding to fill the gap left when unemployed individuals no longer could afford employer-based health insurance for their families. Although by themselves the problems in housing, financial services, manufacturing, and energy sectors might not have forced the economy into recession, taken together these problems had contributed to the emergence of a recession and, if the underlying fundamentals have changed as some forecasters suspect, perhaps a prolonged, global economic slow down that could have widespread impact on living standards here and abroad.", "In response, policymakers quickly moved to prevent the instability in housing and financial services from spilling over into the broader economy. Looking to the future, members of Congress and the Obama Administration sought additional mechanisms to stimulate economic activity. Various approaches were considered to ensure that an economic stimulus package could reach many different segments of the economy, provide a sustained economic boost, and wide spread job growth. Some economic stimulus proposals included infrastructure spending, revenue sharing with states, middle class tax cuts, business tax cuts, unemployment benefits, and food stamps. On January 22, 2009 the House Committee on Energy and Commerce marked-up selected health components and approved a stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, H.R. 1 ). The full House amended and approved H.R. 1 on January 28, 2009. ", "Similar legislation to H.R. 1 was introduced in the Senate (ARRA, S. 350 ) and referred to the Committee on Finance, among others, where provisions were approved on January 27. An amendment in the nature of a substitute ( S.Amdt. 570 ) was offered as a substitute for H.R. 1 and was approved by the full Senate on February 10, 2009. The Senate version of ARRA was referred to a joint Senate and House conference committee. The conference committee reached agreement and referred ARRA to the House and Senate, where it was passed on February 13, 2009. President Obama signed ARRA ( P.L. 111-5 ) on February 17, 2009.

Temporary Increase of Medicaid FMAP", "paragraphs": ["The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most Medicaid service expenditures. It is based on a formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa); it has a statutory minimum of 50% and maximum of 83%. Exceptions to the FMAP formula have been made for certain states and situations. For example, the District of Columbia's Medicaid FMAP is set in statute at 70%, and the territories have FMAPs set at 50% (they are also subject to federal spending caps). Under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-27 ), all states received a temporary increase in Medicaid FMAPs for the last two quarters of FY2003 and the first three quarters of FY2004 as part of a fiscal relief package. In addition to Medicaid, the FMAP is used in determining the federal share of certain other programs (e.g., foster care and adoption assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act) and serves as the basis for calculating an enhanced FMAP that applies to the State Children's Health Insurance Program. .", "During a recession adjustment period that begins with the first quarter of FY2009 and runs through the first quarter of FY2011, the provision holds all states harmless from any decline in their regular FMAPs, provides all states with an across-the-board increase of 6.2 percentage points, and provides qualifying states with an additional unemployment-related increase. It allows each territory to choose between an FMAP increase of 6.2 percentage points along with a 15% increase in its spending cap, or its regular FMAP along with a 30% increase in its spending cap.", "States are evaluated on a quarterly basis for the unemployment-related FMAP increase, which equals a percentage reduction in the state share. The percentage reduction is applied to the state share after the hold harmless increase and after one-half of the 6.2 percentage point increase (i.e., 3.1 percentage points). For example, after applying the across-the-board increase, a state with a regular FMAP of 50% would have an FMAP of 56.20%. If the state share (after the hold harmless and one-half of the across-the-board increase) were further reduced by 5.5%, the state would receive an additional FMAP increase of 2.58 percentage points (46.9 state share * 0.055 reduction in state share = 2.58). The state's total FMAP increase would be 8.78 points (6.2 + 2.58 = 8.78), providing an FMAP of 58.78%.", "The unemployment-related FMAP increase is based on a state's unemployment rate in the most recent 3-month period for which data are available (except for the first two and last two quarters of the recession adjustment period, for which the 3-month period is specified) compared to its lowest unemployment rate in any 3-month period beginning on or after January 1, 2006. The criteria are as follows:", "unemployment rate increase of at least 1.5 but less than 2.5 percentage points = 5.5% reduction in state share; unemployment rate increase of at least 2.5 but less than 3.5 percentage points = 8.5% reduction in state share; unemployment rate increase of at least 3.5 percentage points = 11.5% reduction in state share.", "If a state qualifies for the unemployment-related FMAP increase and later has a decrease in its unemployment rate, its percentage reduction in state share could not decrease until the fourth quarter of FY2010 (for most states, this corresponds with the first quarter of SFY2011).

After FY2010, states' annual DSH allotments will return to 100% of the annual DSH allotments as determined under current law. Under this provision, if states' annual DSH allotments grew at a greater rate than what they would have received without the 2.5% adjustment, then states will receive the higher DSH allotments without the recession adjustment.

To address concerns with the impact of the regulations, several laws passed during the 110 th Congress imposed moratoriums on six of the Medicaid regulations until April 1, 2009 (excluding a rule on outpatient hospital facility and clinic services). CBO estimated that the extension of the Medicaid moratoria would increase federal expenditures by $105 million in FY2009, but would not have an additional spending increase beyond FY2009. The seven Medicaid regulations issued during the most recent Congress covered the following areas: ", "Graduate Medical Education", "Most states make Medicaid payments to help cover the costs of training new doctors in teaching programs.

", "Cost Limit on Public Providers", "Intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) are used by some states to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid costs. Certain IGTs are specifically allowed for funding the state share of program costs. Some states have instituted programs where the state shares of Medicaid spending is paid by hospitals or nursing homes that are public providers, but not units of government, or are units of government, but the state share is returned to the provider sometimes through Medicaid payments. Both a proposed and final regulation were issued, however, a federal court held that the rule had been improperly promulgated and remanded the rule back to CMS for further action. This regulation would clarify the types of IGTs allowable for financing a portion of Medicaid costs, impose a limit on Medicaid reimbursement for government-owned hospitals and other institutional providers, and require certain providers to retain all Medicaid reimbursement.

Targeted case management (TCM) refers to case management for specific beneficiary groups or for individuals residing in state-designated geographic areas. There has been considerable ambiguity about what services are covered and what is legitimately considered TCM. The case management regulation addresses a provision of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171 ) that clarifies and narrows the case management definition and directs the Secretary of HHS to issue regulations to guide states' claims for federal matching funds for case management.

", "School-Based Services", "As a condition of accepting funds under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( P.L. 108-446 , IDEA), public schools must provide special education and related services necessary for children with disabilities to benefit from public education. States can finance only a portion of these costs with federal IDEA funds. Medicaid may cover IDEA required health-related services for enrolled children as well as related administrative activities. According to federal investigations and congressional hearings, Medicaid payment to schools have sometimes been improper. To address these problems, CMS issued a regulation that would restrict federal Medicaid payments for school-based administrative activities (e.g., outreach, service coordination, referrals performed by school employees or contractors), and certain transportation services (e.g., from home to school and back for certain school-age children). For more information on school-based services under Medicaid, see CRS Report RS22397, Medicaid and Schools , by [author name scrubbed]. ", "Provider Taxes", "States use provider-specific taxes to help finance their share of the Medicaid program. Under these funding methods, states collect funds (through taxes or other means) from providers and pay the money back to those providers as Medicaid payments, and claim the federal matching share of those payments. Once the state share has been subtracted, the federal matching funds may be used to raise provider payment rates, to fund other portions of the Medicaid program, or for other non-Medicaid purposes. Provider taxes must be consistent with federal laws and regulations, which may have been ambiguous or changing. CMS issued a provider tax regulation to address these issues.

Likewise, if the amount paid to a non-FQHC Indian provider (whether or not the provider participates with the MCE) is less than the rate that applies under the state plan, the state must pay the difference between the applicable rate and the amount paid by MCEs. Under this provision, Indian Medicaid MCEs are permitted to restrict enrollment to Indians and to members of specific tribes in the same manner as IHPs may restrict the delivery of services to such Indians and tribal members.", "Finally, P.L. 111-5 applies specific sections affecting Medicaid to the CHIP program, including (1) Section 1932(a)(2)(C) regarding enrollment of Indians in Medicaid managed care (e.g., states cannot require Indians to enroll in a MCE unless the entity is the IHS, certain IHPs operated by tribes or tribal organizations, or certain urban IHPs operated by Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), and (2) the new provisions described above. The effective date of this provision is July 1, 2009.", "Consultation on Medicaid, CHIP and Other Health Care Programs Funded under the Social Security Act Involving Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations", "There are no provisions in prior Medicaid or CHIP law regarding a Tribal Technical Advisory Group (TTAG) within CMS, the federal agency that oversees the Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP programs.", "P.L. 111-5 requires the Secretary to maintain within CMS a TTAG, previously established in accordance with requirements of a charter dated September 30, 2003. ARRA also requires that the TTAG include a representative of a national urban Indian Health organization and the IHS. The representative of a national urban Indian Health organization will be exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act for certain meetings with federal officials. The P.L. 111-5 also requires certain states to establish a process for obtaining advice on a regular, on-going basis from designees of IHPs and UIOs regarding Medicaid law and its direct effects on those entities. Applicable states include those in which one or more IHPs or UIOs provide health care services. This process must include seeking advice prior to submission of state Medicaid plan amendments, waiver requests or proposed demonstrations likely to directly affect Indians, IHPs or UIOs. This process may include appointment of an advisory panel and of a designee of IHPs and UIOs to the Medicaid medical care advisory committee advising the state on its state Medicaid plan. The provision also applies this new language to CHIP in the same manner in which it applies to Medicaid. Finally, the new law prohibits construing these amendments as superseding existing advisory committees, working groups, guidance or other advisory procedures established by the Secretary or any state with respect to the provision of health care to Indians.

The report should address: what improvements are needed to identify factors to begin and end the application of a countercyclical FMAP; how to adjust the amount of a countercyclical FMAP to account for state and regional variations; and how a countercyclical FMAP could be adjusted to better account for actual Medicaid costs incurred by states during economic recessions.
