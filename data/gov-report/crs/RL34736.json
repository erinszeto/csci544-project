The act states that \"The primary function of the OSTP Director is to provide, within the Executive Office of the President [EOP], advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of issues that require attention at the highest level of Government.\" Further, \"The Office shall serve as a source of scientific and technological analysis and judgment for the President with respect to major policies, plans, and programs of the Federal Government.\"", "The President nominates the OSTP Director, who is subject to confirmation by the Senate. In many Administrations, the President has concurrently appointed the OSTP Director to the position of Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST), a position that allows for the provision of confidential advice to the President on matters of science and technology. While Congress can require the OSTP Director to testify, the APST may decline requests to testify on the basis of separation of powers and/or executive privilege. The APST manages the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), an interagency body established by Executive Order 12881 that coordinates science and technology (S&T) policy across the federal government. The APST also co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), a council established by Executive Order 13539 and composed of external advisors who provide advice to the President. In the Obama Administration, John Holdren is both the OSTP Director and the APST.", "The OSTP has engaged in several activities of interest to the 113th Congress. Following disagreements starting in FY2011 between OSTP and Congress regarding OSTP participation in certain activities with China and Chinese-owned companies, Congress statutorily restricted OSTP's ability to use appropriated funds in certain ways. This restriction was continued explicitly in P.L. 113-6, implicitly in P.L. 113-46 and P.L. 113-73, and explicitly in P.L. 113-76. In February 2013, OSTP Director Holdren issued a memorandum requiring federal agencies annually investing at least $100 million in research and development to develop policies allowing the general public access to the results of this investment. Finally, OSTP has inventoried federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education investments and developed a strategic plan for them. The President also proposed in his FY2014 budget request a reorganization of STEM education programs, which Congress did not approve.", "Among other issues Congress may wish to consider are the need for science advice within the EOP; the title, rank, and responsibilities of the OSTP Director; the policy foci of OSTP; the funding and staffing for OSTP; the roles and functions of OSTP and NSTC in setting federal science and technology policy; and the status and influence of PCAST. Some in the S&T community support raising the OSTP Director to Cabinet rank, contending that this would imbue the position with greater influence within the EOP. Others have proposed that the OSTP Director play a greater role in federal agency coordination, priority setting, and budget allocation. Both the Administration and Congress have identified areas of policy focus for OSTP staff, raising questions of policy setting and oversight. Some experts say NSTC has insufficient authority over federal agencies engaged in science and technology activities and PCAST insufficient influence on S&T policy; they question the overall coordination of federal science and technology activities. Finally, some in the scientific community support increasing the authority of the OSTP Director in the budget process to bring greater science and technology expertise to federal investment decision making."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 ( P.L. 94-282 ) established the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), including the position of its Director, within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) to provide scientific and technological analysis and advice to the President. This codified and institutionalized a presidential science advice function that previously existed at each President's discretion.", "This report provides an overview of the history of science and technology (S&T) advice to the President and discusses selected issues and options for Congress regarding OSTP's Director, OSTP management and operations, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), and the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of Science and Technology Advice to the President", "paragraphs": ["Science and technology policy issues tend to reach the presidential level if they involve multiple agencies; have substantial budgetary, economic, national security, or foreign policy dimensions; are highly controversial (especially when science and technology intersect with values, ethics, and morality); or are highly visible to the public. When these matters reach the Oval Office, Presidents generally seek information and advice from trusted sources as to the options available and their implications.", "Throughout U.S. history, Presidents have obtained S&T advice from federal scientists and engineers and informal personal contacts. Since the early 1930s, Presidents have attempted to expand their sources of S&T advice through advisory boards and committees. Lacking a statutory foundation, these boards and committees tended to lack permanency, as successive Presidents often disbanded them. When again faced with the need for S&T advice, Presidents would form new advisory boards or committees, sometimes reconstituted from previously disbanded ones.", "In the years leading up to World War II, the importance of research and development (R&D) to the nation's economic and military strength became increasingly evident. As a result, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) in 1941. Historians widely credit the federal R&D enterprise with contributing substantially to the Allied victory in World War II, as well as to the development of subsequent U.S. industrial strength. In November 1944, President Roosevelt wrote a letter to OSRD Director Vannevar Bush seeking recommendations on how research and the research infrastructure established to support America's war effort could be \"profitably employed in times of peace.\" OSRD Director Bush's response, Science: The Endless Frontier , laid out a framework that asserted the essential role of scientific progress in meeting the nation's economic, national security, and social needs. Experts widely view the Bush report as foundational to today's U.S. science and technology policy. Among its recommendations, the report asserted: ", "The Federal Government should accept new responsibilities for promoting the creation of new scientific knowledge and the development of scientific talent in our youth.", "The next several Presidents used a variety of mechanisms to obtain S&T advice within the EOP, to enhance interagency coordination, and to receive counsel from outside advisors. Organizations within the EOP included the Office of the Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (Eisenhower) and the Office of Science and Technology (OST; Kennedy, Johnson). Organizations focused on interagency coordination included the President's Scientific Research Board (Truman), the Federal Council for Science and Technology (FCST; Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon), and the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology (FCCSET; Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush). External advisory committees included the Science Advisory Committee (Truman, Eisenhower), and the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC; Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson).", "President Nixon abolished the Office of Science and Technology\u2014the S&T policy office then extant in the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The National Science Foundation (NSF) assumed its civilian functions and the National Security Council (NSC) its security functions. In addition, President Nixon opted not to appoint new members to PSAC after accepting the pro forma resignation of its members. President Ford supported the return of a science advisory mechanism to the White House, but he wished to establish it through legislation, not executive order. He signed the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 ( P.L. 94-282 ) into law on May 11, 1976. This act established OSTP and the position of OSTP Director.", "Policy tensions and power struggles between OSTP and other EOP offices and between presidential Administrations and the science community are not new. Carter Administration OSTP Director Frank Press, for example, battled the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), opposing the CEQ-advocated use of federal subsidies to the then-infant solar power industry and instead supporting a balanced pace between market demand and scientific discovery. In July 1981, George Keyworth, Reagan Administration OSTP Director, stirred controversy in the science community on his first speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) by asserting \"Nowhere is it indicated that the OSTP or its director is to represent the interests of the scientific community as a constituency.\" Further, he added that serving as an \"inside lobbyist\" for the science community would work against the community's interest by reducing his influence within the White House. Keyworth's view of the role of the President's science advisor was at odds with many in the science community at that time. During the George H. W. Bush Administration, tension existed between OSTP Director D. Allan Bromley and other high-ranking White House officials over the extent of Administration support for federal funding of commercial technology development. These tensions became public when the Wall Street Journal published articles asserting Bromley's success in advancing an industrial policy in the Administration, including \"picking technological winners and losers.\" Following criticism from Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) Michael Boskin, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, and OMB Director Richard Darman, Bromley issued a statement clarifying that the Administration's \"principles are inconsistent with an industrial policy of targeting particular industries for support or particular technologies for commercialization.\"", " Appendix A provides a historical compilation of presidential S&T policy advisors with their titles, EOP S&T agencies/offices, interagency coordination organizations, and advisory committees. As illustrated in Table A-1 , the Presidents subsequent to President Ford continued to adapt OSTP and related organizations to suit their needs. For example, P.L. 94-282 established a President's Committee on Science and Technology (PCST) with the OSTP Director as a member. PCAST largely assumed the role of PCST with the OSTP Director serving as a co-chair along with one or two nonfederal PCAST members. More recently, P.L. 112-282 included provisions for the OSTP Director to chair an Intergovernmental Science, Engineering, and Technology Advisory Panel (ISETAP). An executive branch, Cabinet-level council established by presidential Executive Order, the National Science and Technology Council, which is chaired by the President and managed by the OSTP Director, has subsumed ISETAP's responsibilities.

Priority setting. A key activity in the first step is OSTP's request to federal agencies for their recommendations on R&D priorities. In addition, interagency working groups meet to determine individual agency responsibilities for specific activities when multiple agencies share responsibility for broad issue areas. The OSTP and OMB use this information in their development of a joint memorandum that articulates the Administration's R&D priorities and R&D investment criteria. Agencies are to use this memorandum as an aid in the second step, preparation of their budgets. 2. Agency budget preparation. In the second step, OSTP continually interacts with agencies as they develop their budgets, providing advice and working with them on their priorities. In general, OSTP provides more guidance to agencies with large R&D budgets and to programs that cross agency boundaries. Federal agencies submit their completed budget proposals to OMB.

In the third step, OSTP works with OMB to review proposed agency budgets to ensure they reflect Administration plans and priorities. The OSTP also participates in OMB budget examiner presentations to the OMB Director and provides advice on priorities at that time. In addition, OSTP provides direct feedback to agencies as they negotiate with OMB over funding levels and the programs on which that funding is to be spent. 4. Final budget decisions.

In assessing whether to eliminate OSTP, Congress may wish to note that it has eliminated other legislative and executive branch agencies engaged in S&T policy, notably Congress's Office of Technology Assessment in 1995 and the Department of Commerce's Technology Administration and its Office of Technology Policy in 2007. Currently, the Office of Science and Technology Policy is the only federal agency whose principal responsibility is the broad tableau of federal S&T policy.

The act also required the OSTP Director to submit an annual report to Congress at the time of the submission of the President's budget request. This report is to include, among other things, a description of the STEM education programs and activities for the previous and current fiscal years, the levels of funding for each program and activity, and an evaluation of duplication and fragmentation of the programs and activities.", "In December 2011, CoSTEM published a detailed inventory of federal STEM education \"investments.\" The inventory included an evaluation of federal STEM education programs (e.g., their purposes, objectives, and funding agencies) and a list of federal STEM education investments, by agency, with FY2008 to FY2010 funding levels.

Among other things, this document reported on the status of the five-year strategic plan mandated by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act and assessed the federal STEM education effort. The report identified four coordination goals: use evidence-based approaches, identify and share evidence-based approaches, increase efficiency and coherence, and focus federal efforts on four priority areas. The priority areas were identified according to three criteria (national needs, presidential priorities, and federal assets) and included kindergarten-through-grade-12 (K-12) STEM teacher education, engagement in STEM, undergraduate STEM education, and serving groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.", "In March 2013, the explanatory statement for the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-6 ) required OSTP to produce a federal STEM education strategic plan within 45 days of enactment of the law. Shortly thereafter, in its FY2014 budget request (released in April 2013), the Administration proposed a reorganization of the federal STEM education effort. The proposed reorganization would have eliminated or consolidated about half the federal STEM education effort while increasing total FY2014 funding for federal STEM education activities by about 6% over FY2012 levels. The Department of Education, National Science Foundation, and Smithsonian Institution would have become lead agencies for K-12, postsecondary, and informal STEM education, respectively. Some other federal STEM education programs, including those at the lead agencies, would have been consolidated under the plan. ", "Publication of the proposed reorganization raised concerns among some STEM education stakeholders, especially among those who disagreed with the Administration's proposed approach. In particular, some stakeholders expressed concern that the proposed reorganization was informed by the perspective of budget analysts at OMB, who some analysts believe focused primarily on a certain type of program evaluation (randomized controlled trials) without incorporating the expertise of the STEM education community. Several policy makers expressed concern that reorganization decisions were made prior to publication of the congressionally mandated strategic plan (OSTP has asserted that unpublished draft versions of the strategic plan informed the proposed reorganization plan). Additionally, some policy makers questioned the capacity of lead agencies to take on their new roles and expressed support, instead, for the activities to remain with their existing agencies (e.g., NASA). ", "Advocates for the Administration's proposed reorganization of federal STEM education activities generally assert that the wide diversity of small STEM education programs distributed across numerous federal agencies presents a substantial barrier to coordination and contributes to fragmentation and incoherence in the federal STEM education effort. By establishing clear agency responsibilities for the three broad areas of federal STEM education activities (graduate/undergraduate STEM education, kindergarten-through-grade 12 STEM education, and informal science education) and aligning programs and funding accordingly, advocates assert that program evaluation would be improved, that fragmentation would be reduced and coordination enhanced, and that existing resources would be directed to high-priority programs.", "One potential complicating factor in the execution of the reorganization proposal is its inclusion as part of the President's budget request. As a budget proposal affecting programs whose funding is provided by many of the 12 regular appropriations bills, the reorganization (i.e., the appropriations for each activity) would not be dealt with comprehensively, but rather on a piecemeal basis. A \"ceding\" appropriations subcommittee might agree to eliminate funding for a program under its jurisdiction with the expectation that it would instead be funded through one of the three lead agencies, under a different regular appropriations bill. However, the \"receiving\" appropriations subcommittee, operating independently, might opt not to provide funding for the program. The end effect, in some cases, might be the unintended elimination of programs, rather than a comprehensive and intentional reorganization.", "In deliberations on FY2014 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies appropriations acts, neither the House Committee on Appropriations nor the Senate Committee on Appropriations supported the proposed reorganization. (House Energy and Water Development appropriators, in contrast, accepted some portions of the reorganization within their jurisdiction.) In addition, the House committee identified flaws in the subsequent federal STEM strategic plan, including the proposed mechanism for dissemination of federal STEM education research and findings. The House committee report would direct OSTP to report within 180 days of passage on the resources and authorities necessary to develop a \"one stop\" style website containing findings from federal research on STEM education. The Senate committee report would defer action on such consolidation until OSTP finalizes STEM program assessments and require OSTP to work with non-federal education and outreach communities on any subsequent reorganization proposal.", "The joint explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 113-76 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, was critical of the proposed reorganization, stating:", "While the Congress is supportive of attempts to improve efficiency and effectiveness in Federal STEM education programs, the proposed reorganization of these programs contained in the budget request was incomplete and lacked sufficient detail. The proposal contained no clearly defined implementation plan, had no buy-in from the education community and failed to sufficiently recognize or support a number of proven, successful programs. Accordingly, the agreement does not adopt the reorganization; all STEM activities are funded in their existing programmatic structures unless explicitly noted otherwise elsewhere in this statement or through language in either the House or Senate report that is not modified or superseded by this statement.", "The joint explanatory statement further directs OSTP to reexamine other possible reorganizations of federal STEM programs after engaging in an inclusive development process and taking into consideration evaluations and other evidence of program success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stature and Influence of PCAST", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, PCAST advises the President on science, technology, and innovation-related issues.

In a 2008 report, some experts in the S&T policy community asserted that the stature and influence of PCAST has declined as PCAST focused on a narrower set of issues less likely to garner presidential interest. These experts note that while President George H. W. Bush held the first PCAST meeting at Camp David and participated in PCAST meetings, Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush only met occasionally for short periods of time with PCAST chair or committee members.", "According to OSTP, through January 2012, President Obama met with PCAST four times during his first three years in office, with each discussion lasting an hour or more. In addition, PCAST co-chairs met with the President and senior EOP officials several times for focused discussions on specific topics that PCAST should undertake for its studies, updates on studies in progress, briefings on completed studies prior to public release, and actions the President could consider in response to PCAST's recommendations.", "As a federal advisory committee, PCAST is unusual in that its original executive order states that the OSTP Director and one of its members will co-chair it, as opposed to having an independent chair not directly associated with the Administration. This joint-chair approach has continued through succeeding Administrations, with the APST co-chairing the Obama Administration PCAST. Federal advisory committees generally do not have Administration staff as chairs. Administration staff are more commonly included as ex-officio members. The inclusion of the APST as co-chair may reduce PCAST's ability to provide independent thinking to the White House and may place the APST in an awkward position if PCAST members disagree with White House policy.", "Some S&T policy organizations have suggested strengthening PCAST by broadening its mandate, explicitly including national and homeland security issues within its remit, enhancing its independence, and increasing its staff significantly. Other suggestions include selecting the chair of PCAST solely from its non-Administration members; appointing members to staggered, overlapping terms unrelated to presidential and congressional election cycles; and providing all members with security clearances. The Obama Administration has undertaken to provide PCAST members with security clearances.", "Some experts in the S&T community have also suggested increasing the number of presidential advisory committees. For example, they propose advisory committees focused on specific S&T policy issues, such as a Federal-State Science and Technology Council to enhance dialogue with the states, particularly on STEM education. The costs of establishing such new advisory committees may pose a challenge to their creation. In addition, requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (P.L. 92-463) regarding justification of any new advisory committee, its membership, and associated ethics rules (including financial disclosure) may complicate the establishment of new committees and the recruitment of committee members. As noted above, PCAST has taken on the responsibilities of several topic-specific advisory committees established in statute.
