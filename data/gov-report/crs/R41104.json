The lack of proper labor certification was another leading ground for exclusion in FY1996, FY2000, FY2004, and FY2008. By FY2008, however, illegal presence and previous orders of removal from the United States had become the leading ground.

The importance of public charge as a grounds of inadmissibility is evidenced in the fact that over one-half (53.3%) of all 790,685 exclusions over this 15-year period were on this basis, suggesting an effect of the changes in 1996 to the INA provisions on affidavits of support. Labor market protections and illegal presence and prior removals came in distant second and third, with 18.5% and 14.8% of exclusions, respectively.", "The proportion of public charge exclusions had fallen by FY2004, but remained the top basis for denial.

Similar to the analysis of immigrant data, illegal presence and prior removal became the leading ground for nonimmigrant visas in FY2008.

Foremost, many applicants filed affidavits of support that were insufficient in the first few years after IIRIRA went into effect. As the legal community and the prospective LPRs gained a better understanding of the requirement that the affidavit of support must demonstrate the ability to maintain an annual income of at least 125% of the federal poverty line, they may have submitted more complete financial data to support the affidavit. The statutory change in IIRIRA that made the affidavits of support legally binding may have changed behavior over time as well. Potential sponsors may have become less likely to petition for family members if they lacked adequate resources to support them.", "The steady rise in exclusions based on past illegal presence and prior removal is likewise largely due to the statutory change in IIRIRA. Since 1996, foreign nationals who were unlawfully present in the United States for longer than 180 days but less than a year are inadmissible for three years after their departure. Foreign nationals who were unlawfully present for at least a year are inadmissible for 10 years after their departure. When these changes were coupled with database improvements and access to databases across agencies, consular officers became better able to identify visa applicants who are inadmissible on these grounds. The improvements in immigration-related databases as well as the expansion of access to law enforcement databases offer similar explanations for the uptick in criminal grounds of exclusion.", "Finally, the increase in immigrant exclusions based upon labor market protections may reflect the growth in demand for foreign workers and the competition for these scarce visas. As of November 1, 2009, there were 3,499,964 employment-based LPRs visa applications pending.", "Appendix A. Consular Databases for Screening ", "Consular officers use the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) to screen visa applicants. Records of all visa applications are now automated in the CCD, with some records dating back to the mid-1990s. Since February 2001, the CCD has stored photographs of all visa applicants in electronic form, and more recently the CCD has begun storing 10-finger scans. In addition to indicating the outcome of any prior visa application of the alien in the CCD and comments by consular officers, the system links with other databases to flag problems that may have an impact on the issuance of the visa. These databases linked with CCD include DHS's Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) and FBI's Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) results, and supporting documents.", "The CCD also links to the DHS's Traveler Enforcement Compliance System (TECS) for use by CBP officers at ports of entry. A limited number of consular officers have recently been granted access to DHS'Arrival Departure Information System (ADIS). ADIS tracks foreign nationals' entries into and most exits out of the United States. DOS credits access to ADIS with its ability to identify previously undetected cases of illegal overstays in the United States. ", "For some years, consular officers have been required to check the background of all aliens in the \"lookout\" databases, specifically the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) database, which contained over 26 million records in 2009. According to Janice Jacobs, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, the CLASS database grew by approximately 400% after September 11, 2001.", "This increase in the quantity and quality of CLASS records is largely the result of improved data sharing between the Department of State and the law enforcement and intelligence communities. In 2001, only 25 percent of records in CLASS came from other government agencies. Now, almost 70 percent of CLASS records come from other agencies.", "The Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) system requires a consular officer abroad to refer selected visa cases for greater review by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The current interagency procedures for alerting officials about foreign nationals who may be suspected terrorists, referred to in State Department nomenclature as Visa Viper, began after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and were institutionalized by enactment of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. If consular officials receive information about a foreign national that causes concern, they send a Visa Viper cable (which is a dedicated and secure communication) to the NCTC. In 2009, consular posts sent approximately 3,000 Visa Viper communications to NCTC.

Indeed, most visitors enter the United States without nonimmigrant visas through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). This provision of the INA allows the visa documentary requirements to be waived for aliens coming as visitors from 35 countries (e.g., Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, and Switzerland). Thus, visitors from these countries are not required to obtain a visa from a U.S. consulate abroad. Since aliens entering through VWP do not have visas, CBP inspectors at the port of entry are responsible for performing the background checks and making the determination of whether the alien is admissible.", "P.L. 110-53 created a waiver allowing the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to admit countries with refusal rates under 10% to the VWP. This waiver authority became available in October 2008, when the Secretary certified that (1) an air exit system was in place that verifies the departure of not less than 97% of foreign nationals that exit through U.S. airports, and (2) the electronic system for travel authorization (ESTA) was operational. The ESTA is a system through which each foreign national electronically provides, in advance of travel, the biographical information necessary to check the relevant databases and \"watch lists\" to see whether the foreign national poses a law enforcement or security risk. As in all VWP cases, CBP inspectors at the port of entry perform the initial admissibility screening.", "In addition to the Visa Waiver Program, a number of exceptions to documentary requirements for a visa have been established by law, treaty, or regulation. The INA also authorizes the Attorney General and the Secretary of State acting jointly to waive the documentary requirements of INA \u00a7212(a)(7)(B)(i), including the passport requirement, on the basis of unforeseen emergency in individual cases. In 2003, the Administration scaled back the circumstances in which the visa and passport requirements are waived. In 2004, Congress enacted a provision, now known as the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, in 7209 of P.L. 108-458 , that affected all citizens and categories of individuals for whom documentation requirements had previously been waived under 212(d)(4)(B) of INA. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, was required to develop and implement a plan as expeditiously as possible to require a passport or other document, or combination of documents, \"deemed by the Secretary of Homeland Security to be sufficient to denote identity and citizenship,\" for all travelers entering the United States.
