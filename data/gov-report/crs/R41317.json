Commodity provisions in the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) expire in 2012, and Congress is currently reviewing U.S. farm policy. The collection of federal farm programs, which make payments to farmers and landlords, is often referred to by the broader farming community as the \"farm safety net.\" Some programs such as \"counter-cyclical payments\" (which rise when crop prices decline) contain elements of a safety net\u2014which is usually intended to protect recipients against economic risks. Other farm program payments, such as direct (fixed) payments, are made irrespective of market prices.", "As provided under the 2008 farm bill and other legislation, farm safety net programs can be divided into three main categories. Commodity programs provide income support and attempt to address farm price or revenue risks for selected field crops. Risk management (primarily crop insurance) provides protection from declines in yield or revenue for a much broader set of commodities, including many field and specialty crops and some livestock. Supplemental disaster assistance is available for most agricultural commodities (crops and livestock) when weather-related production losses are not covered by other programs.", "Many policymakers and farmers consider federal support of farm businesses necessary for their financial survival, given the unpredictable nature of agricultural production and markets. In contrast, many environmental groups and budget hawks argue that farm subsidies encourage overproduction on environmentally fragile land and are a market-distorting use of tax dollars.", "Historically, federal programs have primarily benefitted farmers (and landowners) of the major crops, such as wheat, corn, cotton, and sugar, with policy constructed over many decades by modifying or adding programs. As a result, programs sometimes overlap or work at cross purposes, generating criticism that they are not well integrated, cost too much, or do not provide adequate risk protection. Additional potential issues for Congress in the next farm bill debate include the extent of the current commodity coverage, program complexity and its impact on participation and effectiveness, and the effect of biofuel subsidies on agriculture.", "The current federal budget situation is likely to prevent any increase in overall spending on a 2012 farm bill. Thus, the level of funding in the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline budget for agricultural programs will be of paramount importance. Combined outlays for farm safety net programs have averaged $15.7 billion per year during FY2003 to FY2010, with a high of $20.5 billion in FY2006 and a low of $12.2 billion in FY2008. CBO's projected annual average for FY2011-FY2020 is $14.8 billion. With crop prices relatively high, counter-cyclical support has declined in recent years while crop insurance outlays (which are directly related to crop prices) have increased sharply. The pool of money for any changes to the farm safety net will likely come from the existing baseline for the commodity programs and the crop insurance program.", "A constraint affecting future U.S. policy choices is the broad set of rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which the United States, as a founding member, has agreed to abide by. Farm bill proposals, if implemented, will affect U.S. commitments, mainly through cost, program design, implementation, and market effects. Under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, the United States is committed to spending no more than $19.1 billion per year on \"amber box\" support (programs considered to be the most trade distorting). The WTO compatibility of any new proposal, such as a whole-farm safety net program, would depend on how its provisions mesh with WTO criteria for loss triggers, payment levels, and production and trade effects."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Roughly every five years, Congress debates and revises omnibus legislation\u2014referred to as the \"farm bill\"\u2014governing federal farm and food policy.

At that time, they were described as payments to transition farmers away from the previous target-price, deficiency payment program. However, in the 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ), AMTA payments were made permanent instead of being phased out.

The loan is made at a specified \"per-unit\" loan rate using the crop as collateral. This loan rate, in effect, establishes a price guarantee. Prior to loan maturity, if the local market price (called the \"posted price\") is at or above the loan rate, the farmer repays the loan principal and interest. In contrast, when the posted price is below the loan rate, the farmer may repay the loan at that price (called the \"loan repayment rate\") and pocket the difference as a \"marketing loan gain.\" Or, rather than taking the loan when the posted price is below the loan rate, farmers may request a \"loan deficiency payment,\" with the payment rate equal to the difference between the loan rate and the loan repayment rate.

For the 2009 crop year, approximately 8% of the total number of eligible farms elected to participate in ACRE, representing nearly 13% of base acres (total program acreage). Program complexity is an issue that reportedly has limited participation. The determination of a payment under ACRE generally requires the crop year to be finished in order to calculate the season-average farm price used in the payment calculation. As a result, payments\u2014once calculated\u2014are not made until well after the crop has been harvested. Some farmers find it challenging to (1) determine if enrollment would be advantageous, and/or (2) explain the program to landlords. Also, some farmers and university researchers have expressed a preference for pursuing a county-wide trigger rather than a state trigger to more effectively cover local revenue losses.

In addition, an individual must comply with certain conservation and planting flexibility rules. Conservation rules include protecting wetlands, preventing erosion, and controlling weeds. Planting flexibility rules allow crops other than the program crop to be grown, but generally prohibit planting fruits or vegetables on subsidized acreage.", "Farming enterprises usually involve some combination of owned and rented land. Two types of rental arrangements are common: cash rent and share rent. Under cash rental contracts, the tenant pays a fixed cash rent to the landlord. The landlord receives the same rent, bears no risk in production, and thus is not eligible to receive program payments. The tenant bears all of the risk, takes all of the harvest, and receives all of the government subsidy. Under share rental contracts, the tenant usually supplies most of the labor and machinery while the landlord supplies land and perhaps some inputs (e.g., chemicals or seed) or management. Both the landlord and tenant bear risk in producing a crop and receive a portion of the harvest. Both are eligible to share in the government subsidy.", "Even though tenants might receive all of the government payments under cash rent arrangements, they might not keep all of the benefits if landlords demand higher rent.

For agriculture, the Commission recommended reducing mandatory agricultural spending by $15 billion from FY2012-FY2020, including direct payments, crop insurance premium subsidies and insurance company reimbursements, conservation, and the Market Access Program. Similarly, the Bipartisan Debt Reduction Task Force proposal would reduce agricultural spending, but by twice that amount, $30 billion through FY2020. It would tighten payment limits, reduce crop insurance premium subsidies and insurance company reimbursements, and consolidate and cap conservation programs.", "At best, this budget situation is likely to prevent any increase in overall new spending on a 2012 farm bill. Thus, the level of funding in the CBO baseline for agricultural programs will be of paramount importance as the development of a 2012 farm bill progresses.", "Each year, CBO issues a baseline budget projection for all federal spending under current law over a multi-year period. Projected spending in the baseline represents CBO's estimate at a particular point in time of what federal spending and revenues likely would be under current law if no policy changes were made over the projected period. The baseline serves as a benchmark or starting point for future budget analyses. Whenever new legislation (such as a farm bill) is introduced that affects federal mandatory spending, its impact is measured as a difference from the baseline. Any increase in costs above the baseline level may be subject to certain budget constraints (such as pay-go). The process of scorekeeping and estimating baselines is done in Congress by CBO, acting under the supervision of the House and Senate Budget Committees. ", "The current, tight federal budget situation is unlike that faced by Congress when it wrote the 2002 farm bill. At that time, a brief federal budget surplus allowed Congress to spend $73 billion more than its 10-year baseline. It was relatively easy to keep existing programs and add new programs across the spectrum of the omnibus farm bill. More recently, the 2008 farm bill was held to be budget neutral, although it received additional funding from outside the agriculture committees' jurisdiction. This outside funding from changes in tax policies provided offsets for higher spending on nutrition and other non-commodity programs, and allowed the overall bill to be budget neutral while increasing total farm bill spending. However, procedural difficulties related to negotiating these offsets with other committees, such as the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, prolonged the development of the 2008 farm bill and added constituencies that were not always in line with agriculture committee priorities.", "Given these difficulties, most policy observers expect the next farm bill will be budget-neutral at best, and written within the confines of the agriculture committees. In this scenario, the level of funding in the CBO baseline would set a maximum amount of funding available for a new farm bill. Offsets to pay for any new programs\u2014such as a new farm safety net\u2014would need to come from within the agriculture committees' jurisdiction. To increase one program, another program would need to be decreased. Offsets could occur within titles or functions of the farm bill (e.g., from within the commodity subsidy program), or could come from transfers between titles or functions within the farm bill (e.g., between commodity subsidies and conservation programs). Moreover, 37 programs in the 2008 farm bill received mandatory funding but do not have any assumed baseline funding beyond FY2012. To continue these programs, offsets of up to $10 billion over five years may be needed. Thus, the political stakes could be increasingly high among the various interest groups and constituencies needed to pass the farm bill.", "Moreover, some fear that budget reconciliation could be required before the 2008 farm bill expires. Budget reconciliation would require cuts in existing farm bill programs to save money before a new farm bill is written, and these cuts could make even fewer funds available in the baseline for the 2012 farm bill.", "For the Title I farm commodity programs in particular, additional infusions of mandatory funding are unlikely given the improbability of offsets from outside the agriculture committees. Other titles in the farm bill such as nutrition, bioenergy, and conservation have had more success in recent farm bills competing for additional funds. ", "Thus, the pool of money for any proposed revisions to the farm safety net may likely come from the existing baseline for the farm commodity programs and the crop insurance program. Existing programs such as direct payments, the various counter-cyclical payments, or crop insurance might be replaced, revised, or reduced to pay for new farm safety net programs.", " Figure 3 shows the actual outlays and projected CBO baseline for the farm commodity payments, crop insurance, non-insured assistance, and supplemental and ad hoc disaster payments from FY2003 to FY2020. Combined outlays for these broadly defined safety net and/or farm income support programs have ranged from $12.2 billion in 2008 to $20.5 billion in 2006. The average for the actual outlays from FY2003 to FY2010 is $15.7 billion per year. The projected annual average for FY2011-FY2020 in the August 2010 CBO baseline is 5.6% smaller at $14.8 billion.", "Of particular note in this analysis when comparing the baseline projection to the recent past is that crop insurance outlays have increased while counter-cyclical support has decreased. In fact, crop insurance outlays have increased more than threefold over the period, rising to an estimated $7.3 billion in FY2010 as higher policy premiums from rising crop prices drove up premium subsidies and expense reimbursements to private insurance companies. These costs are projected to stay high, rising to $8.7 billion in FY2020. ", "Conversely, Title I farm commodity program costs have had a nearly corresponding decrease since FY2003. This is because the counter-cyclical payment component has decreased as market prices for farm commodities generally have risen from levels a decade ago. The status of supplemental disaster assistance remains uncertain and unpredictable. By definition, ad hoc disaster payments are subject to congressional action and are not included in baseline projections. The so-called \"permanent\" agricultural disaster provisions (e.g., SURE) in the 2008 farm bill are authorized only temporarily and have baseline only through the end of the 2008 farm bill.", " Figure 4 shows the components in the baseline projection for the Title I farm commodity programs, crop insurance, NAP, and the permanent disaster program. Crop insurance is the largest component of projected payments, comprising $81 billion of the $148 billion 10-year total. Direct payments are the next largest, at $49 billion over FY2011-FY2020. Counter-cyclical and ACRE payments are the third-largest component, with nearly $9 billion over 10 years. Cotton accounts for about 55% of the combined counter-cyclical and ACRE payment projection, with ACRE payments for corn rising near the end of the period and accounting for 17% of the projection.", "Whether or not direct payments are considered part of the farm safety net (because they are fixed and not tied to changes in prices or revenue), their magnitude in comparison to counter-cyclical payments makes it likely that some proposals for a new safety net could include funding offsets from direct payments.", " Figure 5 shows how the Title I farm commodity payments are allocated by commodity (including direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, ACRE, and the marketing loan programs; that is, the green bars of Figure 3 ). Corn is the commodity receiving the most support, both in the FY2003-FY2010 period and in the FY2011-FY2020 projected period. Cotton is the next-highest supported commodity in total terms, but is planted on comparatively fewer acres. Wheat, soybeans, and rice round out the top five supported commodities, which together account for 93% of the Title I baseline. While commodity allocations are not directly associated with the design of a safety net, these shares nonetheless reflect some of the support and influence in the commodity title (for example, that corn growers were the primary advocates for the development of the ACRE provisions in the 2008 farm bill)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Issues", "paragraphs": ["Besides budget issues, several policy questions are being raised to assess the current farm safety net programs and consider potential changes. How well does the multitude of programs support farmers and/or help them manage overall business risks? What are the holes in the farm safety net with respect to commodities, regional coverage, or farm size? Is it money well spent, or is there a better combination of programs that would meet the objectives of policymakers?", "For supporters of farm programs, continued calls for wide-scale emergency disaster relief are an indication that the farm safety net is not functioning as well as producers and policymakers would like. Two programs with the most genuine safety net features, the SURE and ACRE programs, have been criticized as being too complex, which reportedly has limited participation, while providing too few benefits for farmers who face economic hardship. Also, some farmers have complained, both recently and prior to the 2008 farm bill, that MAL benefits and counter-cyclical payments do not provide enough assistance because trigger levels are mostly below current and expected price levels. Production costs relative to current levels of support are also a concern for many farmers, including dairy producers.", "Critics of farm programs have long questioned the need for farm subsidies, contending that resources for agriculture could be better spent advancing environmental goals or improving agricultural productivity. Others cite an economic argument against the farm commodity programs: like any subsidy, farm programs distort production, capitalize benefits to the owners of the resources, encourage concentration of production, and comparatively harm smaller domestic producers and farmers in lower-income foreign nations. ", "Several issues might shape any potential changes to farm safety net programs in the next farm bill debate.", "Managing farm risk \u2014Crop insurance has very high participation rates, a result driven in part by the high subsidization levels but also because the program in fact reduces both yield and revenue risks. Some members of Congress and policy observers have wondered if crop insurance might be the only element of the farm safety net that remains in the distant future if farm programs are rationalized and funding is reduced. Farm policy observers have identified significant overlap between farm programs. For example, the ACRE program and crop insurance both address revenue variability. Also, the current farm program mix has several variations of \"counter-cyclical-style\" payments, including marketing loan benefits, traditional (price) counter-cyclical payments, ACRE (revenue) payments, revenue-type crop insurance, and whole-farm insurance. In the view of some, a different array of programs might reduce farm risk in a more cost-effective way. Commodity coverage \u2014The extent of the current commodity coverage is primarily a result of the historical and evolving nature of farm policy. Producers of major commodities such as wheat, corn, soybeans, rice, cotton, and milk have benefited the most from farm programs because farmers and policymakers representing those commodities shaped the programs from their inception. Since then, most other commodity advocates have not had the interest or sufficient political power to add their commodities to the mix. Commodity coverage could be increased by changing the commodity mix for current programs or by developing a whole-farm program or insurance policy that could be more comprehensive than USDA's current insurance policy and eliminate potential overlap of coverage across the various existing programs. Biofuels subsidies \u2014The federal government has enacted an increasing number of programs that support the use of agriculture-based biofuels, foremost of which is corn-based ethanol. In the past decade, corn use for ethanol has expanded corn demand by nearly 30%, driving corn prices higher. In 2009, biofuels subsidies totaled nearly $6 billion, and corn has not been the only beneficiary. The increased demand for corn has contributed to an expansion of corn area into non-traditional crop areas, raising prices for other major field crops. Many federal budget watchers argue that the expanding biofuels subsidies should be counted with the pool of agricultural price and income subsidies since this has been one of their major effects. Complexity \u2014The program structure for ACRE and SURE requires a substantial amount of individual farm data, assumptions, and calculations. As a result, determining whether or not the programs benefit an individual producer is not readily apparent beforehand, which affects participation. Similarly, the complexities of such programs require significant setup and ongoing administrative costs. The complexity has arisen, in part, from budget responsibility that requires actual losses to be determined after the end of the marketing year\u2014possibly for the whole farm, rather than making payments sooner on less comprehensive information. Program limits and farm size \u2014Payment limits for the farm commodity programs, with the exception of the marketing assistance loan program, either set the maximum amount of farm program payments that a person can receive per year or set the maximum amount of income that an individual can earn and still remain eligible for program benefits (a means test). The payment limits issue is controversial because it directly addresses questions about what size farms should be supported, whether payments should be proportional to production or limited per individual, and who should receive payments. Some policymakers want limits to be tightened to save money and reduce the possibility of encouraging expansion of large farms at the expense of small farms. Others say larger farms should not be penalized for the economies of size and efficiencies they have achieved. Crop insurance has no payment limits, a feature that some policymakers say makes crop insurance an attractive centerpiece of farm policy because it helps small and large farms alike, with neither apparently gaining at the expense of the other.
