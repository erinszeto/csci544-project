In addition to these economic benefits, some analysts think that an ethanol partnership with Brazil could help improve the U.S. image in Latin America and lessen the influence of oil-rich Venezuela under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. However, obstacles to increased U.S.-Brazil cooperation on biofuels exist, including current U.S. tariffs on most Brazilian ethanol imports.", "While some Members of Congress support greater hemispheric cooperation on biofuels development, others are wary of any cooperative efforts that might negatively affect U.S. ethanol producers. The Energy Diplomacy and Security Act of 2007, S. 193 (Lugar), approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 28, 2007, would increase hemispheric cooperation on energy. S. 1007 (Lugar), the United States-Brazil Energy Cooperation Pact of 2007, calls for the same hemispheric cooperation groups as S. 193, and directs the Secretary of State to work with Brazil and other Western Hemisphere countries to develop biofuels partnerships. H.Res. 651 (Engel) recognizes and supports the importance of the U.S.-Brazil MOU on biofuels. In the 109th Congress, legislation was introduced that would have eliminated current tariffs on foreign ethanol, but in December 2006, Congress voted to extend the ethanol tariffs through December 31, 2008 (P.L. 109-432).

In the 109 th Congress, legislation was introduced that would have eliminated current tariffs on foreign ethanol.

The most widely used biofuel is ethanol (both in the United States and worldwide), an alcohol usually produced from the fermentation and distillation of sugar- or starch-based crops such as sugarcane or corn. Ethanol can also be produced from cellulose-based materials (such as perennial grasses and trees), although the technology to produce cellulosic ethanol is in its infancy, and no commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plants have been constructed. Other biofuels include biodiesel and other renewable diesel fuel substitutes produced from vegetable oils or animal fats (such as soybean or palm oil), and butanol produced from various biological feedstocks.", "Biofuels have several potential benefits relative to petroleum-based fuels. First, the use of biofuels can reduce emissions of some pollutants relative to gasoline or diesel fuel. Second, most biofuels lead to lower emissions of greenhouse gases than petroleum fuels\u2014some can lead to substantial greenhouse gas reductions. Third, biofuels can be produced domestically to displace some petroleum that would otherwise be imported. Finally, some biofuels can reduce overall fossil energy consumption, given that much of the energy needed to grow the feedstock plant material is supplied by the sun.", "There are also many potential drawbacks to biofuels. First, in nearly all cases, biofuels are more expensive to produce than petroleum fuels. Second, infrastructure limitations can lead to even higher costs for biofuels than for conventional fuels. Third, biofuels have their own potential environmental drawbacks, including increased emissions of some pollutants and the potential for increased greenhouse gas emissions (in some cases, depending on the particular biofuel) when the entire production process is taken into account.", "While both the United States and Brazil\u2014as well as many other countries\u2014are studying and investing in many different biofuels, this report focuses on ethanol supply and use for several reasons: (1) ethanol production and consumption far exceeds that of other biofuels; (2) ethanol can be (and is) used as a direct blending component with gasoline, and gasoline engines are dominant in passenger automobiles and light trucks; and (3) current mandates in both Brazil and the United States favor ethanol use, either directly or indirectly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biofuels: A Potential Solution to Latin America's Oil Dependency?9", "paragraphs": ["While oil and gas producers such as Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Trinidad, and Tobago are net energy exporters, most Latin American and Caribbean nations are net energy importers. Countries that rely on oil as their primary energy source are particularly vulnerable to increases in global oil prices. In many Caribbean island nations, oil accounts for more than 90% of total energy consumed. In Central America, oil dependency ranges from an estimated 51% in Costa Rica to 73%-78% in El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama, and to 84-85% in Guatemala and Nicaragua.", "Many Latin American countries experienced dramatic increases in their energy bills after oil price hikes began in 2005, straining government budgets in Central America and the Caribbean. To fill a clear need and attempt to extend his influence in the region, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has offered oil on preferential terms in a program known as PetroCaribe launched in 2005. His government has also reached preferential energy agreements with South American countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, and Ecuador. In December 2005, Mexico, perhaps in an attempt to act as a countervailing force to Venezuela in the region, initiated the Meso-American Energy Integration Program (PIEM) with Central America, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia. As part of the plan, Mexico will supply the bulk of the crude oil to be processed by a new oil refinery in either Guatemala or Panama, which will be used primarily to satisfy Central America's energy needs.", "Given declining oil production levels in both Venezuela and Mexico and the unstable political environment in Bolivia, a major natural gas producer in the region, some analysts have pointed to biofuels as a potential solution to Latin America's petroleum dependency. Producing biofuels would, some argue, allow oil-importing countries in the region to reduce energy costs and the need for imported oil. The Western Hemisphere produces more than 80% of the world's biofuels, led by Brazil (producing ethanol from sugar) and the United States (producing ethanol from corn). Biofuels proponents argue that the climate, surplus of arable land, and excess production of sugarcane and other potential biofuels crops make parts of Latin America ideally suited for an expanded biofuels industry. The potential is greatest in tropical countries that have high crop yields and low costs for land and labor, characteristics that are present in several countries in Central America and the Caribbean.", "An April 2007 study by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), A Blueprint for Green Energy in the Americas , reports that some Latin American and Caribbean countries have shown great interest and promise in the development of biofuels. Beyond Brazil, which has been the leader in ethanol development and production, the study also highlights several other countries with potential for biofuels development. The study also suggests ways the IDB could support the development of biofuels production in the region, including support for a biofuels development fund, the development of regulatory frameworks, and research and development. Regional highlights from the IDB study include the following:", "Central America: The bulk of ethanol production in Central America involves reprocessing hydrous ethanol from Brazil or the European Union (EU) for export to the United States. The IDB study asserts that while the sugarcane harvesting season in Central America is shorter than in Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala have efficient sugar industries and could produce significant sugar-based ethanol. Costa Rica and Guatemala, which house 44% of Central America's ethanol processing factories, have the most well-developed policies in place for biofuels development. Under the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), signatory countries continue to share duty-free access for some ethanol exports to the United States under conditions established by the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) , but exports from Costa Rica and El Salvador enjoy specific allocations. In the future, CAFTA-DR could spur indigenous ethanol production in Central America. Caribbean: Within the Caribbean, Jamaica has exported the largest amount of ethanol to the United States under CBI, most of it reprocessed hydrous ethanol from Brazil. Trinidad and Tobago has an ethanol dehydration plant, but the largest ethanol plants in the Caribbean are located in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Beyond Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, Grenada has been identified as having future production potential for sugar-based ethanol. The United Nations is working with Brazil to provide technology transfer and technical assistance to examine the potential of a biodiesel industry in Haiti from jatropha, a drought-resistant shrub that can grow almost anywhere. South America: Most biofuels production in South America currently goes to satisfy domestic consumption, with Colombia and Argentina possessing the largest government programs in support of biofuels development. Biofuels exports from non-CBI countries are constrained by tariff barriers in the United States and the EU. Should Colombia and/or Peru conclude free trade agreements with the United States, their biofuels export potentials could expand. Argentina, Colombia, and Peru have potential to further develop ethanol from sugarcane; Colombia and Ecuador to produce more biodiesel from palm oil; and Chile has potential for second-generation ethanol production from woodchips."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brazil and the United States: Hemispheric Leaders in Ethanol Production", "paragraphs": ["Brazil and the United States are by far the world's largest ethanol producers.

Ethanol is blended into gasoline at up to the 10% level (E10), although much is blended at lower levels (5% to 7%). Roughly one-third of U.S. gasoline contains some ethanol. A small amount of ethanol is blended in purer form as E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline), which can be used in flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) specifically designed for its use.", "Various federal and state incentives promote the production and use of ethanol in the United States. Since the 1970s, ethanol blended into gasoline (to make \"gasohol\") has been eligible for tax incentives of various forms. Currently, each gallon of pure ethanol blended into gasoline earns the blender a tax credit of 51 cents per gallon. Additional tax incentives exist for small producers. Further, as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ), Congress established a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Each year, the RFS requires a certain amount of renewable fuel be blended into gasoline. For 2007, the mandate is 4.7 billion gallons. The vast majority of this mandate will be met using ethanol. The mandate increases annually and will reach 7.5 billion gallons in 2012.", "U.S. ethanol production capacity has grown rapidly in recent years, and is expected to grow even faster in the next few years.

Depending on market forces, these plants have the capacity to shift some production from sugar to ethanol, or vice-versa.", "Brazilian government support for ethanol began in 1975 when a presidential decree established the Brazilian National Alcohol Program (\"Proalcool\"). Originally established mainly as a way to support the Brazilian sugar industry from a collapse in sugar prices, Proalcool set a production target of 3 billion liters (some 0.8 billion gallons) in 1980. The second phase of the program, established in 1979 in response to the OPEC oil embargo, made Proalcool explicitly into an energy policy and further expanded the production goal to 10.7 billion liters (2.8 billion gallons) by 1985. In 2006, Brazil produced roughly 16.5 billion liters (4.4 billion gallons).", "To promote the goals of the Program, the Brazilian government has employed various policies through the years. These include requiring Petrobras, the state-owned oil company, to purchase a set amount of ethanol; tying the pump price of a liter of ethanol to a percentage of the price of gasoline (originally 59%, later increased to 80%); and requiring Brazilian automakers to produce dedicated ethanol vehicles that could run only on 100% ethanol.", "Currently, the Brazilian ethanol industry is thriving, and many of the requirements and policies from Proalcool have been eliminated. However, one key policy remains: all gasoline sold in Brazil must contain at least 20%-25% ethanol.

There are special provisions for the production of petroleum derivatives. In the case of fuel ethanol, the imported ethanol is used as a blending component in gasoline. Jet fuel (containing no ethanol, but considered a \"like commodity\" to the finished gasoline) is exported to qualify for the drawback in lieu of finished gasoline containing the originally imported ethanol. Some critics estimate that as much as 75% or more of the duties were eligible for the drawback in 2006. Therefore, critics question the effectiveness of the ethanol duties and the CBI exemption.", "Proponents of the domestic ethanol industry argue that foreign ethanol producers receive benefits and incentives from their home countries, and that U.S. duties on imported ethanol should be strengthened.

In fact, the futures contract for March 2007 corn on the Chicago Board of Trade rose from $2.50 per bushel in September 2006 to a record high of over $4.37 per bushel in February 2007. Some analysts predict that if high oil prices continue, increases in global biofuels production may push corn prices up by 20% by 2010 and 41% by 2020.

In January 2007, Mexico faced widespread strikes and social unrest as rising corn prices, fueled by the demand for corn-based ethanol, led to a 30% rise in the cost of corn tortillas, a basic dietary staple. Through Latin America, inflation rates have increased as a result of higher food prices, which have been attributed to increased demand for production of ethanol and other biofuels.", "Critics of biofuels argue that unless new technology is developed to produce biofuels from cellulosic materials, increasing biofuels production will lead to higher global food prices, which will in turn result in hunger and malnutrition in many developing countries. Ethanol proponents dispute those predictions. They maintain that the availability of arable land, especially in Latin America, will allow plenty of space for biofuels production without encroaching upon other crops. In Brazil, for example, less than 9% of the country's total planted area is dedicated to sugar.

Depending on the production process, biofuels can either lead to a net increase or decrease in greenhouse gas emissions throughout the fuel cycle relative to petroleum fuels. Because ethanol contains carbon, combustion of the fuel necessarily results in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the primary greenhouse gas. Further, greenhouse gases are emitted through the production and use of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in corn production, as well from fuels used in the operation of farm equipment and vehicles to transport feedstocks and finished products. However, because photosynthesis (the process by which plants convert light into chemical energy) requires absorption of CO 2 , the growth cycle of the feedstock crop can serve, to some extent, as a \"sink\" to absorb some fuel-cycle greenhouse emissions.", "Recent studies on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions have concluded that corn-based ethanol results in 13% to 22% lower greenhouse gas emissions relative to gasoline. Ethanol from other feedstocks can lead to even lower greenhouse gas emissions. For example, sugar requires far less fertilizer to produce than corn, and less processing is necessary to prepare the feedstock for fermentation. Net greenhouse gas emissions from sugarcane-based ethanol could be as much as 56% lower than gasoline, and cellulosic ethanol could reduce emissions by 90% relative to gasoline.", "Ethanol production processes themselves can also lead to air quality concerns. For example, without proper emissions controls, ethanol plants produce emissions of volatile organic compounds (hydrocarbons) that can lead to negative health effects and can contribute to ozone (smog) formation. Further, burning of sugarcane fields before manual clearing can increase fuel cycle pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. Mechanized harvesting without burning can improve the emissions profile of sugarcane ethanol, but greater mechanization would likely come at the cost of fewer jobs for cane cutters.", "Because of the favorable emissions profile of ethanol from non-corn feedstocks, there is growing interest in moving U.S. biofuels consumption away from corn ethanol to either imported sugarcane ethanol or domestically produced cellulosic ethanol."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Contamination", "paragraphs": ["Another key environmental concern surrounding ethanol is its effects on water quality.

This could lead lower concentrations of soil nutrients, increasing the need for fertilizers and other chemical inputs. And while cellulosic biofuels in general appear more sustainable, some concerns have also been raised about their sustainability, especially if environmentally sensitive areas (e.g., Conservation Reserve Program land) are used for bioenergy production.", "In Brazil, concerns focus on protection of habitats in the cerrado (Brazilian savanna) and the Amazon rain forest. Expansion of sugarcane planting has led to rapid depletion of wooded areas of the cerrado.

UNICA, the S\u00e3o Paulo Sugarcane Association, estimates that roughly 1 million direct jobs and 3 million indirect jobs have been created in Brazil as a result of the country's biofuels industry. Another study asserts that some 2,333 jobs are created in Brazil for every 1 million tons of sugarcane harvested. Most of those jobs are as sugarcane cutters. Ethanol proponents estimate that some 14,000 jobs could be created in Central America through increased production of E10 (10% ethanol) fuel. Similar forecasts have been made for other countries and subregions in Latin America and the Caribbean.", "Analysts agree that biofuels production generates jobs, but some question the number and quality of those jobs. Skeptics argue that because biofuels production often displaces other existing agricultural activities, net job gains may be minimal. They also assert that unless governments make a concerted effort to ensure that small-scale producers have a role to play in biofuels production, large agribusinesses will continue to dominate the biofuels industry in Latin America. Finally, most analysts acknowledge that as biofuels production becomes increasingly mechanized, a development that brings efficiency and environmental benefits, less agricultural jobs are going to be generated. As was stated above, there is likely to be a tradeoff between increased employment and more environmentally benign practices.", "Skeptics of using biofuels to promote rural development also question the quality of most jobs created by the biofuels industry, particularly in countries producing ethanol from sugarcane, where jobs are often low-paying, hazardous work as seasonal cane cutters.

The United States has increasingly regarded Brazil as a significant power, especially in its role as a stabilizing force and skillful interlocutor in Latin America. U.S. officials tend to describe Brazil as an amicable partner governed by a moderate\u00a0leftist government and have responded positively to Brazil's efforts to reassert its regional leadership, which has recently been challenged by the rise of oil-rich Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in\u00a0Venezuela.", "In recent months, Brazil has increasingly used so-called \"biofuels diplomacy\" as a diplomatic and economic tool to raise its profile in Latin America and throughout the world.

In early April 2007, despite Ch\u00e1vez's criticisms of ethanol, one of his allies, President Correa of Ecuador, signed a biofuels production agreement with Brazil. Some Members of the Morales government in Bolivia are also supportive of biofuels production. In mid-April 2007, Ch\u00e1vez was forced to backtrack on his initial opposition to all biofuels production in the region while attending South America's first regional energy summit.

In the short to medium term, collaborative research and development activities may yield the largest potential benefit for both countries, particularly if they are able to hasten the development of cellulosic ethanol technology. Producing ethanol from dedicated energy crops and waste products may allay many of the environmental and food-versus-fuel concerns that are drawbacks of producing ethanol from food crops like sugar or corn. Both countries also stand to benefit from working together on the global front to establish consistent ethanol standards and codes, a crucial step in the process for ethanol to become a globally traded energy commodity.", "While some analysts believe the U.S.-Brazil agreement may be enough to spur viable biofuels markets in \"third countries\" (pillar two), those efforts may not be feasible. First, governments may lack the resources or political will to make the huge investment outlays necessary to develop their biofuels industries. Second, many countries lack the arable land necessary to develop biofuels without encroaching on traditional agricultural lands. A third concern with increasing sugar-based biofuels production is that the sugar industries of many countries in the Caribbean (including the Dominican Republic) are struggling because of high labor costs and efficiency problems.

The results of the other feasibility studies and the willingness of the governments of each of those countries to embrace biofuels development are likely to affect the selection of a second round of countries to receive U.S.-Brazil technical assistance.

Indeed, the U.S.-Brazil MOU does not address two key issues that many Brazilians feel are significant obstacles to expanding bilateral and regional biofuels cooperation, namely the current subsidies and tariffs that protect U.S. corn-based ethanol producers. Since many Members strongly favor extending the current subsidy programs for corn producers and tariffs on foreign ethanol, these issues may be obstacles to maintaining expanded U.S.-Brazil biofuels cooperation. In addition, Members who feel that Brazil's positions on agricultural trade during the failed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and in the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations have adversely affected U.S. interests may also be opposed to the MOU on biofuels.
