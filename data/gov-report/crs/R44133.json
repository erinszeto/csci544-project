The CR generally provided budget authority for ongoing projects and activities at the rate they were funded during FY2015. Most projects and activities funded in the P.L. 114-53 were subject to an across-the-board decrease of less than 1% (0.2108%). The FSGG section of the CR also included a small number of provisions that designate exceptions to the formula and purpose for which any referenced funding is extended (referred to as anomalies ). The FSGG anomalies included in P.L. 114-53 were as follows:", " Section 124\u2014District of Columbia Local Funds . This section provided the authority for the District of Columbia to expend local funds (from local tax revenues and other non-federal sources) for programs and activities funded in FY2015 at the rate set forth in the DC FY2016 Budget Request Act of 2015. Section 125\u2014Recovery Board : Section 125 provided that no funds be included in the CR for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which was established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to provide oversight and transparency in the expenditure of ARRA funds. The board was funded through the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill for the first time in FY2012. Before then, the board was funded by now-exhausted ARRA appropriations. The board received appropriations of $20 million for FY2014 and $18 million for FY2015 but was slated to sunset on September 30, 2015. Section 126\u2014Small Business Administration : This provision authorizes the apportionment of appropriations that are provided by the CR up to the rate that is necessary to allow the Small Business Administration (SBA) to continue issuing general business loans under the 7(a) loan guaranty program if \"increased demand for commitments\" exceeds the program's fiscal year authorization ceiling, which is currently $23.5 billion. On July 23, 2015, for just the second time since the agency began operations in 1953, the SBA suspended the consideration of 7(a) loan guaranty program applications because the demand for 7(a) loans was projected to exceed the program's then-$18.75 billion FY2015 authorization ceiling. The SBA resumed issuing 7(a) loans on July 28, 2015, following enactment of the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, which increased the 7(a) loan guaranty program's FY2015 authorization ceiling to $23.5 billion. Previous CRs had increased the 7(a) loan program's authorization ceiling to a specified amount to reduce the likelihood that the demand for commitments would exceed the ceiling. For example, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 ( P.L. 113-164 ) increased the ceiling from $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ) increased the ceiling to $18.75 billion. This appears to be the first time that a CR anomaly has not specified a ceiling amount. Section 127\u2014Internet Tax Freedom Act : Section 127 extended a moratorium preventing state and local governments from taxing Internet access or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. The moratorium was originally enacted as the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) in 1998. The 113 th Congress enacted multiple extensions of ITFA. The Internet tax moratorium and grandfather clause were set to expire on November 1, 2014, but the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-46 ) extended them through December 11, 2014.

Financial services as an industry is often subdivided into banking, insurance, and securities. Federal regulation of the banking industry is divided among the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (generally known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB). In addition, credit unions, which operate similarly to many banks, are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). None of these agencies receives its primary funding through the appropriations process, with only the FDIC inspector general and a small program operated by the NCUA currently funded in the FSGG bill. ", "Insurance generally is regulated at the state level with some oversight at the holding company level by the Federal Reserve. There is a relatively small Federal Insurance Office (FIO) inside of the Treasury, which is funded through the Departmental Offices account, but FIO has no regulatory authority.", "Federal securities regulation is divided between the SEC and the CFTC, both of which are funded through appropriations. The CFTC funding is a relatively straightforward appropriation from the general fund, whereas the SEC funding is provided by the FSGG bill, but then offset through fees collected by the SEC. ", "Although funding for many financial regulatory agencies may not be provided by the FSGG bill, legislative provisions that would affect some of these agencies have often been included. Both House and Senate bills would have changed the funding procedure for the CFPB, with future funding to be provided by congressional appropriations rather than the current situation in which primary CFPB funding is provided through unappropriated funds transferred from the Federal Reserve. The Senate bill also included the full text of S. 1484 , a broad financial regulatory reform bill that was previously reported by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Many provisions of S. 1484 amend the Dodd-Frank Act and some have proven controversial in the past.", "P.L. 114-113 did not include the provisions relating to CFPB funding from the committee bills and included a relatively small number of the provisions relating to financial regulation from S. 1484 / S. 1910 .

In addition, most of the agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the TTHUD Subcommittee were assigned to the FSGG Subcommittee.
