ARPA-E is a new organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), created specifically to foster research and development (R&D) of transformational energy-related technologies. Transformational technologies are by definition technologies that disrupt the status quo. They are not merely better than current technologies, they are significantly better. Often, a technology is considered transformational when it so outperforms current approaches that it causes an industry to shift its technology base to the new technology. The Nation needs transformational energy-related technologies to overcome the threats posed by climate change and energy security, arising from its reliance on traditional uses of fossil fuels and the dominant use of oil in transportation.", "ARPA-E will fund scientists and technologists to take an immature technology that promises to make a large impact on the ARPA-E Mission Areas (see Section I.B) and develop it beyond the \"valley of death\" that prevents many transformational new technologies from becoming a market reality. The \"valley of death\" generally occurs in two phases. The first phase occurs at the point of determining whether a laboratory stage technology can ever become a real-world technology or it has some inherent unsuitability for real-world applications. Once it has been determined through R&D that the apparent barriers can be overcome and how they may be overcome, then additional investment from many other sources causes a new field of technology options to open up. The second phase of the \"valley of death\" occurs at the point of developing the immature transformational technology to the point where key risks have been lowered enough that industry can invest in the final stages of development and incorporate the technology into products.", "Success for ARPA-E as an organization will be gauged by (a) whether its portfolio of investments includes the most promising transformational energy technology options and (b) the agency's ability to form and manage R&D efforts to mature these technologies rapidly.

The development of a new class of solar cells.", "Photovoltaic solar cells using semiconductor technology can be very efficient at converting sunlight into electrical energy, but the fabrication cost remains too high. Organic and polymer solar cells can be made at low cost, but the efficiencies are low and existing materials degrade in sunlight. One promising avenue towards inexpensive, efficient and long lasting solar cells is to create novel materials based on multiple elements that can be manufactured with thin-film technologies. Another approach is to create nano-particle devices (distributed junction solar cells) that use different nanostructures for the conversion of sunlight into charge carriers and for the collection of those charges onto electrodes.", "2. Biomass substitutes for oil.", "The ethanol for transportation is currently produced from sugar cane, corn or other plants. However, the most cost effective bio-fuels will come from the conversion of cellulose into chemical fuel. When the fuel is burned, CO 2 is released into the atmosphere, but the overall cycle can, in principle, be carbon neutral. The creation of crops raised for energy will also take full advantage of our great agricultural capacity. ", "ARPA-E can fund the creation of new plants to be grown for energy by incorporating a number of genes introduced into plants. Recently, a team of scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National laboratory inserted many genes into bacteria to produce an extremely effective anti-malarial drug. The Gates Foundation has given this team a $42 M [million] grant to commercialize the technology so that the drug can be made available to the developing world. Similar technology can be used to make plants self-fertilizing, drought and pest resistant. Note that about 25% of the energy input in growing corn comes from fertilizer, which is made from ammonia derived from natural gas. ", "Research on more efficient conversion of cellulose into liquid fuel would also yield great dividends. Current methods use the high temperature/high acid processes that are very energy intensive. The breakdown of cellulose into ethanol is also accomplished with bacteria or fungi, but this process can be made much more efficient if the micro-organisms are modified with these methods.", "Since becoming Secretary of Energy, Secretary Chu reportedly contends that \"solving the world's energy and environment problems would require Nobel-level breakthroughs in three areas: electric batteries, solar power and the development of new crops that can be turned into fuel.\" Further, that a \"'revolution' in science and technology would be required if the world is to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and curb the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases linked to global warming.\" Additionally Secretary Chu reportedly believes that solar technology \"will have to get five times better than it is today, and scientists will need to find new types of plants that require little energy to grow and that can be converted to clean and cheap alternatives to fossil fuels,\" and that alternatives must be found to burn coal cleanly as other countries are unlikely to discontinue its use.

In 1992, presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore proposed the creation of a civilian advanced research agency to support research on renewable technologies and renewable fuels.", "From 1977-2000, DOE had an Advanced Energy Projects (AEP) division to \"explore the feasibility of novel, energy-related concepts that evolve from advances in basic research,\" and \"high-risk, exploratory concepts which do not readily fit into an existing DOE program area but which could lead to applications that span scientific or technical disciplines.\" In 1995, DOE placed AEP's activities under a new Computational and Technology Research program. This reorganization was formally stated in DOE's 1997 budget request. Funding for the program was reduced in FY1998 and FY1999, and the AEP program was terminated in FY2000.", "Legislative Origins in the 109 th and 110 th Congress", "Against this historical backdrop, in October 2005, a committee of the NAS recommended the establishment of ARPA-E in its report Rising Above the Gathering Storm. In November 2005, during the 109 th Congress, House Minority Leader Pelosi released an innovation agenda that proposed to create a new DARPA-like initiative within DOE.

", "Policy Debates", "In the 109 th Congress, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committee on Science held hearings on ARPA-E. Chairman of the House Committee on Science Boehlert stated that he was an \"open-minded skeptic\" regarding ARPA-E, and pointed out that the recommendation for its establishment was based on four assumptions that he considered questionable:", "The problem with the energy market is that the supply of new technologies is insufficient; The supply of new technologies is constrained because of a lack of fundamental research; A sensible way to promote more fundamental research is to apply the DARPA model to a civilian energy sector; and Implementing the DARPA model is the best way to improve energy research, given tight federal budgets.", "In the 110 th Congress, Chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology Gordon held a similar hearing. In his opening statement, Chairman Gordon stated that, among several policy goals and objectives, DARPA has succeeded largely because it continued to foster a culture of innovation. The key for ARPA-E success, he said, is that it be a similarly nimble organization with minimal administrative layers and the ability to quickly start and stop research programs.

In addition, proponents argue that ARPA-E should focus on breakthrough research, using emerging basic research in areas such as nanotechnology to develop totally new technologies, as opposed to existing programs that have already identified paths forward and tend to focus on incremental advances. Further, unlike current programs, ARPA-E is designed to bridge the gap between basic research and industrial development\u2014not to get products to the marketplace, but to transform the marketplace by accelerating research.", "In response to the claim that ARPA-E will be more flexible and less risk-adverse, critics point out that the new organization will still be within DOE, so there is no guarantee that DOE management will let it take more risks than existing programs. While proponents contend that ARPA-E would bridge the gap between basic research and industrial development and that existing applied programs tend to focus on incremental advances, some critics argue that reforming DOE's existing programs would be better than creating a new organization.", "Advocates for ARPA-E indicated that candidate energy technologies are not yet at a stage where venture capital investment, such as occurs with In-Q-Tel, would provide the best return. At some point, however, ARPA-E research may lead to technologies appropriate for venture capital investment. At that stage, it might be appropriate to incorporate a venture capital component into ARPA-E's design. Just as DARPA has evolved over 50 years, ARPA-E may need to evolve as well, some witnesses said.", "How Much Funding Should ARPA-E Receive? How Might ARPA-E Receive Funding?

At that point, the program's effectiveness would be evaluated and appropriate actions taken, according to the report.", "One issue discussed in hearings was whether the level of authorized funding for ARPA-E is sufficient to support the research necessary for ARPA-E to reach its goals. Some noted with concern that the proposed $300 million in FY2008 was less than 0.02% of the transportation and energy industries' annual revenues, a level they believed was insufficient relative to the potential return. Some suggested that if it is to be successful, ARPA-E needs to be funded at a level comparable to DARPA\u2014about $3 billion per year.", "Some of those testifying did not believe ARPA-E should be funded due to budget constraints. ARPA-E, they argued, would be funded by shifting resources from DOE's Office of Science. Increasing funding for the DOE Office of Science is also a goal of the America COMPETES Act. Some hearing witnesses expressed concern that dilution of DOE Office of Science resources might influence DOE's acceptance of ARPA-E, and hinder its success. Supporters of ARPA-E agreed that funding for the DOE Office of Science is the highest priority and testified that funding for ARPA-E should not be redirected from that office.", "Some witnesses expressed concerns that a risk-tolerant agency like ARPA-E could not survive if it was subject to the annual appropriations cycle, political and financial pressures, and resource fluctuations that might stifle innovation. To overcome this potential challenge, some policymakers and experts have proposed funding ARPA-E outside of the regular appropriations process. This might include, for example, providing an advance appropriation supporting ARPA-E for several years, rather than the usual one-year appropriation. Another option is to identify a dedicated revenue source for ARPA-E. Some of the funding sources that have been proposed are", "oil industry tax and other incentives; gasoline tax; oil company profit tax; federal oil and gas royalties; climate change cap-and-trade program; and Strategic Petroleum Reserve funds.", "An analogous situation might be research supported through the Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Resources Program, authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ), which receives funding of $50 million per year derived from royalties, rents, and bonuses from federal onshore and offshore oil and gas leases. Based on past experience, however, all of these proposals would face challenges in Congress.", "Will ARPA-E Work?", "Some critics believe that what is preventing the United States from reaching its energy goals is not federal funding for innovative, high-risk research, but rather a lack of private-sector investment in basic research, failure to effectively transfer new energy technologies to the marketplace, or some combination of these. They point out the lack of a captive customer as a challenge to ARPA-E's ability to be successful: energy has a broad and diverse public and private market, while DARPA has DOD as its single primary customer, guaranteeing a solid base of demand. ARPA-E proponents indicated that ARPA-E is needed for \"translational research.\" This type of research identifies the most pressing market needs, selects and funds the most promising scientific approaches to enable breakthrough products, and brings the best candidates of those products to the brink of production."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
